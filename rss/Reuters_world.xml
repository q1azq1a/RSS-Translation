“唯一的区别是，人们一起经营这个地方，他们可以控制发生在他们身上的事情，他们可以帮助其他社区摆脱困境，”她说。</p><p>布朗说，紫屋是社区参与如何改善结果的证据。这就是为什么她希望该国在 10 月 12 日的公投中投“赞成票”。 14日在宪法中承认澳大利亚原住民，并成立一个名为“议会之声”的原住民咨询机构。</p><p>布朗说：“制定一项政策，让原住民实际上能够就某个想法是否可行提供建议并提供一些意见，这是一件简单的事情，但可能会产生如此巨大的影响。”</p><p>根据澳大利亚统计局的数据，原住民和托雷斯海峡岛民约占人口的 3.8%，他们患慢性肾病的可能性是非原住民的两倍多。</p><p>布朗解释说，这是一种“贫穷、剥夺和无能为力”的疾病，源于半游牧的生活方式，现在变得依赖加工食品。</p><p>肾衰竭是原住民死亡的常见原因。但布朗表示，Purple House 的社区主导模式帮助澳大利亚中部地区的透析存活率从全国最低变为最高。</p><p>该医疗服务机构在北领地、西澳大利亚和南澳大利亚的偏远社区设有 19 个偏远诊所。</p><p>肾衰竭的治疗需要每天透析五个小时，每周三次。对于那些需要治疗的人来说，这意味着家庭要从自己的家搬到爱丽丝泉或达尔文接受治疗。</p><p>社区失去了长辈的领导，家庭破裂，文化联系被削弱。患者还遭受孤立和抑郁的困扰。</p><p>布朗说，紫屋是这些土著透析患者的家外之家，其使命是帮助人们保持与国家和家庭的联系，尽管他们需要接受终末期肾衰竭的治疗。</p>

200 万新西兰元（121 万美元）以上房屋的外国买家征税。反对派认为，这不足以支付拟议的减税计划。</p><p>根据新西兰统计局和国家“税收计算器”的数据，对于没有孩子的单身平均收入者来说，减税相当于每周 24.85 新西兰元，即实得工资增加约 2.4%。新西兰的年通货膨胀率目前处于 6%

Held by the Ottoman Empire until 1917, it passed from British to Egyptian to Israeli military rule over the last century and is now a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS/MAPS/movajdladpa/" target="_blank">fenced-in enclave</a> inhabited by over 2 million Palestinians.</p><p> Here are some of the major milestones in its recent history.</p><p> 1948 - End of British rule</p><p> As British colonial rule came to an end in Palestine in the late 1940s, violence intensified between Jews and Arabs, culminating in war between the newly created State of Israel and its Arab neighbors in May 1948.</p><p> Tens of thousands of Palestinians took refuge in Gaza after fleeing or being driven from their homes. The invading Egyptian army had seized a narrow coastal strip 25 miles (40 km) long, which ran from the Sinai to just south of Ashkelon. The influx of refugees saw Gaza&#39;s population triple to around 200,000.</p><p> 1950s &amp; 1960s - Egyptian military rule</p><p> Egypt held the Gaza Strip for two decades under a military governor, allowing Palestinians to work and study in Egypt. Armed Palestinian &quot;fedayeen,&quot; many of them refugees, mounted attacks into Israel, drawing reprisals.</p><p> The United Nations set up a refugee agency, UNRWA, which today provides services for 1.6 million registered Palestine refugees in Gaza, as well as for Palestinians in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and the West Bank.</p><p> 1967 - War and Israeli military occupation</p><p> Israel captured the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war. An Israeli census that year put Gaza&#39;s population at 394,000, at least 60% of them refugees.</p><p> With the Egyptians gone, many Gazan workers took jobs in the agriculture, construction and services industries inside Israel, to which they could gain easy access at that time. Israeli troops remained to administer the territory and to guard the settlements that Israel built in the following decades. These became a source of growing Palestinian resentment.</p><p> 1987 - First Palestinian uprising. Hamas formed</p><p> Twenty years after the 1967 war, Palestinians launched their first intifada, or uprising. It began in December 1987 after a traffic accident in which an Israeli truck crashed into a vehicle carrying Palestinian workers in Gaza&#39;s Jabalya refugee camp, killing four. Stone-throwing protests, strikes and shutdowns followed.</p><p> Seizing the angry mood, the Egypt-based Muslim Brotherhood created an armed Palestinian branch, Hamas, with its power base in Gaza. Hamas, dedicated to Israel&#39;s destruction and restoration of Islamic rule in what it saw as occupied Palestine, became a rival to Yasser Arafat&#39;s secular Fatah party that led the Palestine Liberation Organization.</p><p> 1993 - The Oslo Accords, and Palestinian semi-autonomy</p><p> Israel and the Palestinians signed an historic peace accord in 1993 that led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority. Under the interim deal, Palestinians were first given limited control in Gaza, and Jericho in the West Bank. Arafat returned to Gaza after decades in exile.</p><p> The Oslo process gave the newly created Palestinian Authority some autonomy, and envisaged statehood after five years. But that never happened. Israel accused the Palestinians of reneging on security agreements, and Palestinians were angered by continued Israeli settlement building.</p><p> Hamas and Islamic Jihad carried out bombings to try to derail the peace process, leading Israel to impose more restrictions on movement of Palestinians out of Gaza. Hamas also picked up on growing Palestinian criticisms of corruption, nepotism and economic mismanagement by Arafat&#39;s inner circle.</p><p> 2000 - Second Palestinian intifada</p><p> In 2000, Israeli-Palestinian relations sank to a new low with the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada. It ushered in a period of suicide bombings and shooting attacks by Palestinians, and Israeli air strikes, demolitions, no-go zones and curfews.</p><p> One casualty was Gaza International Airport, a symbol of thwarted Palestinian hopes for economic independence and the Palestinians&#39; only direct link to the outside world that was not controlled by Israel or Egypt. Opened in 1998, Israel deemed it a security threat and destroyed its radar antenna and runway a few months after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.</p><p> Another casualty was Gaza&#39;s fishing industry, a source of income for tens of thousands. Gaza&#39;s fishing zone was reduced by Israel, a restriction it said was necessary to stop boats smuggling weapons.</p><p> 2005 - Israel evacuates its Gaza settlements</p><p> In August 2005 Israel evacuated all its troops and settlers from Gaza, which was by then completely fenced off from the outside world by Israel.</p><p> Palestinians tore down the abandoned buildings and infrastructure for scrap. The settlements&#39; removal led to greater freedom of movement within Gaza, and a &quot;tunnel economy&quot; boomed as armed groups, smugglers and entrepreneurs quickly dug scores of tunnels into Egypt.</p><p> But the pullout also removed settlement factories, greenhouses and workshops that had employed some Gazans.</p><p> 2006 - Isolation under Hamas</p><p> In 2006, Hamas scored a surprise victory in Palestinian parliamentary elections and then seized full control of Gaza, overthrowing forces loyal to Arafat&#39;s successor, President Mahmoud Abbas.</p><p> Much of the international community cut aid to the Palestinians in Hamas-controlled areas because they regarded Hamas as a terrorist organization.</p><p> Israel stopped tens of thousands of Palestinian workers from entering the country, cutting off an important source of income. Israeli air strikes crippled Gaza&#39;s only electrical power plant, causing widespread blackouts. Citing security concerns, Israel and Egypt also imposed tighter restrictions on the movement of people and goods through the Gaza crossings.</p><p> Ambitious Hamas plans to refocus Gaza&#39;s economy east, away from Israel, foundered before they even started.</p><p> Viewing Hamas as a threat, Egypt&#39;s military-backed leader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who took power in 2014, closed the border with Gaza and blew up most of the tunnels. Once again isolated, Gaza&#39;s economy went into reverse.</p><p> Conflict cycle</p><p> Gaza&#39;s economy has suffered repeatedly in the cycle of conflict, attack and retaliation between Israel and Palestinian militant groups.</p><p> Before 2023, some of the worst fighting was in 2014, when Hamas and other groups launched rockets at heartland cities in Israel. Israel carried out air strikes and artillery bombardment that devastated neighborhoods in Gaza. More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, mostly civilians. Israel put the number of its dead at 67 soldiers and six civilians.</p><p> 2023 - Surprise attack</p><p> While Israel was led to believe it was containing a war-weary Hamas by providing economic incentives to Gazan workers, the group&#39;s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-israel-was-duped-hamas-planned-devastating-assault-2023-10-08/">fighters were being trained</a> and drilled in secret.</p><p> On Oct.7, Hamas gunmen launched a surprise attack on Israel, rampaging through towns, killing hundreds, and taking dozens of hostages back to Gaza. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-threatens-kill-captives-if-israel-strikes-civilians-2023-10-09/">Israel took revenge</a> , hammering Gaza with air strikes and razing entire districts in some of the worst blood-letting in the 75 years of conflict.</p> <span>Writing by Stephen Farrell, Nidal al-Mughrabi and Rosalba O&#39;Brien; Editing by Chris Reese</span> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 23:36:20 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> IVWQOXAZ6NOC5MNJFL76PIJ7DU</guid><link/> https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/brief-history-gazas-75-years-woe-2023-10-10/<author><![CDATA[Reuters]]></author><category> ISRAEL</category><category> PALESTINIANS/GAZA</category><category> TIMELINE (TIMELINE, PIX) </category></item><item><title><![CDATA[Explainer: Will US military aid to Israel jeopardize Biden's help to Ukraine?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/geQv5G-TpbxktToKmSPIbMreqiU=/1920x0/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/MNXD35X3VVKZVEPWSA54ZM37XU.jpg" alt="U.S. President Biden makes remarks on the situation in Israel following Hamas' deadly attacks, in Washington" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> US President Joe Biden makes remarks after speaking by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the situation in Israel following Hamas&#39; deadly attacks, from the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, US October 10, 2023.

These spending bills generally originate in the House, where the Speaker - the elected leader of the majority party - controls what legislation is put to a vote.</p><p> Republicans hold a narrow 221-212 majority in the House, which made it possible for just a handful of their members to oust McCarthy last week, the first time in US history this has happened.</p><p> Because McCarthy&#39;s ouster was unprecedented, it is not clear whether Representative Patrick McHenry, who is serving as temporary speaker, can legally call a vote on any aid legislation.</p><p> Further complicating the issue, many of the hard-right members who ousted McCarthy <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-aid-ukraine-may-hinge-partly-who-takes-over-house-speaker-2023-10-04/">oppose aid to Ukraine</a> , including Representative Jim Jordan, a frontrunner in the Speaker&#39;s race. House Republicans refused to include aid to Ukraine in a last-minute spending bill passed last month to avert a government shutdown.</p><p> Support for Israel is far stronger, with Republicans closely tied to conservative Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Biden administration is considering tying a request for assistance to Ukraine to more money for Israel.</p><h 1=""> HOW MUCH DO ISRAEL AND UKRAINE&#39;S NEEDS OVERLAP?</h><p> Israel is a major long-term recipient of US military assistance and enjoys a steady stream of US aid. The two countries agreed in 2016 on a 10-year deal with $38 billion covering annual grants to buy military equipment and a $5 billion missile defense appropriation.</p><p> In the current phase of the conflict, Israel&#39;s major need is for small arms for its infantry and air defense interceptors to protect its civilian infrastructure and military command and control centers.</p><p> It is unlikely Israel has burned through its small arms ammunition this early in the conflict.</p><p> On the missile defense side, Israel uses the Iron Dome system, developed with US backing to provide air defenses. Iron Dome is not designed to fire the same interceptor used by the US-made Patriot system and other missile defense units deployed in Ukraine.</p><p> Ukraine&#39;s major needs are ammunition, missile defense systems and ground vehicles as it fights to take back territory from Russian invaders who launched an offensive in February 2022.</p><p> The United States has sent $44 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the invasion started, asking Congress for several tranches of assistance, the last one approved in December 2022.</p><p> The two countries - and other recipients of weapons aid like Taiwan - would benefit if Congress approves funding to boost the permanent manufacturing capacity of US defense contractors. This would also ease concerns that shipments of US weapons overseas is depleting US stocks at the potential risk to national security.</p><h 1=""> WHAT HAPPENS NOW?</h><p> Biden on Tuesday said his administration had already begun sending Israel additional military assistance including interceptors to replenish the Iron Dome. He said that when Congress returns, the administration will ask lawmakers to take &quot;urgent action to the national security requirements of our critical partners.&quot;</p><p> There are a few ways that additional aid for Ukraine - and Israel - could become law.</p><p> Congress could consider a standalone spending bill combining the two, along the lines of a spending request Biden made in August combining Ukraine, disaster relief and border security money.</p><p> Funding for both also could be included in a larger spending bill, which Congress must pass later this year to keep the federal government open when the stopgap spending measure expires next month.</p> <span>Reporting by Patricia Zengerle, additional reporting by Mike Stone; editing by Humeyra Pamuk and Rod Nickel</span> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 21:42:09 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> 4VE4HFREPBPAPF2YY7JXWMN2SI</guid><link/> https://www.reuters.com/world/will-us-military-aid-israel-jeopardize-bidens-help-ukraine-2023-10-10/<author><![CDATA[Patricia Zengerle]]></author><category> ISRAEL</category><category> PALESTINIANS/USA</category><category> ASSISTANCE (EXPLAINER) </category></item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel prepares ground offensive; Biden pledges support after Hamas attacks]]></title><description><![CDATA[Summary:<ul><li> LATEST DEVELOPMENTS</li><li> Rockets fired from southern Lebanon, Syria; Israel shoots back</li><li> Israeli defence minister: &#39;What was in Gaza will no longer be&#39;</li><li> Biden calls Hamas attacks &#39;an act of sheer evil&#39;</li><li> US has &#39;enhanced military force posture&#39; in region, Biden says </li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/wtY9WNwz6_Zu-gmS3Xvuttbgy7U=/1920x0/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/J67WDSAIH5JQBLNT55XJZHNABE.jpg" alt="An Israeli emergency responder gestures from the window of a damaged building after a rocket, launched from the Gaza Strip into Israel landed in Ashkelon" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> An Israeli emergency responder gestures from the window of a damaged building after a rocket, launched from the Gaza Strip into Israel landed in Ashkelon, southern Israel, October 10, 2023.

REUTERS/Mohammed Salem/File Photo</figcaption></figure><p> Israel calls last week&#39;s devastating attack by Hamas its 9/11 moment. The secretive mastermind behind the assault, Palestinian militant Mohammed Deif, calls it Al Aqsa Flood.</p><p> The phrase Israel&#39;s most wanted man used in an audio tape broadcast as Hamas fired thousands of rockets out of the Gaza strip on Saturday signalled the attack was payback for Israeli raids at Jerusalem&#39;s Al Aqsa mosque.</p><p> It was in May 2021, after a raid on Islam&#39;s third holiest site that enraged the Arab and Muslim world, when Deif began planning the operation that has killed more than 1,000 people in Israel, according to a source close to Hamas in Gaza.</p><p> &quot;It was triggered by scenes and footage of Israel storming Al Aqsa mosque during Ramadan, beating worshippers, attacking them, dragging elderly and young men out of the mosque,&quot; the source said. &quot;All this fuelled and ignited the anger.&quot;</p><p> That storming of the mosque compound, long a flashpoint for violence over matters of sovereignty and religion in Jerusalem, helped set off 11 days of fighting between <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/conflict-between-israel-palestinians-gaza-2023-10-07/">Israel and Hamas</a> .</p><p> More than two years on, Saturday&#39;s assault, the worst breach in Israeli defences since the 1973 Arab-Israeli conflict, pushed Israel to declare war and launch retaliatory strikes on Gaza that had killed more than 800 people by Tuesday.</p><p> A survivor of seven Israeli assassination attempts, the most recent in 2021, Deif rarely speaks and never appears in public so when Hamas&#39;s TV channel announced he was about to speak on Saturday, Palestinians knew something significant was afoot.</p><p> &quot;Today the rage of Al Aqsa, the rage of our people and nation is exploding. Our mujahedeen (fighters), today is your day to make this criminal understand that his time has ended,&quot; Deif said in the recording.</p><p> There are only three images of Deif: one in his 20s, another of him masked, and an image of his shadow, which was used when the audio tape was broadcast.</p><p> The whereabouts of Deif is unknown, though he is most likely in Gaza in the maze of tunnels under the enclave. An Israeli security source said Deif was directly involved in the planning and operational aspects of the attack.</p><h 1=""> TWO BRAINS, ONE MASTERMIND</h><p> The source close to Hamas said the decision to prepare the attack was taken jointly by Deif, who commands Hamas&#39;s Al Qassam Brigades, along with Yehya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, but it was clear who was the architect.</p><p> &quot;There are two brains, but there is one mastermind,&quot; the source said, adding that information about the operation was known only to a handful of Hamas leaders.</p><p> Secrecy was such that Iran, Israel&#39;s sworn foe and an important source of finance, training and weaponry for Hamas, knew only in general terms that the movement was planning a major operation and did not know the timing or the details, a regional source familiar with the group&#39;s thinking.</p><p> The source said that while Tehran was aware a major operation was being prepared, it was not discussed in any joint operation rooms involving Hamas, the Palestinian leadership, Iranian-backed Lebanese militants Hezbollah, and Iran.</p><p> &quot;It was a very tight circle,&quot; the source said.</p><p> Iran&#39;s top authority Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday Tehran was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-khamenei-says-tehran-was-not-behind-hamas-attack-israel-2023-10-10/">not involved</a> in the attack on Israel. Washington has said while Tehran was complicit, it had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-is-complicit-there-is-no-direct-evidence-tying-it-attacks-israel-white-2023-10-09/">no intelligence of evidence</a> that points to Iran&#39;s direct participation in the attacks.</p><p> The plan as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-israel-was-duped-hamas-planned-devastating-assault-2023-10-08/">conceived</a> by Deif involved a prolonged effort at deception. Israel was led to believe that Hamas, an ally of Israel&#39;s sworn foe Iran, was not interested in launching a conflict and was focusing instead on economic development in Gaza, where the movement is the governing power.</p><p> But while Israel began providing economic incentives to Gazan workers, the group&#39;s fighters were being trained and drilled, often in plain sight of the Israeli military, a source close to Hamas said.</p><p> &quot;We have prepared for this battle for two years,&quot; said Ali Baraka, the head of external relations for Hamas.</p><p> Speaking in a calm voice, Deif said in his recording that Hamas had repeatedly warned Israel to stop its crimes against Palestinians, to release prisoners, whom he said were abused and tortured, and to halt its expropriation of Palestinian land.</p><p> &quot;Every day the occupation storm our villages, towns and cities in the West Bank and raid houses, kill, injure, destroy and detain. At the same time, it confiscates thousands of acres of our land, uproots our people from their houses to build settlements while its criminal siege continues on Gaza.&quot;</p><h 1=""> &#39;IN THE SHADOWS&#39;</h><p> For well over a year, there has been turmoil in the West Bank, an area about 100 km (60 miles) long and 50 km wide that has been at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since it was seized by Israel in 1967.</p><p> Deif said Hamas had urged the international community to put an end to the &quot;crimes of the occupation&quot; but Israel had stepped up its provocation. He also said Hamas had in the past asked Israel for a humanitarian deal to release Palestinian prisoners, but this was rejected.</p><p> &quot;In light of the orgy of occupation and its denial of international laws and resolutions, and in light of American and western support and international silence, we&#39;ve decided to put an end to all this,&quot; he said.</p><p> Born as Mohammad Masri in 1965 in the Khan Yunis Refugee Camp set up after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the militant leader became known as Mohammed Deif after joining Hamas during the first Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, which began in 1987.</p><p> He was arrested by Israel in 1989 and spent about 16 months in detention, a Hamas source said.</p><p> Deif earned a degree in science from the Islamic University in Gaza, where he studied physics, chemistry and biology. He displayed an affinity for the arts, heading the university&#39;s entertainment committee and performing on stage in comedies.</p><p> Rising up the Hamas ranks, Deif developed the group&#39;s network of tunnels and its bomb-making expertise. He has topped Israel&#39;s most wanted list for decades, held personally responsible for the deaths of dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings.</p><p> For Deif, staying in the shadow has been a matter of life or death. Hamas sources said he lost an eye and sustained serious injuries in one leg in one of Israel&#39;s assassination attempts.</p><p> His wife, seven-month-old son, and three-year-old daughter were killed by an Israeli airstrike in 2014.</p><p> His survival while running Hamas&#39;s armed wing has earned him the status of a Palestinian folk hero. In videos he is masked, or just a shadow of him is seen. He doesn&#39;t use modern digital technology such as smart phones, the source close to Hamas said.</p><p> &quot;He is elusive. He is the man in the shadows.&quot;</p> <span>Editing by William Maclean and David Clarke</span> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 21:06:57 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> IIU4C6TKPRKLXPTWHJVX6LUS4Q</guid><link/> https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-secretive-hamas-commander-masterminded-attack-israel-2023-10-10/<author><![CDATA[Samia Nakhoul, Laila Bassam]]></author><category> ISRAEL</category><category> PALESTINIANS/MASTERMIND (INSIGHT, PIX) </category></item><item><title><![CDATA[EU's Breton warns Musk about disinformation on X after Hamas' attack on Israel]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p> EU industry chief Thierry Breton on Tuesday warned Elon Musk of disinformation spread on his X messaging platform following Palestinian Islamist group Hamas&#39; surprise attack on Israel.</p><p> &quot;I therefore invite you to urgently ensure that your systems are effective, and report on the crisis measures taken to my team,&quot; Breton told Musk in a letter dated Oct. 10 and seen by Reuters.</p> <span>Reporting by Foo Yun Chee and Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Chris Reese</span> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 18:52:46 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> OSBEOQQILVO5VJRMMZX6MLMHCA</guid><link/> https://www.reuters.com/world/eus-breton-warns-musk-about-disinformation-x-after-hamas-attack-israel-2023-10-10/<author><![CDATA[Reuters]]></author><category> ISRAEL</category><category> PALESTINIANS/EU</category><category> TWITTER (URGENT) </category></item><item><title><![CDATA[Biden to offer support for Israel, American Jews in speech]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p> President Joe Biden on Tuesday will stress US support for Israel as it reels from the killing of more than 1,000 people, including at least 11 Americans, from a surprise attack launched by Palestinian Hamas militants.</p><p> Biden is set to speak at 1 pm ET (1700 GMT) from the White House.
