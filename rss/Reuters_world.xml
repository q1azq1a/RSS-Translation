href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/blinken-heads-saudi-arabia-amid-strained-ties-israel-normalization-mind-2023-06-06/">抵达</a>沙特阿拉伯，开始了备受期待的访问。</p><p>华盛顿一直在努力稳定与利雅得的关系，事实上的统治者穆罕默德亲王主导了利雅得的决策制定，而传统的石油换安全联盟在美国成为主要石油生产国的情况下崩溃了。</p><p>布林肯访问前几天，最大原油出口国沙特阿拉伯<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/opec-meets-debate-production-quotas-new-cut-sources-2023-06-04/">承诺</a>在更广泛的欧佩克+协议基础上进一步削减石油产量以限制供应，因为它不顾美国政府的反对寻求提振低迷的油价。</p><p>一位美国官员说，布林肯和被称为 MbS 的王储会面了 1 小时 40 分钟，讨论的话题包括以色列、也门冲突、苏丹动乱以及人权。</p><p>这位美国官员说：“在我们拥有相同利益的潜在倡议上存在很大程度的趋同，同时也认识到我们存在分歧。”</p><p>预计讨论的很大一部分将围绕沙特阿拉伯和以色列之间关系正常化的可能性展开，尽管官员们淡化了在该问题上取得任何直接或重大进展的可能性。</p><p> “他们讨论了与以色列关系正常化的可能性，并同意继续就这个问题进行对话，”这位美国官员说，但没有提供更多细节。</p><p>布林肯周一在启程前往吉达之前在华盛顿发表讲话，警告说在这个问题上不会立即取得任何突破。他说：“我们并不幻想这可以快速或轻松地完成。”</p><p>沙特阿拉伯是中东强国，也是伊斯兰教两个最神圣圣地的所在地，它祝福海湾邻国阿拉伯联合酋长国和巴林在美国前任唐纳德特朗普政府的领导下于 2020 年与以色列建立关系。</p><p>利雅得没有效仿，称应该首先解决巴勒斯坦建国的目标。 4 月，沙特阿拉伯恢复了与伊朗的关系，伊朗是地区竞争对手，也是以色列的宿敌。</p><h 1="">核技术</h><p>一位熟悉相关讨论的消息人士称，发展民用核计划是利雅得与以色列实现关系正常化的条件之一，这证实了《纽约时报》3 月份的一篇报道。沙特或美国官员尚未公开证实这一点。</p><p>然而，美国官员过去曾表示，只有在协议阻止铀浓缩或反应堆生产的钚后处理——这两种制造核武器的途径时，他们才会分享核电技术。</p><p>利雅得还利用其与中国不断发展的关系，因为华盛顿拒绝了它的一些要求，包括取消对武器销售的限制和帮助敏感的高科技产业。</p><p>布林肯访问两天后，利雅得将举办一场重要的阿中投资会议。</p><p>大西洋理事会非常驻高级研究员乔纳森富尔顿表示，中国将在美国不会帮助沙特的领域提供帮助，但利雅得与北京之间的关系不如与华盛顿的关系深厚。</p><p> “在这一点上，我仍然认为美沙关系是战略性的，中沙关系是交易性的，”富尔顿说。</p><p>在海湾合作委员会 (GCC) 外交部长会议之前的简短讲话中，布林肯试图向他们保证华盛顿对该地区的关注。</p><p>他说：“美国将留在这个地区，我们将继续深入投资与你们所有人合作。”</p><p> MbS 和布林肯还讨论了也门和解决遗留问题的可能方法，而布林肯感谢王储在推动苏丹停火和帮助撤离美国公民方面发挥的作用。</p><p>这位美国官员表示，布林肯还向 MbS 提出了人权问题，无论是在广泛层面还是与具体案件有关，但没有说明是哪些案件。</p><p>该王国一直在投入数百万亿美元来改造和开放其经济，以减少对原油的依赖。改革伴随着对 MbS 的批评者以及商人、神职人员和维权人士的大量逮捕。</p><p>最近一次是在 3 月，沙特当局<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/saudi-arabia-releases-us-national-prison-says-son-2023-03-21/">释放了</a>一名因在 Twitter 上批评政府而被判入狱 19

Coinbase 的首席法律官 Paul Grewal 周二晚些时候告诉路透社，这两起诉讼有实质性的不同。</p><p> “没有任何指控表明我们不遵守对混合基金的限制。没有任何指控表明我们未能妥善隔离任何资产或经营我们自己的对冲基金。类似的事情与我们的案件无关，”Grewal 说。</p><p>币安没有立即回应置评请求。</p><p> Coinbase 股价周三反弹，上涨近 4.3% 至 53.8

3 月以来八次将借贷成本上调至 4.50% 的 15 年高点——这是该行历史上最快的紧缩周期后，该央行自 1 月以来一直暂停评估此前加息的影响。</p><p>央行在一份声明中表示，消费者支出意外强劲、服务需求反弹、住房活动回升以及劳动力市场吃紧表明经济中的过剩需求比预期更为持久。</p><p>加拿大央行 (BoC) 注意到 4 月份通胀上升，以及三个月的核心通胀指标连续几个月高达 4% 的事实，“人们越来越担心 CPI 通胀可能会大幅高于2% 的目标。”</p><p>鉴于这种背景，管理委员会确定“货币政策的限制性不足以使供需恢复平衡并将通胀率可持续地恢复到 2% 的目标。”</p><p>消息公布后，加元兑美元汇率上涨 0.5% 至 1.3330。货币市场认为 7 月再次加息的可能性接近 60%，并已充分消化了 9 月进一步收紧政策的可能性。</p><p> “我们预计 7 月份还会再降息 25 个基点，”丰业银行资本市场经济副总裁德里克霍尔特表示。 “这就像一袋薯条，你打开一个却吃不到一个。”</p><p>利率上一次触及 4.75% 是在 2001 年 4 月和 5 月。</p><p>货币市场和分析师都看到了加息的机会，但许多人认为更有可能在 7 月的下一次会议上加息。路透社上周调查的经济学家中，约有三分之二预计央行将维持利率不变至 2023 年底。</p><p>

头正在繁殖的雌性鲸鱼，这是一个很大的数字。生活在从佛罗里达州延伸到加拿大滨海省的北美东部海岸外的北大西洋露脊鲸现在濒临灭绝。</p><p>为了解决这个问题，美国和加拿大政府近年来对龙虾和螃蟹渔业实施了新的规定，包括使用绳索中的薄弱环节（鲸鱼游过时会断裂）、用于追踪的颜色编码绳索、增加更多陷阱鲸鱼迁徙期间的浮标线和区域关闭。</p><p>但是鲸鱼仍然纠缠在一起。</p><p> “看起来我们提出的解决方案并不有效，”马萨诸塞州科德角海岸研究中心的资深科学家查尔斯梅奥说。</p><p> “没有达到我们需要的程度。我们需要不断增长的人口。我们没有那么多鲸鱼了。”</p><p>华盛顿和渥太华现在正在推广无绳捕鱼作为一种可能的长期解决方案。传统的龙虾捕捞使用沉入海底的陷阱，并通过绳索连接到漂浮在水面的浮标。相比之下，无绳装置仅在其所有者通过遥控器激活释放触发器时才将绳索和浮标部署到水面。</p><p> NOAA 在 2022 年发布了一份 <a href="https://media.fisheries.noaa.gov/2022-07/RopelessRoadmapDRAFT-NEFSC.pdf" target="_blank">战略文件</a>，设想未来几年对无绳技术的潜在监管，加拿大渔业部称无绳渔具是“消除垂直线缠绕风险的唯一方法”。</p><p> “反应过度”</p><p> Edgetech 的产品线销售工程师 Rob Morris 是为数不多的从事无绳捕鱼器研究的公司之一，他说设备的大部分技术问题都已经解决——包括可靠性、在海图绘图仪上查看水下装备以及避免其他人陷阱。</p><p> “这已经非常成熟了，”他说，“我们现在只是在做一些调整。”</p><p>他说 Edgetech 准备每月生产 100 台，只是在等待行业订单。</p><p>但是捕龙虾的人，尤其是缅因州，那里捕获了美国 80% 的龙虾，并不热心。</p><p>该行业长期以来一直认为，没有一头北大西洋露脊鲸的死亡归因于缅因州的龙虾渔具，而且鲸鱼目前的迁徙路线使它们位于该州龙虾渔场的东部。</p><p>由于鲸鱼缠绕和去年被 Seafood Watch <a href="https://www.seafoodwatch.org/recommendation/lobster/american-lobster-24084" target="_blank">列入红色</a>名单，龙虾捕捞者也受到了公众的强烈反对，这标志着一个几十年来因其可持续实践而受到赞誉的行业的惊人失宠。</p><p> “这似乎是对这里没有发生的事情的过度反应，”Monhegan 的龙虾商 Kyle Murdock 说。</p><p>捕虾人表示，他们担心改用无绳设备的高昂管理费用，并担心不可避免的技术故障可能导致价值数万美元的捕网器在海底丢失。</p><p> “我想有些捕龙虾的人会继续做下去，并会投资这笔钱。但我认为这将是我们所知道的缅因州龙虾业的终结，”韦伯说。</p><p>一些新英格兰捕龙虾的人在获得特别许可的情况下驾驶无绳设备，主要是在马萨诸塞州。路透社联系到的那些捕龙虾的人都没有同意接受采访。</p><h 1="">加拿大的麻烦</h><p>2017 年，北大西洋露脊鲸开始大量出现在一个不寻常的地方，即加拿大的圣劳伦斯湾，在它们通常出没的地方以东。</p><p>科学家们说，从通常的夏季目的地芬迪湾转移是由于气候变化驱动的新洋流将鲸鱼的食物——被称为桡足类的小型甲壳类动物——推向了那个方向。</p><p>结果对鲸鱼来说是悲惨的。在海湾繁忙的航道和活跃的雪蟹和龙虾渔业中觅食，仅在那一年，北大西洋露脊鲸的死亡人数就激增至 15 人，其中 5 人归因于船只撞击，其余则归因于缠绕或不明原因。</p><p>加拿大渔业和海洋部主任布雷特吉尔克里斯特表示，渥太华立即实施了新措施来保护鲸鱼，降低船速，并要求捕鱼业在其线路中使用弱绳索。</p><p>政府还开始进行空中和声学监测，允许它在发现鲸鱼时关闭捕鱼区域。吉尔克里斯特说，当这 2,100 平方公里的区域关闭时，只允许配备无绳装置的收割机在那里捕鱼。</p><p> “这对我们的龙虾捕捞者来说无疑是一个挑战。但他们也看到他们长期参与其中，这将帮助他们保护他们的市场，”他谈到这项技术时说。</p><p>马萨诸塞州伍德霍尔海洋研究所的研究员迈克尔摩尔说，鲸鱼意外抵达圣劳伦斯湾表明各地的垂直线捕鱼最终可能不得不进行调整。</p><p> “随着气候变化，迁徙模式也会发生变化，”他说。 “我希望我们能够真正为这个问题促成一个相互可持续的解决方案。这并非不可能。”</p><span>理查德·瓦尔德曼尼斯 (Richard Valdmanis) 撰写，迪帕·巴宾顿 (Deepa Babington) 编辑</span>]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 07 Jun 2023 13:29:12 GMT</pubDate><guid

They maintain that McCarthy and his leadership team failed to deliver on promised spending cuts, ignored their input and retaliated against one of their members.</p><p> &quot;What we plan to do is to be ready at all points in time, acting in good faith, to re-forge the unity that was destroyed last week,&quot; said Representative Dan Bishop, one of the hardliners.</p><p> Bishop and other conservatives joined with Democrats in a 220-206 vote that prevented the Republican-led chamber from debating and passing two bills to prevent federal regulations on gas stoves. Some state and local governments have turned to such regulations as a way of addressing global warming.</p><p> The protest raised questions about whether the House would be able to proceed with other legislation, including a measure to increase congressional scrutiny of regulations and expand the scope of judicial review of federal agencies.</p><p> McCarthy and his allies met with the group on Tuesday night to try to resolve their differences.</p><p> &quot;This is not about lecturing Republicans about what it means to be Republican. It&#39;s about how we work together on a daily, weekly basis,&quot; Representative Patrick McHenry, a McCarthy ally, told reporters.</p><p> McCarthy oversees a narrow House Republican majority of 222-213, meaning that he can lose only four votes from his own party on any measure that faces uniform opposition from Democrats.</p><p> McCarthy endured <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-speaker-fight-enters-fourth-day-amid-antebellum-era-dysfunction-2023-01-06/">15 floor votes</a> in January until he finally won the vote for speaker, agreeing to a set of demands that the hardliners now say he violated to pass the debt ceiling bill.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration</figcaption></figure><p> Turkey&#39;s lira plunged 7% to a record low on Wednesday in its biggest daily selloff since a historic 2021 crash, as the newly-elected government appeared to loosen stabilising measures in its pivot to more orthodox policies.</p><p> The lira has come under pressure since President Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected on May 28. It stood at 22.98 against the dollar at 0735 GMT.</p><p> Earlier it touched a record low of 23.16, bringing its losses this year to more than 19%.</p><p> Erdogan announced his <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkeys-erdogan-take-oath-name-new-look-cabinet-2023-06-03/">new cabinet</a> at the weekend and named Mehmet Simsek, a former deputy prime minister who is well regarded by foreign investors, as finance minister. Simsek later said economic policy needed to return to &quot;rational&quot; ground.</p><p> Markets are also waiting for the appointment of a new central bank governor to replace Sahap Kavcioglu, who spearheaded rate cuts under Erdogan&#39;s unorthodox policies.</p><p> &quot;We are seeing policy normalisation play out,&quot; said Tim Ash at BlueBay Asset Management.</p><p> &quot;I think we are seeing the impact of Simsek pushing (the Turkish central bank) for rational policy.&quot;</p><p> For much of this year, authorities have taken a hands-on role in foreign exchange markets, using up tens of billions of dollars of reserves to hold the lira steady.</p><p> Bankers say the lira&#39;s continued gradual depreciation will lead to improved market conditions and halt a decline in central bank reserves.</p><p> &quot;The lira is getting closer every day to a level that will not need to be defended with reserves. I expect losses to continue for a while,&quot; a forex trader said, adding sharp intraday losses show the currency is nearing &quot;expected levels.&quot;</p><p> Some analysts expect the lira to weaken towards a range of 25-28 against the dollar.</p><h 1=""> RETURN TO ORTHODOXY</h><p> Under pressure from Erdogan, a self-described &quot;enemy&quot; of interest rates, the central bank slashed its policy rate to 8.5% from 19% in 2021 to boost growth and investment. But it sparked a record lira crisis in December of 2021 and sent inflation to a 24-year high above 85% last year.</p><p> The return of Simsek, who was finance minister and deputy prime minister in 2009-2018, signalled a move away from the unorthodox rate cuts despite high inflation that have sparked a more than 80% erosion in the lira&#39;s value in five years.</p><p> Erdogan is considering appointing Hafize Gaye Erkan, a senior finance executive in the United States, as central bank governor, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/erdogan-considering-erkan-turkey-cenbank-chief-sources-say-2023-06-05/">Reuters reported</a> on Monday. Erkan met with Simsek in Ankara on Monday.</p><p> Erkan would be the country&#39;s fifth central bank chief in four years, after Erdogan fired previous governors as part of frequent policy pivots.</p><p> Turkish authorities are now hoping foreign investors will return after a years-long exodus, but market watchers cautioned that Erdogan turned to conventional policies in the past only to change his mind shortly after.</p><p> &quot;Even without political interference, the process of getting Turkey onto a sustainable path is going to be turbulent, and likely involves substantial devaluation and higher yields,&quot; said Paul McNamara, director of emerging market debt at asset manager GAM.</p><p> &quot;We think fair value for the lira is probably 15% or so lower, but containing a devaluation without substantial external support is going to be a desperately difficult task,&quot; he said before Wednesday&#39;s decline.</p><p> &quot;Orthodoxy would involve (above all) allowing the lira to find a sustainable level without intervention and abandoning the de facto capital controls currently in place.&quot;</p> <span>Reporting by Huseyin Hayatsever in Ankara and Jorgelina do Rosario in London; Writing by Jonathan Spicer and Ali Kucukgocmen; Editing by Tom Hogue and Christina Fincher</span> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 07 Jun 2023 07:47:29 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkish-lira-down-7-biggest-selloff-since-2021-crisis-2023-06-07/</guid><link/> https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkish-lira-down-7-biggest-selloff-since-2021-crisis-2023-06-07/<author><![CDATA[Huseyin Hayatsever, Nevzat Devranoglu]]></author><category> TURKEY</category><category> CURRENCY/ (UPDATE 2) </category></item><item><title><![CDATA[Analysis: Diverted Indian jet lands in middle of Russia airspace row]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/SXI4UTVW6NIGTNGCU5OH3NSDCU.jpg" alt="The MC-21-310 medium-range airliner performs a test flight in the Moscow region" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> The MC-21-310 medium-range airliner, fitted with the Russian Aviadvigatel PD-14 turbofan engines, performs a test flight at the Ramenskoye airfield in the Moscow region, Russia August 10, 2022.

That is a potential crisis in the making,&quot; Kirby warned on Monday.</p><p> &quot;I think we should solve it before the crisis happens. It may require the crisis before it gets solved but I think we should probably solve before the crisis,&quot; he said.</p><p> The disagreements put a spotlight on the strategic and geographic importance of Russia in the global aviation world as it offers the most direct flying path between the West and the East - an important factor for carriers to keep costs down.</p><p> An influential trade body with roots in the development of civil aviation after World War Two, IATA has been at the forefront of efforts to create a seamless global architecture for civil aviation.</p><p> But international reaction to Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine has exposed differences between its members over the use of Russia&#39;s air corridors.</p><p> IATA Director General Willie Walsh called for an opening up of Russian airspace.</p><p> &quot;What we would like to see is everybody using Russian airspace. I&#39;m clear that it&#39;s not a security or a safety issue,&quot; Walsh told Reuters.</p><h 1=""> LEVEL PLAYING FIELD</h><p> Airlines in the United States have been in talks with the government to discourage carriers landing on US soil after flying via Russian airspace, which generates fees for Moscow.</p><p> Western carriers are particularly vexed about what they see as their potential competitive disadvantage to Chinese airlines as the world&#39;s second-largest economy reopens and outbound travel picks up.</p><p> But airlines that can are unlikely to stop using Russian airspace after this diversion, said James Halstead, managing partner at Aviation Strategy.</p><p> &quot;It is the hand you are dealt,&quot; said Vinod Kannan, CEO of India&#39;s Vistara, a joint venture between Tata Group and Singapore Airlines <a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/SIAL.SI/" target="_blank">(SIAL.SI)</a> , referring to the overflights.</p><p> &quot;It depends on the law of the land.

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo</figcaption></figure><p> A veritable parade of overseas CEOs including Tesla&#39;s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/TSLA.O/" target="_blank">(TSLA.O)</a> Elon Musk and Goldman Sachs&#39; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/GS.N/" target="_blank">(GS.N)</a> David Solomon have made their way to a reopened China in the last few months.</p><p> One notable common strand: they&#39;ve not talked much in public about their trips which have mostly consisted of meetings with government officials, local staff and business partners. Media events and other public engagements, once frequent before the pandemic, are now rare.</p><p> Even Musk, known for his unreserved banter on Twitter, was uncharacteristically silent on a whirlwind trip last week.</p><p> In 2020, the billionaire celebrated the delivery of the first cars made at Tesla&#39;s Shanghai plant with a dance on stage that was open to the press. This time around, media were not invited to cover his plant visit.</p><p> And while Musk has mentioned the trip in two posts since leaving, he didn&#39;t tweet once while in China.</p><p> Goldman&#39;s Solomon has similarly been more low-key. In 2019, he gave media interviews and participated in several forums. But during his trip in March this year, his only known engagements were closed-door meetings with regulators, China&#39;s sovereign wealth fund and at a university.</p><p> The lack of information from Western CEOs and their companies about the trips to China can be attributed to wariness given that US-Sino political and trade tensions have worsened to their lowest point in decades, said senior staff at chambers of commerce and trade associations.</p><p> President Xi Jinping&#39;s increasing focus on <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-return-global-stage-checked-by-national-security-focus-2023-05-08/">national security</a> - in particular a recent crackdown on consultancies and due diligence firms - has also left many foreign companies uncertain where they might step over the line of the law, they said.</p><p> Noah Fraser, managing director of the Canada China Business Council, said visiting executives are no longer chasing new business opportunities but are concentrating on maintaining existing relationships and will often stipulate no press, big dinners or speaking opportunities.</p><p> They appear to be keeping &quot;their heads down and will have private lunches where they can learn from people on the ground what&#39;s happening,&quot; he said.</p><p> Before travelling to China, US CEOs have been seeking advice about how Beijing&#39;s expansion of its counter-espionage law could affect them, according to the head of a US trade association who declined to be identified, citing the sensitive nature of doing business in China currently.</p><p> The CEOs also want to know how to deal with Chinese government officials and with questions once the trip becomes public, the association head said, adding it was not in their interest to speak to media and run the risk of being asked to comment on stances taken by Washington and Beijing.</p><p> The EU Chamber of Commerce said in a statement that companies operating in China have always exercised a certain level of caution and were now adapting to changes in areas that might be deemed sensitive.</p><p> Tesla did not respond to a request for comment while Goldman declined to comment.</p><p> China&#39;s foreign ministry said in a statement that the numerous visits from US CEOs were a &quot;vote of confidence&quot; in the Chinese economy. That their trips were relatively low-key stemmed from what it called the US government&#39;s &quot;wrong policy&quot; of containing China, it said.</p><p> With respect to concerns about its counter-espionage law, it was China&#39;s right to safeguard national security through domestic legislation, it added.</p><p> The US Department of Commerce declined to comment.</p><h 1=""> SHOWING COMMITMENT</h><p> While US President Joe Biden said last month he expected a thaw in frosty relations with Beijing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-sees-shift-relations-with-china-shortly-says-g7-wants-de-risk-not-decouple-2023-05-21/">&quot;very shortly&quot;</a> , there is no denying that tensions have soared this year with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-china-tensions-intensify-over-tech-taiwan-flashpoints-2023-05-24/">flashpoints</a> including US export curbs on semiconductors and data security concerns.</p><p> That said, after three years of harsh COVID curbs that hampered entry into China, foreign CEOs appear eager to get the lay of the land.</p><p> Those travelling here in recent months have included Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/AAPL.O/" target="_blank">(AAPL.O)</a> Tim Cook, Intel&#39;s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/INTC.O/" target="_blank">(INTC.O)</a> Patrick Gelsinger, General Motors&#39; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/GM.N/" target="_blank">(GM.N)</a> Mary Barra, Blackstone&#39;s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/BX.N/" target="_blank">(BX.N)</a> Stephen Schwarzman and JPMorgan&#39;s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/JPM.N/" target="_blank">(JPM.N)</a> Jamie Dimon.</p><p> Sixty-seven foreign business leaders attended the high-profile China Development Forum this year, although that is still 20 fewer than in 2019.</p><p> &quot;The idea is that you have to show sufficient commitment to the China market if you&#39;re playing there,&quot; said Christopher Johnson, president of China Strategies Group, a political risk consultancy.</p><p> At the same time, the CEOs need to do that &quot;without setting off alarm bells with the US government, and it&#39;s a very difficult task,&quot; he added.</p><p> JPMorgan and Blackstone declined to comment. Apple, General Motors and Intel did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p> The few known comments by foreign CEOs whilst they were in China have been in line with Biden&#39;s stance that he is not seeking to decouple the world&#39;s two largest economies.</p><p> The foreign ministry quoted Musk as saying he was opposed to a decoupling of the US and China economies which he described as &quot;conjoined twins&quot;.</p><p> JPMorgan&#39;s Dimon told the JPMorgan Global China Summit last week he favoured East-West <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgans-dimon-says-us-china-need-have-real-engagement-2023-05-31/">&quot;de-risking&quot;</a> rather than decoupling, according to a source from the event.</p><p> Daniel Russel, vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said the difference between de-risking and decoupling was a subtle but important one.</p><p> It &quot;makes clear that the issue is managing the risk of dependency on China rather than a determination to separate the world into two competing spheres,&quot; he said.</p> <span>Reporting by Brenda Goh in Shanghai and Joe Cash in Beijing; Additional reporting by Selena Li in Hong Kong, Zhang Yan in Shanghai, the Shanghai newsroom, David Brunnstrom and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Edwina Gibbs</span> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 07 Jun 2023 03:05:38 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.reuters.com/world/china/musk-other-foreign-ceos-visiting-china-silence-is-golden-2023-06-07/</guid><link/> https://www.reuters.com/world/china/musk-other-foreign-ceos-visiting-china-silence-is-golden-2023-06-07/<author><![CDATA[Brenda Goh, Joe Cash]]></author><category> USA</category><category> CHINA/CEOS (ANALYSIS, PIX) </category></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kakhovka dam: what happened and what do we not know?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/5M5K724Q3RNU3M6NG5V4IJYOAY.jpg" alt="A view shows the Nova Kakhovka dam that was breached in Kherson Region" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> A view shows the Nova Kakhovka dam that was breached in the course of Russia-Ukraine conflict, in the Kherson Region, Russian-controlled Ukraine, June 6, 2023.

Construction was started under Soviet leader Josef Stalin and finished under Nikita Khrushchev.</p><p> The dam bridged the Dnipro River, which forms the front line between Russian and Ukrainian forces in the south of Ukraine.</p><p> Creation of the 2,155 sq km (832 sq mile) Kakhovka reservoir in Soviet times forced around 37,000 people to be moved from their homes.</p><p> The reservoir holds 18 cubic kilometres (4.3 cubic miles) of water - a volume roughly equal to the Great Salt Lake in the US state of Utah.</p><p> The reservoir also supplies water to the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, and to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which is also under Russian control.</p><h 1=""> WHAT HAPPENED?</h><p> Ukraine, which commented first, said Russia was responsible:</p><p> Ukrainian President <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-russia-must-be-held-account-over-kakhovka-dam-blast-2023-06-06/">Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a> accused Russian forces of blowing up the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station from inside the facility, and said Russia must be held to account for a &quot;terrorist attack&quot;.</p><p> &quot;At 02:50, Russian terrorists carried out an internal detonation of the structures of the Kakhovskaya HPP. About 80 settlements are in the zone of flooding,&quot; Zelenskiy said after an emergency meeting of senior officials.</p><p> A Ukrainian military spokesperson said Russia&#39;s aim was to prevent Ukrainian troops crossing the Dnipro River to attack Russian occupying forces.</p><p> Russia said Ukraine <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-says-ukraine-sabotaged-dam-cut-crimeas-water-distract-own-failure-2023-06-06/">sabotaged the dam</a> to cut off water supplies to Crimea and to distract attention from its faltering counteroffensive.</p><p> &quot;We can state unequivocally that we are talking about deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side,&quot; Kremlin Spokesman Peskov told reporters.</p><p> Earlier some Russian-installed officials said no attack had taken place. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian installed official in Zaporizhzhia, said the dam collapsed due to earlier damage and the pressure of the water.
