href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/fed-is-close-end-rate-hiking-cycle-central-bank-officials-say-2023-07-10/">周一表示，</a>央行可能需要进一步加息，以降低仍处于高位的通胀，但当前货币政策紧缩周期即将结束。</p><p>由于交易员降低了对美国利率必须进一步上调的预期，该言论导致美元兑一篮子货币在亚洲早盘交易中跌至两个月低点101.88。</p><p>自美联储去年开始紧缩周期以来，美国利率预期一直是美元的主要驱动因素。</p><p>与此同时，英镑触及15个月新高1.2869美元，而欧元上涨0.03%至1.1004美元。</p><p>澳大利亚联邦银行(Commonwealth Bank of Australia)货币策略师卡罗尔·孔(Carol Kong)表示，“联邦公开市场委员会的讲话是昨天的主要焦点，讲话的官员重申了最近的信息，即未来几个月可能会进一步加息，因此这并不令人意外。” 。</p><p>市场现在将注意力集中在周三公布的美国通胀数据上，该数据将使美联储在应对居高不下的消费者价格方面取得的进展更加清晰。</p><p>纽约联储<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/ny-fed-survey-finds-waning-near-term-inflation-expectations-2023-07-10/">周一的一项调查显示</a>，美国人的近期通胀预期正在减弱，他们上个月表示，他们预计近期通胀涨幅将是两年多以来最弱的。</p><p> Kong表示：“如果我们（明天）确实得到强劲的CPI报告，这可能有助于市场对FOMC（7月之后）第二次加息的定价，并推动美元小幅走高。” “但鉴于我们已接近联邦公开市场委员会(FOMC)紧缩周期的顶部，我认为任何上行空间都不会很大。”</p><p>周二，日元兑美元升至近一个月高点141.15，最后买盘为141.43，受到美国国债收益率暴跌的支撑。</p><p>由于日本利率接近于零，美元/日元对美国收益率特别敏感。</p><p>其他方面，澳元兑美元上涨 0.16%，至 0.6687 美元；新西兰元兑美元上涨 0.06%，至 0.6216 美元。</p><p>这两种澳大利亚货币兑美元的涨幅受到中国经济复苏步履蹒跚的限制，因为这两种货币都经常被用作人民币的流动性替代品。</p><p>离岸市场人民币兑美元汇率最后小幅上涨至7.2254。</p><p>周一的数据显示，6月份<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/china-factory-gate-deflation-deepens-june-weak-demand-2023-07-10/">中国</a>生产者价格指数出现七年来最大跌幅，而消费者价格指数则徘徊在通货紧缩的边缘。</p><p>麦格理策略师在一份报告中表示：“中国6月份CPI和PPI同比数据低于预期，表明在总需求不强劲的情况下，中国仍在与通货紧缩作斗争。”</p><p> “为了让交易者对中国持积极态度，似乎除了强有力的刺激计划之外，别无他法。”</p> <span>Rae Wee 报道 Shri Navaratnam 编辑</span>]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 11 Jul 2023 01:19:52 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

9 月 30 日结束后政府关门的努力变得更加复杂。</p><p> “我们预计所有拨款措施……将符合已颁布的 2022 财年 1.471 万亿美元的最高水平，”以众议院自由核心小组成员斯科特·佩里 (Scott Perry) 和奇普·罗伊 (Chip Roy) 为首的 21 名议员在一封信中表示。</p><p>信中称：“如果不遵守 1.471 万亿美元的支出水平……我们认为共和党不可能就拨款或其他措施获得 218 票支持。”</p><p>该组织包括上个月关闭众议院的议员，以抗议麦卡锡五月份与拜登达成的避免美国债务违约的协议。</p><p>麦卡锡办公室没有回应路透社寻求对这封信发表评论的询问。</p><p>与此同时，随着国会周一结束 7 月 4 日为期两周的休会，参议院拨款者的目标是达成两党协议，所有这些都表明未来的谈判将很困难。</p><p>从堕胎到变性人权利等一系列热点问题预计将被纳入即将到来的辩论，使问题进一步复杂化。如果立法者未能在 10 月 1 日下一个财政年度开始之前就预算达成一致，美国可能会出现十年来第四次部分政府关门。</p><p>参议院谈判代表在众议院共和党人和白宫最近就联邦政府 31.4 万亿美元债务上限进行的谈判中基本上处于旁观状态，但他们正在制定吸引两党大力支持的法案。</p><p>民主党参议员帕蒂·穆雷和共和党参议员苏珊·柯林斯在一份联合声明中表示：“我们决心继续以两党合作的方式共同制定可以签署成为法律的严肃拨款法案。”</p><p>共和党以 222 比 212 的微弱优势在众议院占据多数席位，而民主党在参议院以 51 比 49 的微弱优势占据多数席位，这意味着没有两党投票，任何法案都无法通过。</p><h 1="">目标相互冲突</h><p>两院领导人甚至没有就他们的支出目标达成一致。</p><p>参议院谈判代表计划维持拜登和麦卡锡在 5 月协议中同意的 1.59 万亿美元可自由支配支出目标。</p><p>众议院共和党上个月投票确定了 1.47 万亿美元的较低目标，这将削减环境、公共援助和对外援助的支出。</p><p>众议院的目标没有考虑共和党领导人可以将现有资金转向党派优先事项以补偿削减的 1150 亿美元。</p><p>众议院共和党人还试图利用该立法废除拜登在气候变化和税收等领域的关键优先事项。他们还寻求消除或改变民主党正在争取的一些涉及劳动力多样性、变性人保护和妇女堕胎机会的现有计划。</p><p>民主党众议员罗莎·德劳罗在一份声明中表示，“我准备结束这种考虑共和党极端拨款法案的游戏，并与参众两院和两党同事一起努力就明年的政府支出达成最终协议”在周五。</p><p>众议院拨款委员会资深民主党人德劳罗指出，众议院共和党人“知道并公开表示，最终他们将需要民主党的投票来保持政府的开放”。</p><p>如果未能就拨款达成一致，可能会导致政府在秋季和冬季部分关闭，这可能会阻碍许多联邦活动，包括空中交通管制、军事加薪和国家公园的运营。</p><p>共和党治理小组 (RG2) 主席众议员戴维·乔伊斯 (David Joyce) 表示，在谈判持续到秋季的同时，可能存在达成短期融资协议以维持政府运作的空间。RG2 是一个由 42 名关心众议院治理的议员组成的较为温和的小组。</p><p>乔伊斯对路透社表示：“我并不热衷于关闭，而且我认为 RG2 或我们团队中的任何人都没有真正考虑过这一点。”

href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/challenges-ahead-thailands-reformist-party-eyes-pm-post-2023-07-03/">不确定的政府之路</a>。</p><p>主要原因是，前进运动的政治纲领的一部分是曾经不可想象的一项提议，即修改泰国的“冒犯君主”法，该法是刑法第112条，侮辱君主政体可判处最高15年监禁。</p><p>在这个几十年来一直将尊重君主视为国家认同核心的国家，这种想法是如此激进，以至于少数党和任命的参议院的许多成员发誓要阻止皮塔成为总理。</p><p>参议员斯里·苏万帕农 (Seri Suwanpanon) 告诉路透社：“拟议的修正案是不尊重的，并且冒犯了君主制。”</p><p>批评者称，几十年来，军方一直以捍卫君主制为由，为干预政治辩护，并利用冒犯君主法来压制异议。</p><p>在议会中，玛哈·哇集拉隆功国王的巨型肖像悬挂在会议厅上方，议员们将于周四投票选出总理。</p><p>但由于由军政府任命的拥有 250 个席位的参议院的投票结果，围绕谁获得这份工作的斗争可能会导致数周甚至数月的僵局，这可能会阻止赢得选举的进步联盟在联合投票中确保其选择两院的。</p><p>该制度是在 2014 年由时任陆军总司令巴育·占奥差 (Prayuth Chan-ocha) 领导的政变后起草的宪法中规定的，巴育·占奥差 (Prayuth Chan-ocha) 是总理，他的政党在 5 月的选举中惨败。</p><p>很大程度上取决于前进党的主要盟友、第二名的为泰党是坚持下去，还是在皮塔的竞标看起来注定失败的情况下寻求其他联盟伙伴。</p><p> 70岁的哇集拉隆功国王在选择政府方面没有任何作用，自选举以来，他对冒犯君主的问题一直保持沉默。皇宫没有回应置评请求。</p><h 1="">彻底的改变</h><p>“向前迈进”提出的修正案反映了几年内席卷泰国的文化变革，几十年来，泰国君主一直被视为近乎半神。</p><p>从表面上看，很多事情都没有改变。国王的肖像悬挂在城市的街道和建筑物上。每晚的《皇家新闻》都会播出王室家族的善行。</p><p>但微妙的变化是显而易见的。在电影院里，许多人不再在每部电影放映前奏起皇家国歌。在政府下令删除讽刺表情包之前，社交媒体上出现了一些讽刺表情包。</p><p>然而，最大的变化是政治上的。在2019年的上一次选举中，没有任何政党敢于建议修改冒犯君主法。</p><p>但“前进”不仅敢于行动，而且在五月份赢得了最多席位，尽管该修正案只是进步纲领的一小部分。</p><p>这种转变随着 2020 年学生领导的示威活动而出现，最初是反对军事统治的抗议活动，但后来演变成对抗议者所谓的军事宫殿权力关系的批评，最后演变为对国王的批评。</p><p>政客们并未领导抗议活动，但当活动人士开始受到冒犯君主法的指控时，“向前迈进”呼吁改革该法。</p><p>据泰国人权律师组织称，与 2020 年抗议活动有关的 1,900 起起诉中，约有 250 起是根据第 112 条进行的。</p><p>分析人士表示，根据法律对如此多的人进行起诉，使这个问题成为主流话题。</p><p>曼谷朱拉隆功大学政治分析师蒂蒂南·蓬苏迪拉克 (Thitinan Pongsudhirak) 表示：“我们现在可以看到，政治中真正的断层是君主制在泰国政治秩序中的作用。”</p><h 1="">数字游戏</h><p>由于许多参议员预计将投票反对皮塔竞选总理，前进党在下议院 500 席的八个政党组成的联盟，拥有 312 个席位，可能不足以确保他获得总理职位。</p><p>为了获得他所需的 376 票，前进党和主要合作伙伴为泰党需要说服参议院或下议院其他政党的 64 名议员。</p><p>如果皮塔饼达不到要求，其他情况就会发挥作用。</p><p>为泰党拥有 141 个席位，而前进党拥有 151 个席位，可以在八党联盟完好无损的情况下提名其总理候选人。</p><p>为泰党忠于在 2006 年政变中被驱逐的自我放逐的前总理他信，在有关冒犯君主的问题上更加谨慎，因此其总理候选人之一可能会赢得足够的选票。</p><p>另一种可能性是，为泰党在下议院寻找其他合作伙伴组成联合政府，但没有“前进”。然而，为泰发誓将坚持“前进”。</p><p>乌汶叻差他尼大学政治学系主任蒂蒂波尔·帕迪瓦尼奇表示，利用法律镇压异见会适得其反。</p><p> “保守派过度使用第 112 条，将王室机构拖入政治更深层次，”他说。</p><p>前进说修改法律将防止其滥用并有利于君主制。它希望将刑罚减少到最多一年监禁，并且只有王室事务局才能提出申诉，而不是任何人。</p><p> “一些参议员误解了......指责前进党想要推翻君主制，”该党执行委员会成员阿马拉特·乔克帕米特库尔告诉路透社。</p><p> “我们希望对其进行修改，以维持君主政体与人民之间的良好关系。”</p>

REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo</figcaption></figure><p> As rebellious Wagner forces drove north toward Moscow on June 24, a contingent of military vehicles diverted east on a highway in the direction of a fortified Russian army base that holds nuclear weapons, according to videos posted online and interviews with local residents.</p><p> Once the Wagner fighters reach more rural regions, the surveillance trail goes cold – about 100 km from the nuclear base, Voronezh-45. Reuters could not confirm what happened next, and Western officials have repeatedly said that Russia&#39;s nuclear stockpile was never in danger during the uprising, which ended quickly and mysteriously later that day.</p><p> But in an exclusive interview, Ukraine&#39;s head of military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said that the Wagner fighters went far further. He said that they reached the nuclear base and that their intention was to acquire small Soviet-era nuclear devices in order to &quot;raise the stakes&quot; in their mutiny. &quot;Because if you are prepared to fight until the last man standing, this is one of the facilities that significantly raises the stakes,&quot; Budanov said.</p><p> The only barrier between the Wagner fighters and nuclear weapons, Budanov said, were the doors to the nuclear storage facility. &quot;The doors of the storage were closed and they didn&#39;t get into the technical section,&quot; he said.</p><p> Reuters was not able to independently determine if Wagner fighters made it to Voronezh-45. Budanov did not provide evidence for his assertion and he declined to say what discussions, if any, had taken place with the United States and other allies about the incident. He also didn&#39;t say why the fighters subsequently withdrew.</p><p> A source close to the Kremlin with military ties corroborated parts of Budanov&#39;s account. A Wagner contingent &quot;managed to get into a zone of special interest, as a result of which the Americans got agitated because nuclear munitions are stored there,&quot; this person said, without elaborating further.</p><p> A source in Russian occupied east Ukraine, with knowledge of the matter, said this caused concern in the Kremlin and provided impetus for a hastily negotiated end to the rebellion on the evening of June 24, brokered by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.</p><p> US officials expressed doubts about this account. In response to a query about whether Wagner forces reached the base and sought to acquire nuclear weapons, White House National Security Council spokesman Adam Hodge said, &quot;We are not able to corroborate this report. We had no indication at any point that nuclear weapons or materials were at risk.&quot;</p><p> The Kremlin and Wagner commander Yevgeny Prigozhin did not respond to questions for this article.</p><p> Matt Korda, a Senior Research Associate and Project Manager for the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, said it would be &quot;virtually impossible for a non-state actor&quot; to breach Russian nuclear security. Wagner may have had thousands of troops at its disposal, he said, but it&#39;s unlikely any of them knew how to detonate a bomb.</p><p> &quot;If you had a malicious actor who was able to get their hands on a nuclear weapon, they would find the weapons stored in a state of incomplete assembly,&quot; he said. &quot;They would need to be completed by installing specialised equipment and then unlocking permissive action links, and in order to do that they would need the cooperation of someone from the 12th Directorate&quot; responsible for protecting Russia&#39;s nuclear arsenal.</p><p> Budanov is the first official to suggest Wagner fighters came close to acquiring nuclear weapons and further escalating an armed mutiny that has been widely interpreted as the biggest challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin&#39;s power. US officials have long feared the nightmare possibility that strife in Russia might lead to nuclear devices falling into rogue hands.</p><p> Wagner fighters drove in the direction of Voronezh-45 after peeling away from a larger convoy of heavy weaponry that was advancing along the M4 highway that runs north from Rostov, where the rebellion began. This smaller group headed east, and engaged Russian forces in a firefight at the first village it reached, according to residents and social media posts. But then it appears to have passed without hindrance for 90 km, including driving unchallenged through the centre of a town that houses a military base.</p><p> Reuters followed the group&#39;s progress to the town of Talovaya, about 100 km from the base, which dates back to the Soviet era. It is one of Russia&#39;s 12 &quot;national-level storage facilities&quot; for nuclear weapons, according to a <a href="https://www.unidir.org/sites/default/files/publication/pdfs/lock-them-up-zero-deployed-non-strategic-nuclear-weapons-in-europe-en-675.pdf" target="_blank">report by UN scientists</a> . At Talovaya, Russian forces attacked the column, according to local people who spoke to Reuters. A Russian helicopter was shot down, killing the two crew.</p><p> Reuters interviewed Budanov in his Kyiv office, which Russia targeted with strikes as recently as May. Dressed in military fatigues with a black pistol tucked into his waistband, Budanov spoke in front of a painting that depicts an owl, a symbol of Ukraine&#39;s spy bureau, clutching a bat, symbol of Russia&#39;s military intelligence agency. He said Voronezh-45 houses small nuclear devices that can be carried in a backpack. &quot;This was one of the key storage facilities for these backpacks,&quot; he said, without providing evidence for this assertion. Reuters was unable to establish if the backpack-sized nuclear charges, referred to by Budanov, are kept at Voronezh-45.</p><p> Such small nuclear bombs – light enough to be carried by a single person – are Cold War relics. American troops trained to parachute from planes with nuclear weapons strapped to their bodies and Soviet troops trained to deploy them behind enemy lines on foot. But by the early 1990s, both nations agreed to remove them from their arsenals as tensions eased, and did so, though Russia kept some to mine harbours, said Hans Kristensen, who leads the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, based in Washington.</p><p> Several former US nuclear nonproliferation officials cautioned that it&#39;s difficult to know for sure whether the Russians kept their promise to destroy their backpack-style nuclear weapons. &quot;I don&#39;t believe the Russians still have them, but I wouldn&#39;t bet my life on it,&quot; said David Jonas, former general counsel to the US National Nuclear Security Administration, which tracks atomic weapons and radioactive material worldwide.</p><p> Amy Woolf, a nuclear weapons specialist for US lawmakers at the Library of Congress from 1988 to 2022, raised doubts about the potency of such weapons if they do still exist. &quot;It&#39;s possible there&#39;s still some old crap stuck in storage somewhere,&quot; she said. &quot;But is it operational? Almost certainly not.&quot;</p><p> Jonas, who advised top Pentagon officials on nonproliferation, agreed, noting that such portable weapons need to be maintained and updated, and degrade over time. He said Russia has struggled to maintain its conventional forces, let alone its atomic stockpile.</p><h 1=""> A FALLING OUT</h><p> Wagner was founded by Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin, a former special forces officer in Russia&#39;s GRU military intelligence. Cast as a private army, Wagner enabled Russia to dabble in wars in countries including Syria, Libya and Mali with full deniability. US officials also say Prigozhin&#39;s business operated a social media troll factory that interfered with the 2016 American presidential election. In recent days, Putin confirmed the <a href="http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/71535" target="_blank">Russian state financed Wagner</a> . State television reported that Prigozhin&#39;s operations had received more than 1.7 trillion roubles ($19 billion) from the Russian budget.</p><p> Prigozhin fired the opening salvo of his mutiny on June 23 when he accused the Russian military of launching a missile strike on a Wagner camp in Russian-occupied east Ukraine. Russia denied any such operation.</p><p> At least half a dozen sources inside and outside Russia say the conflict had been brewing for some time and that money and tensions between rival clans lay at its heart. For months, Prigozhin had been openly insulting Putin&#39;s most senior military men, casting Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov as corrupt and incompetent and blaming them for reversals in Russia&#39;s war in Ukraine.</p><p> The insults went unanswered in public for a long time. Then Shoigu hit back. On June 10, he ordered Wagner fighters to sign contracts with his ministry agreeing to become part of the regular army by month&#39;s end. Prigozhin refused. On June 13, Putin publicly sided with Shoigu. The state was moving to cut Wagner&#39;s funding and this, the sources inside and outside Russia told Reuters, was the trigger for the mutiny.</p><p> In the early hours of June 24, Wagner forces arrived in the southern city of Rostov, an important command centre for Russia&#39;s operations in Ukraine. Wagner took charge of the base there and within hours video emerged of Prigozhin chatting with Russian commanders. Around the same time, other contingents of Wagner forces struck out north, heading in the direction of Moscow along the M-4 highway.</p><p> Wagner fighters encountered little resistance.</p><p> Some Russian units that stood in their path or were instructed to intercept them did nothing, according to five sources: a Russian security source, three people close to the Kremlin, and a person close to the Russian-installed leadership in eastern Ukraine. The security source said two Russian military formations around the south-west of the country received orders to resist Wagner but they did not act on the command.</p><p> Some Russian units did nothing because they were taken by surprise and were outgunned, the sources said, while others stood by because they assumed, until Putin went on television at 10:00 am Moscow time to denounce Prigozhin, that Wagner was acting on the Kremlin&#39;s orders. The sources said some officers were reluctant to move against Wagner because they felt solidarity with the private army and shared Prigozhin&#39;s disillusionment with the way the Defence Ministry top brass was running the war.</p><p> At the Bugayevka crossing between Ukraine and Russia, images posted by a Wagner-affiliated Telegram channel on the morning of June 24 showed dozens of Russian troops standing in line, unarmed. The caption said they had laid down their weapons.</p><p> Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary of Ukraine&#39;s National Security and Defence Council, told Reuters that many in the Russian military sided with Prigozhin. &quot;There are so many commanders who sympathise with Wagner and don&#39;t want to follow Putin,&quot; he said, adding that he knew of 14 Russian generals who supported Prigozhin. Reuters was not able to independently verify his account about the generals.</p><p> One branch of the Wagner force headed north along the M-4 highway, in the direction of Moscow. Their route took them right past Boguchar, a garrison town where a Russian unit is stationed. Three local residents who spoke to Reuters said that the military there did nothing to resist, and that a significant number of people in the town, including people serving in the military, felt sympathy with the Wagner force.</p><p> One woman said of Prigozhin: &quot;Who else should we support? At least there&#39;s one dignified person who was not frightened.&quot; Another female resident also said Wagner had widespread support in the town, and that many Wagner fighters are from Boguchar. &quot;They&#39;re all friends,&quot; she said.</p><h 1=""> A NUCLEAR DETOUR</h><p> As the main Wagner column advanced northwards towards Moscow, a group of military vehicles, and some civilian pickups and vans, turned eastwards. The moment is captured on a video posted on a Voronezh region news site. Reuters geo-located the video to a junction near the town of Pavlovsk. The breakaway contingent rumbled through villages and along a road that cut through patches of forest and flat farmland, skirting gulleys carved out by tributaries of the Don River.</p><p> A video posted on a local online bulletin board shows a field in the dawn light near the village of Elizavetovka on June 24. In the distance there is an explosion and gunfire, and panicked cries from a male voice: &quot;Has a war started?&quot;</p><p> Then a fresh round of automatic gunfire, closer this time.</p><p> Reuters spoke to the man&#39;s neighbour, who said the Russian military had attacked the Wagner force. At 08:24 am, a user on the same online bulletin board, Anna Sandrakova, wrote: &quot;Shells are flying, low-flying helicopters, we could hear explosions, automatic gunfire.&quot; Maxim Yantsov, the local government chief for Pavlovsk district, wrote on his Telegram channel that 19 households were damaged as a result of shooting around Elizavetovka.</p><p> A few hours later, the convoy passed through another village, Vorontsovka, still moving in the direction of the nuclear facility. Two videos posted to Telegram show more than a dozen vehicles, including armoured personnel carriers, tanks and trucks mounted with machine guns or carrying artillery.</p><p> Next on the route, the convoy reached Buturlinovka, according to posts on the town&#39;s online bulletin board and a video that Reuters identified as being recorded in the town. Buturlinovka, closer still to the nuclear facility, is the location of a military air base.</p><p> By Saturday evening, users on a VKontakte online forum started reporting the presence of a military column at the town of Talovaya, 110 km from the military base. A video shared by a local resident with Reuters shows a column of military vehicles moving through the outskirts of the town. A second video, provided by another resident, showed at least 75 vehicles in a convoy on the edge of the town, including 5 armoured personnel carriers, two ambulances, and an artillery gun towed behind a truck. A third resident said local people offered food and water to the Wagner troops. The situation was calm, he said, until a Russian helicopter fired at the column. It fired back and the helicopter fell to the ground, followed by explosions and a cloud of smoke.</p><p> Russian state media later broadcast video of a wooden cross erected at the site in Talovaya district where the helicopter, a Ka-52 attack aircraft, crashed. Pskov region governor Mikhail Vedernikov said the two crewmen who were killed were stationed at a military base in his region, in north-west Russia. &quot;True to their oath, they did everything to protect our country,&quot; he said in a video address posted on his Telegram channel.</p><p> Reuters couldn&#39;t determine what the column did next. A resident of Talovaya said that as far as he was aware, it did not move any further and the following day – after the truce was announced – the column turned around and went back the way it came.</p><p> Budanov said in his interview that an unspecified number of fighters did in fact press on to Voronezh-45 with the intention of seizing portable, Soviet-era nuclear weapons stored at the facility.</p><p> The nuclear facility at Voronezh-45 is operated and guarded by military unit no. 14254, part of the defence ministry&#39;s 12th Main Directorate responsible for protecting Russia&#39;s arsenal of nuclear weapons, according to the Russian Defence Ministry&#39;s website and publicly available records. What is stored there is a closely guarded secret. Russia does not publicly acknowledge even keeping nuclear weapons there; that information has emerged from the reports of foreign scientists.</p><p> Reuters was unable to establish if the backpack-sized nuclear charges referred to by Budanov are kept at the facility. But there is evidence that such devices were developed by the Soviet Union. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/volume-147/issue-174/senate-section/article/S13280-1?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Alexei+Yablokov%22%5D%7D&amp;s=8&amp;r=1" target="_blank">In testimony</a> to the US Congress, in 1997 Alexei Yablokov, a former Russian presidential science advisor, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/russia/suitcase/yablokov.html" target="_blank">said Soviet scientists</a> in the 1970s created suitcase-sized nuclear munitions for use by secret agents.</p><p> Kristensen, the Federation of American Scientists researcher who said that Russia and the United States discarded thousands of suitcase-sized nukes in the 1990s, said that he doubts any remain stored Voronezh-45. He said he believes – but cannot be certain – that other nuclear weapons are stored at Voronezh-45, which satellite images show to be well-maintained.</p><p> Given the 12th Main Directorate&#39;s control over the facility, the movement of weapons would take time and likely be detected by US satellites, he added.</p><p> Further north, there is evidence that the Russian military undertook drastic measures to block off another potential access route to Voronezh-45. The E-38 road branches off the M-4 highway at a settlement called Rogachevka. This road also leads to Voronezh-45. On the evening of June 24, local residents reported hearing explosions. A video posted on a Telegram channel captured the sound of an aircraft followed by an explosion. A motorist driving along the E-38 posted a video that shows the road covered in debris near a bridge over the river Bityug. In one lane is a deep crater.</p><h 1=""> A DEAL IS STRUCK</h><p> On the evening of June 24 there was an unexpected announcement by Belarusian state media. The country&#39;s president, Alexsandr Lukashenko, had negotiated Prigozhin&#39;s agreement to halt his forces&#39; advances. Prigozhin said in an audio message that his forces had come within 125 miles of Moscow and were &quot;turning around&quot; to head back to their training camps. Under the deal, Russia would not prosecute the rebels and Wagner fighters would either withdraw to Belarus or join Russia&#39;s regular army.</p><p> A European intelligence source said Prigozhin was persuaded to abandon his revolt after realising he didn&#39;t have sufficient support amongst the military.</p><p> Prigozhin&#39;s whereabouts and future plans are unclear.</p><p> Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that Putin held talks with the Wagner leader on June 29 and &quot;gave his assessment of the events&quot; of June 24.</p><p> One of Prigozhin&#39;s private jets has made multiple trips between Belarus and Russia in the days since the rebellion, according to flight tracking data.</p><p> When Belarusian president Lukashenko hosted a group of journalists in Minsk on July 6, he said Wagner&#39;s fighters had yet to arrive at their new Belarusian base. &quot;As for Yevgeny Prigozhin, he&#39;s in St Petersburg. Or perhaps this morning he flew to Moscow. Or perhaps he&#39;s somewhere else. But he&#39;s not in Belarus,&quot; Lukashenko said.</p><p> (Reporting by Mari Saito and Tom Balmforth in Kyiv, John Shiffman and Phil Stewart in Washington, Polina Nikolskaya in London, Maria Tsvetkova in New York, Anton Zverev, Christian Lowe in Paris, David Gauthier-Villars in Istanbul, Stephen Grey, Reade Levinson and Eleanor Whalley in London, Milan Pavicic and Daria Shamonova in Gdansk; edited by Janet McBride)</p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 10 Jul 2023 18:30:02 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/wagner-fighters-neared-russian-nuclear-base-during-revolt-2023-07-10/</guid><link/> https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/wagner-fighters-neared-russian-nuclear-base-during-revolt-2023-07-10/<author><![CDATA[Reuters]]></author><category> UKRAINE</category><category>危机/俄罗斯</category><category>WAGNER (EXCLUSIVE, PIX, TV, GRAPHIC) </category></item><item><title><![CDATA[Foxconn dumps $19.5 bln Vedanta chip plan in blow to India]]></title><description><![CDATA[Summary:<ul><li> Modi wants India to become a semiconductor making hub</li><li> Foxconn pulls out of a key project planned with Vedanta</li><li> Foxconn says mutually reached decision with Vedanta</li><li> Decision seen as a setback to PM Modi&#39;s ambitions </li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/AZNHmMvKZKgIHZ7nH4odEl80qSw=/1920x0/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/6KUM4NIXEJOGTCBRCJXPDYRN3Y.jpg" alt="一名妇女走过新台北市一家公司大楼外的富士康标志" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>文件照片-2022 年 12 月 22 日，台湾新北市，一名妇女走过富士康公司大楼外的标志。路透社/Annabelle Chih/文件照片</figcaption></figure><p>Taiwan&#39;s Foxconn has withdrawn from a $19.5 billion semiconductor joint venture with Indian metals-to-oil conglomerate Vedanta, it said on Monday, in a setback to Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#39;s chipmaking plans for India.</p><p> The world&#39;s largest contract electronics maker signed a pact with Vedanta <a href="https://reut.rs/3XQDHzu" target="_blank">last year</a> to set up semiconductor and display production plants in Modi&#39;s home state of Gujarat.</p><p> &quot;Foxconn <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/2354.TW" target="_blank">(2354.TW)</a> has determined it will not move forward on the joint venture with Vedanta,&quot; a Foxconn statement said without elaborating on the reasons.</p><p> The company said it had worked with Vedanta for more than a year to bring &quot;a great semiconductor idea to reality&quot;, but they had mutually decided to end the joint venture and it will remove its name from an entity that is now fully owned by Vedanta.</p><p> Vedanta said it is fully committed to its semiconductor project and had &quot;lined up other partners to set up India&#39;s first foundry&quot;. &quot;Vedanta has redoubled its efforts&quot; to fulfil Modi&#39;s vision, it added in a statement.</p><p> A source familiar with the matter said concerns about incentive approval delays by India&#39;s government had contributed to Foxconn&#39;s decision to pull out of the venture. New Delhi had also raised several questions on the cost estimates provided to request incentives from the government, the source added.</p><p> Modi has made chipmaking a top priority for India&#39;s economic strategy in pursuit of a &quot;new era&quot; in electronics manufacturing and Foxconn&#39;s move represents a blow to his ambitions of luring foreign investors to make chips locally for the first time.</p><p> “This deal falling through is definitely a setback for the &#39;Make in India&#39; push,” said Neil Shah, Vice President of research at Counterpoint, adding that it also does not reflect well on Vedanta and &quot;raises eyebrows and doubts for other companies&quot;.</p><p> Deputy IT minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar said Foxconn&#39;s decision had &quot;no impact&quot; on India&#39;s plans, adding that both companies were &quot;valued investors&quot; in the country.</p><p> He said it was not for the government to &quot;get into why or how two private companies choose to partner or choose not to&quot;.</p><h 1=""> &#39;IMPORTANT STEP&#39;</h><p> Foxconn is best known for assembling iPhones and other Apple <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AAPL.O" target="_blank">(AAPL.O)</a> products but in recent years it has been expanding into chips to diversify its business.</p><p> Most of the world&#39;s chip output is limited to a few countries, such as Taiwan, with India a late entrant. The Vedanta-Foxconn venture announced its chipmaking plans in Gujarat last September, with Modi calling the project &quot;an important step&quot; in boosting India&#39;s chipmaking ambitions.</p><p> But his plan had been slow to take off. Among other problems encountered by the Vedanta-Foxconn project were deadlocked talks to involve European chipmaker STMicroelectronics <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/STMPA.PA" target="_blank">(STMPA.PA)</a> as a tech partner, Reuters has previously <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-chip-plan-stalls-after-tower-intel-deal-setback-modi-2023-05-31/">reported</a> .</p><p> While Vedanta-Foxconn managed to get STMicro on board for licensing technology, India&#39;s government had made clear it wanted the European company to have more &quot;skin in the game&quot;, such as a stake in the partnership.</p><p> STMicro was not keen on that and the talks remained in limbo, a source has said.</p><p> The Indian government has said it remains confident of attracting investors for chipmaking. Micron last month said it will invest up to $825 million in a chip testing and packaging unit, not for manufacturing. With support from India&#39;s federal government and the state of Gujarat, the total investment will be $2.75 billion.</p><p> India, which expects its semiconductor market to be worth $63 billion by 2026, last year received three applications to set up plants under a $10 billion incentive scheme.</p><p> These were from the Vedanta-Foxconn joint venture, Singapore-based IGSS Ventures and global consortium ISMC, which counts Tower Semiconductor <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TSEM.TA" target="_blank">(TSEM.TA)</a> as a tech partner.</p><p> The $3 billion ISMC project has stalled, too, owing to Tower being acquired by Intel, while another $3 billion plan by IGSS was also halted because it wanted to re-submit its application.</p><p> India has re-invited applications for the incentive scheme from companies.</p> <span>Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru, Ben Blanchard in Taipei, Aditya Kalra in New Delhi; Additional reporting by Rishika Sadam; Editing by David Goodman and Alexander Smith</span> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 10 Jul 2023 14:07:46 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.reuters.com/technology/foxconn-pulls-out-india-chip-jv-with-vedanta-2023-07-10/</guid><link/> https://www.reuters.com/technology/foxconn-pulls-out-india-chip-jv-with-vedanta-2023-07-10/<author><![CDATA[Ben Blanchard, Munsif Vengattil, Aditya Kalra]]></author><category>鸿海</category><category>VEDANTA/CHIPS (UPDATE 5, PIX) </category></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ex-USA Gymnastics doctor Nassar stabbed in prison, stable -AP]]></title><description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/sfwYr3CLDtcHWEmghnvDdhHqGgc=/1920x0/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/7762MQFRKZO3ZCXEL46ZIRJMCY.jpg" alt="前美国体操队队医拉里·纳萨尔 (Larry Nassar) 在夏洛特伊顿县法院的量刑听证会上出庭，他于 2017 年 11 月承认性侵犯指控" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Larry Nassar, a former team USA Gymnastics doctor who pleaded guilty in November 2017 to sexual assault charges, stands in court during his sentencing hearing in the Eaton County Court in Charlotte, Michigan, US, February 5, 2018.

The part one is the effort to get out of the import business.&quot;</p><p> India announced significant purchases of US defence equipment during Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#39;s state visit to Washington last month, including an over one billion dollar order for GE <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/GE.N" target="_blank">(GE.N)</a> engines for fighter jets. A possible $3 billion deal for MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones is also being discussed.</p><p> In line with New Delhi&#39;s desire for self-reliance in defence and Modi&#39;s flagship &quot;Make in India&quot; policy, the jet engine deal includes joint manufacturing in the future, while the assembly and maintenance of the SeaGuardians will likely be in India.</p><p> Eric Garcetti, the US ambassador to India, said Washington had earlier paid &quot;lip service&quot; but was now easing India&#39;s access to military technologies. He said the US was &quot;leaning in with technology&quot; sharing more with India than it had with some its closest allies.</p><p> However, the moves so far will not be sufficient to end New Delhi&#39;s reliance on Russia while stringent US rules governing the sharing of military technology limit future possibilities for now.</p><p> &quot;Nobody gives you everything. They keep you at least a screwdriver away from having it fully,&quot; said a second senior official from India&#39;s defence ministry, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p> Arzan Tarapore, an Indian security expert at Stanford University, said the deals announced during Modi&#39;s visit &quot;do not in themselves represent an Indian shift away from Russia.&quot;</p><p> &quot;A big shift away from Russia will take multiple decades,&quot; he said.</p><h 1=""> GAP WITH CHINA</h><p> India still uses mostly Russian technology for traditional arms. Tarapore said that the biggest potential for US-India collaboration should be on new systems that India doesn&#39;t already have.</p><p> India&#39;s main aim is to narrow the technological gap with better-armed arch-rival China, with which it has a tense relationship, and which is also closely allied with traditional foe Pakistan.</p><p> One problem for India is that Russia&#39;s war in Ukraine has severely dented Moscow&#39;s ability to deliver weapons and equipment.</p><p> India&#39;s air force recently informed a parliamentary panel that Russia would delay deliveries of spares for Sukhoi Su-30 MKI and MiG-29 jet fighter planes. A big-ticket item, believed to be the remaining two of the five Russian <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/russia-cannot-meet-arms-delivery-commitments-because-war-indian-air-force-says-2023-03-23/">S-400 air defence systems</a> India bought for nearly $5.5 billion in 2018, has also been delayed, it said.</p><p> India has also been expecting to receive two nuclear-powered attack submarines from Russia over the next few years, but these might also be delayed, defence officials said.</p><p> Such problems have reinforced India&#39;s resolve to become less dependent on Russia, but it does not want to rely on any one nation for its weapons purchases, they said.</p><p> It is buying French fighter jets, Israeli drones, American jet engines and potentially German submarines. Over time these purchases will reduce the share of Russian military technology used by India, but this would take at least two decades, Indian officials said.</p><h 1=""> LEAST LIMITATIONS</h><p> Bill Greenwalt, a former senior Pentagon official for industrial policy, said the days of US and Russian domination of the global defence market and being able to control defence technology was coming to end, but what would replace it was &quot;still a work in progress.&quot;</p><p> He said India could become frustrated by the strict US export control system for armaments and the restrictions it places both on technology sharing and its ability to develop systems it acquires.</p><p> &quot;I expect India will pursue cooperation with the West with those countries that can transfer technology ... with the least amount of limitations on their use,&quot; he said.</p><p> Exports to India must satisfy stringent US International Trafficking in Arms (ITAR) regulations and the two countries are not treaty allies - which for instance means the level of technology sharing provided under the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-get-us-nuclear-submarine-technology-china-looms-large-2021-09-15/">AUKUS deal to supply Australia with nuclear-powered submarines</a> is not on the cards.</p><p> Even so, Modi&#39;s US visit has been hailed by both sides as bringing the relationship to a new level. Besides the defence deals, the two countries also signed agreements on chips, space, artificial intelligence and critical minerals.</p><p> India is also a member of the QUAD alliance with the US, Japan and Australia, which deepens its ties with the West, but does not replace its decades-old relationship with Russia.</p><p> Derek Grossman, a Rand Corporation defence analyst, said the US would always be cautious in what military hardware and technology it shares with India because of this.</p><p> Even if India can transition away from Moscow over the next few decades, Grossman said, &quot;the US will still have suspicions about how their systems are being used and how that might help the Russians in some sort of way, because of that close India-Russia partnership.&quot;</p><p> &quot;India is going to be opportunistic in this situation and accept whatever the US is willing to offer. But I don&#39;t think they are willing to give up what they have with Russia.&quot;</p> <span>Reporting by Krishn Kaushik in NEW DELHI, David Brunnstrom in WASHINGTON, Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan</span> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 10 Jul 2023 06:20:41 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.reuters.com/world/us-military-deals-not-enough-wean-india-off-russian-arms-yet-2023-07-10/</guid><link/> https://www.reuters.com/world/us-military-deals-not-enough-wean-india-off-russian-arms-yet-2023-07-10/<author><![CDATA[Krishn Kaushik, David Brunnstrom]]></author><category> INDIA</category><category> USA/RUSSIA (ANALYSIS, PIX)</category></item></channel></rss>
