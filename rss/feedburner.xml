预见到技术将导致“对传统有血有肉的专业人士的需求稳步下降”，而最近，CB Insights 表示“结构性破坏正在冲击管理咨询”。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a>更早之前，克莱顿·克里斯滕森 (Clayton Christensen) 及其同事警告说：“虽然我们无法预测咨询行业颠覆的确切进展，但我们可以非常有信心地说，无论其速度如何，一些现任者都会措手不及。” <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2个</a></p><p>但事情并没有像预期的那样发展。在咨询和法律领域，成熟的公司一如既往地具有影响力和盈利能力。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a>许多潜在的破坏者已经出现。有些失败了，有些获得了强大的利基地位，但没有人挑战——更不用说推翻——现有秩序了。大多数老牌领导者都使用了广泛的战略和策略来快速适应威胁。</p><p></p><p>与许多成熟行业的情况一样，专业服务市场由一小部分可清楚识别的顶端群体和大量在其影子下运营的低端公司主导。咨询的巨头包括麦肯锡、波士顿咨询集团和贝恩；科技公司 Accenture 和 Capgemini；以及四大会计师事务所安永、德勤、毕马威和普华永道。在法律领域，顶级律师事务所包括五家总部位于伦敦的律师事务所，非正式地称为“魔圈”——年利达律师事务所、高伟绅律师事务所、富而德律师事务所、安理国际律师事务所和斯劳特梅律师事务所——以及凯易律师事务所、瑞生律师事务所和欧华律师事务所。</p><p>这些公司为何如此有弹性？我们的研究包括对 25

href="#ref5">5个</a></p><h3>需求方和供应方的威胁</h3><p>根据我们的研究，我们将人工智能技术确定为最大的供应方风险，威胁要接管专业人士传统上视为自己的工作。在需求方面，威胁来自客户寻求更好地控制他们购买和使用专业服务的方式。还有其他潜在的颠覆者同时从供需双方挑战现有企业。与此同时，新的精品和专业公司已经出现，以满足利润丰厚的业务领域的特定客户需求，尽管它们很少真正具有颠覆性。下面，我们将详细介绍每个潜在威胁。</p><p><strong>人工智能破坏了商业模式。</strong> 2022 年 11 月推出的生成式 AI 加速了专业服务工作许多方面的持续转型，从而提高了准确性并显着节省了成本。</p><p>在律师事务所，人工智能工具扫描法律文件并审查合同。基于人工智能的服务公司，如 Kira Systems、Clio、Reveal-Brainspace、iManage 和汤森路透，在发现、尽职调查以及合同管理和审查方面提供帮助。 97% 的大型律师事务所使用汤森路透的服务。</p><p>这些公司并不将自己定位为律师事务所的竞争对手，但随着它们规模的扩大和技术能力的增强，它们可能会开始破坏这些公司的商业模式。例如，Clio 的法律软件可以对索赔进行电子发现，甚至可以通过扫描先例案例进行诉讼分析，从而有可能减少公司可以向客户收取的计费小时数。</p><p>在咨询中，人工智能可以帮助专业服务公司发现新的关系、识别客户行为模式并突出节省成本的机会，从而提供额外的价值。 “与一个比其他任何人都更了解这个行业的团队一起出现已经不够好了，”一位四大咨询合伙人说。 “你还需要一个数据集或算法来提供额外的价值来源。”</p><p>但人工智能也可以成为强大的破坏者。 Palantir Technologies 开始使用 AI 来检测欺诈，后来扩展到应用最先进的机器学习来解决各种政府和私人客户的问题。它支持政府监督的工作引起了争议，但其预测分析帮助一家大型汽车供应商在其工程和制造职能方面取得了巨大的效率提升。这样的结果代表了咨询公司可以提供的洞察力的严谨性和质量的重大进步。</p><p>老牌公司已经通过收购和内部开发建立自己的人工智能能力来应对威胁。自 2013 年以来，麦肯锡收购了 12 家主要是小型人工智能公司，其中包括总部位于英国的 QuantumBlack，该公司使用先进的数据分析来提高组织绩效。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a>在法律方面，总部位于旧金山的 DLA Piper 开发了 Aiscension，这是一种监控合规风险的人工智能产品。保险律师事务所 Kennedys 创建了 Kennedys IQ 衍生产品，它使用人工智能来评估医学证据并建议赔偿金额。</p><p>这些收购和合作伙伴关系提供的不仅仅是新功能；他们可以扩大他们的公司可以为客户处理的问题的范围。</p><p>现任者也在加强他们作为高接触可信顾问的作用，这是人工智能无法复制的。几家大型咨询公司通过投资体验中心扩大了他们的产品范围——客户和顾问在物理和虚拟环境中使用设计思维和其他创造性技术来设想可能的未来。在过去五年中，IBM、德勤、埃森哲和其他公司收购了 200 多家创意机构来帮助开发这些中心。</p><p><strong>客户控制：拆分服务。</strong>最深远的需求方威胁是分拆，因为越来越精明的客户正在寻找降低成本的方法，并对他们与服务公司的关系施加更大的影响。这可能意味着回收以前由外部公司处理的活动或求助于专家而不是大型专业公司的广泛服务。这两种选择都可以帮助客户建立内部能力，并对业务成果承担更大的责任。但分拆威胁到现有公司的杠杆模式，因为它剥夺了通常分配给许多初级和低薪通才的工作。</p><p>在法律上，替代法律服务提供商 (ALSP) 的出现证明了这种需求方威胁。 ALSP 本身并不是律师事务所，但它们以较低的成本提供广泛的法律服务，例如文件审查或合同管理。 2017 年，位于弗吉尼亚州的 IT 服务公司 DXC Technology 将其几乎全部法律职能外包给了位于堪萨斯州欧弗兰帕克的 ALSP UnitedLex。 DXC 将 150 名内部律师转移到 UnitedLex，只保留了少数高级专业人员。虽然外包内部法律部门并不少见，但律师事务所认为这是一个巨大的威胁，因为这是当时同类交易中最大的交易，而且它涉及 ALSP，可以提供更低的成本结构。</p><p>咨询网络的兴起（例如总部位于伦敦的 Eden McCallum）和在线平台（例如总部位于纽约的 Gerson Lehrman Group）也面临着类似的挑战。这些公司在逐个项目的基础上为客户匹配顾问，绕过大公司。总部位于伦敦的 Kubrick Group 与公司签订合同，提供数据科学家和技术专家团队，客户稍后可以聘用他们。</p><p>这种安排让客户有责任定义其问题并整合工作团队——传统上由大型咨询公司处理的事情。但是除了最大和最复杂的项目外，它们消除了雇用大公司的需要。如果没有现任者更高的管理费用，费用就会低得多。</p><p>客户也在改变商业安排，越来越多地要求基于结果的交易，要求顾问证明他们对预期结果直接负责，例如成本降低 5%。因为对于涉及顾问影响之外的因素（例如收入增长）的项目，这可能更难做到，所以大多数公司只有在他们有信心为预期结果做出贡献时才会同意基于结果的交易。</p><p>现有公司正在以多种方式应对这些需求方的挑战。律师事务所已经成立了自己的 ALSP；总部位于伦敦的 Allen &amp; Overy 于 2013 年创建了 Peerpoint，这是一个独立的业务，拥有 350 名主要是自由职业的律师和 5300 万英镑（6400 万美元）的收入。在咨询方面，德勤创建了一个名为 Pixel 的部门，将客户问题分解成各个组成部分，然后使用众包平台寻找合适的专家来处理每个部分。</p><p>大公司也在加倍发挥其传统优势：解决客户最大和最具挑战性的问题。他们的价值来自他们在高影响、大规模、高风险情况下提供建议和合规的能力，并且他们可以为服务收取额外费用。 “我们做的是心脏直视手术，而不是提供 [全科医生] 服务，”一位资深律师说。</p><p><strong>精品店和专家在市场关注中找到优势。</strong>随着前顶级合作伙伴建立自己的精品店或风险投资公司支持新的创业公司，专业服务领域不断出现新的竞争对手。成功的公司在特定的利基市场占据了市场份额，但很少引起顶级公司的关注。它们对需求或供应方造成的干扰有限，它们只是反映了市场的异质性和复杂性。</p><p>在咨询方面，总部位于伦敦的 Baringa 通过专注于能源行业、确定可再生能源等热门话题并聘请使用情景建模来预测未来能源价格的专家，实现了快速发展。总部位于纽约的 AlixPartners 专注于扭亏为盈、诉讼支持和转型。两家公司都有 1,000 多名员工。法律行业见证了专家的快速成长，例如美国的 Caldwell Intellectual Property Law 和英国和新加坡的争议专家 Mishcon de Reya。这些公司的成功表明，深厚的专业知识可以如何创造一个可以抵御基础广泛的竞争对手的可防御的利基市场。</p><p>大公司并不将这些小企业视为直接威胁，而且常常完全忽视它们。 “他们不在我们与 C-suite 的工作中，”伦敦一家大型律师事务所的合伙人说。尽管如此，它们仍可以帮助现任者保持警惕。</p><p>其一，它们为不断变化的市场提供了一个窗口，通常会促使老牌公司进入它们原本可能被忽视的业务领域。例如，德勤针对专业精品公司的出现推出了数字业务。贝恩创建并剥离了 The Bridgespan Group，以专注于非营利组织。</p><p>专业公司还可以暴露顶级公司工作方式中需要注意的弱点。例如，专注于电信、媒体和技术领域的全球最大战略咨询公司 Altman Solon 之所以引起最高管理层的关注，很大程度上是因为整个公司由在这些领域具有深厚专业知识的专家组成，这与许多填补初级职位的大公司不同有很多聪明的多面手。因此，它已经跟上了其运营所在行业的步伐，因此能够更好地快速制定客户特定的战略。</p><p><strong>潜在的破坏者会带来供需双方的风险。</strong>现任者的噩梦场景是同时影响供需双方的中断。这最终就是杀死柯达和宝丽来的原因：数字技术改变了图像的创建方式和消费方式，让现任者没有任何价值可以依靠。摄影行业的幸存者，如富士和佳能，是通过进入邻近市场而不是留下来战斗来做到这一点的。</p><p>这些挑战者已经出现在专业服务领域，但到目前为止，他们还没有成为颠覆者。例如，成立于 2013 年的 HourlyNerd 雄心勃勃，希望成为连接技术客户与自由顾问的市场，以比典型采购流程更快的速度为客户提供更广泛的顾问选择。 “我们喜欢将自己视为可能聘请咨询公司的替代者，”其中一位联合创始人说。 <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p> Axiom Law 成立于 2000 年，致力于通过员工和合作伙伴网络提供随需应变的法律人才，从而更有效地提供法律服务。 “Axiom 有机会颠覆一个世纪以来未发生实质性变化的行业，”一位投资者表示。 <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8个</a></p><p>两家公司都做得不错。 HourlyNerd 于 2016 年更名为 Catalant，转向软件即服务模式，如今拥有数百名员工。 Axiom 是一家中型律师事务所，拥有约 1,600 名员工，年收入为 8.425 亿美元，其商业模式比大多数竞争对手都更加灵活。 <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a>但两者都没有达到它所期望的破坏性效果。</p><p></p><h3>地平线上的破坏性威胁</h3><p>那么，是什么迫在眉睫的干扰让管理咨询和律师事务所的高管们夜不能寐？</p><p>我们采访的高级专业人士指出的一个因素是人工智能和分析能力的显着加速。在法律中，编纂——捕捉经验丰富的合作伙伴的法律推理并将其转化为可以应用于未来案件的算法的过程——可能会消除专业人士现在所做的大部分认知工作。 “那将是破坏性的，”伦敦一家大型公司的合伙人说。</p><p>其他一些人表示，近期最大的威胁很可能来自科技巨头：尤其是谷歌、亚马逊、微软和 Salesforce。每个人都建立了面向客户的能力，其中一些来自大型咨询公司，以增强他们销售针对客户技术挑战的解决方案的实力。</p><p>凭借其人工智能能力和全球影响力，它们可能会影响专业公司业务的供需双方。例如，Amazon Web Services 利用其掌握的大量数据，可以利用其对客户行为的独特洞察力为零售客户提供在线购物趋势预测。</p><p> “Amazon Web Services 的最大影响不在于其作为云服务供应商的地位，而在于其关于消费者购买行为的信息的非凡规模和深度，这是任何传统咨询公司都无法与之竞争的，”他说一家大型咨询公司的合伙人。</p><p>其他人淡化了威胁。 “像谷歌这样的公司实际上并不擅长客户服务，”一位受访者说。虽然一家科技公司有可能收购一家大型咨询公司，但这将代表与咨询公司发展合作伙伴关系的典型方法的重大战略转变，并将减少未来可以合作的公司数量。</p><h3>保持敏捷</h3><p>大型专业服务公司并没有仅仅因为他们采取的行动就避免了颠覆。更重要的是他们对商业环境变化的警惕性和反应能力。虽然咨询公司和律师事务所的高管经常贬低他们看似过时的工作方式，但事实证明，他们的专业合作模式非常有弹性。</p><p>从我们的访谈中，我们确定了三个值得强调的成功要素，它们也可能适用于其他行业。</p><p><strong>创新努力致力于解决客户问题。</strong>这与许多其他企业形成鲜明对比，在这些企业中，创新活动是与组织面向客户的部分分开进行的。最好的专业服务公司会根据他们在客户业务中发现的共同限制、摩擦和机会来追求产品和服务创新。然后，他们与选定的客户和合作伙伴组织（例如技术提供商）一起开发、测试和改进这些创新，然后再将它们推广到他们的客户组合中。</p><p><strong>合伙人及其后辈与客户密切合作。</strong>这些公司的学徒制模式意味着感觉-反应差距——感知客户需求然后采取适当行动解决这些需求之间的差异——比领导者与从事工作的人相差很远的公司要小。</p><p><strong>公司对投资新活动持谨慎态度。</strong>虽然这在瞬息万变的世界中似乎是一个弱点，但事实是，大多数新兴技术都需要很长时间才能发挥其潜力，而且许多公司都因行动过快而失败。由于其工作基于项目的性质，专业公司能够测试新技术，了解哪些有效，然后根据项目成功和客户需求向前推进。</p><h3>保持领先于中断</h3><p>专业服务公司在抵御潜在破坏方面的经验表明，其他行业的公司可以采取四种行动来准备和应对变化。</p><p><strong>诊断威胁。</strong>虽然每一个新的竞争对手或技术都可以被视为潜在的威胁，但有必要评估风险的大小以及它可能影响的业务部分。我们研究的咨询公司和律师事务所在分离需求和供应方面的影响方面大多非常周到。 （有关如何应用此逻辑，请参阅“诊断破坏性威胁的性质”。）</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>诊断破坏性威胁的性质</h4><p class="caption">考虑您所在行业的新兴技术或新竞争对手，并回答以下问题以确定破坏性威胁的性质。</p><p class="print

“我们希望保持整体关系，专注于优质工作领域，”伦敦一家大型律师事务所的合伙人表示。 “争论的焦点是我们留了多少……给其他律师事务所，我们保留了多少，并通过第三方或替代交付模式做了多少。”</p><p><strong>平衡实用主义与健康的偏执狂。</strong>我们在采访中与之交谈的法律和咨询合作伙伴真的被撕裂了。一方面，他们几乎没有看到任何证据表明他们的强势地位受到威胁，他们一致认为十年前关于颠覆的可怕预测是没有根据的。另一方面，他们不想表现得沾沾自喜，当然也不想向下级同事传达未来没有中断风险的信息。高管们必须学会接受双重心态：务实地承认基本面是好的，同时偏执地怀疑新兴技术或新竞争对手。毕竟，克里斯滕森和他的同事们认为，那些可能会措手不及的现任者最有可能被颠覆。</p><p></p>

12%，或者病毒可以扰乱商品、零部件和人才的全球流动时，一家公司在面对不断发展的事件时快速适应的能力对其生存和繁荣至关重要。</p><p>业务弹性是一种动态属性，可通过企业价值在不断变化的环境中的稳定性和持久性进行回顾性衡量。实时性体现在企业对业务环境的即时变化和渐进变化的及时适应。</p><p>我们的工作采用了企业的复杂适应性系统视图，表明弹性源自三种基本的适应能力：感知和监控，以识别商业环境中出现的新变化；业务模型组合开发，以构建和测试跨运营环境的能力；和基础能力建设，以长寿驱动增长，避免企业停滞。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a>此外，这些能力中的每一项都取决于<em>风险情报</em>能力的发展。</p><p></p><p>我们将风险情报定义为严格解释风险及其给公司带来的后果或机会的磨练能力。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a>它使领导者能够看穿环境的复杂性，并系统地识别、分类和解释风险。这使他们能够超越已知的风险因素，有意识地探索未知的风险，从而拥抱而不是避免不确定性。重要的是，风险情报让人们认识到，个别风险或它们表现出来的形式远不及它们对公司价值交换系统的共同后果——即管理、识别、创造、传达、交付、获取、保护和维持价值。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a>最后，它为领导者提供了风险的网络视图，不仅阐明了风险的直接后果，还阐明了风险在公司价值交换系统中级联的方式，从而能够更有效地分配风险缓解资源。在本文中，我们将风险情报分解为可操作的元素，领导者可以追求这些元素，以帮助长期加强他们的组织。</p><h3>识别、分类和解释风险事件</h3><p>领导者无法准确预测特定的风险事件，也无法让公司为所有风险做好准备。然而，他们可以系统地识别、分类和解释风险事件，揭示看似不同的事件可能产生相似的后果。</p><p>第一步是研究每个业务价值函数，并确定可能对其有效性产生影响的似是而非的风险事件。为了帮助完成这一过程，我们构建了一个与行业无关的清单，将我们的研究中确定的与个体价值交换系统组件相关的 99 个主要风险类别分为三层。 （请参阅“价值函数风险清单”。）虽然不可避免地并不详尽，但该资源可作为识别任何企业面临的潜在风险的可靠起点。 </p><div class="callout-highlight callout-highlight--transparent callout--expand-column" id="fig1"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>价值函数风险清单</h4><p class="caption">这份源自标准普尔 500 指数 20 年数据的风险清单显示了公司价值交换系统（绿色节点）的功能如何与业务功能及其各自的风险类别相关联。 </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MAG_FE_Sheth_fig1.png" alt="价值函数风险清单"/></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p>接下来，领导者应该根据风险事件的影响<em>范围</em>、它们引起的变化的<em>持久性</em>以及事件发生的<em>频率</em>来描述和分组风险事件。 （参见“风险特征”。）领导者随后可以解释每组风险事件与公司价值交换系统组成部分之间的联系。</p><div class="callout-highlight" id="fig2"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>表征风险</h4><p class="caption">每一种风险都可以根据其影响的广泛程度、它引起的变化可能持续多长时间以及它发生的频率来描述。例如，大雪事件具有行业内范围、诱发临时变化、发生频率低等特点。 </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MAG_FE_Sheth_fig2.png" alt="表征风险" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p>风险分类从了解风险事件的范围开始，它传达了一种风险影响在受影响的利益相关者范围内的感受范围。 COVID-19 大流行的广泛范围在整个价值网络中产生了供需方面的影响，而范围狭窄的事件，例如单个制造工厂的罢工，往往会产生更有限的影响。当多个利益相关者经历同时或相继的中断时，影响的复杂性增加会阻止系统自组织恢复常态。这种情况也可能会引起主权国家或国际组织的干预，它们可以帮助恢复或充当新的破坏力量。</p><p>要对风险事件进行全面分类，领导者还必须考虑其后果的持久性。大流行和 2021 年苏伊士运河堵塞都造成了供应方中断，但每个事件引起的变化的持久性差异很大。虽然运河堵塞等供应链冲击通常遵循自组织修正机制，即价格上涨降低需求并使滞后供应正常化，但同样的公式不能用于应对像大流行这样的长期情况。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a>在规划和实施响应策略之前了解持久性很重要。例如，大流行造成的业务中断范围更广，后果更持久，与运河堵塞的影响更有限相比，影响的价值体系功能要多得多。</p><p></p><p>风险事件发生的频率也很重要，因为处理频繁事件所需的企业机制可能不同于处理单一事件的机制。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a>尽管公司从所有事件中学习，但他们对重复发生的事件的响应通常会转化为标准操作程序。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a>例如，采用条形码和扫描仪实时跟踪和管理库存，在很大程度上消除了由于数据不匹配而导致的库存记​​录错误和延误。</p><p>我们的范围、持久性和频率 (SPF) 框架提供了一个结构化视图，显示风险事件本身如何不如其后果重要。当多个风险事件同时发生时，该框架特别有用，因为它为管理人员提供了一种通用的、合乎逻辑的方法来考虑它们并快速获取信息和理解。然后将这些事件与公司的价值交换系统联系起来，经理们可以更容易地看到不同的风险何时仍然会对其价值函数产生类似的后果。 <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p>考虑一家制造商与一家海外供应商打交道，其产品由于贸易战而突然被征收高得多的关税，以及一家价值链合作伙伴的破产。这些风险事件具有 SPF 特征（两者的范围都是公司间的，它们的持久性是可逆的，并且它们的频率很低），并且同样重要的是，这两个事件也会影响相同的价值函数。破产和贸易战都可能减缓投入并提高供应方的成本，使满足客户需求变得更加困难。两者还需要制造商确保新的供应来源并稳定运营现金流。通过根据 SPF 框架描述这些潜在风险事件的特征并将它们与价值函数联系起来，管理人员可以将它们更简单地视为对公司的特定价值函数具有共同后果并需要类似准备和响应的风险组。</p><h3>划分和减少不确定性</h3><p>风险事件后果的不确定性是不可避免的，但可以根据不确定性水平落在完全了解和完全无知（两者都是极端且不太可能）之间的范围内来管理。 <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a>然后，领导者应设法将具有较高影响不确定性的风险降低到较低水平。 （参见“影响不确定性的管理水平”。） </p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand-column" id="fig3"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>管理影响不确定性水平</h4><p class="caption">一旦管理人员将风险映射到适当的级别，他们应该采取建议的关键行动，将高阶风险转换为低阶风险。 </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MAG_FE_Sheth_fig3.png" alt="管理影响不确定性水平" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p></p><p>导致 1 级不确定性的风险事件通常涉及数量非常有限的具有明显公司内部影响的未来情景，在这些情景中，可以准确了解风险事件与企业价值交换系统之间的因果关系。此类事件的示例包括生产中的例行变化、预期的销售损失以及执行手动任务时的人为错误。当特定类型的 1 级事件频繁发生时，它们表明过程中存在错误或疏忽，如果诊断正确，这些错误可以永久纠正。例如，货物盗窃——在拥堵的交通枢纽中经常发生的问题——可以使用跟踪集装箱货运并保持实时记录的光学字符识别扫描仪来防止。重要的是，在第 1 级，对公司价值影响的总体不确定性在预期的可接受范围内。</p><p>导致 2 级不确定性的风险事件涉及大量的替代未来情景并具有公司间后果；然而，尽管它们更具挑战性，但它们发生的可能性及其影响是可以估计的。企业的正式情景规划练习通常涉及 2 级事件，在这些事件中，先前获得的有关风险因素影响的知识可以提高准确性和整体有效练习。为期六天的苏伊士运河堵塞是可以预见的，因为 2018 年多艘船连环相撞使运河关闭了两天。因此，五角大楼已经在其正常运营准备中进行了更长时间的堵塞。 <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p>导致 3 级不确定性的风险事件涉及一组有限的场景，其中某些已知风险事件可能以未知方式影响公司。关于风险事件后果的连锁反应如何在这个层面上表现出来的知识有限。通常，这些风险包括具有行业内范围和多利益相关方影响的不太频繁发生的事件，应将其视为最坏的情况。</p><p> <a href="https://www.portrevel.com/">Port Revel</a>是一个位于法国阿尔卑斯山湖上的培训设施，它通过帮助海运公司模拟最坏的情况并确定通过主要为小型船舶设计的航运基础设施运营越来越大的集装箱船的先前未知后果来降低 3 级不确定性。它密切模拟了海上运输中最棘手地点的条件，允许实习飞行员在强风中驾驶大型集装箱船穿越迷你苏伊士运河，在拥挤的迷你旧金山湾驾驶和停靠游轮，以及操纵油轮通过仿亚瑟港。这些演习引出了意想不到的船舶性能和飞行员行为，有助于识别和解决以前未知的事件后果。</p><p>第 4 级不确定性包括具有未知风险因素的事件，这些事件可能会产生各种负面后果，其影响无法估计。这些未知的未知因素通常通过“其他未知风险可能影响我们的业务运营和预期绩效”等陈述以 10-K 表示。在存在未知未知数的情况下开发场景模型具有挑战性。这些模型是对世界的不完整表征，在开发它们时可能会带来无法想象的风险。</p><p>一旦领导者将影响的不确定性排序为不同的级别，他们就可以专注于通过数据、模拟建模和逻辑分析发现未知因素，将较高级别的影响不确定性转化为较低级别。例如，2016 年英国脱欧公投与 2019 年脱离欧盟之间的三年时间间隔为领导人提供了一个机会，可以将想象中的事件转化为可能的情景，并把握其巨大的贸易影响。通过关注其价值链中最脆弱的方面，例如跨境交易数量最多的方面，领导者本可以认识到通过拥挤港口的货物即将重新分配，并模拟重新路由场景。例如，众所周知，费利克斯托处理着英国 48% 的集装箱贸易，这些货物本来可以发往多个较小且不那么繁忙的港口。港口即将拥堵的迹象也可能暗示延误的可能性很高，并且需要在英国持有更多库存以保证准时交货。</p><p>可能产生永久影响的全系统变化通常是由明显的大趋势引起的，例如技术突破、消费者需求模式的变化、全球事件或监管机构的干预。一旦这些趋势出现在公司的雷达上，它们就可以被跟踪并快速解释（如果必要的观察和建模能力到位）。例如，经过多年辩论后于 2022 年 12 月颁布的欧盟碳边境税要到 2026 年才能全面实施，为企业提供数年时间来减少由此产生的不确定性。</p><p></p><p>此外，对于可能不常见但影响很大的潜在事件，企业可以检查可能更好地认识到类似事件的后果的其他行业；然后他们可以解释对他们自己的价值交换系统的影响。例如，英国脱欧战略家本可以研究美国和加拿大以及美国和墨西哥在汽车和白色家电行业的跨境贸易，以帮助他们应对迫在眉睫的自由贸易协定和边境法规。</p><p>主动识别似是而非的风险事件及其潜在后果是有助于建立真正风险情报的行动类型。然而，我们的研究表明，公司很少强调发现未知和似是而非的风险事件及其结果，而是将注意力集中在管理已知风险上。我们还发现，即使直接竞争对手公开披露了这些风险，公司也不具备类似的完整风险知识。我们对 10-Ks 的研究表明，即使在同一行业的公司之间，对风险因素的认识也存在显着差异。例如，在金融行业 18 家可比公司首次公开数据泄露后，他们对网络风险的认识滞后了八年之久。这种模式在另外四个行业中是一致的——包括零售、电信、技术和医疗保健。</p><p>此外，我们的分析表明，人们对风险因素之间因果关系的认识程度很低，这就是风险在现实世界中如何影响公司。一个已知或未知的风险因素一旦显现，可能会影响其他相关的已知和未知风险因素，从而产生一连串的后果，这是合乎逻辑的。这最终会以可能已知但出乎意料（或更糟的是，被误解）的方式影响一家公司。</p><p></p><p>虽然大多数公司认为他们正在为风险事件做准备，但他们往往只关注 1 级和 2 级不确定性，因此制定了高度具体但范围狭窄的缓解计划。以马士基为例，该公司在 2017 年成为勒索软件网络攻击的受害者，导致其整个网络瘫痪数日，并停止了全球 76 个港口码头的运营，损失约为 3 亿美元。 <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a>然而，这家航运公司直到 2013 年年度报告才公开承认网络攻击的风险，尽管黑客攻击和其他网络威胁的风险自 1990 年代末以来就广为人知（尽管可能并未被认真视为托运人的主要风险）。因此，很少有风险是完全未知的，而特定行业的未知数在其他部门可能不是未知数。</p><h3>构建企业风险网络并将其情境化</h3><p>要更清楚地了解 3 级和 4 级不确定性，了解企业风险之间的联系非常重要。开发量化风险网络 (QRN) 会有所帮助。 QRN 是一张加权图，它将所有已识别的潜在风险与公司的价值交换系统功能联系起来，并帮助决策者解释相关影响。此外，QRN 可以揭示违反直觉的见解，例如一个功能间接暴露于通常与不同但相关的功能相关的风险。例如，货运公司航运需求预测不准确的风险直接影响其运营费用管理功能，并间接影响设施容量、运营能力和客户让步以及公司声誉。</p><p>出于三个原因，公司应该建立自己的风险网络。首先，每家公司都有自己独特的价值交换体系，其领导层最了解这一点。其次，有弹性的公司需要建立冗余，这在资源受限的环境中很难做到。自定义 QRN 突出了连接最紧密且最脆弱的价值函数，从而创建了分配资源以支持企业的优先顺序。第三，自定义 QRN 为公司领导提供了风险共享图，他们可能会或可能不会就关键漏洞达成一致。 QRN 构建活动将管理注意力集中在经常被忽视但可能至关重要的职能和相关风险类别上，以最终帮助领导者预测未来并为未来做好准备。</p><p>要开始构建您公司的风险网络，请根据您的业务所依赖的关键价值函数和清单中捕获的风险类别来识别与您的业务特别相关的风险事件。从公司备忘录、公共风险披露、投资分析师报告和历史知识等数据源中识别每个类别中的似是而非的风险事件。例如，管理运营职能的领导者可以使用库存风险类别（例如设施和流程管理、采购和分销）来构建一个合理的风险因素或事件列表（例如意外风暴、设备故障、输入短缺、应急物资耗尽、工人健康紧急情况、通信中断或罢工），这些都可能影响业务连续性。请注意，这些列表可能包含每个风险类别下的多个风险因素。</p><p>接下来，使用 SPF 框架描述相关风险，确定与公司价值函数相关的合理情景，并确定潜在的应对措施。这种做法使管理人员有机会特别注意不太重视的风险，并帮助他们降低风险对公司价值交换系统影响的总体不确定性水平。</p><p>由于原型公司是按功能组织的，因此应该为 QRN 中的每个功能节点估计潜在风险对单个功能的影响（例如罢工对采购的影响）以及不同价值功能之间的相互关联性。例如，一旦管理者定义了公司采购和运营职能之间的相互关联程度，他们就可以推断出罢工对采购的直接影响及其对运营的间接影响。加权影响，即使使用高、中、低等相对术语，也为管理人员提供了一种共同语言来讨论重大风险和可能的情景，并有助于解决关于什么是可能的或什么是重要的争论。被确定为特别重要或脆弱的功能应由专家进行分析，以更深入地了解影响它们的风险及其相互关联性。</p><p>我们创建了一个通用的 QRN，首先要求具有部门和职能专业知识的领导者以 10 分制表示他们的职能与其他业务职能之间的相互联系。 （参见“定量风险网络”。）然后，我们要求领导者说明这些联系所产生的特定风险对其职能领域的潜在影响。例如，一位表示与业务战略职能有显着关联的销售和营销专家被问及销售预测风险、销售执行风险和声誉风险是否会对业务战略产生高、中或低影响。公司可以遵循此流程，通过利用内部领导者和外部专家来建立统一的理解。一旦编码，数据就构成了风险网络表示和公司特定 QRN 的基础。 </p><div class="callout-highlight callout-highlight--transparent callout--expand-column" id="fig4"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>量化风险网络</h4><p class="caption">这种广义 QRN 的可视化表示揭示了风险类别与企业职能之间的联系。它说明了公司如何分离和识别连接多个相关风险的关键价值函数，因此在构建企业弹性方面尤为重要。功能越中心，字体越大； QRN 中的粗链接意味着功能和风险类别之间的高影响关系。 </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MAG_FE_Sheth_fig4.png" alt="量化风险网络" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p>这样的 QRN 通过阐明价值交换系统的核心功能，帮助领导者更好地了解公司对风险事件的脆弱性。影响核心功能的风险事件将意味着对公司价值交换系统产生强烈的负面影响。例如，财务资本管理直接连接到 15 个财务风险类别，并从其他职能间接连接到 30 个风险类别。影响财务资本管理的任何一个风险类别中发生的任何事件都将对所有其他相关功能产生影响；例如，重大的货币风险可能会影响公司的采购决策。因此，保护​​金融资本管理职能对于弹性至关重要。相比之下，对营销和销售职能的负面影响不太可能对该公司造成级联影响。 <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a></p><p>专家知识、行业见解、经验和模拟都有助于构建企业风险的网络视图。 QRN 是基准资源，可帮助公司隔离最坏情况并对其进行客观建模，估计因果模式，并有效降低 3 级和 4 级不确定性。</p><p>拥有完善的 QRN 的公司将能够区分由于流行病和运输路线阻塞等原因导致的业务中断的范围和后果。它还将能够查明可能会因这些事件而遭受重大后果的业务部分，例如价值交付、价值创造和价值保护，并确定应该为这些事件中的每一个事件保护的准确业务功能。在大流行的情况下，这些功能将包括财务资本管理、市场风险评估和技术管理；对于范围较小的阻塞，这些将包括运营管理和运营费用控制。此外，公司可以使用价值函数风险清单，并为在每个函数中识别的风险事件构建场景模型。</p><p>最终，将似是而非的风险事件的知识及其可能与公司价值函数的相互作用相结合，使战略家能够制定量身定制的缓解计划和应对策略。认识到需要更好地了解一组特定场景的领导者可以投资开发精确的模型，以减少它们对公司影响的不确定性。</p><p></p><p></p><p>驱动任何大型复杂企业的价值交换系统不断受到挑战，因为动态业务环境中的上下文会发生变化。这增加了预测变化、探索新的商业模式变体以及不断追求下一波增长支持能力的风险。风险情报有助于领导者开展这项工作，使他们能够更好地专注于维持持续的价值交换并培养实现弹性所需的适应性。</p><p>为了创建和培养风险情报，公司需要一个中央风险管理职能部门，该职能部门配备广泛的职能专业知识，并提供识别和分类风险所需的资源。它需要接受风险不确定性与风险规避的心态，并降低不确定性水平。它需要一个以动态方式更新的特定于公司的量化风险网络。最后，它需要一种风险情报文化，在这种文化中，整个组织的领导者共享一个共同的框架和语言来解释风险和指导资源分配以减轻风险。归根结底，磨练风险智能能力是构建弹性企业的关键。</p><p></p>

2018 年，房地产市场 Zillow 推出了 Zillow Offers，这是该业务的“即时买家”部门。它利用了一种名为 Zestimate 的专有算法，该算法可以计算给定住宅物业的预期售价。根据这些计算，Zillow Offers 计划购买、翻新和转售房产以获取利润。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a>虽然它在最初几年取得了一些成功，但该模型未能适应 2021 年更加动荡的市场的新动态。Zillow 在当年第四季度出售的每套房屋平均损失 25,000 美元——导致减记 8.81 亿美元。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2个</a></p><p>这是我们所说的<em>算法惰性</em>的一个例子：当组织使用算法模型来考虑环境变化但未能跟上这些变化的步伐时。在这篇文章中，我们解释了算法惰性，确定了它的来源，并建议了组织可以实施的实践来克服它。</p><p></p><h3>信用评级灾难</h3><p>为了理解算法惯性现象，我们对另一个未能对环境变化做出反应的组织进行了深入研究：穆迪，一家为债券和住宅抵押贷款支持等复杂金融工具提供信用评级的金融研究公司证券（RMBS）。在 2008 年全球金融危机爆发前的这段时间里，这些证券将一揽子个人抵押贷款组合成具有独特特征的不同部分。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p>穆迪在 2000 年开发了一种名为 M3 Prime 的专有算法模型，共同努力在其信用评级中考虑环境变化。该模型分析了有关财产、抵押贷款持有人和经济的数据，以估计计算信用评级的两个核心参数：抵押贷款池的预期损失和证券维持 AAA 评级所需的损失保障保护。分析师将向穆迪的信用评级委员会提出建议，该委员会为该证券分配公开发布的评级。穆迪监控这些评级并随着环境的变化升级或降级 RMBS。 M3 Prime 模型取得了早期的成功，因此在 2006 年，穆迪通过引入衍生模型 M3 Subprime 扩大了算法分析的范围。</p><p> 2000 年至 2008 年间，穆迪为数以千计的 RMBS 提供了信用评级，但到 2008 年，穆迪最终下调了价值数十亿美元的 83% 的 AAA 级抵押贷款支持证券的评级。美国政府以及 21 个州和哥伦比亚特区，认为穆迪对其夸大这些产品和其他产品的评级在引发金融危机中所起的作用负责。 2017 年，该机构同意支付 8.64 亿美元来了结指控。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4个</a></p><p>这是具有破坏性社会后果的算法惯性的一个特别说明性的例子。穆迪的决策为探索算法惯性提供了极好的背景，因为该组织明确负责将分析环境变化作为其核心服务的一部分。此外，我们能够从金融危机调查委员会制作的一份报告中获取有关其算法模型的详细信息，该报告包括对当时参与该业务的穆迪高管进行的大量访谈。 <a id="reflink5"

模型的最初假设——抵押贷款发起人用来简化贷款申请流程的技术也能够更准确地评估潜在风险——没有被修改以反映不断变化的贷款环境。穆迪信贷政策董事总经理告诉一个联邦调查小组，他是一个高级别结构化信贷委员会的成员，预计该委员会将处理降低抵押贷款承保标准等问题，但从未提出过这个话题。 “我们谈论了一切，除了......坐在桌子上的大象，”他说。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6个</a></p><p></p><p>穆迪模型还假设消费者的 FICO 信用评分是贷款违约的主要预测因素。但随着时间的推移，这种数据输入的质量显着下降：随着这些信用评分的使用变得越来越普遍，个人找到了人为夸大它们的方法。因此，低文件和无文件抵押贷款具有穆迪算法模型中未考虑的潜在风险。 <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p><strong>表面改造。</strong>当组织仅对算法模型进行微小修改以响应环境的实质性变化时，就会出现这种现象。在穆迪，环境发生了一些重大变化，包括越来越多的贷款发起人、越来越低质量的抵押贷款以及前所未有的利率下降。</p><p>穆迪对这些变化的回应是寻求在快速增长的市场中获得更多业务，因此它对模型进行了微调，使其“更高效、更有利可图、更便宜、更通用”，据其首席信贷官说——而不是更准确。 <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a>当它修改 M3 Prime 以引入 M3 次级贷款模型时，它是根据溢价贷款推断次级贷款的损失曲线，而不是为次级贷款制定新的损失曲线。</p><p><strong>模拟未知的未来。</strong>依靠算法模型为未来环境生成可行的场景也可能使组织容易受到算法惯性的影响。穆迪构建了一个具有 1,250 种宏观经济情景的模拟引擎，使其能够根据通货膨胀、失业和房价等经济指标的变化来估计未来可能的损失。然而，模拟引擎受限于其底层结构和假设，因此分析师没有考虑正在发生的变化，没有更新情景，未能准确反映不断变化的宏观经济环境。基于详细的业绩历史可以更准确地揭示经济压力和贷款行为之间的因果关系这一信念，穆迪使用基于历史参数的估计而不是预期的池损失分布来检查压力场景中的行为。 <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p><strong>专门分门别类。</strong>当不同领域的专家参与算法的设计和使用并且没有总体的单一所有权或对模型的共同理解时，就会出现这种情况。在穆迪，信用评级程序的职责被划分为使用量化模型的领域专家（信用评级委员会成员）和开发该模型的量化分析师。</p><p>由于模型的所有权和使用是分散的，而且穆迪没有严格定义如何使用它，信用评级委员会成员制定了临时规则，在模型的输出不符合他们的专家判断导致的结果时调整模型的结果他们相信它应该产生。模型输出不被认为是最终的；相反，这些模型被视为与其他方法结合使用的工具，不同的评级委员会在如何做出决定方面存在很大差异。</p><p>这些模型是由远离模型应用领域的个人开发和修改的；然后，不同的领域专家组在不了解其基本逻辑的情况下以不一致的方式使用这些模型。负责 RMBS 评级的总经理称该模型在技术上非常复杂，以至于很少有人了解它是如何运作的。 <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a></p><p>这个问题是算法惯性难以解决的核心问题：模型和算法通常非常复杂，以至于领域专家几乎无法掌握其功能的细节，而数据科学家则与他们的模型在实际中的使用方式脱节世界。</p><h3>开发与算法惰性作斗争的实践</h3><p>我们已经描述了算法惰性的每个原因如何在穆迪使用算法模型将环境变化动态纳入其信用评级中发挥作用。尽管认识到模型中的缺陷并积极尝试改变它，但该组织无法有效地适应环境，从而在很大程度上促成了

href="#ref11">11</a>模型通常包括许多概念的操作化，组织很容易忘记这些参数，这些参数可能隐藏在软件代码层中。需要记录代表环境的参数，以确保它们保持可见。同样，支撑模型的基本假设应该被阐明并定期重新审视。</p><p>穆迪使用高级抵押贷款的数据集来训练一个模型，该模型旨在用于对由次级抵押贷款组成的 RMBS 进行评级。最初，由于数据的可用性，这可能是一个合理的选择。但是，当模型的初始数据集未被刷新时，就会产生算法惰性。正如穆迪的案例所表明的，数据从来都不是完全准确、客观和完美无缺的。因此，使数据来源和关于这些来源的假设对算法用户透明，并不断反思该数据的适当性，是寻求避免算法惰性的组织的关键实践。</p><p>组织必须清晰地组织数据源并定期对其进行评估。不同的数据源具有不同的质量和特征。在将这些来源输入算法模型、进行处理并不断相互比较之前，确保将这些来源彼此区分开来，使数据科学家能够尽早识别和消除算法惰性。</p><p>支撑算法使用的假设也应该被记录和阐明。任何对环境建模的尝试都涉及量化——将现实的各个方面转化为数字数据。这种量化不可避免地涉及对环境如何运作做出假设。然而，虽然量化对于算法模型的工作是必要的，但在设计和使用算法模型的复杂过程中，有关量化如何执行的细节可能会丢失。因此，保留此类假设的实时记录可能会防止算法惰性的出现。</p><p><strong>定期重新设计算法例程。</strong>组织应该定期重新设计——并愿意彻底改革——他们的算法模型，并重新考虑它如何适应更广泛的组织惯例。算法模型的初始设计可能需要大量工作，组织自然希望从这项工作中获益。然而，在瞬息万变的动态环境中，重要的是不仅要愿意对模型进行渐进式更改，而且要在必要时从根本上对其进行彻底改革。</p><p>当然，组织在彻底检查算法例程时面临权衡：完全重新构建算法模型可能非常昂贵。然而，不这样做的后果可能是灾难性的。</p><p>例如，当穆迪不得不对越来越多的次级抵押贷款主导的 RMBS 进行评级时，该组织选择逐步修改 M3 Prime 模型。然而，明确区分主要市场和次级市场之间的区别并对原始模型进行更深入的改革可能会更有效。除了重新思考算法模型本身之外，组织还可以考虑它在实践中的部署方式：假设，穆迪本可以将 M3 Prime 模型以不同方式应用于不同类型的 RMBS——也许只是需要更多的人为干预来处理质量较低的部分贷款。</p><p>重新设计和检修算法模型取决于了解哪些组织过程与模型相互关联，并分析环境变化对其的影响。如果很明显，它所依赖或输入的模型或流程已经过时或无效，则应认真考虑进行彻底改革。</p><p><strong>假设模型会损坏。</strong>对于一个组织来说，仅通过算法模型预测的棱镜来思考潜在的未来情景可能是危险的：模型中嵌入的所有假设限制了可以考虑的潜在未来。为了解决与未知未来模拟相关的算法惯性，重要的是假设模型会崩溃。考虑超出算法模型范围的场景；这需要具有挑战性的预测假设以及假设该模型存在根本性缺陷。</p><p>考虑模型<em>之外的</em>场景的积极实践可以通过迫使团队成员积极考虑算法模型的局限性来帮助激励和启发前两种实践——公开数据和假设以及定期重新设计算法例程。</p><p></p><p>一种特别有用的方法可能是利用对未来的定性预测，而不是依赖过去可用数据的定量预测。这些形式的情景规划提供了机会来考虑对未来可能持有的截然不同的愿景。这可能还需要开发混合算法，这些算法不完全依赖过去的数据来预测场景，而是将领域专家引入的定性措施和专家规则嵌入其中。</p><p><strong>在数据科学家和领域专家之间架起桥梁。</strong>组织必须为数据科学家和领域专家创建流程，以紧密合作来设计他们的算法例程。 <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a>实际上，数据科学家和人工智能专家处理问题的方式与领域专家截然不同。领域专家专注于组织惯例和特殊情况，而数据科学家专注于开发基于数学原理的可概括结构。为了克服算法惯性，数据科学家和领域专家必须密切合作，以了解组织惯例和特殊情况的特征如何映射到算法模型中使用的数学参数。</p><p>当数据科学家和领域专家的世界完全分离时，还存在数据科学家和领域专家通过表面上信任彼此的工作来转移责任的危险。这样的假设实际上会阻碍两个世界之间的关键对话。例如，穆迪最终颠覆了其信用评级模型的结果，因为信用评级分析师没有试图理解为什么该模型可能会产生不符合他们直觉的结果。在数据科学家和领域专家之间架起桥梁，使领域专家能够直观地掌握算法模型的工作原理。这种共同点可以使组织能够创建和使用更好地适应环境变化的模型。</p><p>组织可以用来促进数据科学家和领域专家之间沟通的一种结构性桥梁建设实践是建立产品经理等职位。这应该由一个具有领域和数据科学经验的人担任，他直接负责监督算法例程。例如，一些数据专家呼吁建立一个新的组织结构，其中包括一个“创新元帅”角色——一个受到数据科学家和领域专家尊重的人。 <a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a>鉴于他们在这两个领域的知识和专长，这些人可以通过开发和维护有助于确保算法程序能够适应环境变化的“高带宽、双向通信渠道”来赢得组织的尊重。 <a id="reflink14" class="reflink" href="#ref14">14</a></p><p></p><p>另一种桥梁建设实践称为<em>模型可解释性</em>：以实用且易于理解的方式描述算法模型。对于数据科学家来说，这种可解释性可以促进获得抵消算法惰性来源所需的专家知识；对于领域专家来说，这种可解释性可以帮助他们深入而直观地理解模型如何考虑环境变化。模型可解释性在具有不同专业知识的两组专业人员之间建立了共同点。这种做法使组织能够建立桥梁，而不仅仅是谈论它们。</p><p></p><p>寻求从强大的预测分析中获益的组织越来越多地面临算法惯性问题。尽管利用动态算法来适应环境的变化，组织可能会发现结果跟不上新的发展。通过公开数据和假设，定期重新设计算法例程，假设他们的模型会崩溃，并建立桥梁，组织可以增加他们在算法解决方案上的大量投资通过更好的决策获得回报的可能性。</p><p></p>

He predicted in 1965 that the density of transistors on a microchip would double [&#8230;]]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><figure class="article-inline"><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Winston-MooresLaw-1290x860-1.jpg" alt="" /><br /></figure><p>英特尔联合创始人、早期半导体行业的杰出人物戈登摩尔于今年早些时候去世，享年 94 岁。他留下了历史上最成功的公司之一，当然还有他著名的<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/gordon-moore-obituary.html">摩尔定律</a>。他在 1965 年预测微芯片上的晶体管密度每年都会翻一番，并在 1975 年将他的预测调整为“恰好”每两年翻一番。后一种预测已经成立了将近 50 年。</p><p>人们常说，我们手中的手机比 1969 年的阿波罗登月任务的计算能力更强。的确如此，但这也太轻描淡写了——我们的手机实际上 <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a25655/nasa-computer-iphone-comparison/">比当时所有的 NASA 都强大</a>，这一事实证明了指数变化的令人震惊的现实。</p><p></p><p>我们人类倾向于以线性方式思考：如果去年增长了一点，今年就会增长更多一点。我们很难理解半导体发生了什么。 1971 年，每个微处理器大约有 2,400 个晶体管。五十年后，一块芯片拥有 580 亿个晶体管，英特尔计划<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/opinion/moore-law-now-and-in-the-future.html">到 2030 年达到 1 万亿个</a>。如果每两年翻一番，它大约每十年增长 30 倍，20 年增长 1,000 倍，40 年增长 100 万倍。在 60 年内，您将以 10 亿倍的速度获得某些东西。</p><p>很难夸大这种变化速度对世界造成的影响。有趣的是，我十几岁的男孩们对他们几乎可以立即查询几乎任何事实或流式传输任何视频或歌曲完全不感兴趣。与此同时，错误信息传播得更快。至于人工智能？无论是好的还是坏的，它都会迅速变得更好。 （如果你想害怕，请查找“deepfakes”。）</p><p>摩尔定律还导致了商业史上一些最经典的失败。柯达没有为数码照片做好准备。 Blockbuster 也被打了个措手不及，下载电影在短短几年内就从不可能变成了实时下载。一旦流媒体电影变得微不足道，租用视频的模式就死了。</p><p>在所有这一切中，我看到了两个重要的教训。首先，如果我们能够尽早取得成功，相信还有更多的可能，为此疯狂竞争，并进行<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-missing-discipline-behind-failure-to-scale/">必要的投资，我们</a>就能取得显着进步。这里的核心点是，显而易见，摩尔定律不是定律。几十年来，没有人要求大型芯片公司将晶体管的宽度缩小到纳米级。他们之所以这样做，是因为竞争、为建立芯片市场而进行的大量公共和私人支出，以及理论、制造技术、设备设计和营销方面令人印象深刻的创新水平。 （一旦 iPad<em>可行，我们还需要</em>吗？）根据早期经验和成功，摩尔定律被证明是对一个行业可以实现的目标的有力而大胆的预测。</p><p>其次，我们可以将其与我们时代的关键商业挑战相提并论：如何在管理我们的社会和环境影响（尤其是气候变化）的同时实现繁荣和发展。我们可以拥抱快速变化，以可持续或净积极的方式运营。</p><h3>我们可以再次拥抱指数</h3><p>就像在 1960 年代和 70 年代一样，在外部目标的驱动下，我们再次沿着一条我们不确定如何前进的道路前进——最重要的是，科学告诉我们世界应该以多快的速度去碳化。 “基于科学的目标”是应对气候变化的准摩尔定律。跟上这些雄心勃勃的目标是商业价值的重要创造者，是实现卓越创新和绩效的途径，也是与客户、员工和其他利益相关者保持相关性（而不是被 Blockbuster 化）的核心方式。</p><p></p><p>到目前为止，许多清洁技术领域给半导体世界留下了良好的印象。清洁能源和电池存储的成本即使不是每两年减半，也一直在快速下降。根据国际能源署的数据，2000 年至 2020 年间， <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/evolution-of-solar-pv-module-cost-by-data-source-1970-2020">新太阳能模块的每瓦成本</a>下降了 96%。45 年来，太阳能成本暴跌了 500 倍，大约每五年减半。虽然不是摩尔定律的步伐，但它的速度足以撼动整个行业并创造巨大的新机会。清洁技术转型是我们旅行、建造建筑物、制造事物等方式的数万亿美元的转变。</p><p>与半导体一样，清洁技术领域的这种表现来自于创新、投资、政策支持和大规模制造能力的大规模建设（主要在中国）。但也许在这两种情况下最重要的是，变革的步伐需要意志力和新的思维模式。 10 多年前，当我们这些身处可持续商业世界的人开始推动以科学为基础的目标的想法时，阻力是显而易见的。 “我们怎么可能移动得那么快？”很多人会问。 “考虑到它的成本，我们<em>为什么</em>要移动得那么快？”但是，当您跨越成本和心理临界点时，怀疑会转变为热情。</p><p></p><p>尽管摩尔定律一直在推动社会的深刻技术和社会变革，但它仍然是一个人为的目标。竞争、创新和利润动机驱使公司朝着它迈进。这一次，为了实现气候目标，我们正在使用全球行星阈值来确定我们需要实现多快的目标——不仅是碳，还有水的使用、环境中有毒物质或塑料的数量、人权的普遍性供应链中的滥用行为等等。</p><p>如果我们希望我们的世界繁荣昌盛，那么拥有这些可不是一件好事。我们正在努力应对的可持续性“法则”绝对<em>不是</em>理论上的或发明的——它们基于自然和物理法则。 Smart companies will see these nonnegotiable realities as the incredible opportunity that they are and get moving.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/we-should-bring-moores-law-to-climate-action/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Manage Your Workforce Ecosystem, Not Just Your Employees</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/manage-your-workforce-ecosystem-not-just-your-employees/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/manage-your-workforce-ecosystem-not-just-your-employees/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 12 Jun 2023 11:00:03 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Elizabeth J.

The most common answer is also the most surprising.</p><p> A confident minority of executives say their workforce is just their employees. But the overwhelming majority, especially leaders on the front lines of organizational transformations, takes a broader view that goes beyond just employees. Increasingly, they characterize the workforce as all of the people and groups involved in achieving the company&#39;s business objectives. Organizations&#39; extended workforces have become so essential to their businesses, brands, and approaches to value creation that they need to think differently about, and act differently toward, their entire workforce.</p><p> That represents a shift in management perspective since we began our study of the future of the workforce a few years ago. We are seeing this change across industries and a variety of organizations, large and small — and it is challenging leaders to redefine who and what constitutes their workforce and to develop new management practices and organizational structures.</p><p></p><p> Hierarchical, command-and-control, internally focused management practices are ill suited for workforces that span internal and external organizational boundaries. Using siloed functions to independently manage employees and external contributors, for example, is fraught with challenges: Ill-defined decision rights, governance processes, and power dynamics can undermine even the most well-intentioned executives. In addition, the technology systems for managing employees are typically different and disconnected from those for accessing and tracking external contributors. This lack of integration creates inefficiencies that can thwart efforts to obtain and maintain strategically valuable capabilities.</p><p> We define <em>workforce ecosystem</em> as a structure that encompasses actors, from within the organization and beyond, working to create value for an organization. Within the ecosystem, actors work toward individual and collective goals with interdependencies and complementarities among the participants.</p><p> Workforce ecosystems include employees as well as external contributors and partners of various kinds — long- and short-term contractors, gig workers, application developers, service providers, and crowdsourced actors. An ecosystem perspective explicitly recognizes that accessing and engaging workforces is no longer the sole purview of the human resources function but requires cross-functional actions involving leaders in the C-suite, IT, procurement, finance, legal, and other areas.</p><p> Intentionally orchestrating a workforce ecosystem requires leaders to coordinate activities across their own organization and with external contributors. To meet this challenge, companies need to reassess coordination between functions such as human resources, procurement, and IT. Decisions also need to made about how to govern relationships with external contributors, such as application developers and subcontractors. We developed the concept of <em>integration architectures</em> to define both that internal coordination and how organizations interact with their extended workforce.</p><p></p><p> Our integration architecture model contrasts with the default, siloed approach to managing interactions in most workforce ecosystems. Typically, contingent workers are the responsibility of procurement. Partners and alliances are often handled by strategy, and AI and automation are part of the tech organization (but rarely regarded as part of the broader workforce ecosystem). HR typically oversees full- and part-time employees. In this common approach, multiple groups work independently to govern the contributors for which they have a mandate, but efforts across the organization are uncoordinated.</p><p> Managers in different departments frequently use combinations of external and internal workers without any centralized coordination. These decentralized approaches may be efficient on a local level, where each business unit and functional manager retains maximum control, but they are suboptimal at an aggregate level.</p><p> Indeed, decentralization can have substantial drawbacks when orchestrating a workforce ecosystem. Dispersed efforts may not be aligned with overall strategic priorities and may undermine a business&#39;s pursuit of new strategic directions. The lack of integration may limit available data about who (and what) is contributing to an organization. It may lead to cost inefficiencies as contingent workers are sourced on an ad hoc basis. And it likely means that both internal workers and external contributors (existing and potential) have less visibility into opportunities to contribute. While decentralization is currently the most common approach to managing employees and the extended workforce, it is almost always uncoordinated.</p><h3> Why Centralized Integration Architectures Appeal</h3><p> Given the shortcomings of decentralized architectures, many organizations orchestrating workforce ecosystems are creating integration architectures that are more centralized and cross-functional in their design. In some organizations, HR coordinates workforce ecosystem management with the procurement and IT functions; in these cases, business leaders and teams work with HR and others to proactively manage risks. Other companies are adopting a more cross-functional approach to managing all types of individual workers and providers; in these cases, HR plays a key but less central role, with talent marketplaces playing a more prominent role in supporting workforce needs across business units and functions.</p><p> Swiss global health care company Novartis, for example, has set up a cross-functional steering committee to manage its approximately 100,000 internal workers and roughly 50,000 external ones. Novartis is working to provide managers with visibility into internal and external talent sources, an effort driven by data culled from a variety of partners and platforms. The process will be facilitated by curators called workforce strategists, who will grant managers real-time access to teams of employees, contractors, and technologies.</p><p> The pandemic prompted HR at another global company we studied to get more involved with overseeing the broader workforce because of the concerns it raised about remote and onsite work policies, pay continuity, absences, and sick leave for both contingent workers and employees. Before the pandemic, HR paid close attention only to what was going on with full-time-equivalent or part-time employees, the company&#39;s vice president of HR reported; often, with contingent workers, “HR was not in the loop at all,” she said. At that time, there wasn&#39;t even a shared understanding of who comprises the company&#39;s contingent workforce. The pandemic lent urgency to the idea that the company would have to be more centrally integrated and agile to take care of its contingent workers. It also underscored that the company needed to better manage the reputational, legal, operational, and cost risks of the broader workforce, and to use the entire workforce to its fullest competitive advantage.</p><p> At this same company, hiring processes and procedures had historically differed by department — and departments tended not to communicate with one another. HR supported decisions about hiring permanent employees, while procurement brought in contingent workers. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to HR, managers were often converting contingent workers into full-time employees. A newly developed clearinghouse platform that involved HR, procurement, and finance gave the company data-based cross-functional visibility into tracking and approving external workers.</p><p> Management of the contingent workforce had been a hot potato at the company, according to the chief procurement officer: “Anybody who was at the center was on the hook for all the risk and none of the benefit.” But he described the company as having shifted to thinking of its relationship with contingent workers in strategic rather than transactional terms, which involves managing the contingent workforce cross-functionally. As the vice president of HR explained, “There was an acknowledgment between our CFO, our chief general counsel, our CHRO [chief human resources officer], and our chief operating officer that they all had skin in the game.”</p><p> Talent marketplaces are another great tool for anchoring a centralized and more cross-functionally integrated architecture. NASA, for example, used to have six talent-market platforms spread across multiple units, each of which independently matched employees with gigs and projects. Now the space agency uses a single talent marketplace — one orchestrating mechanism — to coordinate access to internal human talent across the organization. Extending its internal talent marketplace to external contributors is on NASA&#39;s horizon.</p><p></p><h3> Integration Architecture Challenges</h3><p> While centralized and cross-functional integration architectures are enabling organizations to achieve higher levels of coordination in their workforce ecosystems, these efforts are in their nascent stages. Even among companies on the leading edge of workforce ecosystem transformations, leaders emphasize that these efforts are just starting to gain traction. In our research and consulting work, we see that most organizations still take reactive, local, and uncoordinated approaches to enlisting and retaining external talent and complementary contributors. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p> Leaders realize that such decentralized efforts are both cost- and resource-inefficient and risk demotivating internal employees. Yet they struggle to establish a centralized cross-functionally integrated architecture for workforce ecosystem orchestration. We have heard the following concerns:</p><ul><li> How do you identify the right set of stakeholders to create a centrally integrated architecture for workforce ecosystem orchestration?</li><li> How do you get stakeholders to engage in local workforce ecosystem experiments to tailor shared goals to specific contexts?</li><li> How do you promote coordinated learning from local experimentation?</li><li> How do you improve your workforce ecosystem implementation process over time?</li></ul><p> To create an integrated workforce ecosystem, at least three types of issues need to be addressed: structural design (pertaining to the division of labor, goals, and incentives), politics (relating to resources, power, and status), and culture (affecting individuals&#39; search for identity and meaning). We recommend taking a phased approach to these issues, which intertwine, overlap, and can reinforce one another. This process is likely to be most appropriate for large, established organizations that are starting to embrace workforce ecosystems, but key elements should be helpful for those in small and medium-size enterprises. (See “Four Phases of Orchestrating an Integrated Workforce Ecosystem.”)</p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Four Phases of Orchestrating an Integrated Workforce Ecosystem</h4><p class="caption"> The graphic below describes the key challenges associated with orchestrating workforce ecosystems and the phases associated with addressing them. <a id="reflinki" class="reflink" href="#refi">i</a> </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MAG_Altman_Figure.png" alt="Four Phases of Orchestrating an Integrated Workforce Ecosystem" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p> In the first phase, we propose creating an orchestration team to develop a working plan, goals, and metrics in consultation with relevant local and central stakeholders, both internal and external. This team should focus on integration considerations within the organization (functional roles and responsibilities) and on relationships with external participants. By working with groups within the organization that already engage external workers, the team can get a head start with managers experienced in orchestrating parts of workforce ecosystems. From a structural design perspective, they can quickly begin to highlight and address previously identified skills gaps.</p><p> To deal with political concerns, the team can choose local well-respected and action-oriented champions to lead transformations. Additionally, the team can include representatives from external contributors to bring their perspectives to the efforts. Team members should be able to speak for functional areas, product groups, and business units as appropriate; the key is to obtain participation from across stakeholder groups. Finally, to grapple with cultural challenges, at least one team member should play the role of a boundary spanner, serving as a go-between among the central team, local teams, and other affected groups.</p><p> In the second phase, we suggest promoting local experimentation. Central orchestration teams can introduce pilot programs to explore potential configurations of workforce ecosystem relationships. These experiments can address structural issues, such as staffing projects with a mix of internal and external workers, identifying necessary skills, ensuring competencies, and measuring the quality of outcomes. They can address political challenges, such as internal employees resisting contributions from external workers and local leaders feeling tension as they lose some control over team composition. Finally, cultural questions may arise as employees adapt to shifts in responsibilities, especially if they need to take on more of a facilitation role coordinating participants from various sources.</p><p> In the third phase, we emphasize coordinated learning and resourcing, which spans challenges (and successes) identified by local teams and overseen by the central team. Structural impediments, such as existing policies and procedures (intellectual property licensing models or training rules, for example) may serve the organization well in a traditional employee life-cycle model but require revision for a workforce ecosystem. Resourcing issues may arise as local managers hire more external workers or partner more easily with subcontractors but then refuse to release employees to accept other opportunities. Even when the C-suite and lower levels embrace changes, midtier managers might be resistant because they are often tasked with managing the day-to-day challenges of these sometimes highly disruptive transformations.</p><p> In the fourth and final phase, we consider workforce ecosystem expansion. Once initial pilots are analyzed and new practices are starting to be institutionalized, leaders should consider what other new systems, tools, goals, metrics, and processes have proved successful enough to adopt. These should be regularly reviewed as the organization continues to gain knowledge and experience. Leaders may want to expand the central orchestration team to include representation from other internal groups. And they may want to consider connecting their workforce ecosystems with others — for example, working more closely with client organizations and their ecosystems. Culturally, leaders may consider more actively promoting distributed learning and workforce ecosystem activities through storytelling and other communication tools. They will likely want to highlight growth opportunities while also beginning to address the myriad concerns that inevitably accompany such transformations.</p><p> This four-phase approach offers a practical way to engage, connect, and activate key stakeholders. From there, organizations can begin to shape their own strategies and pathways by experimenting with new types of integration architectures and quickly iterating as they learn what does and doesn&#39;t work across different contexts.</p><p> Echoing the way that integration architectures define how internal functions and business units work together to orchestrate workforce ecosystems, leaders need to define how to govern relationships with external contributors. Leaders face several decisions about which integration architectures are appropriate for external contributors.</p><p> The choice of third-party integration architectures may determine the degree to which partners are willing to expend resources to participate in (or contribute to) the workforce ecosystem. Decisions around how to coordinate with developer ecosystems, for instance, can be critical to effective workforce ecosystems. Google Play is Google&#39;s distribution marketplace for apps and content. In comparison to Apple&#39;s App Store, through which Apple distributes apps and content, Google has a lighter touch, with less-strict requirements and compliance testing. Apple&#39;s policies are known to be much more stringent. Integration architectures with external developers may have more or less rigidity and be more or less welcoming.</p><p> Crafting integration architectures with third parties raises questions about who should own these relationships within the enterprise. For example, video game console manufacturers often enable third-party developers (complementors) to create games that work on their systems; frequently, it is the demand for these third-party games that drives sales of particular consoles. Should developer relations be the responsibility of a business development or strategy group (that may also handle strategic alliances) or a separate group with specific responsibilities for developer ecosystems? An integration architecture helps define responsibilities and adjudicate potential conflicts among internal groups with competing interests.</p><p></p><p> Implementing integration architectures in your organization begins with an assessment of how your workforce ecosystem currently functions. How much visibility and control does your organization&#39;s HR function currently have over internal and external contributors? If these contributors are currently managed in a decentralized manner, evaluate whether your organization is best served by this architecture.</p><p></p><p> If you recognize that a more centrally integrated and orchestrated workforce ecosystem would be a better approach for your organization, decide which groups and individuals should be part of the orchestration team. Should someone (or some group) be centrally responsible for overseeing the entire workforce ecosystem?</p><p> Throughout our research, we have heard leaders describe their struggles to engage talent essential to their company&#39;s success within an increasingly complex and connected workforce ecosystem. We have observed time and again that intentionally orchestrating a workforce ecosystem perspective can help leaders take a much richer and more nuanced view of their own organization and the people, partners, and technologies upon which they rely to meet their strategic goals and objectives.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/manage-your-workforce-ecosystem-not-just-your-employees/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Opening Access to the Fast Track for Career Equity</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/opening-access-to-the-fast-track-for-career-equity/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/opening-access-to-the-fast-track-for-career-equity/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 08 Jun 2023 11:00:49 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Haig R.

Collectively, these companies employed over 700,000 people. About 40% of the employees were based in the United States.</li></ul></aside><p> Business leaders tend to focus their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts on addressing bias and discrimination because these practices are pervasive and discrimination is illegal. But in the process, they overlook situational factors that play a leading role — and are easier to address — in determining whether women and people of color get promoted and are among the higher paid.</p><p> Career and pay equity are inextricably linked. Women and people of color continue to be underrepresented among managers and executives, and often among senior professionals as well. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> While pay equity is improving for these demographic groups, the raw pay gaps (average and median differences between women and men, and between people of color and White employees) remain high in many companies. These pay gaps will persist until women and people of color occupy the career levels and roles that command the highest pay at a rate that reasonably reflects their representation in the workforce.</p><p></p><p> Inequity not only hurts individual employees; it also deprives businesses of the talent that is overlooked. If leaders understand how situational factors affect their employees&#39; prospects for advancement, they can apply <em>proactive career management (PCM)</em> — identifying and removing barriers to employee success — to make their workplaces more equitable and more productive.</p><p> To better understand the factors underlying these differences in career outcomes, I examined the results of analyses of multiple years of promotion, retention, performance, and pay data in 20 large and midsize companies that collectively employed more than 700,000 people. The findings confirmed that significant gender and racial differences in promotion probability for women and people of color are attributable to four factors that are consistently consequential to employees&#39; success: performance ratings, role assignments, reporting relationships, and flexible working arrangements.</p><p> With the exception of performance ratings, these factors are related to an employee&#39;s circumstances, not their knowledge, skills, or behavior. For instance, if career progress requires experience in certain roles but women are proportionally underrepresented in those roles relative to men, the net result is that fewer women will advance.</p><p> Certainly, bias and discrimination are also in play: In most of the organizations, we found large, unexplained gender and racial disparities in the likelihood of promotion that cannot be accounted for by any business-relevant factors. And we found universal and sizable racial disparities in performance evaluations, with people of color, particularly Black employees, less likely to receive high ratings. These are a logical focus for corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts because they are evidence of bias or discrimination.</p><p> But because the explained differences often have the greatest influence on career advancement and pay equity, it&#39;s important to address them directly. The good news is that these factors are often the easiest to address successfully. Proactive career management is a data-driven approach that offers a solution that works.</p><h3> Four Factors Drive Who Advances at Work</h3><p> Let&#39;s look more closely at the four factors I identified that explain who receives promotions, high performance ratings, and larger pay increases at work and why women and people of color tend not to see those benefits.</p><p> <strong>Performance ratings.</strong> Because performance ratings affect all other outcomes, such as promotion, retention, and pay, disparities in this area have a cascading effect. In 89% of the companies studied, Black employees were less likely to receive high performance ratings. The differences can be sizable, with the majority at 25% or higher. Moreover, because performance ratings tend to persist from year to year — a high rating one year predicts the likelihood of a high rating the next — the tendency for people of color to get lower ratings becomes a virtual blockade to their progress. Interestingly, women are generally more likely to be highly rated than otherwise comparable men, but that doesn&#39;t translate into a higher probability of promotion for them.</p><p> <strong>Access to accelerator roles.</strong> In every company, certain roles are career accelerators and others are dead ends, regardless of who occupies them. In this study, having a supervisor role at any level almost universally improved the chance that an employee would be promoted and receive high ratings. However, we almost always found that women and people of color were far less likely to be in such roles than men or White employees, respectively.</p><p> The differences are often stark and steep. For example, in a global financial services company we studied, US-based employees who were supervisors were 50% more likely to be promoted and 55% more likely to receive high performance ratings than those who were not supervisors. Outside the US, supervisors were 89% more likely to be promoted and 37% more likely to get high ratings. These effects were even larger for female supervisors than for male supervisors. But across the company, women were half as likely to be supervisors. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2个</a></p><p>Further, because women are more likely than men to face career disruption during their child-rearing years, they may take on supervisor roles later. In such cases, they don&#39;t experience the same compounding benefit of being in such roles as their male colleagues.</p><p> <strong>Reporting relationships.</strong> Whom one reports to can have a decisive impact on the trajectory of one&#39;s career. We generally found that people who reported to supervisors with high performance ratings were significantly more likely to receive a high rating as well. The probability that they would be promoted also increased.</p><p> We saw similar effects for employees whose managers were higher up in the corporate hierarchy than the norm for someone at their level and thus had more clout. To the extent that women and people of color are less likely to report to high-performing and higher-level supervisors, they are less likely to receive high ratings or promotions themselves.</p><p> They may also be less likely to benefit from these relationships when they do have them. At a global insurance company, those who reported to a top-rated supervisor were about 50% more likely to be promoted and 30% more likely to receive high performance ratings. Those whose supervisors were at a level higher than the norm were 9% more likely to be promoted and 14% more likely to be highly rated. However, having a high-performing or higher-ranked supervisor did not help women and people of color as much as it helped White men.</p><p> <strong>Flexible working.</strong> Increasingly, organizations view flexible work arrangements as essential to attracting and retaining talent, particularly women and younger employees. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, more companies and employees have embraced such arrangements, but historically, they have been career killers. For example, those who work part time or remotely or take family leave are less likely to be promoted, are paid less, and are more likely to leave their companies.</p><p> At a business I&#39;ll refer to as ConsumerCo, opting for flexible work arrangements hurt both women and people of color. The percentage of women working part time was three times that of men; for people of color, it was two times that of White employees. Overall, working part time reduced promotion probability by 50% and the likelihood of receiving a high rating by 70%. It also increased turnover probability by 25% compared with similarly situated full-time workers.</p><p> Likewise, leaves of absence were disproportionately taken by women and people of color. Those on leave were about 50% less likely to be promoted or receive high ratings and much more likely to turn over — at least 150% more likely in the US and at least 80% more likely globally. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p> Unless companies do something to mitigate the negative consequences of flexible working on employees, the phenomenon of higher levels of flexible work arrangements risks further undermining career progress for women and people of color.</p><h3> The Case for Proactive Career Management</h3><p> With the exception of performance ratings, these drivers of career progress, or lack thereof, are situational. This is telling. It indicates that whether employees advance is not just a reflection of the talents and skills they bring or what they do, but also of how well their employers position them to succeed. All too often, women and people of color simply aren&#39;t positioned to succeed in the same way their White male counterparts are.</p><p> This is not to say that bias and discrimination are not factors, as mentioned above. However, employers can make measurable progress on DEI when they understand the extent of the positioning issues in their workforce and deal with them in a purposeful, systematic way. This is where PCM comes into play.</p><p></p><p> The idea behind proactive career management for DEI is simple: Identify and rank the factors that most influence career success and retention; if and where they skew significantly against certain demographic groups, intervene to eliminate or reduce the disparities. In other words, work to ensure that demographic characteristics bear no relationship to how well or poorly positioned an employee is to stay and succeed at work.</p><p> Every organization has talent flows that shape their workforce. Employers hire, train, and develop employees. And they value employees by giving them promotions, high ratings, raises, and other forms of compensation for the knowledge, capabilities, behavior, and experience they bring, the effort they deliver, and, ultimately, how they perform. Meanwhile, employees&#39; decisions to stay or leave are influenced by whether their careers are progressing.</p><p> These talent flows and rewards define the internal labor market of an organization and produce the supply of people with the attributes needed to meet the demands of the business. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> But as we have seen, different demographic groups within an organization do not have the same opportunities to acquire these attributes or be rewarded for them.</p><p> By not distributing opportunities equitably, companies effectively restrict their talent supplies. Women and people of color become more likely to leave or, if they stay, become less engaged because their careers are stalled. Knowing how the internal labor market functions for different demographic groups within an organization is thus crucial for a company to execute its DEI strategy.</p><p> To implement PCM, organizations should start by creating a success profile that identifies and ranks the factors that drive who advances. From there, they can examine how each factor influences the probability that employees from different demographic groups get promoted and whether the organization is valuing their capabilities and efforts equitably.</p><p></p><p> Small organizations might rely on the four factors described in the previous section. For them, controlled, statistical analyses of their own internal labor market data are likely infeasible. Such organizations might complement the research with qualitative input about the keys to career progress from their leaders and employees who have successfully risen in the ranks there.</p><p> Large employers with complex organizations will be best served by developing an objective success profile based on empirical evidence that identifies and ranks the critical individual and situational factors that drive success in the organization. The natural place to start is with the factors that drive promotions. But organizations might examine other markers of success as well, like pay, ratings, and retention, to see how well the results align with those from the analysis of promotions.</p><p> After creating the profile, the next step is to examine how the profile plays out for different demographic groups. There are two questions to answer.</p><p> First, are the factors that most influence employee success distributed similarly across demographic groups, or do they tend to be concentrated more in some groups than in others? These are <em>quantity effects</em> , and they reflect the relative frequency of the factors across groups. For instance, are women and people of color as likely as men and White employees to have the prized characteristics or to work in circumstances associated with success?</p><p> Second, when people possess the prized characteristics or work in favored circumstances, do they benefit equally from those attributes, or do some demographic groups benefit more? These are <em>price effects</em> . They reflect whether the employer values the attribute, behavior, or situation in question differently for one group than for another.</p><p> Objectively answering these questions is the foundation of PCM, as illustrated in the case of ConsumerCo.</p><p></p><h3> Positioning Employees for Success at ConsumerCo</h3><p> ConsumerCo&#39;s leaders were committed to improving career and pay equity in both their salaried and front-line workforces.</p><p> The company recognized that having a diverse workforce was not a luxury or a concession to social good; it was essential to its success. With an increasingly diverse customer base and growth occurring mostly in markets outside the US and Europe, having a leadership team and a workforce well attuned to the preferences and norms of local cultures was important to achieving growth targets.</p><p> HR and DEI leaders modeled their workforce data to uncover and assess the success profile for their salaried workforce. They identified 12 factors that were most likely to predict whether someone would be promoted. Situational factors dominated this success profile — a finding that stunned company leaders, who viewed the culture as a meritocracy. Of the top 12, only performance ratings and tenure were specific to the talents or accomplishments of an individual employee. The rest were purely circumstantial.</p><p> Being an expat (working outside one&#39;s home country) was the most positively influential factor. Reporting to a supervisor at a higher level than is typical had the least impact among the top 12 factors, but the effect was statistically significant.</p><p> Other factors included three of the four described earlier: having a high performance rating, being in a supervisory role, and reporting to a highly rated supervisor. In addition, working in certain functions or business lines mattered a lot to how one&#39;s career progressed.</p><p> Similar modeling showed that even the probability of receiving a high rating was inordinately influenced by situational factors. This finding suggested that performance ratings were not accurate measures of individuals&#39; contributions.</p><p> When ConsumerCo&#39;s leaders mapped the success profile to women in the company, they found that when women were positioned in situations conducive to their future progress, they usually fared as well as men. But overall, they were less likely to be so positioned. (See “Mapping Women&#39;s Experiences to a Success Profile.”) For instance, women who were expats were more likely to be promoted from those roles than otherwise comparable men, but women were less represented among the expat population.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Mapping Women&#39;s Experiences to a Success Profile</h4><p class="caption"> A global consumer products retailer identified the 12 attributes that most strongly influenced whether an employee would be promoted.

When they did have those roles, it did not help their careers to the same extent as comparable men, for reasons that were not clear. ConsumerCo leaders could see that female employees faced a double whammy of sorts: Not only were they blocked from this accelerator role, but they also didn&#39;t get the same lift to their promotion prospects as their male colleagues when they did have that role.</p><p> When the company looked at people of color, it found that they tended to be both less well positioned and less valued than White employees. ConsumerCo needed to change its internal labor market dynamics to achieve career and pay equity for women and people of color.</p><h3> A Checklist for Change</h3><p> Focusing on situational factors has a distinct advantage: They&#39;re easier to address than individual characteristics. For instance, although tenure is an important driver of success, it is a fact of people&#39;s employment history, not something that ConsumerCo could change overnight.</p><p> Still, ConsumerCo identified several areas where it could act reasonably quickly, such as changing reporting relationships for women and people of color, finding opportunities for them to gain more supervisory experience earlier in their careers, and addressing the disparities in performance ratings for people of color.</p><p> The company had found that taking a leave of absence thwarted career advancement, especially for women, and so it is also developing new leave and career development policies to address imbalances for that group.</p><p> Here&#39;s where the “proactive” part of PCM comes in.</p><p> The analysis of ConsumerCo&#39;s success profile made it possible to create a simple checklist of green lights (career advancers) and red flags (success blockers) that managers could use to evaluate the positioning of individual employees. By considering whether women and people of color on their teams were experiencing more green lights or red flags, line managers and supervisors could identify who was well positioned to stay and thrive, as well as who might be at risk of stalling in their career or leaving the organization. (See “Green Lights, Red Flags.”)</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Green Lights, Red Flags</h4><p style="margin-bottom:30px;"> A global consumer products retailer created a checklist of attributes that help or hurt employees&#39; career progress.

For each factor, they could effectively evaluate the situational reality of different groups and tailor their interventions to address the most significant gaps.</p><p> For instance, they found that female, Black, and Hispanic employees were less likely to be reporting to highly rated supervisors, while Asian employees were more likely to have this advantage. And although women were less likely to be reporting to a manager one grade higher than usual, there were no such disparities for people of color. Also, while every non-White racial group was significantly underrepresented in one of the core functions that most contributed to advancement, women were more likely to work in that function than men.</p><p> ConsumerCo is in the early stages of rolling out interventions to address its disparities. But other companies I have worked with have pursued a variety of solutions.</p><p> Closing gaps due to flexible work arrangements often requires changing the culture. In many companies, part-time work is looked upon as evidence of lower commitment, and it can be difficult to shake these perceptions. However, companies can make quick progress on pay if they stop factoring leaves of absence into the statistical models that they use to assess pay equity and adjust wages and salaries to close gaps.</p><p> Situation-based racial disparities in performance ratings have been reduced in some companies through the calibration process used to align ratings by different supervisors. Some have also eliminated forced rankings that provide for a very limited percentage of employees to receive top ratings. These tend to favor people with more tenure, whom supervisors have known longer, and presumably better — and who are more likely to be White.</p><p> Some clients have addressed the importance of supervisor roles by expanding training, both to reinforce the importance of these roles and to help supervisors understand the impact they have on employees&#39; prospects. Leaders can offer training to help women and people of color gain the experience they need to advance — and close the gap between women and men in these positions.</p><h3> Proactive Career Management Has Benefits and Risks</h3><p> Because a success profile is built from an organization&#39;s data, it is more likely to reflect reality than the assumptions that leaders make about how employees succeed. Leaders may be prone to thinking that what got them to the top could get anyone else there as well, and they may oversimplify their own path. Further, people tend to generalize based on their own experiences, even if they don&#39;t represent the organizational norm.</p><p> A good empirical model can counter the tendency of people to engage in wishful thinking or to cling to belief. It can also account for the effects of being in different business lines, functions, geographies, and job families. This is something that&#39;s hard to do based on personal observation and experience alone.</p><p></p><p> Another value of PCM is that it is grounded in what creates value for the business. If, for instance, a role becomes critical to growth, one would expect the employer to accord more value to that role and the employees who successfully deliver value in it. And to the extent that an organization&#39;s DEI strategy helps ensure that high-potential women and people of color are able to access these newly valuable roles and perform them ably, it will serve the greater business need.</p><p> If there is a downside to PCM, it relates to the sharing of sensitive data and intelligence. PCM proceeds from objective modeling of the drivers of success and how they affect different groups. Invariably, the models will surface potentially damaging information about the existence of systemic gender or racial disparities in outcomes and opportunities, which creates legal risk.</p><p> PCM works best when managers understand the realities uncovered by the models and the reasons why specific actions are warranted. Thus, it requires a reasonable level of transparency. Corporate legal departments may, however, object to exposing what they may believe to be strong evidence of bias and inequity.</p><p> There&#39;s a delicate balance to be achieved. Most organizations I work with accomplish it by sharing high-level information with business and line leaders, and sometimes employee groups, about the reasons for particular actions while restricting the more granular data to a smaller group of top executives and HR and DEI leaders. Legal counsel almost always presides over such decisions; however, such advisers have become more understanding of the need for data-driven DEI strategies, appreciating that people can&#39;t solve problems they don&#39;t know about or understand.</p><p></p><p></p><p> The unexplained disparities in career opportunity and advancement at many organizations are important to address because they signal the potential influence of bias and discrimination. But doing so should not override attention to differences that can be explained by legitimate, business-relevant factors. The surest, most sustainable way to create career equity and equitable representation across all levels of an organization is to address the organization&#39;s career development practices (or lack thereof) that systemically impede the progress of women and people of color.</p><p> Of course, the work that employees do, their knowledge and skills, and how hard and effectively they work influence whether they will succeed. But success is also determined by how individuals are positioned to succeed — and organizations can do better at ensuring that all high-potential talent can gain experiences that will set them up for growth.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/opening-access-to-the-fast-track-for-career-equity/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Empower Your Team, Empower Yourself</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/empower-your-team-empower-yourself/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/empower-your-team-empower-yourself/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 07 Jun 2023 11:00:24 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Russell Clayton, Andrew Artis, and Dejun Tony Kong. <p>Russell Clayton is an assistant professor of instruction, teaching MBA courses in the Muma College of Business at the University of South Florida.

With budgets tightening and workforce disruptions such as layoffs affecting many sectors, now is not the time for organizations to eliminate employee professional development and training. Likewise, individuals should continue to upskill regardless of whether organizational resources are plentiful. In this article, we explore ways that executives may approach learning and development (L&amp;D) spending, as well as strategies for employees to secure professional development funding.</p><h3> For Managers: How L&amp;D Can Keep Teams Competitive</h3><p> In this first section, we&#39;ll explore three key strategies for managers to effectively allocate resources for L&amp;D, even during difficult economic times. When they better understand the importance of such programs, leaders can make more informed decisions that benefit the organization in the long term.</p><p></p><h4> 1. Assess the risk of cutting L&amp;D budgets.</h4><p> When budgets are tight, L&amp;D is often among the first programs to suffer cutbacks. This frequently happens because training is perceived as the low-hanging fruit when it comes to justifying budget cuts. However, these types of short-term cost-saving measures may not be a wise strategic move for executives. Having well-trained employees is critical to staying competitive, and we encourage executives to assess the risks their organization will be taking should they decide to eliminate employee training dollars.</p><p> For example, organizations that cut L&amp;D spending may fall behind when the economy recovers compared with those that maintain their investments. As a result, workers could lack the critical skills needed for organizational success. Furthermore, investing in L&amp;D helps companies do more with less. The number of skills needed for a single job has increased 10% annually since 2017, according to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-02-03-gartner-hr-research-finds-fifty-eight-percent-of-the-workforce-will-need-new-skill-sets-to-do-their-jobs-successfully">research conducted by Gartner</a> . Those organizations that continue to prioritize upskilling will have employees who are up to date on the skills needed to accomplish their work, whereas organizations that significantly cut L&amp;D likely will not.</p><p> <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-survey/2020/reports/pwc-23rd-global-ceo-survey.pdf">PwC&#39;s annual CEO survey</a> found that companies with advanced L&amp;D programs in place had higher employee engagement and were better at attracting and retaining top talent. Executives must keep this in mind, even in the face of economic downturns, because slashing L&amp;D budgets can increase the risk of losing talented employees. As Josh Felperin, global sales director of Alps Controls, put it, “Investing in employees&#39; personal and professional development on a consistent basis should be any leadership team&#39;s No. 1 priority, not just financial results.”</p><h4> 2. Shift to framing L&amp;D as an investment.</h4><p> Managers need to consider L&amp;D as an investment rather than a cost. Think about how L&amp;D can generate revenue instead of being just another budget line item. For example, upskilling and promoting from within can save organizations money on recruitment and hiring. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, the average hard cost of recruiting a new employee is $4,700, with total costs — including soft costs such as time — amounting to two to three times the position&#39;s salary. Now imagine what your L&amp;D managers could do with just half of that dollar figure in terms of upskilling a current employee instead of hiring a new candidate. Not only are you saving on recruiting costs — you are also helping your organization close the skills gap that is plaguing many industries.</p><p></p><p> Finally, executives should view their <em>own</em> L&amp;D activities as an investment. In a tight economic environment, it might be tempting to cut both L&amp;D funds and the time dedicated to training. However, research has found a significant relationship between <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ijtd.12082">executive L&amp;D activities and organizational performance</a> .</p><h4> 3. Strategically prioritize the skills to be developed.</h4><p> When facing economic headwinds, budget reductions across all departments might be unavoidable, and we&#39;re not arguing that L&amp;D budgets should remain completely untouched. However, we do advocate for allocating funds to strategic training priorities. The reality is that some L&amp;D training may be postponed until the economy flourishes again. It might be necessary to prioritize hard skills, like project management or cybersecurity, over soft skills, like time management, in the short term. While we strongly support <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/12/20/the-surprising-thing-google-learned-about-its-employees-and-what-it-means-for-todays-students/">soft skills training</a> — they play a key role in every business — we understand that L&amp;D funds may need to be spent on immediate hard-skills training needs in order to keep your organization competitive.</p><p> Match your L&amp;D expenditures to your organization&#39;s KPIs. Amazon is a great example of a company that does this. Despite recent major layoffs, it continues to train employees in key areas through its Upskilling 2025 initiative, including hard skills like cloud computing services and machine learning. Regardless of which skills you value most, the imperative is to be sure you&#39;re providing training opportunities. “Organizations that are not investing in the development of their employees are working against themselves and tripping over their own feet,” Jon Sexton, senior vice president of culture and leadership development at Vibrant Credit Union, asserted.</p><p></p><h3> For Employees: Strategies for Securing Professional Development Opportunities</h3><p> Pursuing professional development opportunities in the workplace can be challenging, particularly when budgets are constrained. Instead of passively waiting for workshop and training opportunities to arise, employees need to be proactive in convincing managers of the mutual benefits of L&amp;D investments.</p><p> That said, asking for money when budgets are tight is never an easy conversation, particularly when L&amp;D is perceived as merely nice to have. We recommend the following approaches to prepare your case, shape a productive conversation, and secure funding for your professional development.</p><h4> 1. Align your goals with your organization&#39;s needs.</h4><p> To increase your chances of obtaining approval for professional development opportunities, frame your request by demonstrating how the training will support your team&#39;s objectives. If you can explain how it will move your team forward, you&#39;re more likely to gain your manager&#39;s support (and funding).</p><p></p><p> Take the case of Nick. His employer already had an in-house training team delivering Continuing Professional Education hours for accountants, so he didn&#39;t think it would sign off on an external CPE course that focused on reviewing skills. To justify the expense and need — given his position as a junior accountant at the time — Nick discussed how the course would benefit the firm <em>first</em> and himself <em>second</em> with the managing partner. Nick emphasized that the course would help the company maintain its commitment to providing accurate, reliable information to clients through specific training on how to avoid making common tax accounting errors. By making the compelling argument that the external training would provide critical skills to help the company achieve its mission, Nick was able to convince his manager that the training would be valuable and received the funding.</p><p> Similarly, when Amanda, an insurance professional, asked her manager to pay for her training to earn her claims adjuster license, she took what she described as a “help me, help my team” approach. Amanda made her pitch for professional development during a time when the team she was on was struggling. While her current job function was <em>not</em> that of a claims adjuster, earning the license allowed her to help her organization in an area that really needed assistance.</p><p> During your pitch, ask your manager how they would like you to share the knowledge gained from training. This might involve a one-on-one follow-up, sharing presentation materials or bullet points summarizing the training, or even hosting a workshop to review the material with your team. By being proactive in sharing what you&#39;ve learned, you further solidify the benefits of professional development for the entire team.</p><h4> 2. Bring your manager on board.</h4><p> As <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/learning-for-a-living/">Gianpiero Petriglieri has noted</a> , many organizations “are not as hospitable to learning as their rhetoric suggests.” While employees may be frustrated by managers who overlook learning or prioritize performance over all else, they can educate managers on the benefits that professional development can bring to the company by taking a tactful approach.</p><p> For example, one vice president at a large industrial services company was reluctant to see training as an investment, fearing that employees might demand a raise or even leave after the training. In truth, this belief is a myth, if not irrational. Employees are a greater flight risk when they do <em>not</em> see internal opportunities and have to look elsewhere for personal growth. After all, employees are humans who have the fundamental need to feel competent, and they appreciate arrangements that are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2015.08.002">customized to their skills and interests</a> . Employees can share third-party sources that emphasize the importance of targeted training to employee retention and engagement. For example, <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236438/millennials-jobs-development-opportunities.aspx">research from Gallup</a> suggests that professional development is a top factor in retaining millennials.</p><p> When discussing the topic with your manager, it&#39;s important to embrace a positive tone and remember that there might be resistance along the way. Shape the conversation in a way that focuses on how professional development increases the retention of valued employees. Be prepared to hear “no,” but probe to find out what might make your manager say “yes.” By understanding their concerns, you&#39;re better equipped to overcome those barriers. Consider asking questions like, “What would help you say yes?” or, “Would you worry about our competitor sending employees to this training?” This encourages your manager to consider the potential upsides of your request.</p><p> Three communication touch points are helpful for closing the circle when it comes to getting your manager invested in L&amp;D as a team resource. First, communicate clearly about the training you&#39;re seeking and gain permission to attend the training. Second, update your manager <em>during</em> the training, expressing your enthusiasm and gratitude. For example, you can send your manager a short status update on how the training is going and initial ideas you have to bring back to the team. Lastly, once the training is complete, acknowledge your manager&#39;s support when sharing your newfound knowledge with the team. By showing your excitement, you can inspire coworkers who also desire professional development.</p><h4> 3. Show your commitment to learning.</h4><p> When pitching your professional development request, consider providing several options, ranging from fully funded by the company to partially funded by you. Demonstrating your commitment to learning new skills, even if it means investing your own money, can make your request more persuasive.</p><p> Divya, for example, found a $2,500 training opportunity to develop the soft skills needed to better serve customers at her government agency job. Knowing that funding was limited, she proposed several options to her manager, including 100%, 50%, and 25% company funding. By having some skin in the game, Divya showed that she was serious about the training. In the end, her request was fully funded by the agency, but she was prepared to accept partial funding and cover the rest herself.</p><p> You can also show your commitment by exploring lower-cost or free opportunities before pursuing other options. An effective way to do this is to detail what you have learned so far through training options at no cost to your employer — and what skills or knowledge gaps still exist. Perhaps you want to earn a certification in data visualization. You can begin by completing online courses for free or at minimal cost, which can provide the foundational knowledge needed in this area and demonstrate your time investment. Then, explain to your manager what you&#39;ve learned and why additional, funded training is necessary to further your goals.</p><p></p><p> This collaborative negotiation process allows you to (1) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1571-9979.1999.tb00178.x">adopt an interest-based approach</a> , (2) help your manager <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60407-4">overcome psychological barriers</a> , and (3) <a href="https://doi.org/10.5465/amj.2012.0461">build trust</a> and mitigate your manager&#39;s perception of risk.</p><p></p><p> Prioritizing learning and development is essential for both managers and employees to help steer their organizations toward sustainable success and maintain a competitive edge. Even during economic uncertainty, strategic L&amp;D investments can boost employee engagement, close skill gaps, and foster growth. By recognizing the value of professional development and adopting a collaborative approach, leaders and employees alike can create a thriving learning culture that promotes individual and organizational success.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/empower-your-team-empower-yourself/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Do You Have a Corporate Philanthropy Strategy?</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/do-you-have-a-corporate-philanthropy-strategy/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/do-you-have-a-corporate-philanthropy-strategy/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 06 Jun 2023 17:00:01 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Ane Casajús-Burutaran, Tina C.

While management scholars have long pointed out the importance of corporate philanthropy, businesses&#39; approaches to it vary widely, and few have fully integrated it into their corporate strategy. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> This article examines the shifting landscape of corporate giving and the potential implications for businesses and their stakeholders.</p><p> As companies face growing pressures to incorporate purposeful social missions into their core businesses, leaders have gained experience managing initiatives aimed at social impact in addition to profit. While corporate social responsibility (CSR) is part of most companies&#39; business strategies, philanthropy often remains disconnected from core business objectives. This makes it challenging for leaders to discern what types of philanthropic engagement should be prioritized and why.</p><p></p><p> We define <em>strategic corporate philanthropy</em> as voluntary giving that builds on the company&#39;s core competencies to achieve social impact while improving its competitive edge — resulting in a win-win situation. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> The scope of corporate philanthropic engagement is vast. (See “Main Types of Corporate Philanthropy Engagement.”) Even though gift matching has led the way for many years in the US, Coca-Cola, Google, and Walt Disney are just a few of the many multinationals that now engage in more than one type of corporate philanthropy. IBM&#39;s Open Source Community Grant program (with annual contributions of $200,000), the Danone Ecosystem (an impact investment fund with over $200 million committed since 2009), and the Ikea Foundation (with unrestricted funding for selected nonprofits working on emergency relief) are examples of the great diversity of corporate philanthropic engagement.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Main Types of Corporate Philanthropy Engagement</h4><p> <strong>Community grants:</strong> The company supports local community efforts or nonprofits with financial or in-kind contributions.</p><p> <strong>Corporate foundations:</strong> The company establishes and funds an independent legal entity to manage its philanthropic projects. These can be directly operated by the foundation or co-led through partnerships or grant giving.</p><p> <strong>Corporate sponsoring:</strong> The company finances the events, projects, or programs of a nonprofit organization.</p><p> <strong>Gift matching:</strong> The company matches the charitable donation of an employee, usually at a 1-1 ratio.</p><p> <strong>Venture philanthropy:</strong> The corporation takes the principles of venture capital financing to select, guide, and support a charitable project. This is often done through a corporate foundation.</p></article></aside></div><p></p><p> Increasingly, companies are establishing corporate foundations, which are legally independent entities that work exclusively on philanthropic activities. This allows them to take a more systematic approach to giving and create a “philanthropic identity.” Examples include the Walmart Foundation (with annual giving of $1.5 billion) and the Chanel Foundation (supporting over 150 charitable organizations since 2011). However, guidance remains limited on what type of philanthropic engagement would best fit a company&#39;s strategy.</p><p> Corporate philanthropy has the potential to create multiple benefits for a business, including enhanced reputation, legitimacy, local integration, network creation, knowledge acquisition, institutional acceptance, and stakeholder trust. But it also bears risks. Thus, companies must think carefully about what, how, and where to engage.</p><p> Our research examines the various strategies companies are testing in the realm of corporate philanthropy. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> When building a corporate philanthropy strategy, a business&#39;s most important decisions revolve around three central issues: what topics to engage in, which parts of the company can support these efforts, and how to maximize impact. First, in terms of engagement, companies can either actively engage in the design, implementation, and evaluation of potential projects (operational), or provide the resources for another organization to take the lead (grant giving). This decision should be based on their knowledge and expertise in their respective field. The second decision is whether to house the project in an external entity, like a corporate foundation, or internally under a department like sustainability, HR, public relations, or partnerships. Lastly, the project must be anchored within the community to make a real impact, either through the company&#39;s own networks in the country or through local partners.</p><p></p><p> Our analysis offers a framework to assist managers in their decision-making process, enabling them to ask the right questions to understand the fit of a philanthropic project for their organization. Three dimensions need to be assessed.</p><p> <strong>Cognitive fit:</strong> <em>Does your company have the knowledge and expertise to engage in this social issue?</em> Corporate philanthropy, much like any business activity, demands specialized competencies; thus, companies need to be selective to maximize their impact. Tackling complex issues related to their primary industry is a good starting point because businesses already have expertise in dealing with customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. Prominent examples include the Loewe Foundation&#39;s commitment to creativity and craftmanship — aligned with its identity as a luxury fashion house — and Adidas&#39; focus on expanding access to sports for all.</p><p> <strong>Structural fit:</strong> <em>Can the project be linked to the internal structure of your organization?</em> Every project needs organizational support to be integrated with the company&#39;s corporate structure and processes, which will potentially involve CSR, HR, or logistics. But one unit or department has to be in charge of providing adequate economic, human, social, and intellectual capital. We find that different corporations develop very different structural solutions to manage their philanthropic activities. Roche decided to create a whole new department, called the Corporate Donations and Philanthropy department, integrated under the CEO&#39;s office. Inditex still carries out its philanthropic activities within its sustainability department, and Visa chose to manage its donations through the Visa Foundation, as an independent entity.</p><p> <strong>Contextual fit:</strong> <em>Is the company well anchored in the local community, and does it have access to it, in order to effectively design and implement the project?</em> Gaining access to the local context is critical for success — it enhances onsite decision-making capabilities and fosters trust among stakeholders. If the organization engages in a familiar context, it can better tailor social solutions to local needs and do so more efficiently. For instance, HSBC&#39;s Hongkong Bank Foundation has distributed over HK$2.4 billion ($305.8 million) to support the Hong Kong community, its home market. Another example is the eBay Foundation, which encourages its employees to volunteer and give within their local communities.</p><p> Answering these questions helps companies craft a corporate philanthropy strategy and determine the implications of alternative pathways. (See “Designing a Corporate Philanthropy Strategy.”) Our assessment framework can be used on individual projects and to systematically manage a portfolio. When planning and defining a potential philanthropic project, managers can answer the questions related to the three dimensions and consider the recommendations given for each option. For example, a US-based fintech company seeking to engage in research projects focused on Alzheimer&#39;s disease would have a low cognitive fit between the philanthropic project and company expertise. It would also have a low structural fit if it did not have an in-house department to support community outreach for medical issues. Additionally, the fintech firm would score low on contextual fit if it were to engage in a program in Somalia — a market in which it doesn&#39;t operate or have specific knowledge. Under these circumstances, a grant-giving strategy through an external body like a foundation would be advisable. As this case reveals, thinking about the three dimensions can help managers establish guiding principles for their corporate philanthropy strategy and set rules regarding what, how, and where to engage. </p><div class="callout-highlight callout"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4 style="line-height:1.5;"> Designing a Corporate Philanthropy Strategy: An Assessment Framework</h4><p class="caption"> Using a structured framework to answer key questions, companies can craft strategies that not only guide the development of potential philanthropic projects but also streamline the management of their philanthropic portfolios. </p><table id="Chart#" class="chart-grouped-rows no-mobile" style="width: 100%"><thead><tr><th style="width:23%;" class="white"> Dimension</th><th style="width:30%" class="white"> Assessment</th><th style="width:45%" class="white"> Evaluation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p> <strong style="font-size:larger;"><span class="blue">Cognitive Fit</span></strong><br /> (the “What”)</p></td><td><p> <strong>Does your company have the knowledge and expertise to engage in this social issue?</strong> </p></td><td><div style="vertical-align:top"><div style="background-color:#43BD29; width:15%; text-align:center; float:left;"><p> <span class="white"><strong>Yes</strong></span></p></div><div style="width:85%; float:right; padding-left:10px;"><p> Take an operational approach based on the company&#39;s knowledge and expertise.

Over time, however, the Adecco Group&#39;s philanthropic portfolio grew and became very diverse, requiring a detailed assessment across the cognitive, structural, and contextual fit of the programs. In 2021, the management team carefully selected the foundation&#39;s priority projects based on the questions provided in our assessment framework. Accordingly, other initiatives were given back to the company (and integrated into the respective departments), and some were entrusted to better-suited nonprofits to take forward. This strategic move allowed the Adecco Group&#39;s foundation, now called the Innovation Foundation, to redefine its corporate philanthropy strategy and develop a decision-making framework rooted in three principles:</p><p> <strong>Industry expertise (cognitive fit).</strong> The foundation now focuses exclusively on the domains of employment, skills, and the future of work — the business&#39;s areas of expertise. In addition to receiving financial support, it benefits from the knowledge, data, experience, and ecosystem of the Adecco Group. This mutually beneficial relationship ensures that the valuable outcomes and insights generated by the foundation are shared back to the company.</p><p> <strong>Tailored social innovation lab methodology (structural fit).</strong> The foundation developed a proprietary operating model that blends data-driven analysis, design thinking, and innovation to deliver user-centric solutions following an acceleratorlike process. Thus, projects that did not align with that format — such as grant giving and fundraising — were given back to the business. These projects were run in the marketing or sustainability department, contingent on their structural fit and their knowledge, personnel, and network needs.</p><p> <strong>Local knowledge (contextual fit).</strong> Because the Innovation Foundation focuses on projects with long-term impact — those that address the source of a problem rather than the symptoms — local partners and end users are involved at every stage. One example is the foundation&#39;s Women Back to Work project in Spain, where the continuous involvement of local organizations and beneficiaries ensures that the program incorporates a deep understanding of the real problems of women reintegrating into the workforce in that context. Once a project has been developed and tested in-house, it is spun off for a local partner organization to scale and create maximum impact.</p><p></p><p> In the year following the foundation&#39;s restructuring, the team pursued three projects aimed at boosting employability for women, young adults, and older employees. These initiatives have provided the company with insights and real-time data on the unmet needs and potential solutions for underserved populations in the labor market.</p><p></p><p> The Adecco Group&#39;s case demonstrates the power of a well-crafted corporate philanthropy strategy that is grounded in guiding principles. As corporate giving becomes increasingly important in today&#39;s business landscape, it&#39;s critical for companies to focus their efforts on maximizing their social impact as well as their competitive position. A well-executed philanthropic strategy not only benefits society but also strengthens an organization&#39;s market position by providing access to new knowledge and expanding the organization&#39;s network.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/do-you-have-a-corporate-philanthropy-strategy/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Making Investments in AI: Samsung&#39;s Hina Dixit</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/making-investments-in-ai-samsungs-hina-dixit/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/making-investments-in-ai-samsungs-hina-dixit/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 06 Jun 2023 11:00:22 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. <p>Sam Ransbotham ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ransbotham">@ransbotham</a> ) is a professor in the information systems department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College, as well as guest editor for <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> &#39;s Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy Big Ideas initiative.

Find out her five criteria on today&#39;s episode.</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I&#39;m Hina Dixit from Samsung Next, and you&#39;re listening to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> .</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Welcome to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> , a podcast on artificial intelligence in business. Each episode, we introduce you to someone innovating with AI. I&#39;m Sam Ransbotham, professor of analytics at Boston College. I&#39;m also the AI and business strategy guest editor at <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> .</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And I&#39;m Shervin Khodabandeh, senior partner with BCG and one of the leaders of our AI business. Together, <cite>MIT SMR</cite> and BCG have been researching and publishing on AI since 2017, interviewing hundreds of practitioners and surveying thousands of companies on what it takes to build and to deploy and scale AI capabilities and really transform the way organizations operate.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> On today&#39;s episode, we have Hina Dixit, an investor at Samsung Next. Hina, thanks for joining us.欢迎。</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Thank you so much. It&#39;s a pleasure being here with you.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Most of our listeners are likely familiar with Samsung — giant South Korean multinational, lots of consumer electronics — but people may be less familiar with Samsung Next, so let&#39;s start there. Can you describe what Samsung Next is and what your role is?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. Samsung Next is the private equity or venture capital arm of Samsung. We tend to be stage-agnostic, but at the same time, we have six focus areas where we invest. AI is one of them. We also invest in fintech, blockchain, and infrastructure, and media tech as well, along with health tech.</p><p> Along with these six focus areas, we tend to make more and more learned investments about the ever-changing, dynamic world as well. So if you or anyone has a cool idea, please feel free to reach out.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I should&#39;ve prepared more and had a few pitches ready so that we could&#39;ve put you on the spot here while we were recording and get you on record there. So, what, exactly, do you do, though?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I currently lead the AI investment segment area. If there is any deal which is associated with AI, I tend to lead that deal and also work on the investment strategy for Samsung Next.</p><p> When you head out to these startup demos, to these pitches and expos, you will see thousands of startups. Now, how do you ensure that you are focused on the right areas which matter to Samsung? It should also propel innovation further; [instead of simply] furthering the innovation, it should also be usable. So that&#39;s why having a paradigm will help you make those sound decisions, where you can actually prioritize certain areas ahead of time compared to other investors, and understand which of the current technologies will be booming, say, a few years from now. And accordingly, you tend to segment and understand that, OK, these are my top-priority areas.</p><p> At the same time, I&#39;m very, very passionate about mentoring entrepreneurs, mentoring fellow people in tech. I come from a tech background, so I can always understand the hiccups people face when they are moving from individual-contributor roles or management roles in these big techs and moving forward to a startup entrepreneurial journey. I love connecting with them and helping them out.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That&#39;s really wonderful, Hina. So I want to talk about both things you said, both the mentoring, but also I want to go back to how you pick an investment. I mean, obviously, where you&#39;re sitting, you are looking at thousands of opportunities probably, right? And so you mentioned there are some guiding principles in terms of how you prioritize where to focus and what fits strategically with Samsung, but tell us more about how you pick an investment once you&#39;ve already gone through that filter, that “OK, it&#39;s the right thing for the company. We want to do it.” Now you&#39;re actually evaluating an AI company. Tell us how you pick. What are the factors you consider?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I tend to focus on very important factors for me personally. Every investor out there has a very different way of investing. Some people are very intuition-driven, and I have seen such investors make really great decisions. Some people are very theory-driven, and some people tend to take it as they go.</p><p> I am a mix of all of them. I tend to make these sound, learned decisions where I&#39;m very comfortable and I know the space very well. One thing that is always very important for me is the team. Is there a right product-team fit here? Are these individuals capable of building these great products that they&#39;re promising? I think that is an essential parameter for me.</p><p> And then, moving on to the problem itself: Is this pain point really [going to be] valid in few years? The pain point has to be there. The next thing is the technical innovation. Now, that is important, because that serves as a mode for you, or mode for these entrepreneurs, right? Otherwise, any big tech [company] can just go in and create what they have created. We want to have a solid mode around these products that they&#39;re building and some sort of novelty.</p><p> And then, moving from technical innovation and the mode, obviously there has to be a decent market size. You might be building an awesome product, but at the same time, the market sizing [might be] very small. It becomes really hard to scale that kind of product. Even if it&#39;s not monetizable, it should be solving a very solid pain point, plus the impact of that particular solution has to be global. And that&#39;s another factor for me, where I tend to make my own decision that, OK, this is something which is going to change everything that we do today.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Tell us more about the team, because technology is one aspect, but how do you suss out both the capability of the team itself and then how well the team works with each other? I mean, a lot of startups have team issues, right?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Yeah.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> How do you look into that?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Sure. I think it&#39;s a very deep question, and I think it comes from my days at Apple. Apple has a very startuplike culture in some of their organization, and here I&#39;m speaking about the culture because there were so many learnings from them. When I started, there was a very open culture where people would come on the weekends to support and mentor you and help you. They wouldn&#39;t even ask for any kind of credit. They would help you move forward, and at the same time, they will not just stop there. They will empower you. They will connect you with the right connections across the organization.</p><p> I kind of felt that it is very difficult for people to be that selfless and just focus on making the product great, but I think that&#39;s what the spirit of Apple is, and I tend to see a similar spirit in founders if I know that they&#39;re very, very product-driven, or they&#39;re very, very goal-driven in terms of [their] team. Then I tend to get that sense, OK, these guys will support each other.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> You&#39;ve got some extensive experience in this area. You mentioned Apple a couple of times. Tell us a bit about how you got to where you are now from where you started.</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I come from a very humble family background. So while my dad would work very hard, I would help them out with our family business, which was a small public call office, or a PCO, where people [went] and used to make telephone calls. So I used to sit there, and I used to make those calls for people, handle the customers, and enable them to make these phone calls, and that was a very good learning point for me because I learned how to talk to people.</p><p> From being a very introverted child, I became very public-facing, right then and there. … Like, OK, these are my customers. They are top priority. I need to serve them, help them, and that&#39;s where I think some of these qualities that I [espouse] or these passions that I have — that I love helping people, I love solving conflicts — probably arise.</p><p> I did my high school from Kanpur [City in India], which is Mercy Memorial School, and after my high school, I went to a women&#39;s college because my parents were a bit conservative yet. I was the first girl in the entire family of my dad&#39;s side who went outside of the city in order to get an education.</p><p> It was immensely fun. It was a very safe and secure environment. Obviously, it was very competitive — we women tend to be very competitive — and at the same time, I made great friends there, and I learned so much from my classmates at that time. We used to trade on these various ideas, and we used to create these JavaServer Pages-based applications, web applications for online quizzing, test banks, writing educational articles.</p><p> I remember, even buying a Starbucks coffee at that time used to be a very, very far-off thought because it was so expensive for me, and I used to work multiple jobs at the same time. And then I was placed at Symantec six months ahead of graduation. So that took some pressure off of me, and Symantec was a great starting point for me. I was in their data loss prevention team. I learned significantly from all the mentors there. I still share great relationships with all of them. And then Apple happened, and the rest is history.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> One thing that&#39;s fascinating: As you were saying that, I was thinking about how you tied your exposure to customer service through that very early call office job.</p><p> At the same time, much of what we&#39;re talking about with artificial intelligence ... it strikes me that the kind of job that would be suspect or likely to be replaced, and I have to wonder, how does the next Hina Dixit come along without that experience if we don&#39;t have those introductory customer service-oriented jobs to learn those skills?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Yeah, I get the question. This has been a grave thought, and a lot of people are coming forward and discussing it. But I think AI is not going to replace people. AI is going to empower people, and that&#39;s the thought process I come from. Just because phones became relevant, it didn&#39;t mean that [the mail was] not relevant anymore. We still order Amazon packages, and we still get our bills in the mail and whatnot, and that&#39;s how I think we will be able to push mankind. That&#39;s how we keep on pushing each and every … mile toward the ultimate goal of humankind&#39;s future, right?</p><p> Moving to the ultimate goal there, I think nobody should blindly trust that, OK, AI is going to replace their job, but they should be able to learn about AI. And that&#39;s one of the things where I&#39;ve been focusing on: finding these really cool technologies which can help people ramp up on AI.</p><p> Like, why do people need to write any single piece of code in order to use AI? Why can&#39;t this be as simple as looking at an Excel sheet? Why can&#39;t this be as accessible [as a] user interface, which is very easily programmable by just any business user out there? So finding that kind of interface between AI and the current users, that is a very critical piece where I think investors should focus on, because the ultimate goal here is to normalize the usage of AI and make that publicly available and at the same time accessible as well.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I think this is a very, very good point. That vision you painted is actually quite appealing. It used to be, the human element of AI was around making the technology better, faster, cheaper, or [writing] the next-generation algorithm, which of course, we still do, but that&#39;s going to be more and more in the R&amp;D and innovation zone. I think, as you&#39;re saying, the usage of AI will go from humans&#39; role as programmers and writers of code to more working at that interface, of having these building blocks and connecting those building blocks that AI provides to solve existing problems, but more importantly, as you&#39;re saying, thinking about “What else can we do with this? How do you innovate, now that you have all this at your fingertips?”</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Yeah. I kind of think the same way, because anybody ... you know, think of Excel. Anybody can just jump into Excel and make applications out of it. I know there are a bunch of cool apps coming around productivity right now which are backed by AI.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Share with us a bit your view on the coolest areas of technology that you are looking at right now. What piques your interest these days with everything that&#39;s going on with cyber and Web3 and quantum computing and everything else? Can you share specific investments or areas you&#39;re looking at?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Sure. We are focused a lot on infrastructure pieces of Web3, and at the same time, we are also focusing a lot on the AI aspect of Web3. So can we use these decentralized systems in order to make compute efficient? That&#39;s a question that we are trying to … answer right now. We are also trying to dive in deeper on the health-tech side, where we want to digitize the normal health paradigm, and we want to empower users out there and give them more proper feedback, maybe in their diet, maybe connect them to the right agents or doctors or nurses.</p><p> The focus is on empowering the humans. That&#39;s where I think we are trying to focus. And then obviously there is meta-tech aspect, which is the metaverse. We&#39;re trying to understand, how easy would it be to convert any image into a 3D asset and place it in the metaverse? And then, how do we make this metaverse accessible, just like the real world?</p><p> It seems surreal, but at the same time, there&#39;s so much hard work and research for each and every aspect of this. We are also focusing a lot on the fintech perspective and trying to empower these LatAm [Latin American] countries, finding a way they can build very sustainable and safe credit-scoring systems in Asia, for example, [and in] India, East Asia, and LatAm countries. So building a lot of infrastructure around fintech in LatAm countries and Asian countries is another thing that we are focusing on.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Yeah, I think that infrastructure&#39;s particularly interesting because that is an area where artificial intelligence can make a difference, when you can get some scale through an infrastructure. It&#39;s one of those situations that it seems like it opens up new possibilities when the economics change — when things that were no longer possible become possible. Are there other things that you&#39;re working on that are next in the portfolio? What are we going to see from Samsung Next next?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> We are moving into robotics as well. I did invest in one of the companies, called Integral AI, and they are trying to use these large AI models or foundation models [to train] their robots. But at the same time, robotics is another area where we want to focus on the consumer robotics aspect, so any cool startups out there building these cool consumer robots, please feel free to reach out to us, and we&#39;ll be happy to jump in and help out.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Hina, we&#39;ve got a segment where we ask you a series of questions, and these are supposed to be rapid-fire. Just give us the first thing that comes to your mind.</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> OK.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> You&#39;ve got a past career that&#39;s over a decade of being involved in these technologies. What&#39;s your proudest AI moment? What&#39;s the thing in this portfolio that you&#39;re proudest of that involves AI?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I think I&#39;ll have to say Stability AI because before that, there were a lot of research communities around, but at the same time, there was no way that somebody could go and commercialize those research works. And I really value Emad Mostaque&#39;s work there — that he recognized this problem and he got these research facilities together in order to start commercializing and build more solid consumer end products.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> We&#39;ve been very positive about artificial intelligence today, but is there anything that worries you about AI?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I think one thing that worries me is that we have seen a recent burst of these large language model-based apps, and that does include ChatGPT. I love their work, but at the same time, there are other pain points. And then, obviously, there are copyright issues that we need to solve, there are security issues. So those are some of the other areas we are trying to focus on, and trying to understand how those pain points can be resolved.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your favorite activity that does not involve technology?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> It&#39;s basically gardening in my house. I just find that very therapeutic, and, secondly, I love playing with my dog, Jimmy. He&#39;s absolutely adorable.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What was the first career you wanted? What did you want to be when you grew up?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I have always wanted to be a startup founder. I was 8 when I manifested that … I would be a founder, I would be building great products, and I would be helping out other people. So ever since I was 8, [I&#39;ve been] chasing that dream.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your greatest wish for artificial intelligence in the future? What are you hoping we can gain from this?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> My biggest wish for AI would be enabling common sense in some way, because these large AI models, they do have some AI capabilities when they can be put together in conjunction. We know from the recent <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2204.02311">PaLM research paper that Google published</a> that, OK, there is a way of having these multiple multimodels work together in order to create more sensible information and reliable information out there for users to believe in, and they basically used it to train their robots.</p><p> So that&#39;s one application, but a lot can come forward from that particular research work that Google published, including chain-of-thought prompting as well. How do you use these several models to work together in order to perform better in real-world and unstructured environments? So that would be very cool to see.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> OK, yeah, that seems so exciting to me, too, because we originally had the generative AI adversarial models, where, yes, we learned how to play chess really quickly, or we learned through a game, but the universe that has expanded from the idea that we can have bazillions of these models working kind of with and against each other — that seems very natural to, well, the way that we as humans or current biology works. It seems like there&#39;s a lot of potential for that.</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Yeah, yeah.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Well, Hina, thanks for taking the time to talk with us today. I think that there&#39;s lots — actually, particularly from your background — that is inspiring to people. Thank you for taking the time to talk with us.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah, thank you so much.</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Thank you so much for having me.很高兴。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Thanks for listening.
