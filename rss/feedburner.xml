src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Raman-1290x860-1.jpg" alt="" /><br /></figure><p>随着经济衰退的威胁迫在眉睫，我们正在进入不确定性和快速变化的连续第四年。三年前，一场全球大流行颠覆了供应链，隔离改变了我们的工作方式。几个月后，种族正义的清算迫使企业做出前所未有的承诺，<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/inclusive-hiring-to-build-better-teams-period/">建立包容性组织</a>。持续的远程工作再次挑战了工作场所的现状，并在某些情况下成为了无障碍的工具。持续紧张的劳动力市场迫使企业重新考虑并调整其吸引顶尖人才的努力。现在，人工智能的进步将重塑每个行业几乎所有工作所需的技能组合。</p><p>所有这些变化使人力资源成为高管对话的中心，雇主对如何发现、培养和发展人才有了不同的思考。很快，技能就开始主导对话。从 2021 年 10 月到 2022 年 10 月，LinkedIn 网络平台上提及技能优先相关主题的帖子平均数量大约增加了一倍。雇主正在努力将技能置于其人才战略的中心——从招聘到晋升——这一点可以证明<a href="http://www.oneten.org/">OneTen</a>和<a href="https://www.businessroundtable.org/workforceskills">商业圆桌会议</a>等团体。由于许多商界普遍谈论可能出现的经济衰退，一个关键问题悬而未决：雇主如何保持对技能优先方法不断增长的投资，以最大限度地提高工人和企业的投资回报？</p><p></p><p> LinkedIn 的新数据为加倍努力以技能为先提供了令人信服的案例。 《 <a href="https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report">2023 年工作场所学习报告》</a>显示，Z 世代和千禧一代员工最有可能重视职业发展和技能建设的机会，甚至超过了工作与生活的平衡。调查结果还显示，内部流动性已成为最高管理层领导者的第二大劳动力优先事项，学习与发展 (L&amp;D) 领导者表示与高管的合作比以往任何时候都更加密切。</p><p>随着最年轻的员工要求技能驱动的职业道路和高管的关注，未能维持对技能优先人才战略投资的企业将被抛在后面。然而，在经济放缓期间，人们有一种倾向，即退缩并恢复到旧的、可预测的模式和策略。从本质上讲，企业的生存本能迫使许多人选择停滞而不是创新。在 2008 年经济大衰退期间，以前要求教育程度较低的工作坚持要求大学学位的做法（即所谓的<a href="https://www.hbs.edu/managing-the-future-of-work/Documents/dismissed-by-degrees.pdf">学位膨胀</a>）加速了。这种倒退通过增加招聘成本和流动率直接损害了企业的利润，同时加剧了少数人受益而多数人失去机会的经济格局。</p><p></p><h3>扩大多元化人才的机会</h3><p>如今，即使经济前景仍然不确定，企业领导者有机会以不同的方式做事，而且他们在扩大技能优先战略方面处于更有利的地位。无论您仍在努力吸引人才，还是您的招聘已显着降温，都有一些方法可以将技能优先的方法嵌入到您业务的各个方面，即使在经济放缓期间，也可以推动更强劲的长期成果。</p><p>寻找人员来填补空缺职位过去是一个繁琐的手动过程。如果没有复杂的方法来根据实际技能寻找和培养人才，大学学位就成为雇主用来验证候选人是否具备某些技能和能力的少数生硬工具之一，但它却将<a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat07.htm">大多数美国人排除在外。劳动力</a>，尤其是有色人种工人。</p><p>如今，我们可以使用比以往更多的数据来准确确定我们所需的技能，然后找到拥有这些技能的人员（无论是内部人员还是外部人员）。 <a href="https://economicgraph.linkedin.com/research/skills-first-report">LinkedIn 的数据</a>显示，接受这种转变并注重技能的组织可以看到巨大的影响：LinkedIn 上采取技能优先方法的组织可以将其人才管道扩大近 10 倍。雇主已经开始意识到这一点：LinkedIn 上超过 45% 的企业现在<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/skills-new-currency-ryan-roslansky/">明确使用技能数据</a>来填补空缺职位。</p><p></p><p>为了建立未来所需的多元化、高职能团队，雇主必须关注技能——这种方法对人才管道多元化也产生巨大影响。当雇主要求某职位拥有大学学位时，他们会自动排除 60% 的美国人，其中包括 76% 的非裔美国人和 83% 的拉美裔美国人。</p><p>从职位描述中删除不必要的学位要求是基于技能的人才获取的基础，但这还不够。人才招聘领导者还必须投资扩大采购渠道并修改招聘材料中的语言，以确保其包容性和吸引力。此外，面试问题和招聘流程应以第一天的职位所需的基本技能为基础，而不仅仅是证书或经验，并且应有意且公平地制定这些技能，以揭示这些技能。</p><h3>投资于学习和内部流动</h3><p>虽然聘用具备合适技能的新员工是技能投资的一种方式，但我们有机会重新关注支持现有员工的成长和发展，尤其是在招聘降温的行业。 LinkedIn 工作场所学习报告的最新调查结果表明，鉴于有效地将人才重新部署到优先业务领域的紧迫性再次凸显，2023 年可能成为扩大技能提升和内部流动计划的重要一年。事实上，调查结果显示，预算预测依然强劲，41% 的 L&amp;D 领导者预计今年的消费能力更强，只有 8% 的人预计预算会减少。</p><p>现在为员工投资技能和基于技能的职业道路可以带来回报。 LinkedIn 的调查结果显示，公司在三年内<a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/global-talent-trends">学习了工作技能的</a>员工保留率提高了近 7%。根据工作场所学习报告，在两年内进行过内部调动的员工有 75% 的可能性留在公司，而角色没有改变的员工有 56% 的可能性继续留在公司。</p><p>与技能优先的招聘类似，技能优先的人才管理要求公司对现有流程进行一系列补充性改变并投资新流程。推动技能优先的内部流动性的关键一步是定义特定角色所需和首选的技能以及跨角色的技能如何重叠。从那里，领导者可以帮助他们的团队建立稳健的职业道路，使员工能够通过培养和应用与其目标相符的技能来实现职业发展。最后，整个企业——更重要的是直接与员工——就可用的职业道路和获得这些职业道路所需的技能进行沟通和透明度，对于提高保留率和晋升率至关重要。</p><p>虽然技能提升和再技能计划的势头正在增强，但显然需要加快进展。 LinkedIn的调查结果显示，40%的公司仍处于早期阶段，向利益相关者出售他们的项目并组建他们的团队； 54% 处于中期阶段，正在开发和启动项目；只有 2% 的人表示他们已经完成了一个项目。百分之四的人根本没有开始。</p><p></p><p>除了运营变革之外，培育包容性、以学习为导向的文化也是公司正在做出的核心转变。通过与领先雇主客户的合作，Grads of Life 了解到，要确保代表性不足群体的员工留在公司并在公司内成长，需要的不仅仅是对 L&amp;D 的财务投资。该组织的研究揭示了黑人人才与白人人才<a href="https://gradsoflife.org/equity-career-advancement-insights-from-underrepresented-employees/">在薪酬和晋升方面存在差异</a>。至关重要的是，除了运营变革之外，组织还应投资变革管理并消除薪酬和晋升系统中的偏见，以加强组织文化。对于大多数雇主来说，采用基于技能的方法来招聘和保留人才与现状有很大不同，而面临将其付诸实践的实施团队需要指导、培训和支持才能取得成功。</p><p></p><p></p><p>在阴云密布的经济预测中，首席执行官们正在谨慎地平衡哪些方面要撤退，哪些方面要加倍努力。投资于技能优先的方法来培养优秀人才并培养他们已有的优秀人才不仅可以帮助他们度过当前的风暴。将技能作为公司战略的核心将使您的员工队伍在所有工作不断变化的世界中保持长期的适应力。</p><p> LinkedIn 的数据显示，自 2015 年以来，<a href="https://linkedin.github.io/future-of-skills/#explore">工作技能组合已经发生了约 25% 的变化</a>，到 2027 年，这一比例将翻倍——这意味着今天的工作所需的核心技能与仅仅几年前的同一份工作看起来非常不同前。今天，我们即将进入的人工智能新时代可能会进一步加速这一变化，82% 的领导者承认他们的员工将需要新技能来<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/will-ai-fix-work">采用人工智能的新工作</a>方式。</p><p>现在，当大海波涛汹涌时，那些准备在这个新的工作世界中取得成功的企业领导人将展示如何做到这一点。现在不是等待更好的条件来做出改变的时候。对于企业来说，现在是更新思维、通过关注技能型劳动力来应对挑战的最佳时机。</p><p></p>

Ransbotham：</strong>我们知道人工智能工具正在增强人类的表现，但人们对此有何真实感受？在今天的节目中，了解一家公司如何在考虑最终用户的情况下开发 AI 工具。</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins：</strong>我是来自英特尔的 Elizabeth Anne Watkins，您正在听<cite>我、我自己和 AI</cite> 。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>欢迎收看<cite>我、我自己和 AI</cite> ，这是一个关于商业人工智能的播客。每一集，我们都会向您介绍一位利用 AI 进行创新的人。我是 Sam Ransbotham，波士顿学院分析学教授。我还是<cite>《麻省理工学院斯隆管理评论》</cite>的 AI 和商业战略客座编辑。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我是 Shervin Khodabandeh，BCG 的高级合伙人，也是我们人工智能业务的领导者之一。自 2017 年以来，<cite>麻省理工学院 SMR</cite>和 BCG 一直在研究和发布 AI，采访了数百名从业者，并调查了数千家公司，了解如何构建、部署和扩展 AI 功能，并真正改变组织的运作方式。</p><p><strong>山姆·兰斯博瑟姆：</strong>欢迎。今天我们有一位伟大的客人：伊丽莎白安妮沃特金斯，英特尔的研究科学家。伊丽莎白，感谢您今天加入我们。让我们开始吧。</p><p><strong>伊丽莎白安妮沃特金斯：</strong>非常感谢你今天邀请我。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>作为世界上最大的半导体制造商，英特尔可能是大多数人都已经知道的公司，但是您能给我们介绍一下英特尔实验室的总体情况，也许还有您的具体职责吗？</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins：</strong>正如您所说，目前围绕 AI 和 AI 行业以及 AI 领域的大型讨论中，我们并不总是最重要的，但英特尔内部正在开展许多引人入胜的工作，我们有这样一个对该领域的独特视角和进入该领域的独特方式，我很高兴今天能在我们的谈话中介绍其中的一些内容。</p><p>我去年 8 月刚刚加入英特尔，与这么多不同的团队会面已经是一次非常不可思议的经历。我作为人工智能社会科学的研究科学家加入了英特尔，并在英特尔实验室的 Lama Nachman 手下工作。该小组称为智能系统研究。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>伊丽莎白，你提到英特尔实验室正在用人工智能做一些独特的事情。您介意与我们分享您正在做的一些事情吗？</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins：</strong>我特别兴奋的一个项目叫做 MARIE，它是工业环境中多模态活动识别的首字母缩写词。所以基本上，我将从一个比喻开始：想象一下，你的电脑可以看着你组装，比方说，你在互联网上订购的一件家具。当你读到手册的难点时，或者你拿着螺丝刀，拿着一块胶合板，你无法回到手册，想象一下你的电脑可以看到你在做什么，知道手册要告诉您[做什么]，然后帮助您将这两者联系起来。想象一下，你的计算机实际上可以告诉你，“嘿，我想你要把架子 A 拧到支架 B 上，”或者类似的事情。而且我知道，每次我收到他们说里面有一把扶手椅的扁平包装时，我都很难从 A 地到 B 地。</p><p>我们的员工在我们的设施内进行的正是这些过程，他们实际上是在建造和制造半导体芯片。因此，在我们工厂内部工作的人，我们的技术人员，正在做非常复杂和非常精细的工作，为工厂车间发生的各种手动操作处理零件和工具。因此，他们所做的所有工作与将扁平背包放入扶手椅一样复杂——有时甚至更复杂。涉及到很多工具。有各种不同的工艺，不同的设备，不同尺寸的设备。因此，我们正在构建的计算机系统有点像我描述的那个说，“嘿，你的意思是把螺丝 A 放到支架 B 上吗？”我们正在构建系统来帮助我们工厂内部的人员完成这种非常仔细和非常复杂的工作。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>实际上，这是一个有趣的类比。我的意思是，我想我们都觉得扁平包装很有挑战性，也许吧，尽管我不得不承认我有点喜欢它们。但我敢肯定，英特尔内部的情况要复杂得多。我喜欢这个例子的一点是，我觉得我们经常谈论自动化：我们能否让机器学习如何做人类所做的事情？这是机器学习 [ML] 的核心。然后我们谈论增强，以及机器如何帮助人类做出决定？这让我觉得有点不同。这是下一步。</p><p>所以在这种情况下，我们不会试图让机器组装扁平包装。我们并不是要让机器组装半导体。仍然是人类在做这件事。因此，需要在这里学习的是人类。这似乎比我们之前讨论过的更进一步。</p><p><strong>伊丽莎白·安妮·沃特金斯：</strong>山姆，我很高兴你明白了这一点。这正是我们在英特尔实验室内部谈论的，即人类是专家。人是知道如何与这些系统交互的人，他们知道如何将这些位拧在一起。他们知道将这些微小且非常精密的组件组合在一起所需的所有物理和动态复杂性。</p><p>我们不想训练计算机来做那件事。计算机<em>无法</em>做到这一点。这种组装和清洁过程的方式——因为，当然，所有这些过程都发生在这些超级洁净室里，每个人都必须穿着防护服和手套……我们想支持正在做这件事的人。没有计算机可以做到这一点。这需要人为判断；需要人类的专业知识才能以全面、真正动态并能够应对新压力的方式进行这些过程。</p><p>如果机器的较大部件以特定方式弯曲，或者如果螺钉以特定方式掉入孔中——计算机将需要很多很多年才能评估、诊断和修复这些类型的持续动态问题.但你知道谁真正擅长这样做是人类。因此，我们正在努力以人为本，以人为本。这表明我对 MARIE 感到非常兴奋的双重原因是，既有技术方面，也有人性化的一面。在技​​术方面，我认为 MARIE 非常令人兴奋，因为它是多模式的。它通过环境感应结合了许多不同类型的人工智能系统。它将使用活动识别的计算机视觉与音频传感相结合，并与自然语言处理 [NLP] 相结合，以一种可以帮助在技术人员周围构建周围环境的方式，最终帮助他们 [with] 他们所做的事情。</p><p>但在系统可以帮助他们 [with] 他们所做的事情之前，系统必须真正学习，并且是人类专家教系统如何学习和教系统它需要知道的东西。因此，据我所知，这是一种将人工智能系统部署到新领域并将其应用于新问题的全新方法。 ......我们正在面对和应对人工智能发展的一大挑战，即数据收集。</p><p>您需要大量数据才能进入新域。您需要大量以适当方式标记的数据，根据您要解决的问题类型进行标记。因此，我们有点颠倒了脚本：我们没有在部署系统<em>之前</em>尝试获取所有数据，而是继续部署一个系统，然后与当地专家合作，他们教授系统——通过大声说话和通过动态数据标签——他们教会系统它需要知道什么。因此，希望用于帮助人们完成这些任务的数据将由第一批使用该工具的人生成。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>这似乎是一个很好的类比，因为正如你所说，它让我想起了如果是一个新的人类合作伙伴加入该项目你会怎么做。你会经历那些相同的步骤。</p><p> Shervin 和我进行了一些研究，我们发现<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/achieving-individual-and-organizational-value-with-ai/">60% 的人将 AI 视为同事</a>，而这正是您所描述的那种关系。但这让我想到了这里的一点危险。假设当你把那个系统放在那里时，它知道的不多，而且你已经让人类训练了它们。好的;我是一个人。我觉得我有点恼火。我想，“为什么我必须如此努力地训练这个同事？”你如何保持这种活力？你提到这个项目有技术方面，但也有社会方面。我觉得这在社交方面可能比在技术方面更难。</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins：</strong>这正是我接下来要谈的，因为这正是我要做的。我开始与人们谈论他们对这些系统的实际想法——你是对的。有时他们确实觉得这很烦人，他们会问，“等等——所以我把这个非常复杂的乐器放在一起，系统问我在做什么，这是<em>错的</em>？那么我应该如何不仅花时间做我的工作，还要教这台机器如何做我的工作呢？”</p><p>所以我真的很高兴我能成为实地的社会科学家。我们仍在深入开发，当然，在部署某些东西之前，以及当真正的部署原则出现时，公司通常会尽可能多地进行测试——比如用户体验和用户界面设计——那些通常更接近开发过程的结束。但在这里，社会科学和对人们需要什么、人们可能会觉得烦人的东西以及他们需要信任与他们合作的机器的理解是开发的 DNA。因此，我不断地与我们为其构建系统的技术人员交谈，并向他们提出问题，就像您所描述的那样，问他们，“您认为这很烦人吗？这怎么可能更有帮助？我们可以在系统中构建哪些其他可供性，以使其对您更有帮助？”</p><p>并且还提出更深层次的问题，不仅是关于他们与系统的二元关系，而且还关于他们更大的社会技术工作背景。询问，比如，“你的日程安排是什么样的？”以及，“你们的老板对这个系统有什么看法？”并且，“有没有一种方法可以让我们尝试通过这个系统促进更富有成效的关系，不仅是与你的老板，还有与你的其他同事？”因此，我们的目标是建立一个非常深刻的理解，不仅仅是对一项任务，而是对整个工作空间，并询问我们的系统如何通过成为这个空间内人类的同事，以最佳方式帮助扩大人类潜能, 但也 [问], “如何在了解他们的工作环境的情况下建立它以促进长期关系？”</p><p>因为我们依靠人们提供数据并依靠人们帮助我们实际进行数据标记这一事实所要求的其中一件事是我们需要他们参与，我们需要他们喜欢与系统，我们需要他们发现它值得信赖、可靠和有用。要了解如何实现所有这些目标，需要深入了解社会背景、社会习惯、工作习惯和任务流程。所以这正是我们现在正在做的事情。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我认为你的想法似乎不仅仅局限于这个项目，这真的很有趣。有“好吧，我如何让这个特定项目到位”的元素，但是你正在谈论的很多事情的基础是，“我们如何找出最好的方法来引入，本质上，一个新系统？我们如何找出转变和实现我们整体愿景的最佳方式？”这超越了单个项目。你是如何尝试学习这些课程的？</p><p><strong>伊丽莎白安妮沃特金斯：</strong>这是一个非常好的问题。我真的为我们的实验室和我们在人类与 AI 协作方面所做的一些重大赌注感到自豪，以及有多少来自社会科学的投入、贡献和见解正在被采纳，并且在英特尔历史上一直被采纳，在他们的整个研究项目中。当我们在教育、制造和无障碍等垂直领域开展研究项目和构建产品时，各个团队都进行了深入投资，以促进和鼓励与像我这样的人——与社会科学家进行对话。</p><p>我们经常把这些非常棒的团队聚集在一个房间里，那里有工程师、数据科学家、政策制定者和社会科学家，不仅包括我，还有一个由人类学家 Dawn Nafus 领导的优秀团队，以及另一个社会科学家团队那有心理学家。我们所有人都非常紧密地合作，以确保我们构建的产品不仅是为了解决一个问题而设计的，而且它们是围绕最佳解决方案进行适当设计的，我们利用我们的所有不同类型的多模式可供性工具可以提供，并且我们深刻理解我们所有产品将部署到的社会和组织环境。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>我认为，在我们第一次谈论这些模型和工具与使用数据之间似乎经常发生一种转变：事情非常注重数据和工具，同时又非常注重科学。这很有意义，因为我们不知道如何做其中的一些事情。现在，作为一个社会，我们正在学习如何使用这些工具和模型建筑。但是你在那里提到的很多团队——人类学、心理学——这些并不是我们可能认为 [as] 是生产 AI 应用程序不可或缺的传统事物，但这些正是你碰巧提到的。你为什么选择那些？我猜这是你的一些社会科学背景，对吧？</p><p><strong>伊丽莎白·安妮·沃特金斯 (Elizabeth Anne Watkins)：</strong>是的，在我的研究生学习和博士后工作中，我一直非常关注用户和人。我总是对人们可以多么古怪、多么有创造力和多么创新，以及人们如何经常以他们的开发人员没有预料到和没有预见到的方式使用技术着迷。</p><p>虽然这其中有一些危险因素，正如我们在各种滥用和双重用途应用程序中看到的那样，但人们也已经找到了很多非常奇妙和美妙的方法，让技术更适合他们在他们的上下文或为他们工作更顺利一点。因此，看到英特尔有何不同，因为他们作为半导体制造商的历史，对硬件的深入投资以及采用生态系统方法来部署人工智能工具的方式，真的向我展示了他们是一家关心的公司，就像我一样，关于将要使用这些工具的人以及这些人所处的社会结构，以及构建不仅可以匹配购买或使用这些工具的人，还可以匹配这些技术所融入的生活和社区的工具会被插话。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong> Elizabeth，很明显，正如我们一直在讨论的那样，您已经了解了很多背景，但我们能否退后一步，问一下您是如何最终担任英特尔实验室的这个角色的？</p><p><strong>伊丽莎白·安妮·沃特金斯 (Elizabeth Anne Watkins)：</strong>我想我担任这个角色的道路很早就开始了，可能是在我研究生生涯的开始。在我毕业于麻省理工学院并开始攻读博士学位后。在哥伦比亚大学，有人可以为一个关于记者安全和隐私行为的项目做出贡献。我的导师说，“嘿，我给你安排了这个项目的面试。”我说，“我对安全和隐私一无所知。”她说，“去面试吧。我给你面试了去吧。”所以在面试的前一天晚上，我想，“哦，我最好有话要说。 PGP — Pretty Good Privacy — 每个人都在谈论 PGP。我最好下载 PGP，这样我就可以假装我知道 PGP 是什么。”我试图弄清楚，但这很难。我想不通……我去了网站，我想，“网站并没有真正解释这里发生的事情。钥匙在哪里？我下载了密钥，但密钥也保存在数据库中，但我将密钥写在我的电子邮件中？哦，我好……我做不到。我很不擅长这个。这不适合我。”</p><p>第二天我接受了出色的项目负责人 Susan McGregor 的采访，我说，“你知道吗？这份工作不适合我。我试着做 PGP；这太难了。有一些关于它的东西，我只是......我不能完全理解这种语言。她说，“我认为这让你非常适合这份工作，因为我们正试图弄清楚为什么安全和隐私对工作人员来说如此困难，尤其是记者，他们是许多不同行为者攻击的高价值目标，我们正在努力弄清楚如何为他们制定更好的安全和隐私协议，所以听起来你对安全的设计方式感到沮丧。”我说，“是的，那令人沮丧。”她说，“好吧，让我们做点工作吧。”</p><p>所以我们最终一起工作了几年，研究记者。我们有一个特别令人痛心的项目，研究发表巴拿马文件的记者。为此，他们拥有数 TB 的数据。有记者在世界各地工作；他们都没有在同一地点，也没有一次突破口。他们从来没有一次泄露所有这些数据。因此，我们将其视为一个成功的故事。我们说，“好的。我们总是听到有关数据泄露和攻击的坏消息；我们从来没有听说过成功的故事。”因此，我们采访了为巴拿马文件撰稿的记者，并与他们讨论了他们的组织文化，以及让所有记者统一协议如何有助于灌输团队合作意识和相互保护的意识。看到文化的力量和围绕像 PGP 和安全协议这样困难的行为的共同使命......这真的很鼓舞人心。</p><p>大约在那个时候，我开始关注面部识别，从那里开始关注人工智能并围绕“为什么这很难理解？”提出类似的问题。我们如何才能以更具战略性的方式将其传达给人们，从而更好地了解他们正在做的工作和他们需要做的工作？我们如何才能以一种对真实的人有意义和可以理解的方式为这些系统带来一些透明度？”</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>其中一件有趣的事情是，安全总是那样。如果做起来有点困难，那么我们都倾向于不去做，因为这是明天的问题与今天的问题的对比。 ......这是我们人类最可怕的事情。而且你知道，我认为我们在很多方面都失败了 [at] 没有将其构建到基础架构中，因此它是默认设置。人工智能有很多类比：我们正在构建东西，如果我们不让默认设置易于使用或容易做正确的事情，那么人们就会做错事——或者人们会做容易的事事情或短期的事情。你提到了面部识别：我们应该在我们的基础设施中构建什么样的东西，这样我们才不会传播基于 AI 的错误？</p><p><strong>伊丽莎白安妮沃特金斯：</strong>这是一个很好的问题。在我的研究生生涯和在英特尔的整个研究生涯中，推动我的研究的是一种认识，即人们是自己生活中的专家，我们确实需要在整个开发流程中与人们和用户互动，以便构建不仅仅是系统，还有解决方案，以及针对实际发生的实际问题的解决方案。一家公司尽可能地包括社会科学的专业知识，以及社会科学家可以带来什么严谨而强大的工具来研究人们的生活方式、他们使用的语言种类、他们拥有的价值观种类以及什么对他们来说真正重要他们以及他们想要保护的东西和他们想要保持安全的东西，以及将不同种类的选择和不同种类的途径构建到同一技术中，这些技术可能会被不同级别的人以不同的方式使用，这些都是我很乐意看到整个领域都占据一席之地。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong><em>听起来</em>不错。我的意思是……就像低买高卖听起来不错。公司实际上是如何做到这一点的？他们需要采取哪些步骤才能在这些方面取得进展？</p><p><strong>伊丽莎白安妮沃特金斯：</strong>这是一个很好的问题。我们在英特尔做这件事的方式是，我们正在促进我们的技术团队之间的对话——他们正在围绕机器人技术和辅助工具和教育工具构建真正令人惊叹的系统——并将社会科学家嵌入所有这些团队，以便我们可以问关于“嘿，这个系统的假设是什么？”的一些问题？你和老师谈过吗？您是否与将要在地面上使用该机器人的人员交谈过？您与这些解决方案的服务对象之间的对话是怎样的？”</p><p>我真的很幸运，我能处在这样一个地方，我们将这种专业知识嵌入到问题制定阶段和项目制定阶段，贯穿整个开发流程。我也很高兴英特尔与负责任的 AI [咨询] 委员会一起建立了道德影响评估流程。因此，这是一个稳健而严格地构建开发管道的过程，整个英特尔和所有业务部门的团队 [使用]。这是一种注入专业知识的方式，不仅是社会科学家，还有负责任人工智能 [咨询] 委员会的每一个人，包括工程师和政策制定者以及法律界人士和标准界人士，并促进与这个多学科负责任人工智能的对话 [咨询] 通过提交道德影响评估与开发团队协商。</p><p>道德影响评估是我们将价值观付诸实践并确保围绕人类监督、人权、隐私、安全、保障以及多样性和包容性的价值观的一种方式——这些是我们确保将这些价值观融入其中的方式英特尔 BU [业务部门] 在整个组织中整合的工具。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>好的，我们有一个环节，我们向客人提出一系列五个快速问题。只需回答您想到的第一件事。第一：你最自豪的 AI 时刻是什么时候？</p><p><strong>伊丽莎白安妮沃特金斯：</strong>哦，天哪。这是一个很好的问题。我真的很自豪能够向正在构建这些系统的这些工程师和数据科学家团队代表我们在场的技术人员的声音。由于英特尔构建的流程，我可以与正在构建计算机视觉、动作识别和 NLP 的工程团队坐在一起，选择围绕任务的语义框架中的短语，以及任务是如何构建的以及如何构建的他们可以得到认可，能够像我对技术人员进行的采访那样，在引入这项技术时询问他们的担忧，我们可以做些什么来确保他们的担忧得到解决，询问他们需要了解的透明度，他们需要什么来信任这个系统，所有这些都是为了加强人们正在做的工作。</p><p>事实上，我可以获取这些信息并将其始终如一地提供给工程师，并查看他们的响应速度。就像，“哦，好吧，我们可以建造这个，我们可以建造那个。如果我们将其构建到 UI 中会怎么样？如果我们将其内置到对话中会怎样？”这是一个令人难以置信的令人信服的过程，尤其是在来自学术界之后，我会写一篇论文，然后需要一年的时间才能发表。进而 …</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>哦，一年听起来很快。</p><p><strong>伊丽莎白·安妮·沃特金斯：</strong>对。如果我幸运的话，需要一年的时间。我认为我最长的记录可能是 3.5 年才得以发表。我不知道。你的记录是什么？</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>呃，10。所以……</p><p><strong>伊丽莎白安妮沃特金斯：</strong>十！</p><p><strong>山姆·兰斯博瑟姆：</strong>是的。不过我们不要谈论它，因为我会很难过的。</p><p><strong>伊丽莎白安妮沃特金斯：</strong>哦，不。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>所以你提到了人们的担忧。你对人工智能有什么担忧？</p><p><strong>伊丽莎白安妮沃特金斯：</strong>嗯，当我开始与技术人员交谈时，他们最大的担忧之一是他们将被替换。</p><p>我说，“好吧，让我们谈谈吧。你觉得这是干什么的？”他们说：“我看到了新闻。我知道你正试图制造一个机器人来做我所做的事情，所以我想我正在训练我的替代者。”我想，“哦，不！这太可怕了。”我必须与我们的技术人员进行很多对话，我必须说，“那<em>不是</em>我们正在做的。我们不是要取代你。你是专家。我们需要你。事实上，我们需要你教系统，这样系统才能去帮助像你这样的人。因此，通过训练系统，您实际上是在帮助全球英特尔晶圆厂 [半导体制造厂] 的许多其他人，并且您确保他们以您希望获得帮助的方式获得帮助。”</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>几年前我和 Shervin 参与的一些研究完全集中在你提到的<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/expanding-ais-impact-with-organizational-learning">组织学习</a>方面——这是一种让每个人都能更快地学习和传播知识的方式。</p><p>您最喜欢不涉及技术的活动是什么？你的世界里有什么<em>不是</em>AI 的？</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins：</strong>嗯，最近发生了很多事情，有时似乎很难弄清楚什么是人工智能，什么不是。</p><p> [在]我的个人生活中，我做了很多烘焙工作。好久没做面包了。我经常做饭。我很幸运能和我的丈夫住在纽约市，所以我们进行了很多探索——事实上，只是走出去。这可能是最大的非人工智能活动，用我们自己的两只脚走到外面，用我们自己的眼睛环顾四周。那总是让人耳目一新。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>你年轻时想要的第一份职业是什么？你长大后想做什么？</p><p><strong>伊丽莎白安妮沃特金斯：</strong>我想成为一名艺术家，这是一条颠簸曲折的道路。我在加州大学欧文分校读本科，我学的是视频艺术。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>你对人工智能未来最大的愿望是什么？</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins：</strong> AI 可以做很多人类做不到的事情，但也有很多人类可以做而 AI 做不到的事情。我认为这是一个巨大的挑战，至少对我来说是这样，我希望在未来几年与我共事的人能够弄清楚这种平衡到底是什么，以及我们如何系统化“人们真正做的是什么”需要人工智能系统可以做的帮助吗？”但要真正透彻地了解人们在做什么以及他们是如何做的。</p><p>现在人工智能系统变得如此先进，但通常是在实验室或真空中，随着它们在现实世界中成熟，我认为它们可以做的事情真的很令人兴奋，但我们面临着大量的工作来获得它们那里。我认为其他社会科学家和多学科团队（例如我们在英特尔的团队）将共同努力，以确保这些系统真正能够作为解决方案进行部署。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>这对于这一集来说是一个很好的上限。感谢您与我们交谈。我认为已经发生的事情之一是，你在谈论你正在做的项目和事情，但你也给了我们一个暗示，当我们离开时，未来会发生什么比方说，以工具为中心的“我们能得到正确的机器学习吗？我们能得到正确的模型吗？我们能得到正确的数据吗？”你谈论了很多关于接下来会发生什么，一旦我们勾选其中一些复选标记会发生什么 - 这些检查是什么？我认为很多人都可以从中学习。感谢您今天抽出时间与我们交谈。</p><p><strong>伊丽莎白·安妮·沃特金斯：</strong>天哪，真是太高兴了。</p><p><strong>萨姆·兰斯博瑟姆：</strong>感谢您的聆听。下次，我和舍文将与来自 Aboitiz Data Innovation 的 David Hardoon 进行交谈。我们再次谈论化学工程，所以你不会想错过这个。</p><p><strong>艾莉森·莱德：</strong>感谢您聆听<cite>我、我自己和人工智能的演讲</cite>。和您一样，我们相信关于人工智能实施的对话不会从这个播客开始和结束。这就是为什么我们在 LinkedIn 上专门为像您这样的听众创建了一个群组。它被称为 AI for

The majority of entertainment revenue already goes to a very small percentage of artists. This is the <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2014/03/05/toponepercent/">reality for musicians</a> , especially on <a href="https://themusicnetwork.com/few-artists-generate-most-streams/">streaming services</a> , and is echoed in Hollywood in the huge <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/655480/all-time-top-grossing-actors-box-office/">box office revenues</a> generated by a handful of leading actors in blockbuster films. When you get an “algorithmic economy,” Taplin said, “the algorithms narrow the funnel, with outsize paychecks for a few.” He&#39;s hopeful that a collective licensing regime — similar to what&#39;s in place for music sampling — will emerge to protect artists when their content is used to train generative AI.</p><h3> Embracing Generative AI, With Some Concerns</h3><p> Yves Bergquist is director of the AI &amp; Neuroscience in Media Project at USC&#39;s <a href="https://www.etcenter.org/">Entertainment Technology Center</a> , which is funded by Hollywood studios. You can guess that his opinion of generative AI is probably much more favorable than Taplin&#39;s. It is, although he said he does have some concerns about AI&#39;s potential effects on the media and entertainment industry: “It&#39;s a completely revolutionary technology” characterized by misinformation and “some insanity.”</p><p> We asked Bergquist whether movie studios would embrace generative AI. Parts of them are already doing so, he said. “Some groups within the studios are highly technologically savvy, such as the chief technology officers and all of the visual effects artists and technicians. They are very sophisticated and are already working with generative AI companies. The studios do a lot of the postproduction work in films — particularly in animation — and there is a lot of pressure to bring costs down. The postproduction companies have a software development culture, so they will embrace generative AI.”</p><p> He also believes that many production companies will embrace the technology because they are already shooting on large LED-based screens and will need generative images for them. Bergquist said he expects that tools offering virtual actors and voice synthesis will be most aggressively adopted by short-form creators who distribute their work on TikTok or YouTube and by video game producers. “Streaming channels, digital ads, games — that&#39;s what kids watch these days,” he noted. “The media industry no longer has a monopoly on entertainment.” Makers of hardware (such as cameras) are experimenting with generative in-camera visual effects as well.</p><p></p><p> The business side of traditional movie studios is sometimes more reluctant to embrace AI, Bergquist observed, simply because they don&#39;t have the same kind of culture of data or software. “It&#39;s being bolted onto organizations and people who aren&#39;t ready,” he said. Even the new streaming studios, like Netflix and Prime Video, have experienced a lot of growing pains in their AI journeys.</p><p> Bergquist said that before the WGA strike started in May, many screenwriters told him that they view the likes of ChatGPT as a “great creative assistant tool” but not something that will replace human writers. “It&#39;s good at brainstorming ideas, but it will output only average content,” Bergquist asserted. “It&#39;s nowhere near capable of the symbolic abstraction necessary for script development, and it can&#39;t output a script with narrative structure and character arcs.” At least not now. Future language models with higher levels of intelligence and new paradigms for AI might be able to do so.</p><p></p><p> Bergquist thinks generative AI will have enormous effects not only on entertainment but also on education. He believes that schools, including the School of Cinematic Arts at USC, need to quickly ramp up their teaching to keep pace with the frenzy of new generative AI tools that are released nearly every week. Bergquist is preparing courses himself on the technology for the Society of Motion Pictures and Television Engineers, an organization that represents technologists in media.</p><h3> Are Both Experts Right?</h3><p> Although Taplin and Bergquist seem to have very different views on generative AI, they might both be right about its impacts. Economic pressures may entice the industry — at least some sectors of it — to embrace these new tools. Generative AI will lead to dramatic changes in production and postproduction, distribution, and intellectual property ownership. The technology may not be good for traditional artists and the companies that employ them, but it is likely to lead to significant changes in the industry over the next few years — hopefully some for the better along with some for the worse. Perhaps the only purely good news is that neither expert expects that humans will be entirely replaced anytime soon.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-impact-of-generative-ai-on-hollywood-and-entertainment/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Recapping Work/23: The Big Shift</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/recapping-work-23-the-big-shift/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/recapping-work-23-the-big-shift/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 15 Jun 2023 11:09:56 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[MIT SMR Editors. ]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Career Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Employee Development]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video]]></category><category><![CDATA[Webinars & Videos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Workplace Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Diversity & Inclusion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Organizational Behavior]]></category><category><![CDATA[Remote Work]]></category><category><![CDATA[Skills & Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Workplace, Teams, & Culture]]></category><description><![CDATA[Download the Event Summary Download (PDF) The pandemic irrevocably changed the how, why, and where of work.

Tools that can help us solve complex and vexing problems can also be put to work by cybercriminals or give authoritarian governments unprecedented power to spy on and direct the lives of their citizens. We can build models that lead to the development of new, more sustainable materials or important new drugs — and we can build models that embed biased decision-making into systems and processes and then grind individuals up in their gears.</p><p></p><p> In other words, AI already gives us plenty to worry about. We shouldn&#39;t be distracted by dystopian fever dreams that misdirect our attention from present-day risk.</p><p> The recent emergence of ChatGPT and similar large language models into broader public awareness has heightened general interest in both the potential benefits and the dangers of AI. A few days before I wrote this, Geoffrey Hinton, a giant of the AI field whose work underlies much of the current technology, resigned from his position at Google, telling <cite>The New York Times</cite> that he wanted to speak freely about the risks of generative AI. “It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,” he told the newspaper.</p><p> And there, indeed, is where we should put our attention. Throughout human history, new technologies have been put to work to advance civilization, but they have also been weaponized by bad actors. The difference this time is that not only is the technology extremely complex and difficult for most people to understand — so too are the potential outcomes.</p><p> There&#39;s a steep learning curve that all of us must be prepared to climb if we want AI to do more good than harm. The excitement about possible uses for these tools must be tempered by good questions about how automated decisions are made, how AI systems are trained, and what assumptions and biases are thus baked in. Business leaders, especially, need to be as aware of reputational and material risks, and the potential for value destruction, as they are of opportunities to leverage AI.</p><p></p><p> And while AI development is likely to continue to proceed at a breakneck pace that no open letter can arrest, the rest of us ought to proceed deliberately and with caution. In “<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/dont-get-distracted-by-the-hype-around-generative-ai/">Don&#39;t Get Distracted by the Hype Around Generative AI</a> ,” Lee Vinsel reminds us that tech bubbles are accompanied by a lot of noise. We need to let go of the fear of missing out (FOMO) and take a measured, rational approach to evaluating emerging technologies.</p><p> Here at <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> , we will continue to support business leaders with the research and intelligence required for clear-headed decision-making and judicious experimentation. Our ongoing <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/big-ideas/responsible-ai/">focus on responsible AI practices</a> , led by guest editor Elizabeth Renieris of the University of Oxford, is a critical part of that commitment.</p><p> We&#39;re all stakeholders in the AI revolution.

Glaser, Omid Omidvar, and Mehdi Safavi</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> When algorithms aren&#39;t updated to account for changes in the environment, they deliver poor-quality predictions.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> AI models designed to dynamically account for new circumstances don&#39;t always do so effectively. This scenario, called <em>algorithmic inertia</em> , can result in poor guidance and flawed decisions. The authors explored the causes and consequences of algorithmic inertia by investigating credit-ratings agency Moody&#39;s and its use of algorithmic models to rate mortgage-backed securities in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. They found that the most significant contributing factors to algorithmic inertia are buried assumptions, superficial remodeling, simulation of the unknown future, and specialized compartmentalization. Exposing data and assumptions, and periodically redesigning algorithmic routines, are two key practices for heading off such inertia.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/predictive-models-can-lose-the-plot-heres-how-to-keep-them-on-track/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/risk-intelligence-and-the-resilient-company/" class="no-underline">Risk Intelligence and the Resilient Company</a></h4><h6> Ananya Sheth and Joseph V.

Risk intelligence — the honed ability to rigorously interpret risks and the consequences or opportunities they pose for a company — supports organizational resilience by helping leaders identify and manage a broad array of potential threats to their company&#39;s value exchange system, both over time and across changing business contexts. To strengthen their organization&#39;s risk intelligence, leaders should systematically categorize and interpret risk events, compartmentalize uncertainty and reduce its impact, and construct and contextualize an enterprise risk network.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/risk-intelligence-and-the-resilient-company/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-professional-services-firms-dodged-disruption/" class="no-underline">How Professional Services Firms Dodged Disruption</a></h4><h6> Julian Birkinshaw and David Lancefield</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Professional services firms with longevity hold lessons for other businesses trying to survive disruptions in turbulent markets.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> Big professional services firms appeared to be in the crosshairs of new, technology-fueled competitors a decade ago, but many have maintained or even bolstered their positions.

While 80% of companies claim to ideate and incubate new ventures, only 16% of companies successfully scale them. Scaling paths require a clarity of ambition equal to the scale of opportunity; a set of plausible strategic options for what assets will be needed to achieve that ambition; smart brainstorming about how to acquire those assets; an openness to bringing in new leaders to support the expanding scope of activities; and preparation for the inevitable high-stakes moments when decisions entail commitments that will be difficult, if not impossible, to reverse.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-missing-discipline-behind-failure-to-scale/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/helping-neurodivergent-employees-succeed/" class="no-underline">Helping Neurodivergent Employees Succeed</a></h4><h6> Emily R.

Creating a neuroinclusive organization calls for specific training and development efforts that benefit neurodivergent employees and the wider workforce. Managers are key to the success of these programs and need to be educated about how to support their neurodivergent employees.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/helping-neurodivergent-employees-succeed/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-digitally-mature-is-your-finance-office" class="no-underline">How Digitally Mature Is Your Finance Office?</a></h4><h6> Kristof Stouthuysen</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Many finance offices are stuck in traditional operational roles and aren&#39;t benefiting from advanced analytics.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> Finance leaders in a wide range of industries are trying to integrate data and analytics to improve operations, but not all CFOs have cracked the code. In particular, many are not capitalizing on the promise of new machine learning applications. CFOs who are able to challenge an often conservative, cautious culture and manage to successfully deploy advanced analytics can deliver more real-time insights, reduce human error and bias, and speed up processes and decision-making. What&#39;s more, while more traditional finance leaders often guard the data they possess, those who embrace advanced analytics — what the author calls <em>digital finance leaders</em> — become strong advocates for democratizing data across a company&#39;s silos.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-digitally-mature-is-your-finance-office" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/cashing-out-excellence/" class="no-underline">Cashing Out Excellence</a></h4><h6> Robert D.

Circumstances such as reporting to a high performer, holding a career-accelerator role such as being a supervisor, and not taking advantage of flexible work options all play a leading role in promotions and pay increases. Disparities in performance ratings also have a cascading effect that adversely affects people of color: In the author&#39;s study, people of color in the majority of companies were up to 50% less likely to receive high performance ratings. Because ratings tend to persist, with a high rating one year predicting the likelihood of a high rating the next, getting shut out from the start can significantly impede career progression.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/opening-access-to-the-fast-track-for-career-equity/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-unequal-rewards-of-peer-support-at-work/" class="no-underline">The Unequal Rewards of Peer Support at Work</a></h4><h6> Nancy Baym and Constance Noonan Hadley</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Job satisfaction comes in part from how well people feel their organization recognizes and values the social support they provide to colleagues.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> Employees&#39; supportive behaviors with one another boost engagement and productivity, but research shows that men gain more benefits from such efforts than women do. Social support includes emotional assistance, esteem reinforcement, social companionship, information or advice, and instrumental help.

They say it&#39;s broader than an organization&#39;s full-time employees, instead encompassing ecosystems of contractors, gig workers, service providers, and even technologies. These networks require innovative management practices, given that hierarchical, command-and-control leadership is ill suited for workforces that span internal and external boundaries. In developing new practices, leaders must address three types of issues: structural design (pertaining to the division of labor, goals, and incentives), politics (relating to resources, power, and status), and culture (affecting individuals&#39; search for identity and meaning).

In 2015, Richard and Daniel Susskind foresaw that technology would cause a “steady decline in the need for traditional flesh-and-blood professionals,” while more recently, CB Insights said that “a tectonic disruption is hitting management consulting.” <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> Even earlier, Clayton Christensen and colleagues warned, “Although we cannot forecast the exact progress of disruption in the consulting industry, we can say with utter confidence that whatever its pace, some incumbents will be caught by surprise.” <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2个</a></p><p>But things have not played out as predicted. In consulting and law, the established firms are as influential and profitable as ever. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> Many potential disrupters have come along. Some have failed, some have gained strong niche positions, but none has challenged — let alone toppled — the existing order. Most established leaders have used a wide range of strategies and tactics to adapt quickly to the threats.</p><p></p><p> As is the case in many well-established industries, professional services markets are dominated by a small, clearly identifiable group at the top and large numbers of lower-tier firms operating in their shadow. Consulting&#39;s giants include McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group, and Bain; technology-based firms Accenture and Capgemini; and the Big Four accounting firms Ernst &amp; Young, Deloitte, KPMG, and PwC. In law, the top tier includes the five London-based firms informally known as the Magic Circle — Linklaters, Clifford Chance, Freshfields, Allen &amp; Overy, and Slaughter and May — along with Kirkland &amp; Ellis, Latham &amp; Watkins, and DLA Piper.</p><p> How have these firms been so resilient? Our research, which included interviews with 25 executives and a review of case studies on a dozen would-be disrupters, revealed many factors at work. The one that distinguishes the most effective firms is their capacity to diagnose potential causes of disruption and respond accordingly.</p><p> We define <em>industry disruption</em> as an upending of the established order, with incumbents losing out to new competitors. As Joshua Gans has argued, disruption can occur when incumbent firms have blind spots about what customers want (a demand-side effect) or when a new technology makes the incumbents&#39; existing capabilities obsolete (a supply-side effect) — or a combination of the two. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> (See “Four Types of Potential Threat in Consulting and Law.”)</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Four Types of Potential Threat in Consulting and Law</h4><p class="caption"> Professional services firms face threats on both the demand and supply sides.</p><p class="caption"> Supply-side disruption increases as the capabilities delivered by the incumbent decrease in value to the customer.

On the demand side, the threat comes from clients seeking greater control over how they buy and use professional services. Still other would-be disrupters challenge incumbents from both the supply and demand sides at the same time. Meanwhile, new boutique and specialist firms have cropped up to serve particular client needs in lucrative business segments, though they have rarely been truly disruptive. Below, we look at each potential threat in detail.</p><p> <strong>AI undermines the business model.</strong> The launch of generative AI in November 2022 has accelerated the ongoing transformation of many aspects of professional services work, enabling greater accuracy and significant cost savings.</p><p> At law firms, AI tools scan legal documents and review contracts. AI-based services companies such as Kira Systems, Clio, Reveal-Brainspace, iManage, and Thomson Reuters provide assistance in discovery, due diligence, and contract management and review. Thomson Reuters&#39;s services are used by 97% of the largest law firms.</p><p> These companies don&#39;t position themselves as competitors to law firms, but as they scale and the technology gains capabilities, they can begin to undermine those firms&#39; business models. Clio&#39;s legal software, for example, can conduct e-discovery for a claim and even engage in litigation analysis by scanning precedent-setting cases, potentially reducing the number of billable hours that a firm can charge to clients.</p><p> In consulting, AI can help professional services firms provide additional value by uncovering new relationships, identifying patterns of customer behavior, and highlighting cost-saving opportunities. “It&#39;s no longer good enough to show up with a team that knows more about this industry than anybody else,” one Big Four consulting partner said. “You also need a data set or an algorithm that provides additional sources of value.”</p><p> But AI can also be a powerful disrupter. Palantir Technologies started out using AI to detect fraud and has since expanded to applying state-of-the-art machine learning to solve problems for a variety of government and private clients. Its work in support of government surveillance has drawn controversy, but its predictive analytics helped a large automotive supplier make large efficiency gains in its engineering and manufacturing functions. Such results represent a significant advance in the rigor and quality of insights consulting firms can offer.</p><p> Established firms have taken on the threat by building up their own AI capabilities through acquisitions and in-house development. McKinsey has acquired 12 mostly small AI firms since 2013, including UK-based QuantumBlack, which uses advanced data analytics to improve organizational performance. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a> In law, San Francisco-based DLA Piper has developed Aiscension, an AI product that monitors compliance risks. The insurance law firm Kennedys created its Kennedys IQ spinoff, which uses AI to assess medical evidence and recommend amounts for damages.</p><p> These acquisitions and partnerships deliver more than new capabilities; they can expand the range of issues their firms can handle for clients.</p><p> Incumbents are also enhancing their role as high-touch trusted advisers, which AI cannot replicate. Several large consulting firms have increased their range of offerings by investing in experience centers — physical and virtual environments where clients and consultants use design thinking and other creative techniques to envision possible futures. Over the past five years, IBM, Deloitte, Accenture, and other firms have bought more than 200 creative agencies to help develop these centers.</p><p> <strong>Clients take control: unbundling the service.</strong> The most profound demand-side threat is unbundling, as increasingly savvy clients look for ways to cut costs and exert greater influence over their relationships with services firms. This can mean reclaiming activities previously handled by outside firms or turning to specialists instead of the broad offering of a large professional firm. Both options can help clients build up their internal capabilities and gain greater accountability for business outcomes. But unbundling threatens the incumbent firms&#39; leverage model by taking away work that would typically be assigned to a lot of their junior — and lower-paid — generalists.</p><p> In law, the emergence of alternative legal service providers (ALSPs) is a testament to this demand-side threat. ALSPs aren&#39;t law firms as such, but they provide a vast array of legal services, such as document review or contract management, at a lower cost. In 2017, DXC Technology, a Virginia-based IT services firm, outsourced almost its entire legal function to UnitedLex, an ALSP based in Overland Park, Kansas. DXC transferred 150 in-house lawyers to UnitedLex, retaining only a small number of senior professionals. While outsourcing in-house legal departments is not uncommon, law firms saw this as a huge threat because it was the biggest transaction of its kind at the time and because it involved an ALSP, which can offer a much lower cost structure.</p><p> Consulting faces a similar challenge from the rise of consulting networks, such as London-based Eden McCallum, and from online platforms, such as New York-based Gerson Lehrman Group. These companies match clients with consultants on a project-by-project basis, bypassing the large firms. London-based Kubrick Group contracts with companies to provide teams of data scientists and technologists, who can later be hired by the client.</p><p> Such arrangements put the onus on the client to define its problems and integrate work teams — something traditionally handled by a large consulting firm. But they eliminate the need to hire a large firm except on the biggest and most complex projects. And without the incumbents&#39; higher overhead, fees are much lower.</p><p> Clients are also changing commercial arrangements, increasingly demanding outcome-based deals that require consultants to demonstrate that they were directly responsible for the desired results, such as a 5% reduction in costs. Because this can be harder to do with projects that involve factors outside the consultants&#39; influence, like growing revenue, most firms agree to outcome-based deals only when they can be confident of contributing to the desired result.</p><p> Incumbent firms are responding to these demand-side challenges in a couple of ways. Law firms have formed their own ALSPs; London-based Allen &amp; Overy created Peerpoint in 2013, a separate operation with 350 largely freelance lawyers and 53 million pounds ($64 million) in revenue. In consulting, Deloitte created a unit called Pixel that breaks down client problems into their constituent parts and then uses a crowdsourcing platform to find the right experts to work on each part.</p><p> The large firms are also doubling down on their traditional strengths: tackling clients&#39; biggest and most challenging problems. Their value comes from their ability to provide advice and compliance in high-impact, large-scale, high-risk situations, and they can charge a premium for the service. “We do open heart surgery rather than provide [general practitioner] services,” said one senior lawyer.</p><p> <strong>Boutiques and specialists find strength in market focus.</strong> New competitors emerge all the time in professional services, as former top partners set up their own boutiques or venture firms back new startups. The successful ones take market share in specific niches but rarely cause much concern to top-tier firms. They cause limited disruption on either the demand or supply side, and they simply reflect the heterogeneity and complexity of the market.</p><p> In consulting, London-based Baringa has grown quickly by focusing on the energy industry, identifying such hot topics as renewable energy and hiring specialists who use scenario modeling to project future energy prices. New York-based AlixPartners focuses on turnarounds, litigation support, and transformation. Both firms have more than 1,000 employees. The legal industry has seen the rapid growth of specialists such as Caldwell Intellectual Property Law in the US and Mishcon de Reya, a specialist in disputes, in the UK and Singapore. The success of such firms shows how deep expertise can create a defensible niche against broad-based competitors.</p><p> Large firms don&#39;t view these smaller businesses as a direct threat and often ignore them altogether. “They&#39;re not on our radar for the work we do with the C-suite,” said a partner in a large London law firm. Still, they can help incumbents stay vigilant.</p><p> For one, they provide a window on a changing marketplace, often prodding established firms to move into business areas they might have otherwise neglected. Deloitte, for example, launched its digital business in response to the emergence of specialized boutique firms. Bain created and spun off The Bridgespan Group in order to focus on nonprofits.</p><p> The specialty firms can also expose weaknesses in top-tier firms&#39; ways of working that need attention. For example, Altman Solon, the largest global strategy consulting firm specializing in telecommunications, media, and technology, commands C-suite attention in large part because the entire firm comprises specialists with deep expertise in those sectors, unlike many large firms that fill junior ranks with a lot of smart generalists. As a result, it is already up to speed with the industries in which it operates and thus is better able to develop client-specific strategies quickly.</p><p> <strong>Would-be disrupters that pose supply- and demand-side risk.</strong> The nightmare scenario for incumbents is disruption that affects the supply and demand sides at the same time. This is ultimately what killed Kodak and Polaroid: Digital technology changed how images were created and how they were consumed, leaving the incumbents nothing valuable to fall back on. The survivors from the photography industry, such as Fuji and Canon, did so by moving into adjacent markets, not by staying and fighting.</p><p> Such challengers have appeared in professional services, but so far they have fallen short as disrupters. For example, HourlyNerd, founded in 2013, had big ambitions to become a marketplace for connecting technology clients with freelance consultants, giving the client a wider choice of consultants at a faster rate than the typical procurement process. “We like to think of ourselves as a replacement to potentially hiring a consulting firm,” one of the cofounders said. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p> Axiom Law, founded in 2000, sought to provide on-demand legal talent using a network of employees and associates to provide legal services more efficiently. “Axiom has an opportunity to disrupt an industry that hasn&#39;t materially changed in a century,” one investor said. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8个</a></p><p>Both firms have done moderately well. HourlyNerd, which rebranded as Catalant in 2016, shifted to a software-as-a-service model and today has several hundred employees. Axiom is a midsize law firm with about 1,600 employees, $842.5 million in revenue, and a more flexible business model than most of its competitors. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a> But neither has achieved the disruptive effects it aspired to.</p><p></p><h3> Disruptive Threats on the Horizon</h3><p> So, what looming disruptions keep the executives running consulting and law firms awake at night?</p><p> One factor the senior professionals we interviewed pointed to is a dramatic acceleration in AI and analytics capabilities. In law, codification — the process of capturing the legal reasoning of an experienced partner and turning that into an algorithm that can then be applied to future cases — threatens to eliminate much of the cognitive work now done by professionals. “That would be disruptive,” said a partner in a large London firm.</p><p> Several others indicated that the biggest threat in the near future will most likely come from the giant technology companies: Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce, in particular. Each has built client-facing capabilities, some from the large consulting firms, to enhance their strength in selling solutions to clients&#39; technology challenges.</p><p> With their AI capabilities and global reach, they could affect both the supply and demand sides of professional firms&#39; businesses. For example, using the vast amount of data at its disposal, Amazon Web Services could exploit its unique insights into customer behavior to provide retail clients with forecasts of online shopping trends.</p><p> “The greatest impact of Amazon Web Services won&#39;t lie in its position as a supplier of cloud services, but in the extraordinary scale and depth of its information on consumer buying behavior, which no conventional consulting firm could begin to compete with,” said a partner in a large consulting firm.</p><p> Others downplayed the threat. “The likes of Google are not actually that good at client service,” one interviewee said. While it is possible that a tech company could buy a large consulting firm, that would represent a significant strategic pivot from the typical approach of developing partnerships with consulting firms and would reduce the number of firms it could partner with in the future.</p><h3> Staying Nimble</h3><p> The big professional services firms haven&#39;t avoided disruption simply because of the actions they&#39;ve taken. More important is their vigilance and responsiveness to changes in their business environment. While consulting and law firm executives often disparage their seemingly old-fashioned ways of working, their professional partnership models have proved to be remarkably resilient.</p><p> From our interviews, we identified three elements of success that are worth highlighting as potentially applicable to other sectors as well.</p><p> <strong>Innovation efforts are devoted to solving client problems.</strong> This contrasts with many other businesses, where innovation activities are pursued separately from the customer-facing parts of the organization. The best professional services firms pursue product and service innovations based on common limitations, frictions, and opportunities they&#39;ve identified in their clients&#39; businesses. They then develop, test, and refine those innovations with selected clients and partner organizations — such as technology providers — before launching them across their client portfolios.</p><p> <strong>Partners and their juniors work closely together with clients.</strong> The firms&#39; apprenticeship model means that the sense-response gap — the difference between sensing client needs and then taking appropriate action to address them — is narrower than in firms where the leaders are a long way removed from those doing the work.</p><p> <strong>Firms take a cautious approach to investing in new activities.</strong> While this might seem to be a weakness in a fast-changing world, the truth is that most emerging technologies take a long time to realize their potential, and plenty of firms have failed by moving too quickly. Because of the project-based nature of their work, professional firms are able to test new technologies, see what works, and then move forward based on project success and client demand.</p><h3> Staying Ahead of Disruption</h3><p> The experience of professional services firms in holding off potential disruption suggests four actions that firms in other sectors can take to prepare for and respond to change.</p><p> <strong>Diagnose the threat.</strong> While every new competitor or technology can be seen as a potential threat, it&#39;s necessary to assess the magnitude of the risk and the part of the business that it might affect. The consulting and law firms we studied were mostly very thoughtful about separating out the demand- and supply-side effects. (See “Diagnosing the Nature of the Disruptive Threat” for how to apply this logic.)</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Diagnosing the Nature of the Disruptive Threat</h4><p class="caption"> Consider an emerging technology or new competitor in your industry and answer the following questions to determine the nature of the disruptive threat.</p><p class="print no-mobile no-desktop caption"> Take the assessment at https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-professional-services-firms-dodged-disruption/</p><p> <a id="interactive-modal" href="#modal-container" class="is-button aqua no-print" style="max-width:275px">Take the assessment now</a> </p><p class="caption"><svg height="20.25" viewBox="0 0 18.183 20.25" width="18.183" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><clipPath id="a"><path d="m0 0h18.183v20.25h-18.183z"></path></clipPath><g clip-path="url(#a)"><path d="m17.081 12.4a1.087 1.087 0 0 1 1.1 1.1v5.648a1.087 1.087 0 0 1 -1.1 1.1h-15.981a1.087 1.087 0 0 1 -1.1-1.1v-5.648a1.185 1.185 0 0 1 1.1-1.1 1.185 1.185 0 0 1 1.1 1.1v4.546h13.642v-4.546a1.324 1.324 0 0 1 1.24-1.1m-11.71-4.135 2.618 2.617v-9.642a1.214 1.214 0 0 1 1.102-1.24 1.185 1.185 0 0 1 1.1 1.1v9.643l2.617-2.48a1.012 1.012 0 0 1 .827-.276 1.958 1.958 0 0 1 .827.276 1.254 1.254 0 0 1 0 1.653l-4.545 4.548c-.138.138-.276.138-.413.276a.878.878 0 0 1 -.827 0c-.138 0-.276-.138-.413-.276l-4.546-4.684a1.081 1.081 0 0 1 0-1.515 1.257 1.257 0 0 1 1.653 0" fill="#000000"></path></g></svg> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/a3e29f5546.pdf" target="_blank" class="marketing_click" id="Download_Assessment[Birkinshaw_article]" rel="noopener">Download the scorecard (PDF)</a></p><div id="modal-container"><div  id="btn-close-modal" class="close-modal-container"> ← RETURN TO ARTICLE </div><div class="modal-content"><iframe src="https://survey.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eWAtUnHf3GCdswu" width="100%" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></p></div><p><script>$("#interactive-modal").animatedModal({modalTarget:'modal-container',animatedIn:'fadeInRightBig',animatedOut:'fadeOutRightBig',animationDuration:'.6s',color:'#292929',overflow:'hidden'});</script></p></article></aside></div><p> <strong>Match the response to the challenge.</strong> Once the supply and demand effects have been mapped, it&#39;s possible to target the appropriate response. Demand-side challenges require experimentation in how clients&#39; needs can be anticipated, understood, met, and adjusted to. Professional services firms are inherently good at this. Project teams are empowered to come up with creative solutions and to experiment with alternative models for forming partnerships and delivering services. This should serve as a cautionary note to firms that have become too “corporate,” with decisions flowing from the top down to partners and teams.</p><p> Supply-side changes, in contrast, require investment in new capabilities and an openness to restructuring and even outsourcing internal activities. This often requires a higher level of centralization, frequently with a dedicated team that hires from the outside or makes small acquisitions. The challenge is to integrate them with client project teams so they are deployed in the market.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Stay focused on the organization&#39;s true mission.</strong> While there are plenty of genuine threats out there, there&#39;s also a lot of noise. Paying too much attention to all of the changes swirling around can cause leaders to lose sight of the bigger picture. For professional services firms, the client relationship transcends all else, and the appropriate response to both demand- and supply-driven threats is to double down on that relationship. “We want to retain the overall relationship, focusing on the areas of premium work,” the partner in a large London law firm said. “The debate is how much we leave ... to other law firms and how much we retain and do via third parties or alternative delivery models.”</p><p> <strong>Balance pragmatism with a healthy paranoia.</strong> The law and consulting partners we spoke with in our interviews were genuinely torn. On the one hand, they saw little or no evidence that their strong positions were under threat, and they agreed that the dire predictions of disruption from a decade ago had been unfounded. On the other hand, they did not want to appear complacent, and they certainly didn&#39;t want to send a message to their junior colleagues that there were no future risks of disruption. Executives must learn to live with a dual mindset: a pragmatic acknowledgment that the fundamentals are sound, coupled with a paranoid suspicion of emerging technologies or new competitors. After all, it was those incumbents that might be caught by surprise that Christensen and his colleagues considered most at risk of disruption.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-professional-services-firms-dodged-disruption/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Risk Intelligence and the Resilient Company</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/risk-intelligence-and-the-resilient-company/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/risk-intelligence-and-the-resilient-company/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 13 Jun 2023 12:05:04 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Ananya Sheth and Joseph V.

At a time when a container ship grounded in the Suez Canal can bottle up 12% of the world&#39;s trade, or a virus can disrupt the global flow of commodities, components, and talent, a corporation&#39;s ability to quickly adapt in the face of unfolding events is essential to its survival and prosperity.</p><p> Business resilience is a dynamic property that is retrospectively measured by the stability and longevity of corporate value across changing contexts. In real time, it manifests in an enterprise&#39;s timely adaptation to both immediate and gradual changes in the business environment.</p><p> Our work, which employs a complex adaptive systems view of businesses, shows that resilience derives from three fundamental adaptive capacities: sensing and monitoring, to recognize emerging changes in the business environment; business model portfolio development, to build and test capabilities across operating contexts; and fundamental capability development, to drive growth with longevity and avoid corporate stall. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> Moreover, each of these capacities hinges on the development of a capability for <em>risk intelligence</em> .</p><p></p><p> We define risk intelligence as the honed ability to rigorously interpret risks and the consequences or opportunities they pose for a company. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> It allows leaders to see through environmental complexity and systematically identify, categorize, and interpret risks. This enables them to look beyond known risk factors and intentionally explore yet-to-be-known risks, thereby embracing rather than avoiding uncertainty. Importantly, risk intelligence brings recognition that individual risks or the forms in which they manifest matter far less than the often-shared consequences they have on a company&#39;s value exchange system — that is, the manner in which it manages, identifies, creates, conveys, delivers, captures, protects, and sustains value. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> And finally, it provides leaders with a network view of risks that enables more effective allocation of risk mitigation resources by illuminating not just the direct consequences of risks but the manner in which they could cascade across the company&#39;s value exchange system. In this article, we break down risk intelligence into actionable elements that leaders can pursue to help toughen their organizations for the long term.</p><h3> Identify, Categorize, and Interpret Risk Events</h3><p> Leaders cannot accurately predict specific risk events, nor can they prepare their companies for all risks. They can, however, identify, categorize, and interpret risk events in a systematic manner that reveals how seemingly different events could have similar consequences.</p><p> The first step is to work through each business value function and identify plausible risk events that may have implications for its effectiveness. To aid in this process, we constructed an industry-agnostic inventory organizing three tiers of 99 major risk categories identified in our study in relation to individual value exchange system components. (See “A Value Function Risk Inventory.”) While inevitably not exhaustive, this resource serves as a robust starting point to identify potential risks faced by any enterprise. </p><div class="callout-highlight callout-highlight--transparent callout--expand-column" id="fig1"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> A Value Function Risk Inventory</h4><p class="caption"> This risk inventory derived from 20 years of S&amp;P 500 data shows how the functions of a company&#39;s value exchange system (green nodes) link to business functions and their respective risk categories. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MAG_FE_Sheth_fig1.png" alt="A Value Function Risk Inventory"/></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p> Next, leaders should characterize and group risk events by their <em>scope</em> of impact, the <em>permanence</em> of the changes they induce, and the <em>frequency</em> of event occurrence. (See “Characterizing Risks.”) Leaders can then interpret the linkages between each group of risk events and the components of the company&#39;s value exchange system.</p><div class="callout-highlight" id="fig2"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Characterizing Risks</h4><p class="caption"> Every risk can be characterized according to how widely its impact may be felt, how long the changes it causes may last, and how often it occurs. For example, a major snow event has intra-industry scope, induces temporary changes, and occurs infrequently. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MAG_FE_Sheth_fig2.png" alt="Characterizing Risks" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p> Risk categorization begins with understanding a risk event&#39;s scope, which conveys a sense of how widely a risk&#39;s effects will be felt across the range of affected stakeholders. The wide scope of the COVID-19 pandemic created supply- and demand-side effects across entire value networks, whereas narrow-scope events, such as a labor strike at an individual manufacturing facility, tend to have more bounded effects. When multiple stakeholders experience simultaneous or sequential disruptions, the increased complexity of the impact prevents the system from self-organizing to normalcy. Such circumstances also may invite interventions from sovereign states or international organizations, which can aid recovery or act as new disruptive forces.</p><p> To fully categorize risk events, leaders must also consider the permanence of their consequences. Both the pandemic and the 2021 Suez Canal blockage caused supply-side disruptions, but the permanence of the changes each event induced varied significantly. While supply chain shocks such as the canal blockage often follow a self-organizing correction mechanism in which price increases lower demand and normalize the lagging supply, the same formula cannot be applied to counter a protracted situation like the pandemic. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> It is important to understand permanence before planning and implementing a response strategy. For example, the business interruption created by the pandemic had a scope that was broader and consequences that were of greater permanence, affecting a significantly larger set of value system functions in comparison to the more limited impact of the canal blockage.</p><p></p><p> How often a risk event occurs is important too, because the enterprise mechanisms needed to handle frequent events can be different from those employed for singular events. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> Although companies learn from all events, their responses to those that occur repeatedly are typically converted into standard operating procedures. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a> For example, the adoption of barcodes and scanners to track and manage inventory in real time has largely eliminated stock-keeping record errors and delays resulting from mismatching data.</p><p> Our scope, permanence, and frequency (SPF) framework provides a structured view that shows how a risk event itself is less important than its consequences. The framework is especially useful when multiple risk events occur at the same time, because it gives managers a common, logical approach for considering them and quickly gaining information and understanding. By then connecting those events to the company&#39;s value exchange system, managers can more easily see when diverse risks are nonetheless leading to similar consequences for its value functions. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p> Consider a manufacturer dealing with both an overseas supplier whose products are suddenly subject to much higher tariffs due to a trade war, and the bankruptcy of a value chain partner. These risk events share SPF characteristics (the scope of both is interfirm, their permanence is reversible, and their frequency is low), and, as important, both events also affect the same value functions. The bankruptcy and the trade war are both likely to slow inputs and raise costs on the supply side and make it more difficult to meet customer demand. Both also would require the manufacturer to secure new supply sources and stabilize operational cash flow. By characterizing these potential risk events according to the SPF framework and linking them to value functions, managers can then view them more simply as groups of risks that have shared consequences for a company&#39;s specific value functions and deserve similar preparedness and response.</p><h3> Compartmentalize and Reduce Uncertainty</h3><p> Uncertainty about the consequences of a risk event is unavoidable, but it can be managed based on where the level of uncertainty falls on a spectrum between complete knowledge and complete ignorance (both of which are extreme and unlikely). <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> Leaders should then seek to convert risks with higher levels of impact uncertainty to lower levels. (See “Managing Levels of Impact Uncertainty.”) </p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand-column" id="fig3"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Managing Levels of Impact Uncertainty</h4><p class="caption"> Once managers have mapped risks to the appropriate level, they should take the critical action recommended to convert higher-order risks to lower-order risks. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MAG_FE_Sheth_fig3.png" alt="Managing Levels of Impact Uncertainty" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p></p><p> Risk events causing level 1 uncertainty usually entail a very limited number of future scenarios with clear intrafirm effects, where causal linkages between risk events and the enterprise&#39;s value exchange system can be accurately known. Examples of such events include routine variation in production, expected sales losses, and human errors in performing manual tasks. When specific types of level 1 events occur frequently, they are indicative of errors in process or oversight that can be rectified permanently if diagnosed correctly. For instance, cargo thefts — a recurrent problem at logjammed transport hubs — can be prevented using optical character recognition scanners that track container freight and maintain real-time records. Importantly, at level 1, the overall uncertainty of the impact on firm value is within an expected, acceptable range.</p><p> Risk events causing level 2 uncertainty involve a larger number of alternate future scenarios and have interfirm consequences; however, even though they are more challenging, the probability that they will occur and their effects can be estimated. Businesses&#39; formal scenario planning exercises often involve level 2 events in which previously acquired knowledge regarding the impact of risk factors leads to improved accuracy and an effective exercise overall. The six-day Suez Canal blockage was predictable because a multiship pileup had closed the canal for two days in 2018. As a result, the Pentagon had already worked a longer blockage into its normal operational preparedness. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p> Risk events causing level 3 uncertainty involve a bounded set of scenarios where certain known risk events may affect the company in unknown ways. There is limited knowledge about how a chain reaction of consequences from a risk event might manifest at this level. Typically, these risks include less frequently occurring events with intra-industry scope and multistakeholder implications, which should be considered worst-case scenarios.</p><p> <a href="https://www.portrevel.com/">Port Revel</a> , a training facility situated on a lake in the French Alps, reduces level 3 uncertainty by helping ocean shipping companies simulate worst cases and identify the previously unknown consequences of operating increasingly large container ships through shipping infrastructure largely designed for smaller vessels. It closely replicates conditions at the trickiest spots in maritime transport, allowing trainee pilots to navigate scaled giant container ships through strong gusts of wind across a mini-Suez, steer and dock cruise ships in a crowded mini-San Francisco Bay, and maneuver oil tankers through an imitation Port Arthur. These exercises draw out unanticipated ship performance and pilot behaviors, helping to identify and address previously unknown event consequences.</p><p> Level 4 uncertainty encompasses events with unknown risk factors that could have a variety of negative consequences, the repercussions of which can&#39;t be estimated. These unknown unknowns are usually expressed in 10-Ks through statements such as “Other unknown risks may impact our business operations and projected performance.” It is challenging to develop scenario models in the presence of unknown unknowns. The models are incomplete representations of the world that could entail risks unimagined while developing them.</p><p> Once leaders order the uncertainty of impact into levels, they can focus on converting higher-level impact uncertainty into lower levels by discovering unknowns through data, simulation modeling, and logical analyses. For instance, the three-year gap between the UK&#39;s Brexit referendum in 2016 and its departure from the European Union in 2019 offered leaders an opportunity to convert the imagined event into likely scenarios and capture its vast trade implications. By focusing on the most vulnerable aspects of their value chains, such as those with the highest number of cross-border transactions, leaders could have recognized the imminent redistribution of goods passing through congested ports and modeled rerouting scenarios. For example, Felixstowe was known to be handling 48% of the UK&#39;s container trade, which could have been sent instead to multiple smaller and less busy ports. Evidence of impending port congestion also could have implied the high likelihood of delays and the need to hold more inventory in the UK to guarantee on-time deliveries.</p><p> Systemwide changes that are likely to have permanent effects are typically caused by noticeable megatrends, such as technological breakthroughs, changes in consumer demand patterns, global events, or regulatory body interventions. Once these trends are on a company&#39;s radar, they can be tracked and rapidly interpreted (if the necessary observation and modeling capabilities are in place). For instance, the European Union&#39;s carbon border tax, which was enacted in December 2022 after years of debate, won&#39;t be fully implemented until 2026, offering companies several years to reduce the uncertainty arising from it.</p><p></p><p> Further, for potential events that may be infrequent yet high impact, businesses can examine other industries where the consequences of similar events might be better recognized; then they can interpret the implications for their own value exchange system. For example, Brexit strategists could have studied cross-border trade between the US and Canada and the US and Mexico in the automobile and white goods sectors to help them navigate looming free-trade agreements and border regulations.</p><p> The active identification of plausible risk events and their potential consequences are the kinds of actions that contribute to building true risk intelligence. However, our research indicates that companies place little emphasis on discovering unknown and plausible risk events and their outcomes and instead focus attention on managing known risks. We also find that companies do not have a similarly complete knowledge of risks, even when those risks are publicly disclosed by direct competitors. Our study of 10-Ks revealed significant variation in the acknowledgment of risk factors, even among companies in the same industry. For instance, there was a lag of as much as eight years in acknowledging cyber risks after the first public data breach within a group of 18 comparable companies in the financial sector. This pattern was consistent in four additional sectors — including retail, telecom, technology, and health care.</p><p> Moreover, our analyses revealed only marginal levels of acknowledgment of causal relationships between risk factors, which are how risks impact companies in the real world. It is only logical that a known or unknown risk factor, when manifested, would likely influence other linked known and unknown risk factors, thereby creating a cascade of consequences. This ultimately would affect a company in potentially known but unexpected (or, worse, misunderstood) ways.</p><p></p><p> While most companies think they are preparing for risk events, they tend to focus only on level 1 and 2 uncertainty and therefore develop highly specific but narrow mitigation plans. Take Maersk, for example, which in 2017 fell victim to a ransomware cyberattack that brought down its entire network for days and halted its operations at 76 port terminals globally at a cost of roughly $300 million. <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a> Yet the shipping company did not publicly acknowledge the risk of a cyberattack until its 2013 annual report, despite the risk of hacking and other cyberthreats having been well known since the late 1990s (although perhaps not seriously regarded as a primary risk for shippers). Thus, few risks are entirely unknown, and industry-specific unknowns may not be unknowns in other sectors.</p><h3> Construct and Contextualize an Enterprise Risk Network</h3><p> To gain clearer insight into level 3 and 4 uncertainty, it is important to understand the linkages among enterprise risks. Developing quantified risk networks (QRNs) can help. A QRN is a weighted map that links all identified potential risks to a company&#39;s value exchange system functions and helps decision makers interpret related impacts. Moreover, QRNs can reveal counterintuitive insights, such as a function&#39;s indirect exposure to risks typically associated with a different but connected function. For example, the risk of inaccurately forecasting shipping demand in a freight company directly affects its operating expense management function and indirectly affects facility capacity, operational capability, and customer concessions, as well as the company&#39;s reputation.</p><p> Companies should build their own risk networks for three reasons. First, each company has its own unique value exchange system that is best understood by its leaders. Second, resilient companies need to build in redundancies, which is challenging to do in resource-constrained environments. Custom QRNs highlight the most connected — and most vulnerable — value functions, creating an order of priority for allocating resources to bolster the enterprise. Third, custom QRNs provide a shared picture of risk for company leaders, who may or may not agree on critical vulnerabilities. The QRN-building activity focuses managerial attention on the often disregarded but potentially crucial functions and related risk categories to ultimately help leaders anticipate and prepare for the future.</p><p> To begin constructing your company&#39;s risk network, identify the risk events that are particularly relevant to your business by working from critical value functions upon which it relies and from the risk categories captured in the inventory. Identify plausible risk events in each category from data sources such as company memos, public risk disclosures, investment analyst reports, and historical knowledge. For example, leaders managing the operations function can use inventory risk categories, such as facilities and process management, sourcing, and distribution, to build a list of plausible risk factors or events (such as an unexpected storm, an equipment malfunction, input shortages, drained emergency supplies, worker health emergencies, communications interruptions, or labor strikes) that could affect business continuity. Note that these lists will likely contain several risk factors under each risk category.</p><p> Next, characterize relevant risks using the SPF framework, identify plausible scenarios related to the company&#39;s value functions, and identify potential responses. This exercise gives managers the opportunity to pay extra attention to less appreciated risks and helps them reduce the overall level of uncertainty of the impact of risks on the company&#39;s value exchange system.</p><p> Since the archetypal company is organized by function, the consequences of potential risks on individual functions (such as a labor strike&#39;s effect on sourcing) and the interconnectivity between different value functions themselves should be estimated for each functional node in the QRN. For instance, once managers define the level of interconnectivity between the sourcing and operations functions in their company, they can deduce the direct consequences of a labor strike for sourcing and its indirect consequences for operations. Weighting impacts, even using relative terms such as high, medium, and low, provides a common language for managers to discuss significant risks and plausible scenarios and can help resolve debate on what is likely or what is important. Functions identified as particularly important or vulnerable should be analyzed by experts to develop a deeper understanding of the risks affecting them and their interconnectivity.</p><p> We created a generalized QRN, beginning by asking leaders with sector and functional expertise to indicate interconnectivity between their function and other business functions on a 10-point scale. (See “A Quantitative Risk Network.”) Then we asked the leaders to indicate the potential impact of specific risks to their functional area arising from these connections. For example, a sales and marketing expert who indicated significant interconnectivity with the business strategy function was asked whether sales forecasting risks, sales execution risks, and reputation risks would have a high, medium, or low impact on business strategy. Companies can follow this process to build a codified understanding by leveraging their internal leaders as well as external experts. Once coded, the data forms the basis for a network representation of risks and a company-specific QRN. </p><div class="callout-highlight callout-highlight--transparent callout--expand-column" id="fig4"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> A Quantitative Risk Network</h4><p class="caption"> This visual representation of a generalized QRN reveals the linkages between risk categories and enterprise functions. It illustrates how companies can isolate and identify key value functions that link several connected risks and are therefore particularly significant in building enterprise resilience. The more central the function, the larger its font size; the thick links in the QRN imply high-impact relationships between functions and risk categories. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MAG_FE_Sheth_fig4.png" alt="A Quantitative Risk Network" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p> Such a QRN helps leaders better understand a company&#39;s vulnerability to risk events by illuminating those functions that are central to the value exchange system. A risk event affecting a central function would imply a strong cascade of negative effects across the company&#39;s value exchange system. For example, financial capital management connects directly to 15 financial risk categories and indirectly to 30 risk categories from other functions. Any event occurring in any one of the risk categories affecting financial capital management will have implications for all other connected functions; for instance, significant currency exposure will likely affect the company&#39;s sourcing decisions. Thus, protecting the financial capital management function is critical to resilience. In contrast, a negative effect on the marketing and sales function is unlikely to cause a cascading impact in this company. <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a></p><p> Expert knowledge, industry insights, experience, and the simulations are all useful in building a network view of enterprise risks. QRNs are baseline resources that help a company isolate and objectively model for worst-case scenarios, estimate cause-effect patterns, and effectively reduce level 3 and 4 uncertainty.</p><p> A company with a well-honed QRN will be able to differentiate between the scope and consequences of a business interruption due to, say, a pandemic and a transport route blockage. It will also be able to pinpoint the parts of the business that will likely experience significant consequences from these events, such as value delivery, value creation, and value protection, and identify the precise business functions that should be guarded for each of these events. In the case of the pandemic, these functions would include financial capital management, market risk assessment, and technology management; for the lower-scope blockage, these would include operations management and operating expense control. Furthermore, the company could use the value function risk inventory and build scenario models for risk events identified within each of these functions.</p><p> Ultimately, pairing the knowledge of plausible risk events and their likely interactions with the company&#39;s value functions enables strategists to develop tailored mitigation plans and response strategies. Leaders who recognize the need to better understand a specific set of scenarios can invest in developing precise models to reduce the uncertainty of their impact on the company.</p><p></p><p></p><p> The value exchange system that drives any large, complex enterprise is continuously challenged as contexts vary in the dynamic business environment. This raises the stakes for anticipating change, exploring new variations of business models, and continuously pursuing the next wave of growth-enabling capabilities. Risk intelligence helps leaders in this work, enabling them to better focus on maintaining continuous value exchange and fostering the adaptability needed to achieve resilience.</p><p> To create and nurture risk intelligence, a company needs a central risk management function that is staffed with broad functional expertise and given the resources required to identify and categorize risks. It needs to embrace a mindset of risk uncertainty versus risk avoidance and reduce the levels of uncertainty. It needs a company-specific quantified risk network that is updated in a dynamic manner. And finally, it needs a culture of risk intelligence in which leaders across the organization share a common framework and language for interpreting risks and guiding resource allocation for risk mitigation efforts. Ultimately, honing a risk intelligence capability represents the key to building a resilient enterprise.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/risk-intelligence-and-the-resilient-company/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Predictive Models Can Lose the Plot.

However, these organizational efforts often fail — sometimes with spectacular consequences.</p><p> In 2018, real estate marketplace Zillow launched Zillow Offers, an “instant buyer” arm of the business. It leveraged a proprietary algorithm called Zestimate, which calculates how much a given residential property can be expected to sell for. Based on these calculations, Zillow Offers planned to purchase, renovate, and resell properties for a profit. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> While it had some success for the first few years, the model failed to adjust to the new dynamics of a more volatile market in 2021. Zillow lost an average of $25,000 on every home it sold in the fourth quarter that year — resulting in a write-down of $881 million. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2个</a></p><p>This is an example of what we call <em>algorithmic inertia</em> : when organizations use algorithmic models to take environmental changes into account but fail to keep pace with those changes. In this article, we explain algorithmic inertia, identify its sources, and suggest practices organizations can implement to overcome it.</p><p></p><h3> A Credit-Rating Catastrophe</h3><p> To understand the phenomenon of algorithmic inertia, we conducted an in-depth study of another organization that failed to respond to changes in the environment: Moody&#39;s, a financial research firm that provides credit ratings for bonds and complex financial instruments such as residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs). These securities aggregated bundles of individual mortgages into distinct tranches with unique characteristics during the period leading up to the global financial crisis of 2008. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p> Moody&#39;s made a concerted effort to account for environmental changes in its credit ratings by developing a proprietary algorithmic model in 2000 called M3 Prime. The model analyzed data about properties, mortgage holders, and the economy to estimate two parameters central to calculating a credit rating: expected losses for the mortgage pool and the loss coverage protection required for a security to maintain a AAA rating. An analyst would present a recommendation to Moody&#39;s credit rating committee, which assigned a publicly posted rating for the security. Moody&#39;s monitored these ratings and upgraded or downgraded RMBSs as the environment changed. The M3 Prime model achieved early success, so in 2006, Moody&#39;s expanded its scope of algorithmic analysis by introducing a derivative model, M3 Subprime.</p><p> Between 2000 and 2008, Moody&#39;s provided credit ratings for thousands of RMBSs, but it ended up downgrading 83% of AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities valued at billions of dollars by 2008. The US government, along with 21 states and the District of Columbia, held Moody&#39;s responsible for the role that its inflated ratings of those and other products played in precipitating the financial crisis. In 2017, the agency agreed to pay $864 million to settle the allegations. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4个</a></p><p>This is a particularly illustrative example of algorithmic inertia with devastating societal consequences. Moody&#39;s decisions offer an excellent context for exploring algorithmic inertia because the organization was explicitly responsible for analyzing environmental changes as part of its core service. Moreover, we were able to access detailed information about its algorithmic model from a report produced by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that includes extensive interviews conducted under oath with Moody&#39;s executives who were involved in the business at the time. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5个</a></p><p>Our analysis enabled us to identify the most significant contributing factors to algorithmic inertia — buried assumptions, superficial remodeling, simulation of the unknown future, and specialized compartmentalization — described below.

For example, loan originators were increasingly underwriting mortgages based on lower credit standards and substantially less documentation than before. So an original assumption undergirding Moody&#39;s M3 Prime model — that the technology that mortgage originators were using to streamline the loan application process was also enabling a more accurate assessment of underlying risks — wasn&#39;t modified to reflect the changing lending environment. The managing director of credit policy at Moody&#39;s told a federal inquiry panel that he sat on a high-level structured credit committee that would have been expected to deal with issues like declining mortgage underwriting standards, but the topic was never raised. “We talked about everything but … the elephant sitting on the table,” he said. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6个</a></p><p></p><p>Moody&#39;s model also assumed that consumers&#39; FICO credit scores were the primary predictive factor in loan defaults. But the quality of this data input significantly diminished over time: As the use of these credit scores became increasingly common, individuals found ways to artificially inflate them. As a result, low- and no-documentation mortgages carried latent risk that was not being taken into account in Moody&#39;s algorithmic model. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p> <strong>Superficial remodeling.</strong> This phenomenon occurs when organizations make only minor modifications to the algorithmic model in response to substantive changes in the environment. At Moody&#39;s, some major changes to the environment included a growing number of loan originators, increasingly low-quality mortgages, and an unprecedented decline in interest rates.</p><p> Moody&#39;s response to these changes was to seek to capture more business in the rapidly growing market, so it fine-tuned the model to be “more efficient, more profitable, cheaper, and more versatile,” according to its chief credit officer — not to be more accurate. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> When it modified M3 Prime to introduce the M3 Subprime model, it extrapolated loss curves for subprime loans based on premium loans rather than developing fresh loss curves for subprime loans.</p><p> <strong>Simulation of the unknown future.</strong> Relying on an algorithmic model to produce viable scenarios for the future environment can also leave organizations vulnerable to algorithmic inertia. Moody&#39;s constructed a simulation engine featuring 1,250 macroeconomic scenarios that enabled it to estimate possible future losses based on variations in economic markers such as inflation, unemployment, and house prices. However, the simulation engine was limited by its underlying structure and assumptions, so analysts did not consider the changes that were occurring, did not update scenarios, and failed to accurately represent the changing macroeconomic environment. Based on the belief that detailed performance histories could more precisely reveal causal links between economic stresses and loan behavior, Moody&#39;s used estimates based on historical parameters rather than expected pool loss distributions to examine behavior in stress scenarios. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p> <strong>Specialized compartmentalization.</strong> This situation arises when experts in different domains are involved in an algorithm&#39;s design and use and there is no overarching single ownership or shared understanding of the model. At Moody&#39;s, responsibilities for the credit rating routine were divided between the domain experts (credit rating committee members) who used the quantitative model and the quantitative analysts who had developed it.</p><p> Because ownership and use of the model were distributed, and Moody&#39;s didn&#39;t strictly define how to use it, credit rating committee members established ad hoc rules to adjust the results of the model when its outputs didn&#39;t conform to what their expert judgment led them to believe it ought to produce. Model outputs weren&#39;t considered final; rather, the models were seen as tools to be used in conjunction with other approaches, and there was much divergence in how different ratings committees made their determinations.</p><p> The models were developed and modified by individuals who were distant from the domains in which they would be applied; disparate groups of domain experts then used the models in inconsistent ways without understanding their underlying logic. The managing director for rating RMBSs described the model as so technically complex that few people understood how it worked. <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a></p><p> This issue is at the heart of what makes algorithmic inertia hard to tackle: The models and algorithms are often so complex that domain experts can hardly grasp the details of their functioning, while data scientists are disconnected from how their models are being used in the real world.</p><h3> Develop Practices That Combat Algorithmic Inertia</h3><p> We have described how each of the causes of algorithmic inertia played out in Moody&#39;s use of an algorithmic model to dynamically incorporate changes in the environment into its credit ratings. Despite recognizing flaws in the model and making active attempts to change it, the organization was unable to effectively adapt to the environment, thereby substantially contributing to the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p> To prevent similar degradation of critical algorithms&#39; predictive value, we suggest that organizations implement the four practices described below. (See “Keeping Algorithms Relevant.”)</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Keeping Algorithms Relevant</h4><p class="caption"> Organizations can increase the likelihood that algorithmic tools will effectively adapt to changes in the environment by following four practices. </p><table id="Chart#" class="chart-grouped-rows no-mobile"><thead><th style="border-right:hidden;border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;"></th><th style="border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;"></th></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right:hidden;border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding-left:0px;"><p> <strong>Expose Data and Assumptions</strong></p></td><td style="border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;"><p> Articulate and document the data and the fundamental assumptions in the algorithmic model. </p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right:hidden;background-color:#f0f0f0;border-bottom-color:black;padding-left:0px;"><p> <strong>Periodically Redesign Algorithmic Routines</strong></p></td><td  style="background-color:#f0f0f0;;border-bottom-color:black;"><p> Periodically redesign — and be willing to overhaul — the algorithmic model and how it fits into broader organizational routines. </p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right:hidden;border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding-left:0px;"><p> <strong>Assume That the Model Will Break</strong></p></td><td style="border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;"><p> Actively consider scenarios outside the scope of algorithmic models by challenging predictive assumptions, assuming that the model will be fundamentally flawed, and envisioning qualitative alternative predictions of the future.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right:hidden;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding-left:0px;"><p> <strong>Build Bridges Between Data Scientists and Domain Experts</strong></p></td><td style="background-color:#f0f0f0;"><p> Ensure that data scientists and domain experts work closely together to design the algorithmic model and the organizational routine in which it is to be embedded. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><!--IMAGE FALLBACK FOR MOBILE BELOW --></p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MAG_Glaser_Table_2.png" alt="Keeping Algorithms Relevant" class="no-desktop" /></p></article></aside></div><p></p><p> <strong>Expose data and assumptions.</strong> Organizations should articulate and document the data used in their algorithmic models, including data sources and fundamental assumptions underlying their data selection decisions, which can have deleterious effects. <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a> Models often include operationalizations of many concepts, and it is easy for organizations to lose track of these parameters, which can be buried in layers of software code. Parameters representing the environment need to be documented to ensure that they remain visible. Similarly, the fundamental assumptions undergirding the model should be articulated and periodically revisited.</p><p> Moody&#39;s used a data set on premium mortgages to train a model that was intended to be used to rate RMBSs composed of subprime mortgages. Initially, this might have been a reasonable choice due to the availability of data. But when a model&#39;s initial data set isn&#39;t refreshed, algorithmic inertia can result. As the Moody&#39;s case suggests, data is never completely accurate, objective, and flawless. Therefore, making the sources of data and assumptions about those sources transparent to algorithm users, and continually reflecting on the appropriateness of that data, are critical practices for organizations seeking to avoid algorithmic inertia.</p><p> Organizations must keep data sources clearly organized and evaluate them periodically. Different data sources have different qualities and characteristics. Ensuring that these sources are distinguished from one another before they are fed into algorithmic models, processed, and constantly compared against one another enables data scientists to identify and eliminate algorithmic inertia sooner rather than later.</p><p> The assumptions underpinning the use of an algorithm should also be documented and articulated. Any attempt to model the environment involves quantification — transforming aspects of reality into numerical data. Such quantification inevitably involves making assumptions about how the environment works. However, while quantification is necessary for algorithmic models to work, details about how it is performed can get lost in the complex process of designing and using algorithmic models. Therefore, maintaining a living record of such assumptions may prevent the emergence of algorithmic inertia.</p><p> <strong>Periodically redesign algorithmic routines.</strong> Organizations should regularly redesign — and be willing to overhaul — their algorithmic model and reconsider how it fits into broader organizational routines. The initial design of an algorithmic model can take a lot of work, and it is natural for an organization to want to reap the benefits of that work. However, in a dynamic and quickly changing environment, it&#39;s important to be willing not just to make incremental changes to a model but to fundamentally overhaul it if necessary.</p><p> Of course, organizations face a trade-off when it comes to overhauling an algorithmic routine: It can be very expensive to completely re-architect an algorithmic model. However, the consequences of failing to do so can be disastrous.</p><p> For example, when Moody&#39;s had to rate an increasing number of subprime-dominated RMBSs, the organization chose to incrementally modify the M3 Prime model. However, it may have been more effective to specify the distinctions between the prime and the subprime markets and do a deeper overhaul of the original model. In addition to rethinking the algorithmic model itself, an organization can consider how it is deployed in practice: Hypothetically, Moody&#39;s could have applied the M3 Prime model differently to different types of RMBSs — perhaps simply requiring more human intervention for tranches composed of lower-quality loans.</p><p> Redesigning and overhauling an algorithmic model is contingent upon understanding what organizational processes interrelate with the model and analyzing the implications that changes in the environment have for it. If it becomes clear that either the model or the processes that it relies on or feeds into have been rendered obsolete or ineffective, an overhaul should be seriously considered.</p><p> <strong>Assume that the model will break.</strong> It can be dangerous for an organization to think of potential future scenarios only through the prism of what algorithmic models predict: All assumptions embedded in a model limit the potential futures that can be considered. To address algorithmic inertia associated with the simulation of an unknown future, it is important to assume that the model will break. Consider scenarios beyond the scope of the algorithmic model; this requires challenging predictive assumptions as well as presuming that the model is fundamentally flawed.</p><p> An active practice of considering scenarios that are <em>outside</em> the model can help motivate and inspire the prior two practices — exposing data and assumptions and periodically redesigning algorithmic routines — by forcing team members to actively consider the limitations of algorithmic models.</p><p></p><p> One particularly useful approach might be to make use of qualitative predictions of the future instead of quantitative predictions that rely on available data from the past. These forms of scenario planning offer opportunities to consider radically different visions of what the future may hold. This might also entail developing hybrid algorithms that do not precisely rely on past data to predict scenarios but also embed in them qualitative measures and expert rules introduced by domain experts.</p><p> <strong>Build bridges between data scientists and domain experts.</strong> Organizations must create processes for data scientists and domain experts to work closely together to design their algorithmic routines. <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a> Practically speaking, data scientists and AI specialists approach problems very differently than domain experts do. Domain experts focus on organizational routines and idiosyncratic situations, whereas data scientists focus on developing generalizable constructs based on mathematical principles. To overcome algorithmic inertia, data scientists and domain experts must work closely together to understand how characteristics of organizational routines and idiosyncratic situations map to the mathematical parameters used in an algorithmic model.</p><p> When the worlds of data scientists and domain experts are completely separate, there is also the danger that data scientists and domain experts will shift responsibility by superficially trusting each other&#39;s work. Such assumptions can actually prevent crucial dialogue between the two worlds. For instance, Moody&#39;s ended up subverting the results of its credit rating model because the credit rating analysts didn&#39;t attempt to understand why the model might be generating results that didn&#39;t fit with their intuitions. Building bridges between data scientists and domain experts enables domain experts to obtain an intuitive grasp of how the algorithmic model works. Such common ground could enable organizations to create and use models that better adapt to changes in the environment.</p><p> One structural bridge-building practice that organizations can use to facilitate communication between data scientists and domain experts is establishing a position such as a product manager. This should be held by one individual with both domain and data science experience who has direct responsibility for overseeing algorithmic routines. For example, some data experts have called for the creation of a new organizational structure that includes an “innovation marshal” role — someone who is respected by both data scientists and field experts. <a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a> Given their knowledge and expertise in both areas, these people can gain the respect of the organization by developing and maintaining “high-bandwidth, bidirectional communication channels” that help ensure that algorithmic routines are able to adapt to environmental changes. <a id="reflink14" class="reflink" href="#ref14">14</a></p><p></p><p> Another bridge-building practice is called <em>model explainability</em> : describing the algorithmic models in a practical and comprehensible manner. For data scientists, such explainability can facilitate access to the expert knowledge needed to counteract the sources of algorithmic inertia; for domain experts, such explainability can help them develop a deep and intuitive understanding of how the model takes environmental changes into account. Model explainability establishes common ground between two groups of professionals who have different types of expertise. Such practices enable organizations to build bridges instead of just talking about them.</p><p></p><p> Organizations seeking to reap the benefits of powerful predictive analytics are increasingly confronting the problem of algorithmic inertia. Despite leveraging dynamic algorithms to adapt to changes in the environment, organizations may find that the results are not keeping pace with new developments. By exposing data and assumptions, periodically redesigning algorithmic routines, assuming that their models will break, and building bridges, organizations can increase the likelihood that their substantial investments in algorithmic solutions will pay off with better decision-making.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/predictive-models-can-lose-the-plot-heres-how-to-keep-them-on-track/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> We Should Bring Moore&#39;s Law to Climate Action</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/we-should-bring-moores-law-to-climate-action/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/we-should-bring-moores-law-to-climate-action/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 12 Jun 2023 17:00:51 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew Winston. <p>Andrew Winston ( <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewwinston">@andrewwinston</a> ) is a globally recognized expert on how to build resilient, profitable companies that help people and the planet thrive.

He leaves behind one of the more successful companies in history and, of course, his famous <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/gordon-moore-obituary.html">Moore&#39;s law</a> . He predicted in 1965 that the density of transistors on a microchip would double every year and adjusted his forecast in 1975 to “just” doubling every two years. The latter projection has held true for nearly 50 years.</p><p> It&#39;s often said that the phones in our hands have more computing power than the 1969 Apollo moon mission. That&#39;s true, but it&#39;s also a vast understatement — our phones actually have <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a25655/nasa-computer-iphone-comparison/">more power than all of NASA at the time</a> , a fact that demonstrates the shocking reality of exponential change.</p><p></p><p> We humans tend to think in linear terms: If things grew a bit last year, they&#39;ll grow a bit more this year. It&#39;s hard for us to grasp what happened with semiconductors. In 1971, there were around 2,400 transistors per microprocessor. Fifty years later, a chip holds 58 billion transistors, and Intel intends to make it <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/opinion/moore-law-now-and-in-the-future.html">1 trillion by 2030</a> . If something doubles every two years, it grows roughly 30 times per decade, 1,000-fold in 20 years, and 1 million times in 40 years. In 60 years, you&#39;ll get something 1 billion times faster.</p><p> It&#39;s hard to overstate what this speed of change has wrought on the world. At the fun end of things, my teenage boys are utterly unimpressed that they can look up nearly any fact or stream any video or song nearly instantly. At the same time, misinformation can travel much faster. As for AI? It will get rapidly better at both the good and the bad. (Look up “deepfakes” if you want to be scared.)</p><p> Moore&#39;s law has also led to some of the most classic failures in business history. Kodak didn&#39;t get ready for digital photos. Blockbuster was blindsided as well, as downloading a movie went from impossible to a real-time capability in just a handful of years. Once streaming movies became a trivial act, the rent-a-video model was dead.</p><p> In all of this, I see two critical lessons. First, we can make remarkable progress if we enable early success, believe much more is possible, compete like crazy to do it, and <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-missing-discipline-behind-failure-to-scale/">invest what&#39;s necessary</a> . The core point here is that, to state the obvious, Moore&#39;s law is not a law. Nobody mandated the big chip companies to cut the width of a transistor down to nanoscale over decades. They did so because of competition, massive public and private spending to build markets for chips, and impressive levels of innovation in theories, manufacturing technologies, device design, and marketing. (Did we <em>need</em> iPads once they were feasible?) Moore&#39;s law proved to be a powerful and bold prediction of what an industry could accomplish, based on early experience and success.</p><p> Second, we can draw parallels to the critical business challenge of our times: how to thrive and grow while managing our social and environmental impacts (especially climate change). We can embrace rapid change to operate in a sustainable or net-positive way.</p><h3> We Can Embrace the Exponential Again</h3><p> Like in the 1960s and &#39;70s, once again we&#39;re barreling down a path we&#39;re not sure how to travel, driven by external goals — most importantly, how fast science tells us the world should decarbonize. “Science-based targets” are a quasi-Moore&#39;s law for fighting climate change. Keeping up with these aggressive targets is an important creator of business value, a path to excellence in innovation and performance, and a core way to stay relevant to customers, employees, and other stakeholders (and not get Blockbuster-ized).</p><p></p><p> So far, many clean technology sectors are doing a good impression of the semiconductor world. The cost of clean power and battery storage has been, if not halving every two years, still declining very quickly. According to the International Energy Agency, <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/evolution-of-solar-pv-module-cost-by-data-source-1970-2020">the cost per watt of new solar modules</a> dropped 96% between 2000 and 2020. Over 45 years, solar costs have plummeted 500-fold, halving roughly every five years. While not the pace of Moore&#39;s law, it&#39;s been plenty fast enough to shake up entire sectors and create vast new opportunities. The cleantech transition is a multitrillion-dollar shift in how we travel, build buildings, make things, and much more.</p><p> Like with semiconductors, this performance in the cleantech sector has come from a combination of innovation, investment, policy support, and the massive build-out of manufacturing capacity at scale (mainly in China). But perhaps most important in both cases is that the pace of change has required willpower and new mental models. When those of us in the sustainable business world started pushing the idea of science-based targets 10-plus years ago, the pushback was palpable. “How could we possibly move that fast?” many would ask. “ <em>Why</em> would we move that fast, given how much it costs?” But skepticism flips to enthusiasm when you cross cost and mental tipping points.</p><p></p><p> As powerful as Moore&#39;s law has been in driving deep technological and social change in society, again, it was a man-made goal. Companies were driven to move toward it by competition, innovation, and profit motivations. This time, with climate objectives, we&#39;re using global planetary thresholds to shape the goals on how fast we need to go — not just with carbon but with water use, the amount of toxics or plastics in the environment, the prevalence of human rights abuses in supply chains, and more.</p><p> These are not nice-to-haves if we want our world to thrive. The sustainability “laws” we&#39;re grappling with are decidedly <em>not</em> theoretical or invented — they&#39;re based on the laws of nature and physics. Smart companies will see these nonnegotiable realities as the incredible opportunity that they are and get moving.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/we-should-bring-moores-law-to-climate-action/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
