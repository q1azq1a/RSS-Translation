。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>欢迎来到<cite>《我、我自己和人工智能》</cite> ，这是一个关于商业人工智能的播客。每集我们都会向您介绍人工智能创新人士。我是 Sam Ransbotham，波士顿学院分析学教授。我还是<cite>《麻省理工学院斯隆管理评论》</cite>的人工智能和商业战略客座编辑。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我是 Shervin Khodabandeh，BCG 的高级合伙人，也是我们人工智能业务的领导者之一。自 2017 年以来， <cite>MIT SMR</cite>和 BCG 一直在人工智能方面进行研究和出版，采访了数百名从业者，并对数千家公司进行了调查，了解如何构建、部署和扩展人工智能能力，并真正改变组织的运营方式。</p><p><strong>萨姆·兰斯博瑟姆：</strong>大家好。今天，谢尔文和我很高兴阿耶莱特·以色列加入。她是哈佛商学院数字数据设计研究所客户智能实验室的副教授和联合创始人。 Ayelet，感谢您抽出时间与我们交谈。让我们开始吧。</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>非常感谢您邀请我。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>通常，我们首先会询问客人的职业。但作为一名教授的好处在于人们知道这意味着什么。但我仍然认为很高兴听到一些关于你的背景和简历的信息。那么您能花一点时间介绍一下自己并告诉我们您对什么感兴趣吗？</p><p><strong>阿耶莱特·以色列：</strong>好的。我是哈佛商学院的营销学教授。我真正感兴趣的是我们如何更好地利用数据和人工智能来获得更好的结果，如果这对公司、客户和整个社会都有好处的话。我正在进行的一些工作是围绕人工智能以及企业如何利用它来更好地获取消费者信息和偏好。在我所做的其他工作中，我思考如何消除决策中的算法偏差。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>几个月前我看到了您关于使用生成式人工智能的演讲，这真的让我觉得很有趣，因为很多人都在谈论生成式人工智能，但我们还没有很多证据。</p><p><strong>阿耶莱特·以色列：</strong>嗯嗯。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>证据……并不是说它不存在，而是即将到来。但你开始通过你正在进行的这项研究获得一些证据。我们可以在市场研究中使用 GPT 和生成式做什么？</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>我和我在 Microsoft 的两位同事 Donald Ngwe 和 James Brand 开始思考，我们真的可以使用 GPT 进行市场研究吗？这个想法是，有些人已经证明，你可以通过向 GPT 提出问题来复制非常著名的实验，包括著名的 Milgram 实验。我们在想，“我们作为研究人员和实践者所做的工作就是为了更好地了解客户的偏好；也许我们可以使用 GPT 来实际提取这些类型的偏好。”</p><p>对于大型语言模型，其想法是它们将为您提供最有可能的下一个单词。语言就是这样产生的。我们在想，“也许如果我们要求 GPT 或诱导它在两件事之间做出选择，也许答案（最有可能的下一个词）实际上会反映人群中最可能的反应。从这个意义上说，我们本质上会查询 GPT，但会得到我们在人群中看到的偏好的潜在分布。”我们开始尝试这个想法。我们专注于消费产品——因为我们假设 GPT 所了解的数据主要围绕消费产品，可能来自评论网站或类似的东西——看看这个想法是否真的可行？</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>是吗？</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>有点！</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>那太棒了。请告诉我们更多信息。</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>我们的第一反应是，“好吧，让我们看看它是否能产生我们对经济学所期望的非常基本的东西。例如，当价格较高时，它是否知道拒绝报价？它知道在价格和选择之间进行权衡吗？”我们确实看到了一条向下倾斜的需求曲线，这正是我们在查询 GPT 数千次以获得答案时所期望看到的。我们还看到这样的事情，“哦，我们可以告诉它一些关于它的收入的信息，它会对此做出反应。”当它的收入较高时，它对价格的敏感度就会降低，这是有道理的——这也是我们对人们的期望。</p><p>我们还看到，它可以对有关自身的信息做出反应：“哦，上次您在这个类别中购买时，您购买了这个特定品牌”，这使得它将来更有可能选择这个品牌。所以这些是我们对“它是否真的以人类在调查中的方式做出反应？”的测试。然后我们更进一步，我们试图让人们愿意为产品或某些属性付费。然后我们基本上将价格分布与我们在市场上看到的价格分布进行比较，这非常一致。</p><p>对我们来说，真正有趣和令人兴奋的事情是能够了解为属性付费的意愿，因为这是我们作为营销人员都希望找到的东西。在我们的例子中，它是牙膏，我们试图弄清楚有多少人愿意为氟化物支付多少钱，这是我们很难考虑的事情。如果有人问你——“我不知道。”我确实知道我更喜欢买这款牙膏，但我不知道编号是多少。所以这让我们更好奇，GPT 是否可以像我们询问消费者的方式一样为我们提供这个数字。研究人员多年来已经表明，提出这些问题的最佳方法是通过联合研究。本质上，您为人们提供 10 到 15 个选择，通过他们的不同选择，您能够了解他们正在做出的权衡，并实际量化他们愿意支付的差异。</p><p>我们基本上就是这样做的。我们使用 GPT 进行了联合类型分析，并将结果与​​即将发表的论文刚刚运行的人体研究进行了比较，并得到了非常相似的结果，所以我们对此感到非常兴奋。当然，结果并不相同。我们需要做更多的工作来弄清楚一些问题出在哪里，以及这在多大程度上具有普遍性，但我们能够解决这个问题的事实就令人难以置信地令人兴奋。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>这对公司来说似乎很令人兴奋，因为我猜测对很多人进行市场研究的成本比仅仅通过 ChatGPT 进行一堆 API 调用要高得多。这一定是吸引力。还有其他上诉吗？</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>基本上，这些类型的研究非常耗时、昂贵且复杂。理想情况下，您希望要求人们做出很多权衡，但您受到人类这样做的能力的限制。使用GPT，您可以多次查询。但在这一点上，我不会告诉任何人，“用 GPT 或另一个法学硕士取代你所有的人体研究”，因为要弄清楚如何正确地做到这一点，还有很多工作要做。</p><p> GPT 的特点之一是它是经过预训练的。它会给我偏好，但这些偏好与其预训练的时间段相关。一家公司想知道“客户现在对什么感兴趣？”所以这是一种限制。</p><p>我们现在正在测试的是，也许我们仍然需要询问人员，但询问的人数比平时要少。因此，通常当您进行这些研究时，您需要数千名用户才能获得从学术或统计角度来看稳健且具有统计显着性的结果。我们正在尝试看看，也许我可以从更少的人那里收集信息，并通过微调将其与 LLM 结合起来，并生成一些有用的东西。但实际上，一个很大的优势是节省成本和时间。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>这是一个重要的时刻。</p><p><strong>阿耶莱特·以色列：</strong>是的。到目前为止，我们讨论的是消费品，但您可以考虑企业对企业类型的调查，这种调查成本更高，也更难进行。所以也许那里也有潜力。我们还没有测试过。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我喜欢这个主意。我的意思是，当你考虑生成式人工智能的大多数用例时，你会发现很多关于消除工作中的苦差事或创建图像和内容以及总结文本的事情。然后还有围绕计划和库存管理的更高级的内容。但你所说的实际上是用这个取代人类，对吗？我的意思是，基本上就是这样。</p><p>这是一个可能非常有趣的事情的开始，因为你至少证明了它是合理的，对吗？我的意思是，你问了所有这些问题，我想这在经济上是合理的。但是，作为一名营销人员，你就是你自己，并非所有营销策略都基于理性。事实上，其中许多都是基于完全非理性的欲望。</p><p><strong>阿耶莱特·以色列：</strong>是的。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>您对许多人做出的非理性选择有何看法，这些选择创造了这些大品牌和 20,000 美元的手袋以及诸如此类的东西？你如何利用这一点？</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>在回答你的问题之前，作为一名学者，我首先感到紧张的是当你使用“<em>已证明”</em>这个词时。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>证明——我听到了！</p><p><strong>阿耶莱特·以色列：</strong>我看到山姆是……</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我说这话的时候笑了。</p><p><strong>阿耶莱特·以色列：</strong>我想说我们展示了与此相符的证据。我们也知道这些模型仍在不断发展，也许我们一个月前展示的东西在一个月后就不再相关，这也是为什么你不应该在没有测试的情况下就去实现它的原因。所以我想对此小心。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·科达班德：</strong>是的。</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>所以你知道，对于什么是产品，人们有更理性的看法，但品牌所创造的价值对我们来说是无法衡量和难以量化的。但这几乎就像我用氟化物给出的例子一样。就像，我们不知道如何量化氟化物。如果我问你，“哦，你愿意花多少钱购买像高露洁这样的品牌，而不是我刚配制的牙膏？”我们可能会觉得很困难。</p><p>实际上，相同的联合研究模型将能够推断出这些差异。例如，我们可以看到 Mac 相对于其他计算机类型的偏好。所以它已经以某种方式嵌入其中。</p><p>现在它有多准确——这是一个经验问题。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>是的，不，你说得很对，因为当我听到你回答这个问题时，我也意识到我的假设，即你所展示的一些证据，相对于已被证明的，不一定是合理的。而是它有能力概括大多数人所做的事情——或者很多人所做的事情——并将其嵌入到它所接受的训练中。那么我的第二个问题是，如何让它更细分、更具体或更细致？因为当您进行焦点小组讨论时，您可能正在寻找特定的风味/特定的细微差别组合。</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>是的，而且，当 GPT 和其他法学硕士刚刚推出时，我们看到了很多用途，很多令人兴奋的是，“我是一名工程师。我只能问它一个问题。它给了我最常见的东西。这正是我想要的。”事实上，我们正在做的是另一面。我们不想要最常见的东西。我们想了解分布。</p><p>这就是为什么当我们查询 GPT 时，我们会多次询问每个问题 - 因为我们希望获得很多很多不同的消费者。在我们的分析中，我们仅改变了收入和您之前购买的商品。但我们可以以同样的方式改变性别、种族、任何你想要的东西……年龄。我已经看到其他研究人员这样做了。 ……</p><p>哥伦比亚大学和伯克利分校的同事发表了一篇非常有趣的论文，其中使用 GPT 来创建感知图——两个品牌彼此之间的接近程度。他们还表现出性别、年龄以及汽车等方面的差异，我们预计在汽车市场上会看到这些差异。所以你也绝对可以以类似的方式做到这一点。这也体现在政治学的政治学中。我可以给某人一种意识形态，他们的投票行为是有意义的，他们在不同主题上生成的文本是有意义的。作为一个关心异质性并了解不同消费者之间差异的营销人员，这也是非常令人兴奋的。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·霍达班德：</strong>是的。如果我们能将其用于临床试验就好了。</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>我看到了一些关于法学硕士相对于医生更好的临床态度的论文，所以也许仍然有一些东西。 [笑。]</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>也许这就是 GPT-5。</p><p><strong>阿耶莱特·以色列：</strong>是的。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>不过，正如你所说，我认为这些工作方式是对最有可能的下一个单词、最有可能的下一个单词进行概率估计……并且你已经细分出了“鉴于你的收入较低” ，高收入，鉴于你是这个属性，那个属性……”这很有趣，但是我们从哪里想到奇怪的地方呢？如果一切都基于“最有可能”，特别是预定义的[参数]——并不是说你不擅长想出一个好的搜索空间，而是我们如何找到我们不知道的东西，那么？这不是市场研究和焦点小组得出的结果吗？</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>当然，这是挑战的一部分。显然，GPT 学习某种分布，但有些人，你知道……可以说它学习的所有内容都是来自评论。可能有很多非常极端的消费者，他们不会在网上写评论或无法访问互联网，但有这些有趣的极端想法。即使我告诉 GPT，“我想要尽可能多的随机性，非常高的变化”，我也不会去找那些人。所以这肯定会是一个问题。</p><p>我已经知道一些初创公司正在尝试解决这个问题并识别这些极端消费者，然后通过使用法学硕士来预测他们在另一种情况下会做什么，从而将他们提升到一个新的水平。但与此同时，已经有一些关于 GPT 创造力的工作，它创造了非常有创意的想法，你知道，这并不完全是你所要求的。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>其中一些创意不受现实的限制。我想我们都见过其中的一些，[比如]它下棋的方式，并认为该规则有点过于限制。</p><p><strong>阿耶莱特·以色列：</strong>是的。所以这也是幻觉的问题，应该在不同的环境下进行测试。但我认为我们诱导它做出选择的方式不太容易出现幻觉问题，因为它提供了一种选择，并且你不需要询问事实或类似的东西。我并不是想说 GPT 的表现会优于任何客户调查或类似的调查。我只想看看它是否和人类一样优秀。</p><p>即使是与我们交谈的人类客户，我们也必须非常努力地找到人来进行这些调查，有时我们会错过他们。我们也许能够得到一些人的分布，但仍然必须在没有人工智能而只有人类对话的极端情况下努力工作。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我发现真正有趣的是，你说过“这不如消费者调查”，现在我想挑战这一点。因为我发现你的这个想法有趣的是，当你考虑其他人工智能或一代人工智能用例时，你会说，“好吧，所以我是一个人。我是个工程师。我有一个任务。让我们问问 GPT”或任何生成式人工智能系统，它是否属于知识类工作，是否能像人类一样做得好。太好了。或者它能比人类编码得更好吗？或者它可以创建一个视频、文档或其他东西，让您阅读后会说：“哇，这太棒了。那么<em>你</em>就可以做到。我不需要这么做。”正确的？所以这种举证责任是非常明确的。</p><p>在这一点上，我不太确定你<em>是否需要</em>承担举证责任，因为在很多方面，我们假设一个由 500 人或 1000 人组成的焦点小组，或任何调查 - 我的意思是，没有焦点据我所知，有这么大的一个群体——但这种调查在某种程度上是福音，或者，就像 GPT 或其他人，无论什么——</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>您能和我们论文的审稿人谈谈吗？ [笑。]</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>因为事实是，如果你仔细想想，那就是如果唯一知道的方法......那就回去吧。因为，你看：你的前提是，“我们将通过增强这个来在所有市场研究上节省很多钱”，这是一个真实的前提，而且肯定是这样。但我也发现负担减轻了。即使您不停止任何一项基于人类的市场研究或调查，您仍然可以通过扩大反应和选择范围来增加大量价值。</p><p>因为我会争论，你怎么知道 1,000 人或 2,000 人具有<em>代表性</em>，或者他们有所有这些细微差别？所以这件事实际上带来了事实存在的信号，否则你就不会在那里。我发现这实际上对营销人员很有启发。我很高兴与您的审稿人交谈。</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>我认为作为学者，我们习惯于一定程度的严谨性和稳健性，以及能够说，哦，实际证明事物的能力，而且这个工具可以提供某些东西的模拟这一事实很好，但是“它真的能取代人类吗？”是一个更高的负担，因为这个问题，它实际上给了我有意义的、更新的答案吗？它会匹配某些东西吗？你会说，“好吧，也许人类一开始就没有那么伟大，那么我们为什么要尝试……？”</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>不，我实际上是在表达不同的观点。我接受过科学家培训，在科学界和学术界，我承担的举证责任要高得多。我并不是想争辩说你已经证明它可以取代人类。我不认为它会取代人类。但我想说的是，这样做的价值在于，它极大地增强了营销人员可用的信号、见解和想法，因为根据定义，没有任何调查或焦点小组是不受限制的，这不是有限，因为它拥有那里的一切。所以我的观点并不是证明举证责任已经得到满足，而是我什至不知道是否应该有这种举证责任，因为它正在解决焦点小组和传统研究的局限性。所以不一定需要更换。它们一开始就并不完美。没有人会反对这一点。</p><p><strong>阿耶莱特·以色列：</strong>是的。我认为，至少，我可以放心地说，我们表明它可以提供有关偏好和正在发生的事情的非常丰富的信息，至少在它所训练的数据范围内。考虑到研究的类型以及市场研究和接触人员等方面的问题，这可能已经对很多公司产生了很大的改变。一定。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>这里有多种不同的信号，我认为我们首先从以下想法解决了这个问题：这个信号是否取代了焦点小组的其他信号？但这里的因变量可能是，人们真的购买产品吗？人们买氟化物吗？他们购买[假货]产品吗？</p><p><strong>阿耶莱特·以色列：</strong>是的。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>如果这个信号为该预测添加了一些信息，那么我们就有了一个新的信息源。如果它完全取代了它，那么我们就有了不同的东西。</p><p><strong>阿耶莱特·以色列：</strong>是的。现在我们要解决的问题是，对陈述的偏好与实际上基于人们行为的显露偏好进行调查。现在，我认为 GPT 的问题可能比人类少，因为它不受实验者偏见或试图安抚我之类的因素的影响。因此，它可能会给我一些更接近的东西，但如果它带来来自评论网站或市场研究的数据，但它仍然给我一些可能更接近所陈述的偏好的东西，而不一定[给我]人们实际会购买什么。但焦点小组和调查也是如此。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>所以我们认为这是一种新的信号源——那里有很多不同的信号，并且它可能与一个信号有一些重叠。而且我认为这本身就很有趣，但它也可能有一个新的信号。</p><p><strong>阿耶莱特·以色列：</strong>是的。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我发现的另一件令人着迷的事情是，人工智能解决方案已经过数据训练，然后，当它们投入生产时，它们会接受数据训练，或者从生产中的数据中获得反馈，然后它们得到更好的。对于生成式人工智能，很多反馈也需要由人类驱动而不是数据驱动，对吗？就像，这就是它告诉你要做的事情。它引起你的共鸣吗？是的，不是，等等。所以感觉就像是一种技术，生成式人工智能可以成为另一个生成式人工智能输出的用户。</p><p>因此，让我们看一下这样的范式，看，它正在取代焦点小组中的人员，或者我们也可以替换公司中的人员，该公司是一个营销人员，负责处理生成式人工智能的响应，例如“你如何设计一个营销活动”为了这？”</p><p><strong>阿耶莱特·以色列：</strong>嗯嗯。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>所以这个想法可能是多个生成式人工智能代理相互竞争以提高整体质量——你对此有何看法？</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>我认为这是一个有趣的想法。但我也认为，到目前为止的证据表明，在某些时候，你仍然需要至少一个人参与其中……</p><p><strong>谢尔文·科达班德：</strong>当然。</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong> ……因为所有这些幻觉，不切实际的事情出现了。但当然，如果这些模型变得越来越好、效率越来越高、质量越来越高，那为什么不呢？当我们在组织中实施这些类型的事情时，我们还需要考虑如何——我不知道这个词是否完全是<em>“验证”</em> ，但我们如何确保该过程仍然有意义并且我们不这样做这些特工互相交谈只是浪费大家的时间吗？</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>不，当然。你是100%正确的。你需要人类参与其中，而且可能至少需要几十年。但您可能不需要那么多。你知道，如果你有某种输出应该对 20,000 名客户服务代表有所帮助，并且根据反馈、根据他们在试点中的使用情况，它会变得更好，让我们比如说，三个月，也许你不需要向 5,000 人进行试点。也许你可以将其试点给一百个人加上两到三个不同的人工智能代理，这样你就可以大大加快采用时间。</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>是的，那很酷。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>虽然我不得不说，当我听到你这么说时，Shervin，它让我想到的是当人们将麦克风距离扬声器太近时，我们会得到这些反馈循环 - 放大反馈循环。我确实担心，如果这两个数据源过于一致，我们就会被压制。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·霍达班德：</strong>确实如此。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>我们不会变得疯狂。跳到本章后面：给我们答案。人们正在听这个，他们在公司工作，他们现在就可以使用这些工具，而不是 20 年后，就像我们作为学者所想的那样。人们现在应该使用这些工具做什么？</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>和他们一起玩。弄清楚……您想了解客户的哪些信息？我们在论文中提供了完整的提示列表，详细说明了如何提示这些类型的事情并开始获取这些信息。正如谢尔文之前所说，它到底是什么？我们不确定，但这是一个信号。那里有我们可以开始查找的信息，对吧？</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>通过使用它，可以帮助人们发现其中包含哪些信息？</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>我认为是测试和发现。但从一个具体的问题开始确实很有帮助，因为你会陷入很多兔子洞。您可以永远进行这些对话。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong> Ayelet Israel，您是我们接待的唯一一位带有“AI”缩写的客人，这非常适合“<em>我”、“我自己”和“Ayelet Israel”</em> ，即<em>“我、我自己和我自己”</em> 。</p><p><strong>阿耶莱特·以色列：</strong> [笑]</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>请告诉我们更多有关您自己和您的背景的信息，以及您如何最终达到现在的位置以及是什么让您对所有这些东西感兴趣。</p><p><strong>阿耶莱特·以色列：</strong>当然。正如我的姓氏所示，我最初来自以色列。以色列被誉为“<a href="https://www.cfr.org/book/start-nation">创业国家</a>”。当我开始思考我想在大学学习什么时，有一个特殊的项目旨在通过为人们提供某种管理工具来改善创业国家。因此，这是一个为期五年的计算机科学学士学位和 MBA 联合课程。</p><p>我开始这样做，我喜欢计算机科学。我实际上主修金融和营销，但我对营销特别感兴趣，特别是在这种背景下理解大量数据，这些数据非常有趣且实用。然后我决定获得博士学位。在营销方面。</p><p>多年来，我认为消费品或围绕客户和交易的事物对我来说很有趣。这只是一个迷人的世界。你有很多关于这方面的数据，因为随着我们更多地转向在线和数字化，我们可以看到越来越多的数据。接下来的问题是，“我们如何才能更有效、更负责任地利用这些数据？”我的研究的一部分也是关于这一点的。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>所以我们有一个环节，我们会问您一系列快速问题，让您了解情况。只需回答您想到的第一件事即可。</p><p><strong>阿耶莱特·以色列：</strong>好的。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>目前人工智能最大的机会是什么？</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>最大的机会。这并不快。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·霍达班德：</strong>下一个问题。</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>是的，下一个问题。</p><p><strong>萨姆·兰斯博瑟姆：</strong>哦，好的。</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>我会考虑一下。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·科达班德：</strong>通过。</p><p><strong>萨姆·兰斯博瑟姆：</strong>通过。您认为目前人们对人工智能最大的误解是什么？</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>我周围的人往往从事这方面的工作，并且了解这一点，这只是一个模型，但很多人仍然不明白，仍然想象着机器人和发生的这种神奇的事情。这就是为什么我喜欢非常清楚地解释，“哦，它是预测下一个单词的可能性并在分布上选择它们，这就是所发生的一切。”所以我认为我们的情况可能仍然不像十年前那么糟糕，但仍然是这种神奇的、人为的事情发生，但事实并非如此。我想它仍然很神奇。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>这真是太神奇了——或者说可以。您想要的第一个职业是什么？</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>我不知道。在以色列，你参军。我在军队；我是一名情报中尉。我不认为这是我必然想要的职业。这是我做的事。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>关于人工智能有很多讨论和兴奋。人们在哪里过度使用它？人们在哪里使用它而不适用它？</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>我认为我看到的挑战之一实际上是用它来问事实问题，因为这不是它的目的。这不是一种真相发现机制，这只是一种错误的用法。</p><p><strong>萨姆·兰斯博瑟姆：</strong>好的。有没有什么事情是你希望人工智能现在就能做到但它却做不到的？接下来令人兴奋的事情是什么？明天的什么公告会让你高兴？</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israel：</strong>我对这个问题的回答略有不同。我认为，就负责任地使用数据和算法偏差的研究而言，人工智能让我兴奋的是，是的，很多人已经表明人工智能可以产生有偏见的结果。多年来我们也知道人类会产生有偏见的结果。 And what excites me about AI is that it&#39;s much easier to fix biased outcomes by a machine and to generate processes that will eliminate bias, and it&#39;s so much more difficult with humans. And that&#39;s something that I&#39;m really excited about.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I love that point because we&#39;ve got all this bias and misogyny in our world, not by the machines. The machines are not the people who put us in this situation in the first place. And the fact that they maybe do a little bit of that at the beginning, before we&#39;ve trained them, we shouldn&#39;t just throw them out for starting down that path, because we can adjust the weights in models. We can give feedback to models to improve those in a way that we can&#39;t with bazillions of people.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Right.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So I think that&#39;s a huge point.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> And we&#39;ve seen the first models of gen AI images. If you say “doctor,” we&#39;re only [seeing] photos of men or things like that. And over time, this has improved a lot. So that&#39;s really exciting, right? We can try to think about how we fix some societal problems using these things because, yes, machines can be manipulated more easily than humans. Of course, that&#39;s a risk, but that&#39;s for some sci-fi podcast, not for this one.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> The example of the doctor in the image is spot-on because I think so many people were fascinated by how accurate these models are because they felt right. They confirmed our stereotypes. You ask for this image, and it gives you exactly what you think of as that image, but that&#39;s just feeding into the problem again. And that&#39;s going to perpetuate it if we don&#39;t [stop it]. But, like you say, there has been improvement there.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Ayelet, thank you so much. This has been really insightful and quite interesting. Thank you for being on the show.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Thank you so much for having me.这很有趣。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Thanks for joining us today.

In spring 2023, we fielded a global survey and subsequently analyzed records from 3,043 respondents representing more than 25 industries and 100 countries. We also interviewed 17 executives leading AI initiatives in a broad range of companies and industries, including financial services, media and entertainment, retail, travel and transportation, and life sciences.</p><p> Our research examines how managers and leaders use AI to enhance strategic measurement to advance strategic outcomes. It explores how organizations have adapted — and even generated new — KPIs with AI to define and deliver measurably better performance.</p></aside><p> Without adaptation and refinement, static business metrics create two types of strategic risk. One is encouraging performance on the wrong measures. The 2008 global economic crisis, for example, was triggered in part by banks&#39; dependence on a then widely used metric: value at risk, which measures potential portfolio losses in normal market conditions at a single point in time. Financial institutions did not adjust this measure as riskier subprime mortgages and securitized default swaps became a larger part of their portfolios. Guided by a metric that severely underestimated potential losses — in some cases, by orders of magnitude — many financial institutions went bankrupt or suffered significant losses.</p><p></p><p> Opportunity costs represent another risk from static key performance metrics. Our research persuasively demonstrates that companies deliberately using artificial intelligence to design and create more dynamic KPIs enjoy greater situational awareness, stronger ties between operations and strategic outcomes, and improved results overall. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> These <em>smart</em> KPIs reflect deeper understandings of performance drivers and produce more reliable predictions about future outcomes than comparable KPIs not informed by AI. (See “Three Types of Smart KPIs.”) A “set them and forget them” approach to key metrics is neither desirable nor sustainable in volatile and fast-changing markets.</p><div class="callout-highlight callout-simple"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Three Types of Smart KPIs</h4><p class="caption"><table id="chart1" class="chart-grouped-rows"><thead><tr><th> Type of KPI</th><th>描述</th><th>Benefits</th><th>例子</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><p><strong>Smart Descriptive KPIs</strong></ul></p></td><td><ul><p> Synthesize historical and current data to deliver insights on <em>what happened</em> or <em>what is happening</em> .</ul></p></td><td><ul><p> Provide a deeper understanding of performance gaps and their causes.</ul></p></td><td><ul><p> Sanofi&#39;s “snackable AI” tool boosts situational awareness by revealing critical interdependencies among different KPIs.</ul></p></td></tr><tr><td><ul><p> <strong>Smart Predictive KPIs</strong></ul></p></td><td><ul><p> Anticipate future performance, producing reliable leading indicators.

As AI-infused workflows and processes colonize and expand business capabilities, leaders need to update and upgrade their key performance indicators to keep up. From Schneider Electric to Walmart to Maersk, we see strategists, technologists, and business leaders working together to refine and enhance KPIs to ensure their alignment with evolving organizational goals.</p><p> Among these companies, responsibility for making KPIs more predictive, dynamic, and insightful extends beyond strategists and business leaders. They encourage technologists to make a material contribution to the formulation, organization, and prioritization of KPIs. That&#39;s a big change from the way companies have traditionally established and updated KPIs.</p><p> As Schneider Electric chief governance officer and secretary general Hervé Coureil observes, “When processes are digitized, they start to produce &#39;exhaust data&#39; that can be turned into relevant telemetry metrics, providing insights on process behaviors, defects, etc. Secondly, digital transformation triggers significant decisions and investments — portfolio and investment choices, business model implementation, new systems and infrastructure — and therefore, there is a need to measure the impact of those decisions as well as the effectiveness of the various programs that comprise the transformation.”</p><p></p><p> Developing such measures depends on more than executive judgment, intuition, and experience. Transforming static, legacy performance metrics into smarter, more dynamic KPIs demands a greater role for data, analytics, and AI. We suggest that leaders adopt a three-pronged approach to governing the development and use of AI-driven KPIs and, more broadly, their strategic measurement systems. This governance approach rests on three factors:</p><ol><li> A solid data foundation with responsible data and analytics practices.</li><li> Organizational structures with responsibility and accountability for evolving KPIs.</li><li> Trust in KPIs trained to adapt to and learn from changes in circumstances.</li></ol><h3> Governance of Smart KPI Development: Get Your Data in Order</h3><p> Effective KPI governance requires effective data governance. Every organization participating in our research emphasized data quality and discipline as the technical enabler for its AI-driven KPI initiatives. Most legacy IT and database systems, however, aren&#39;t configured to generate or make accessible the quality data necessary for measuring or defining smart KPIs.</p><p> Pierre-Yves Calloc&#39;h, the chief digital officer at Pernod Ricard, recalls that the spirits giant realized it needed three years&#39; worth of weekly consumer sales data to enable meaningful AI interventions. A preliminary review revealed huge gaps. “When we started, we had almost no data governance,” says Calloc&#39;h. “Almost 80% of the data we needed wasn&#39;t there because it was mainly external data. Our statistical experience is that you need weekly data; if you have monthly data, it doesn&#39;t work, so you need to source the information manually. We even called it &#39;archeology&#39; because of the level of effort needed, even going into old PowerPoint and Excel files in mailboxes. In addition, you need a strong business case for the project, because without clear benefits in mind, people will not invest the time.” Essentially, the business case for AI-powered KPIs could not be made without technically reliable and robust governance that transformed data <em>archaeology</em> into data <em>architecture</em> .</p><p> Jon Francis, General Motors&#39; chief data and analytics officer, who previously oversaw Starbucks&#39;s digital transformation, echoed Calloc&#39;h&#39;s observations. “It&#39;s actually really hard to just create a KPI because of the underlying data challenges,” he says. “It takes all of your effort, usually, to create the KPI and report on it.” Poor data and metadata governance undermines an organization&#39;s ability to develop the right metrics. Francis notes that technology systems are often just “spooling data that&#39;s not defined or useable” and, as a result, “you end up with these data dumping grounds.” He candidly observes that for most organizations, the generation of data from production systems is an afterthought.</p><p> Effective KPI governance remains contingent upon a company&#39;s technological capabilities to harness data: It demands diligent data governance, a structured approach to analytics management, and a path for technologists and business unit leaders to collaborate on developing optimal KPIs on an ongoing basis.</p><p></p><h3> Embedding Governance in Teams or Functions</h3><p> Our research finds top management rethinking how to develop and continuously improve their key performance measures and metrics. While approaches vary, a common theme among interviewed executives is choosing to locate responsibility for transforming KPIs in a specific team or group of teams.</p><p> At Schneider Electric, leadership came to recognize that the company&#39;s legacy metrics could become incompatible with its aspirations to strategically collaborate and innovate with its global customers. Coureil helped sponsor the creation of a Performance Management Office within the company&#39;s data team to oversee performance measurement. The office was deliberately positioned in the governance team to ensure a neutral cross-functional perspective.</p><p> The Performance Management Office helped top management transform their portfolio of KPIs and align them with operations. It also pushed the businesses to become far more data-driven and aware of the links between improvement against a given performance metric and enhanced outcomes. “Measurement has been very core for us,” adds Coureil. “We actually tried to make metrics a complete, integral part of our digital transformation, as opposed to an afterthought.”</p><p> What&#39;s the desired outcome of a given KPI? “It&#39;s an ontology or taxonomy question at some point: What behaviors are you looking for?” asks Coureil. “I think people put a lot of things in the KPI basket, and we&#39;ve spent a lot of time trying to be extremely clear about what we&#39;re looking at: What is the desired outcome? It looks very simple, but it is not that simple, actually … being extremely sharp on what the desired outcome of a given KPI is.” That&#39;s why having a performance management office is proving to be essential to strategically coherent and consistent KPI governance, Coureil says.</p><p> Instead of using a performance management office, DBS Bank governs KPI development through cross-functional teams that create value maps linking customer journeys to desired outcomes. The Singapore-based financial services leader revisited its operating model to reflect the fact that using smarter KPIs could measurably improve outcomes for both the business and its customers. “Over the past three years, we moved to something we call a data-driven operating model,” says group chief analytics officer and managing director Sameer Gupta.</p><p> At the heart of the model are cross-functional squads. Representatives from various functions, such as product, risk, data, marketing, call center, and human resources, form a squad, Gupta explains. Every squad member is then aligned on the same set of outcomes mapped to four categories: customer experience, employee experience, profitability, and risk.</p><p> The factors driving performance on each outcome are represented in a value map that connects performance metrics with the four types of outcomes. Each squad is responsible for identifying and optimizing these factors. “The squads look at optimizing those drivers,” says Gupta. “We look at many things to optimize those drivers: experimentation, data, customer immersion, AI, machine learning — all kinds of tools to try and continuously optimize in coordination and consultation with control towers and management dashboards.”</p><p> The result, Gupta notes, is not just greater data-driven operational efficiencies and effectiveness but KPIs that expand the boundaries of the DBS client and customer experience. Revisiting processes for KPI governance have led to both better KPIs and better KPI outcomes.</p><p> While the specific approaches vary, most leaders we spoke with are in the early stages of building governance structures to help make their KPIs more intelligent, detailed, and predictive.</p><h3> Effective KPI Governance Is Based on Trust</h3><p> While these technological and organizational investments in KPI governance are crucial to enhancing KPIs, our research suggests that their practical value to teams is contingent upon people&#39;s willingness to trust them. During Schneider Electric&#39;s digital transformation efforts, Coureil recognized that “one of the changes, versus a more traditional way of doing business, is that you don&#39;t build your dashboard anymore. Somebody else does it for you. So you have to trust those metrics.”</p><p> Anecdotal evidence indicates that establishing trust in AI-sourced metrics can be challenging.</p><p> At Maersk, for instance, the long-held assumption was that getting a vessel out of port and on its way to the next one as quickly as possible was ideal. A digital twin simulation, however, showed that being on time was better than being early: With an end-to-end connected schedule, as is also the situation for commercial airlines, the port that a vessel is heading to next can&#39;t adjust its schedule to immediately accommodate earlier arrivals. In other words, “faster isn&#39;t better” was a counterintuitive assertion from the data team, and it was only after the on-time approach was put into practice that the front-line operators — and even those at the most senior levels managing the entire terminal — were finally convinced.</p><p> Cultivating the trust necessary to develop and use dynamic, AI-enhanced KPIs is a critical leadership and governance challenge. Developing data-savvy managers who are receptive to developing and embracing AI-driven KPIs is a significant part of that challenge. At one media organization, an executive interviewee noted that she&#39;d had a hard time persuading her superiors to look at KPIs and make decisions based on data. Their usual retort was that executives are “paid millions for their gut instincts” — in other words, experience and intuition were valued over data-driven insight.</p><p></p><p> Building a data-oriented management community is one way to create trust among the leaders using enhanced KPIs. At Sanofi, the most senior 150 leaders, representing various functions and businesses, are being trained in boot camps to become more data-centric and to seek out more information before making decisions. As chief digital officer Emmanuel Frenehard says, “Our goal as part of our cultural change is that these 150 people, when they leave the boot camp, are far more inclined to adopt that data-centric view and better understand the potential of AI for us. We are making sure that the core of our leadership is trained on how to use the next generation of AI-driven KPIs.”</p><h3> Further Considerations</h3><p> To ensure that their AI-enabled smart KPIs are setting them up for strategic success, leaders must prioritize the technological, organizational, and cultural dimensions of KPI governance discussed above. As they begin to do so, these related considerations should be top of mind.</p><p> <strong>Establish a steering committee to guide continuous improvement.</strong> Transforming legacy KPIs into enhanced KPIs demands regular experimentation to ensure that key performance is focused on the right outcomes. Determining where this experimentation happens, who does it, and how often are critical leadership and governance decision points. Is it in a central team, like a performance office, or is it more widely distributed? Should certain KPIs be revisited and reviewed more frequently than others? Who has decision rights when changing KPIs changes accountability? There are no one-size-fits-all answers to these questions. Leaders need flexible processes to effectively govern KPIs that might be siloed or cross-functional. We suggest establishing a cross-functional KPI steering committee with business and technical expertise to elicit necessary input and buy-in from relevant stakeholders.</p><p> <strong>Oversee investment in capabilities to optimize groups of KPIs.</strong> Does your company have the capability to assess whether its KPIs are good enough or fully optimized? Our research suggests that AI can play a valuable role in assessing KPI quality, prioritizing KPIs, and addressing trade-offs among them. AI can help determine, for example, under what conditions customer-centricity imperatives should take priority over improving operational efficiencies, or when to prioritize revenue considerations over market share investments. Integrating AI into the process for developing, setting, and prioritizing KPIs can be a disruptive change for managers who are accustomed to making these decisions themselves. To preempt or address such disruptions requires organizational, technological, and cultural investments.</p><p> <strong>Govern KPIs like assets, not tracking tools.</strong> Enhanced KPIs can redefine key performance, not just track it: That makes KPIs, and the capability to enhance them, valuable assets. As with other assets, KPIs can depreciate with time or inattention. Governing KPIs like assets, not tracking tools, ensures that they become more valuable, insightful, and predictive over time. Given a wide variety of asset management frameworks, effective governance means choosing the appropriate asset management framework for KPI assets, including relevant, underlying data assets. Some companies are already beginning to explore using KPIs for KPIs to ensure that the value of their KPI assets consistently improves.</p><p> <strong>Elevate KPI oversight.</strong> As KPIs become more intelligent and more effective proxies for corporate strategy, it becomes more important for boards to be involved with governing KPI development and use. To be sure, developing and using KPIs are management functions. However, boards sign off on strategies that KPIs both embody and inform. Signing off on strategy but not the company&#39;s approach to developing KPIs is short-sighted and can undermine strategic aspirations. Engage the board directly in efforts to develop organizational capabilities for enhancing KPIs. Investing in enhanced KPIs is just as strategically relevant as investing in improving performance itself.</p><p></p><h3>结论</h3><p>Our three-pronged approach to governing the development and use of KPIs expands on the idea that AI can transform KPIs into strategic assets that do more than track performance. They serve as a GPS for the organization, delivering greater foresight and a deeper understanding of interdependencies among key performance drivers.</p><p> Making the transition to AI-enhanced KPIs is not an incremental shift. It is a dramatic change from exclusively human, top-down approaches to setting and refining KPIs. Organizations that have made this transition are putting technology in the (KPI development) loop.</p><p> In the future, KPIs will no longer be passive tools for measurement but active agents for empowering decision makers. Ongoing innovation using generative AI promises to expand the purpose, power, and potential of smart KPIs. Holding conversations with chat-enabled smart KPIs, for instance, is already a goal for several of the executives we interviewed. With proper governance, empowering smart KPIs will empower strategists and managers alike.</p><p> <em>Editor&#39;s note: The authors would like to thank Gaurav Jha, David Zuluaga Martínez, Allison Ryder, and Barbara Spindel for their contributions to this article.</em></p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/governance-for-smarter-kpis/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> How to Make Data Monetization Everybody&#39;s Business</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/how-to-make-data-monetization-everybodys-business/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/how-to-make-data-monetization-everybodys-business/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 13:01:42 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Barbara H.

A confluence of factors is driving this trend: Amid supply chain bottlenecks, rising labor and transportation costs, US tariffs on China, and geopolitical tensions, companies recognize the value of reshoring production. US industrial policies favoring domestic manufacturing are also informing these decisions, including new laws seeking to address national security threats, economic disruptions, and dwindling access to key technological components. The result is an early-stage US reshoring renaissance.</p><p> The question for executives is whether their companies should follow this trend. But first, it&#39;s important to understand the trend&#39;s scope and what&#39;s driving it.</p><p></p><p> There have been calls for reshoring since manufacturing began sharply declining in the late 1970s, but COVID-19 marked a turning point for the C-suite. Between the first quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of 2023, executives started talking about onshoring, reshoring, and nearshoring during earnings calls and conferences much more frequently than they had previously, according to an analysis by The Conference Board.</p><p> Such talk started significantly increasing in the second quarter of 2020, as the pandemic set in globally. In the second quarter of 2022, as supply chain pressures again surged, Russia invaded Ukraine, and new federal industrial policies were enacted. Overall, instances of executives mentioning these ideas increased nearly 3,000% in just three years.</p><p> New laws also helped drive this onshoring resurgence, including the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Each contains stipulations regarding the production and procurement of US-made products and components that benefit companies that manufacture domestically.</p><p> Reshoring is now driving a dramatic rise in manufacturing construction activity. Companies are constructing US manufacturing facilities at a higher rate than any other property type. Such spending rose to an annual rate of $114.7 billion in 2022, according to the US Census Bureau — a 40% increase year over year and a 62% increase over the past five years.</p><p> This made manufacturing the fastest-growing asset category in 2022, as the average growth rate for <em>all</em> nonresidential buildings and infrastructure increased just 7.4% compared with 2021. And the building continues: Manufacturing spending was 74% higher in July 2023 than in the same month the previous year.</p><p></p><p> The reshoring renaissance does not apply universally. Sectors requiring large amounts of manual labor, including shoes and apparel, furniture, and home decorative items, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/business/economy/supply-chain-reshoring-us-manufacturing.html">less likely to reshore</a> . Industries with more complex and expensive products, and those that can use automation and robotics in manufacturing, are leading the US resurgence. The <a href="https://reshorenow.org/content/pdf/2022_Data_Report.pdf">five industries</a> experiencing the greatest US employment growth as a result of reshoring and direct investment are electrical equipment, appliances, and components; computer and electronic products; chemicals; transportation equipment; and medical equipment and supplies.</p><p> Our analysis shows that North America (the US, Canada, and Mexico) has the existing supplier base to support more manufacturing activity than it currently has. In fact, for electrical equipment, North America has 15% of the global supplier base and 7% of global output. Twenty-one percent of the pharmaceutical industry&#39;s global supplier base is in North America, but its share of global output is just 18%, according to <a href="https://www.conference-board.org/publications/TCB-Global-Supplier-Index">The Conference Board Global Supplier Index</a> .</p><p></p><h3> Is Reshoring Right for Your Company?</h3><p>回流的结果是高管和高级管理人员将供应链弹性、可持续性和地缘政治稳定性等因素置于廉价外国劳动力之上，从“低成本”转向“最佳成本”供应链战略。 Although onshoring can entail higher costs from building new facilities and paying higher wages, the benefits of minimizing external risks and creating long-term efficiencies might outweigh keeping near-term costs low.</p><p> Business leaders should consider six key factors in deciding whether to adopt this model.</p><p> <strong>1. Labor costs.</strong> Global labor shortages and cost increases — including in China, where wages are rising — make it relatively more affordable to locate manufacturing in the US than it once was. China outpaced G20 countries in real wage growth from 2008 to 2022, according to the International Labour Organization&#39;s “ <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---travail/documents/publication/wcms_862569.pdf">Global Wage Report 2022-2023</a> .” China&#39;s real monthly wages in 2022 were equivalent to about 2.6 times their real 2008 value.</p><p> <strong>2. Advanced manufacturing.</strong> New automated “smart factories,” which require more engineers and skilled technicians but often far fewer workers overall, including traditional assembly-line workers, make the US labor pool attractive due to its well-educated workforce. Demand for robotics and the advanced technology that supports smart facilities is also surging. <a href="https://www.automate.org/news/robot-sales-in-north-america-have-strongest-year-ever-in-2021">North American robot sales set a record in 2021</a> , with 39,708 units sold, for $2 billion — a 14% increase over the previous high in 2017, and 28% more than the number sold in 2020, according to the Association for Advancing Automation. Plex&#39;s “ <a href="https://www.plex.com/sites/default/files/2022-05/10292_7th_State-of-Smart-Manufacturing_Supply-Chain.pdf">7th Annual State of Smart Manufacturing Report</a> ” notes that smart-manufacturing adoption rates increased 50% in 2022 year-over-year and 83% of manufacturers reported that smart factories are key to their future success.</p><p> <strong>3. Risk mitigation.</strong> The longer and more complex the supply chain, the greater the risks it faces, especially in terms of potential geopolitical instability. There is also renewed scrutiny by the federal government of its own reliance on other economies for critical public health and national defense supplies and components, such as personal protective equipment and semiconductors used in military vehicles and weaponry.</p><p> <strong>4. Sustainability</strong> With companies increasingly needing to meet sustainability goals and reduce their carbon footprints, localizing manufacturing offers several benefits. Constructing new, green facilities domestically can greatly reduce Scope 1 operating emissions from company-owned facilities and vehicles. The US has the world&#39;s largest sustainable-building market, with more than 511 million square feet <a href="https://www.usgbc.org/articles/top-10-countries-leed-demonstrate-green-building-truly-global-movement">certified under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design</a> rating system, compared with 180 million square feet in China. Plus, manufacturing a product closer to its end customer reduces emissions from transportation.</p><p> <strong>5. Stakeholder sentiment.</strong> Many companies&#39; stakeholders — including employees, corporate boards, industry organizations, government officials, and other companies connected within a supply chain — want executives to consider <a href="https://www.kearney.com/industry/consumer-retail/article/-/insights/the-2021-reshoring-index-the-tides-are-turning">localizing manufacturing operations</a> . Walmart — the largest retailer in the United States — vowed in 2021 to spend an additional $350 billion through 2030 on items made, grown, or assembled in the US, for example.</p><p> <strong>6. Transportation costs.</strong> When deciding whether to onshore manufacturing operations, executives should weigh the benefits of lower international labor and operating costs against the greater cost of ocean freight shipping. Trans-Pacific shipping costs increased fifteenfold in 2021 from January 2020 levels, and while transportation costs have declined as the economy has slowed, the supply chain volatility of the last few years is front of mind for managers.</p><p> The growth in US manufacturing-facility construction will continue as businesses see value in focusing on aspects of risk mitigation, using automation to offset labor challenges, and even building new facilities that emit less carbon. This reshoring renaissance is just beginning; it takes a few years to plan, permit, and acquire property for new-facility construction.</p><p></p><p> Now is the time for manufacturing executives to understand how their businesses fit into this renaissance and determine whether reshoring is right for them. Using the factors above as a framework, executives should consider these five key questions:</p><ol><li> Can a new facility for my products that uses advanced automation offset higher labor costs?</li><li> Does my current supply chain involve countries that present uncertainty due to geopolitics?</li><li> Will the carbon emissions from my company&#39;s current supply chain improve significantly if we build a new facility powered by renewable energy and localize production?</li><li> Are my stakeholders, especially customers, asking for domestically manufactured products?</li><li> Is the cost savings that comes with eliminating transoceanic shipping enough to balance out a likely increase in labor and new-facility construction costs?</li></ol><p> By seeking answers to questions such as these, the C-suite can better navigate their company&#39;s operations through a changing global production landscape.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/a-reshoring-renaissance-is-underway/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> What Managers Everywhere Must Know About Caste</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/what-managers-everywhere-must-know-about-caste/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/what-managers-everywhere-must-know-about-caste/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 11:00:32 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Hari Bapuji, Kamini Gupta, Snehanjali Chrispal, and Thomas Roulet. <p>Hari Bapuji ( <a href="https://twitter.com/haribapuji">@haribapuji</a> ) is a professor of management at the University of Melbourne, Australia, and a cofounder of <a href="https://air-collective.com/">Action to Improve Representation</a> .

In particular, issues of bias related to caste identity are making headlines around the world more frequently, and maintaining a healthy and productive culture will require leaders to be able to identify, prevent, and mitigate caste-based discrimination.</p><p> The caste system is a sociocultural-economic hierarchy that is pervasive in South Asia and the sizable South Asian diaspora all over the world. An individual&#39;s caste, inherited from their father, is determined solely by their birth and is unchangeable.</p><p> Numerous incidents of caste-based bias in Silicon Valley and elsewhere have been documented in the media. Studies conducted by academics, governments, and advocacy organizations have found that caste discrimination is prevalent in countries with significant South Asian populations, including the US, the UK, Canada, and Australia. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p></p><p> Within South Asia, which is home to a quarter of the world&#39;s population, caste bias can have disastrous consequences for individuals and organizations. For example, in June 2023, Vivek Raj, an employee of Indian fashion retailer Lifestyle International, died by suicide after recording a statement alleging <a href="https://www.thequint.com/south-india/vivek-raj-dalit-bengaluru-employee-lifestyle-dies-caste-discrimination">workplace caste discrimination</a> . In another case, Indian food delivery company Zomato faced public backlash for <a href="https://www.thequint.com/opinion/zomato-ad-kachra-lagaan-caste-marketing-teaching-moment">a 2023 advertisement</a> that reinforced derogatory caste stereotypes.</p><p> Multinational companies, such as Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Dell, and X (formerly Twitter), have recognized the importance of this issue by addressing caste-based discrimination in their corporate policies. Over 20 US universities have also included caste as a protected category in their policies, alongside race, gender, religion, and others.</p><p> In February 2023, the city of Seattle passed a law to outlaw caste discrimination. A similar bill was passed by California&#39;s legislature but was vetoed in October 2023 by its governor, who said that caste-based discrimination was already prohibited under the state&#39;s existing laws. These legislative efforts are in line with laws in countries that have caste systems, such as India, whose constitution outlaws caste discrimination and guarantees affirmative action for low-caste individuals in public education, employment, and political offices.</p><p> Managers everywhere need to understand these issues to help protect employees of South Asian origin from caste-based discrimination, bullying, incivility, and harassment, and to avoid the legal jeopardy that can result from such acts in the workplace. Managers could also improve the well-being and performance of individuals and their organizations by addressing the influence of caste on activities such as hiring, corporate social responsibility, information sharing, and networking. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a></p><h3> What Is Caste, and Why Is It Relevant?</h3><p> The fundamental assumption underlying the caste system is the notion that humans are created as unequal groups. This inequality is manifested by arbitrarily assigning different levels of purity and value to groups of people on an artificially defined hierarchy that gives some of them socially enforced rights and privileges, including the right to practice certain sets of occupations.</p><p></p><p> Caste is a complex system comprising thousands of groups and subgroups across religions. Broadly speaking, among those who practice Hinduism, Brahmins are at the top of the hierarchy. Their occupations have traditionally included religious duties and knowledge professions like recordkeeping, science, and education. Next in the hierarchy are Kshatriyas (who have traditionally occupied military roles), followed by Vysyas (businesspeople and traders) and Shudras (workers and laborers). Similar groups and subgroups are found among those practicing other religions. For instance, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4357934">among South Asian Muslims</a> , there are high castes (Ashraf, consisting of the Saiads, Sheikhs, Pathans, and Mughals) and low castes (Ajlaf, consisting of artisans and other workers). Among those who practice Sikhism, there are high-caste groups like the Jatts and Khatris. Similarly, <a href="https://scroll.in/article/876000/is-the-caste-system-deep-rooted-among-christians-in-india-a-kerala-bishop-stirs-up-a-hornets-nest">South Asian Christian congregations</a> have formed around distinct caste-based identities.</p><p> Dalits are outside of, and well below, the above groups. They are considered by those following the norms of the caste system as inferior and impure to the point of being subhuman and are relegated to occupations that involve activities like cleaning up excrement and disposing of the dead. Dalits, found across religions, are stigmatized as “ <a href="https://baws.in/books/baws/EN/Volume_05/pdf/14">untouchable</a> ” due to the historic, and still prevalent, practice of other castes avoiding physical contact and spatial proximity with them.</p><p> Adivasis (meaning first inhabitants or, more generally, indigenous peoples) are another group outside the caste system who have historically lived in forest or hill areas remote from urban locations and have often been <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02757206.2023.2204866">stigmatized as outlaws</a> .</p><p> Although individuals from each group today engage in occupations other than those assigned to them by caste, an individual&#39;s caste remains a significant determinant of the social and professional opportunities available to them. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><h3> How Caste Shapes Organizations</h3><p> Caste can shape an organization&#39;s internal environment in a few different ways. The talent pool from which a company hires might not have caste diversity due partly to differences in access to education and other resources that have persisted for generations. Caste determines access to capital and valuable business connections. Research has shown that family firms rely on caste-based networks to share knowledge and resources and exert control over markets and industries. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> Value chains that pass through South Asia replicate caste hierarchies such that high-caste individuals control important activities in the chain (such as design, research, and marketing) while low-caste individuals are relegated to activities valued less (such as product assembly and manufacturing). <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> The disproportionate control of institutions like educational, regulatory, legislative, and industry bodies by high-caste individuals also shapes the environment in which organizations operate.</p><p> Caste impacts the functioning of organizations as well. Recruiters and managers are likely to introduce biases into decisions about hiring and promotion, even at the level of the C-suite. Such biases might be explicit, such as through stereotyping individuals of certain caste backgrounds; or implicit, in the weight placed on markers such as speaking English with a familiar accent or observing certain social etiquette, even when they&#39;re not relevant to the job. Caste stereotypes can also affect the assignment of jobs, such as when high-caste individuals get promoted to managerial roles while low-caste individuals are relegated to low-end jobs, like data entry and coding in the <a href="https://scholarcommons.scu.edu/soc/67/">IT sector</a> or cleaning jobs across sectors.</p><p> Caste also tends to impact workplace interactions; for example, low-caste individuals might experience harassment, bullying, and incivility through behaviors like name-calling or exclusion, or be subjected to unsafe or demeaning work conditions. In one study on caste-based discrimination in the US, 25% of Dalit respondents reported having faced physical or verbal assault; 67% said they had been treated unfairly at work, and 60% reported experiencing caste-based derogatory comments and jokes. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><h3> Why Caste Poses Unique Challenges</h3><p> Caste predominantly operates indirectly, in the form of <em>identity</em> , <em>resources</em> , <em>networks</em> , and <em>culture</em> . A person&#39;s caste is not evident from their physiological features but can be inferred based on those four dimensions and shape their perceived merit. That perception of merit, rather than their caste, can then be claimed as the basis for decisions and actions affecting them. (See “The Indirect Markers of Caste.”) Here&#39;s how caste manifests in each of these dimensions.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> The Indirect Markers of Caste</h4><p class="caption"> Caste is often not directly apparent but can be ascertained based on an individual&#39;s identity, resources, networks, and culture. Together, these dimensions shape the perception of an individual&#39;s merit. Caste discrimination in workplaces is therefore not always explicit but can manifest as biases, stereotyping, and exclusionary practices that are difficult to recognize and address. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAG_Bapuji_RF_Winter_2024_Figure-1.png" alt="The Indirect Markers of Caste" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p></p><p> <strong>Identity.</strong> For many people from South Asia, caste is an inalienable part of one&#39;s identity. Inherited by birth, caste is seen as a symbol of one&#39;s ancestry. Caste identity is further reinforced through practices such as endogamy (marrying within one&#39;s caste), which is intended to maintain caste purity. Nearly 95% of marriages among Indians, including Indian-origin people in the US, occur within the same caste. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> Even a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-02-11/caste-system-of-india-and-south-asia-in-australia-dalit-rights/13135622">dating app for South Asians</a> that a US company developed allows users to filter for high-caste groups to find matches. Several other matchmaking service providers also facilitate marriages within castes.</p><p> An individual&#39;s caste identity is often reflected in their name. Many South Asian surnames (such as Bhatia, Kamble, Khan, Sharma, and Yadav) can be markers of caste. South Asians who do not have a caste-revealing name can face probing questions and exclusion, because caste identity shapes resource availability, networks, and cultural affinity.</p><p><strong>资源。</strong> Tangible resources, such as cash, assets, and investments, are unequally distributed along caste lines. Due to historical differences in rights and opportunities to own and accumulate assets among castes, such inequalities have compounded over generations. Research has found that in India, high-caste individuals are overly represented among the top 50% of wealthy individuals, accounting for 90% of the total wealth, while low-caste individuals have a much higher representation in the bottom 50% of individuals in terms of wealth. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a></p><p> Members of high-caste communities often have systemically greater access to economic capital and the advantages that come with it, such as the ability to attend elite private schools, which affords them greater access to knowledge professions. For instance, <a href="https://theprint.in/india/education/diversity-deficit-in-iims-iits-just-23-sts-and-157-scs-in-9640-faculty-posts/191246/">only 6% of the faculty at the Indian Institutes of Management</a> (premier business schools established by the Indian government) are from the low castes that account for <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/decoded/2021/06/29/measuring-caste-in-india/">the vast majority</a> (69%, according to one estimate) of the Indian population. A similar situation exists in other higher education institutions.</p><p> These differences in resources also affect who can emigrate from South Asia, with high-caste individuals finding it easier to migrate to and get settled in their host countries. For example, nearly 90% of US residents of Indian origin are from high castes. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p><strong>网络。</strong> Caste forms the basis of formal and informal social networks that facilitate economic transactions. Members of one caste are more likely to hire, do business with, and lend financial and nonfinancial support to people from similar caste backgrounds. The long-standing practice of marrying within a caste is one way these networks are formed.</p><p> Caste also shapes networks via other forms of spatial and social segregation. Studies have shown the existence of caste-based segregation in many cities in India due in part to historic factors that allowed each caste to reside in a specific part of the city or town and partly due to individuals&#39; preference to live next to people of their own caste. <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a> Social segregation occurs because of how caste norms shape interactions between castes. For instance, high-caste individuals adhering to such norms might avoid sharing space or a meal with Dalits.</p><p> Formal and informal caste-based associations exist both within South Asia and globally. Such associations can be explicitly caste-based, such as the Brahman Samaj of North America, which is open to all Brahmins, and Pravara Vedika, open only to certain Brahmin subgroups. Some associations represent themselves as broader “community” or linguistic/cultural organizations but are dominated by certain high castes. For example, the Telugu Association of North America is dominated by the Kamma, a high-caste group that actively supports its caste kin; the North American Telugu Association is dominated by the Reddy high-caste group; and the NRI Vasavi Association predominantly comprises members of the Vysya community. <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a></p><p> <strong>Culture.</strong> The dominant culture and norms of a particular South Asian religion or region are often defined in terms of the high-caste culture, even when it is practiced by a numerical minority of the population. These are most often reflected in people&#39;s religious and cultural practices, diets, and spoken languages, which vary by caste. For example, high-caste groups have a hegemony on certain forms of “classical” music and dance because low-caste groups have been excluded from practicing them. These arts are considered superior to folk music and dances practiced by low-caste individuals. Because high-caste individuals have migrated abroad at a higher rate than those from low castes, these cultural artifacts are often perceived as typical of South Asian culture.</p><p> The common misconception in high-income countries that <a href="https://www.livemint.com/Politics/dWUqT4epdPTHNAYuKYVThK/No-vegetarianism-is-not-growing-in-India.html">most Indians are vegetarian</a> is another example of high-caste culture defining the norm abroad. Several organizations and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662520903690">higher education institutions</a> in India adhere to vegetarian menus or have separate kitchens and dining spaces for vegetarians, leading to the segregation, stigmatization, and exclusion of low-caste individuals. Perceptions of South Asian culture are reinforced by the widespread representation of high-caste culture in popular media, including film, TV, and music. Because low-caste individuals do not always fit these profiles, non-South Asian managers might unwittingly treat lower-caste individuals differently as well.</p><h3> What Managers Can Do About Caste Discrimination</h3><p> Caste can be inferred from how it manifests as identity, resources, networks, and culture. For managers of South Asian origin, many signals are visible (such as last names or diet) or can be learned through social interactions (such as location of residence or ancestral occupations) and used in organizational decision-making. For example, research has shown that when the resumes of two candidates of the same profile are presented, high-caste individuals are selected over low-caste individuals based only on the status associated with their last names. <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a></p><p> However, non-South Asian managers can have difficulty discerning cultural cues to caste identity, and since it is a sensitive topic, inquiring about a person&#39;s caste is not appropriate. Low-caste individuals might choose to hide their caste to fit in and avoid exclusion. What, then, can managers do to create a caste-inclusive environment in their organizations?</p><p> To successfully address the challenges of caste, managers need to take a holistic approach that includes making caste a part of organizational diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies and practices, raising awareness through training, and addressing caste inequalities in societies where they are systemic. (See “How Organizations Can Address Caste.”) Managers should also take steps to preempt resistance as these efforts get underway.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> How Organizations Can Address Caste</h4><p class="caption"> Organizations can employ four approaches to creating a more caste-inclusive working environment for South Asian employees and partners. </p><table id="Chart#" class="chart-grouped-rows no-mobile"><thead><th style="border-right:hidden;border-bottom:hidden;background-color:#f0f0f0;"></th><th style="border-bottom:hidden;background-color:#f0f0f0;"></th></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:middle;"><p> <strong>Employee Policies and Codes of Conduct</strong></p></td><td><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Make caste a protected category alongside race, gender, and other aspects of identity.</p><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Include caste in codes of conduct, such as those for suppliers and communication.</p><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Employ equitable procedures for hiring, job assignments, and promotion.</p><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Put protocols in place to address complaints based on caste.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:middle;"><p> <strong>Training and Awareness</strong></p></td><td><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Provide diversity, equity, and inclusion training to identify caste discrimination, and support employees facing such discrimination.</p><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Coach managers on how to manage teams with employees of different castes, create inclusivity in teams, and handle caste-sensitive issues.</p><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Raise awareness of caste privilege and oppression and how they affect individual attitudes and behaviors.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:middle;"><p> <strong>Corporate Social Initiatives</strong></p></td><td><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Provide scholarships, coaching, and training for low-caste individuals where the company has operations, to overcome caste disadvantages and increase access opportunities.</p><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Create opportunities for low-caste individuals and groups to work as suppliers for the company.</p><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Make philanthropic support conditional on nongovernmental organizations and charities having caste-inclusive operations.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:middle;"><p> <strong>Preempting Resistance</strong></p></td><td><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Understand the sources of resistance and the stakeholders involved.</p><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Address resistance through thoughtful and tactful communications to secure buy-in/participation from employees and other stakeholders.</p><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Design external communications to create broad-based support for caste inclusion. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><!--IMAGE FALLBACK FOR MOBILE BELOW --></p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAG_Bapuji_RF_Winter_2024_Table-1.png" alt="How Organizations Can Address Caste" class="no-desktop" /></p></article></aside></div><p> <strong>Explicitly identify caste as a protected category.</strong> DEI policies aim to promote inclusion for people of all identities, and a first step is to explicitly identify caste as a protected category. This recognition should cover all relevant company policies, including those related to the conduct of employees and suppliers, corporate communications, and employee hiring. Companies can explicitly state in their employee conduct policies that caste discrimination will not be tolerated, as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/caste-california-tech-giants-confront-ancient-indian-hierarchy-2022-08-15/">Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/cobc/2021/fy22-code-of-business-conduct-english.pdf">Cisco</a> have done, and implement protocols to comprehensively address reports of caste discrimination in the workplace. Companies can also include caste in their supplier code of conduct (as Canadian retailer <a href="https://www.loblaw.ca/en/supplier-code-of-conduct/">Loblaw</a> has done) to ensure that caste is a protected category throughout their value chains and that suppliers do not alienate or discriminate against low-caste individuals.</p><p></p><p> Policies around company communications and social media messaging should also include guidance on caste-inclusive language. For example, <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-in/dt/policies/social-media-policy.htm">Dell Technologies&#39;</a> global social media policy notes that caste-based hate speech is not tolerated. Companies that host user-generated content should expand their terms of service to prohibit caste-related discriminatory language and slurs, as <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards/hate-speech/">Meta</a> , X, and <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801939?hl=en-GB#:~:text=We%20remove%20content%20promoting%20violence,Disability">YouTube</a> have done, and moderate content that promotes caste indirectly. To develop such policies, organizations can partner with advocacy groups such as the International Dalit Solidarity Network, which has released <a href="https://idsn.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Caste-hate-speech-report-IDSN-2021.pdf">studies</a> on caste-based hate speech.</p><p> Existing practices for inclusive hiring can be adapted for caste with relative ease. Anonymizing applicants&#39; resumes can eliminate some signals of caste from the recruitment process. Employers can instruct hiring managers to disregard candidate characteristics that are not salient to the job, such as accent, etiquette, status of educational institutions attended, and family background. Companies, especially those with subsidiaries in South Asia, must proactively diversify their pool of applicants through targeted referrals or recruiting drives directed at low-caste candidates. These individuals account for the vast majority of the population, and failing to reach them means overlooking a huge talent pool. Structured and standardized interviews that more accurately evaluate candidates based on job-relevant skills can minimize bias at the interview stage and combat caste prejudices in hiring.</p><p> <strong>Increase awareness and training.</strong> Given that caste is an invisible inequality, raising awareness about it is one of the most important aspects of addressing caste discrimination. This training should be aimed at preventing caste discrimination, creating a caste-inclusive environment, and understanding the effects of caste privilege and oppression.</p><p></p><p> Training on caste needs to address the forms of discrimination that low-caste individuals commonly experience, including <a href="https://youtu.be/wJwkIxOpqZA?si=N67lxr5AWEEF2wRQ">slurs</a> , jokes, and <a href="https://dalitdiscrimination.tumblr.com/">derogatory comments</a> about them and their leaders. For example, low-caste individuals from India, which has caste-based affirmative action policies, are often at the receiving end of derogatory remarks, such as “quota candidate” or “reservation people,” that demean the use of these policies. The training should also extend to supporting employees who face such discrimination.</p><aside class="callout-info"><h4> Additional Resources</h4><ul><li> BR Ambedkar, <cite>Annihilation of Caste: The Annotated Critical Edition</cite> (New Delhi: Navayana, 2014).</li><li> “Testimonies of Practice of Caste in the USA,” Ambedkar King Study Circle, accessed Sept. 14, 2023, <a href="https://akscusa.org">https://akscusa.org</a> .</li><li> <cite>Blocked by Caste: Economic Discrimination in Modern India</cite> , eds.

This could include raising awareness about the many ways in which caste discrimination might appear and signaling the inappropriateness of caste-sensitive topics in workplace discussions. Further, without violating the privacy of individuals, companies can collect self-disclosed data on individuals&#39; caste or conduct caste audits (for example, using last names as caste indicators) to understand the caste homogeneity/diversity in their organizations and make employees aware of its implications for organizational functioning and performance.</p><p> <strong>Tackle caste discrimination at its root.</strong> Organizations can work on addressing caste not just internally but within the countries where the caste system is prevalent. Directly funding education and development initiatives in India, Nepal, or Pakistan, for example, can improve access to education for individuals from low-caste backgrounds. Mentoring individuals and groups from lower castes can also help minimize the barriers they face to enter an industry or a profession. Companies can make their support of nongovernmental organizations and charitable organizations (including community and cultural organizations) conditional on their being caste-inclusive in their operations.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Preempt resistance to addressing caste.</strong> Organizations that attempt to address caste are likely to face resistance. Google <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/02/google-caste-equality-labs-tanuja-gupta/">canceled a talk on caste</a> by Thenmozhi Soundararajan of Equality Labs in 2022 after some of its employees objected to it, and legislative efforts to address caste in the US have faced stiff resistance from <a href="https://www.fairobserver.com/world-news/us-news/caste-is-now-weaponized-against-indian-americans/">some Hindu lobbying groups</a> . These groups often argue that caste is an issue of the past or not an issue outside of South Asia and that policies protecting caste could be misused to discriminate against people of Hindu faith or Indian ethnicity. Understanding these sources of resistance to addressing caste can help organizations design ways to overcome them and secure buy-in from all employees and other stakeholders, including via external communications that encourage broad-based support for caste equity.</p><p> Caste is a complex and difficult issue, but addressing it is both an instrumental and moral imperative for organizations around the world. Doing so contributes to more equitable outcomes for individuals and affirms organizational commitment to cocreating a fairer and more equal society for all.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/what-managers-everywhere-must-know-about-caste/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Economic Incentives Are Key to Driving Sustainability at Scale</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/economic-incentives-are-key-to-driving-sustainability-at-scale/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/economic-incentives-are-key-to-driving-sustainability-at-scale/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 31 Oct 2023 11:00:54 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Satoshi Ikeda and Simon Glynn. <p>Satoshi Ikeda is chief sustainable finance officer of the Financial Services Agency of Japan.

To come close to achieving the goals of the <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-paris-agreement-its-down-to-business/">Paris Agreement</a> , the pace and scale of change must be much more radical. The scaling up we need is not simply a matter of dialing up what we have already begun. What we now need is qualitatively different, and today&#39;s approach won&#39;t get us there.</p><p> Merely strengthening disclosure requirements on climate-related data and information could increase regulatory burdens without having a significant productive impact. Regulation needs to be partnered with industrial strategy to create the commercial demand for climate action at scale and for the sustainable finance that is increasingly available. Japan is seeking to do this with a balanced mix of sticks and carrots that is in marked contrast to the approaches of both the United States (mostly carrots) and the European Union (mostly sticks).</p><p></p><p> Today we expect companies to act on climate change without a financial case for doing so. Their nonfinancial rationales might be to do the morally right thing, to satisfy the ESG (environmental, social, and governance) interests of investors, to instill pride and a sense of commitment among workers, or to keep their options open in the face of uncertainty. These are all sound motivations, but they rarely add up to a solid financial case in which cash investments predictably generate surplus cash returns. As a result, they drive incremental commitments but can&#39;t drive action at scale.</p><p> Take, for example, the steel industry, which currently accounts for around 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. There are multiple technological approaches to decarbonizing steel production, but they are all difficult, speculative, and hugely expensive. As Japan&#39;s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) observes in its <a href="https://www.meti.go.jp/english/press/2021/pdf/1027_002a.pdf">technology road map for the iron and steel industry</a> , “Replacing the existing process with a new one … will require a huge amount of capital investment, resulting in large capital and operating costs. But these additional costs are only for decarbonization and contribute neither to improving the performance of steel nor increasing its productivity.”</p><p></p><p> In Europe, the “green premium” for low-carbon steel is expected to be above 250 euros ($265) per ton — a premium of upward of 25% on today&#39;s cost. How many customers would choose to pay this added cost for a product that offers no improvement in performance? Some carmakers and construction companies will pay a bit more for the ESG benefit of using green steel, but they can&#39;t afford to pay much because the consumers at the end of the value chain are not choosing to pay more for green steel. And if customers won&#39;t choose to pay the premium, how can the steelmakers afford the huge investment required? The availability of sustainable finance doesn&#39;t solve that problem if steelmakers have no financial case for making the investment.</p><p> Driving climate action at the scale that is needed will require more than nonfinancial incentives for businesses. A reliance on such incentives will limit us to nonmaterial, incremental outcomes and also leave the whole climate effort vulnerable to changes in sentiment — a real risk we&#39;re already seeing in the backlash against ESG in the United States. For material, transformational outcomes, companies need financial incentives to act, with financial returns that justify the costs and risks involved. That is the only way that enough companies will choose to invest at scale.</p><h3> Creating Demand for Sustainable Finance</h3><p> Where will these financial incentives come from? Today, to shape the availability and focus of sustainable finance, we use scenarios for how different industries need to transition. The International Energy Agency, the Transition Pathway Initiative, the Science-Based Targets initiative, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, and others all set out such sectoral pathways. These scenarios illustrate what is needed, but they don&#39;t make it happen. They are descriptive, not prescriptive. Using these scenarios, we can see what changes an industry needs to make and what an optimal path might be — but describing this path does not move an industry along it.</p><p> The challenge is not about finding the money. The supply of sustainable finance is impressive. The challenge is to create the demand for that finance, in step with the growing supply. Today, providers of sustainable finance lament that take-up of the money they have to offer is low because potential borrowers don&#39;t have the risk appetite; in other words, they are not sufficiently confident of a return.</p><p> For governments, directly paying the green premium through subsidies would be hugely expensive. Fortunately, that is not necessary. What is needed is to create conditions in which companies are motivated to invest the money themselves and are rewarded for doing so.</p><p> There are good examples of this happening. The automotive industry, particularly in the US and European Union, has invested in the transformational shift to electric vehicles, anticipating a near future in which manufacturers will not be allowed to sell vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. And the US government&#39;s Inflation Reduction Act has been described by the World Economic Forum as “ <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/11/how-new-laws-meet-climate-goals/">a compelling nudge</a> ” to the private sector and investors to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors.</p><p> In the US, the approach has been to rely heavily on incentives — the proverbial carrot — which means that companies&#39; participation is voluntary. This reflects what is politically most feasible in the US: It is hard to impose constraints on business, especially at a federal level, in a culture that reveres free enterprise. Incentives are targeted at strengthening the technology leadership of the US economy, playing to a nationalist and environmental agenda. The problem: The incentives needed to kick-start investment in some industries might be very high and might depend in practice on enabling initiatives that cannot be solved with money alone, such as issuing permits to build new long-distance grids for wind and solar power.</p><p> The EU, in contrast, relies principally on regulation — the proverbial stick. This reflects what is politically most feasible; it is hard to offer incentives at the EU level without favoring national target industries and getting into divisive politics. But regulation is unifying and has been the core of the EU&#39;s supranational toolkit. It uses the EU&#39;s market power, a market too big for global players to miss out on. The problem: It might impose unquantified and hidden costs on industry without first gaining political acceptance of that outcome. That is the background to Germany&#39;s recent wobble about protecting its internal-combustion-based car industry from the forced move to electric vehicles.</p><p></p><h3> The Power of an Industrial Strategy</h3><p> America and Europe have hugely different approaches to climate action that reflect their respective self-image and values. Where politics allow, a more balanced mix of sticks and carrots can provide the most effective incentives for companies to progress along their transition pathway. Building up the initiatives in an advertised sequence can provide strong incentives for early action, if companies are confident of the policy environment to come and motivated to position themselves for it.</p><p> Such an industrial strategy is not about picking winners and losers but about recognizing and accepting the idea of winners and losers and playing to win — or to not lose. The incentives work by creating risk that companies are motivated to avoid. The financial case for Volkswagen&#39;s early investment in the electric vehicle market sprang in part from the opportunity to win share from its biggest rival, Toyota. The financial case for Toyota&#39;s recent investment in electric vehicles is partly based on defending its market share. Both companies are strongly incentivized by the threat from emerging electric car makers in China. Similarly, carbon capture and storage is expensive and still speculative, but the financial case to industrialize it could be strong for a fossil fuel company concerned about future prohibitions against extracting and selling its mineral assets.</p><p> This insight aligns well with the way political power sits largely at the national level (or regional level, in the case of the EU). Governments can stimulate climate action in ways that favor their companies and their economies. The incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act are attracting corporate investment, skilled jobs, and technology innovation to the US Japan&#39;s steelmakers are looking to lead the world in new technology solutions for high-end steel, using hydrogen rather than carbon to reduce iron ore to iron. This battle for competitiveness at both the national and company levels is how we can drive climate action at scale in the short time we have to make an impact.</p><h3> Creating and Destroying</h3><p> The transition we are describing is the creative destruction and value migration that have always fueled innovation and investment in a capitalist economy. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> In this important sense, climate change is not a collective-action problem: For systemwide transformations in which nobody loses, the transition will be practically unaffordable. We need winners and losers — or at least the real prospect of winners and losers — to provide the competitive pressure and financial incentive for companies to act.</p><p> The practical task for policy makers is not just to correct for the externalized costs of pollution but to facilitate the dynamic transition to this new state. As researchers have recently asserted, policy makers need to “simultaneously and successfully navigate two distinct but interrelated dynamics: the creation and mass commodification of new green energy technologies on the one hand, and the destruction of powerful, fossil fuel incumbencies on the other.” <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a></p><p> The American and European approaches do not provide this navigation. The carrots of America&#39;s Inflation Reduction Act help to create the new without constraining the old. The sticks of EU&#39;s regulations constrain the old without solving the technological or economic challenge of substituting with the new.</p><p> What would a more balanced and dynamic, sequenced approach look like?</p><h3> Paths to Green Transformation</h3><p> Japan&#39;s approach to green transformation, or GX, involves a mix of carrots and sticks to drive both parts of the creative destruction required, sequenced over time. The <a href="https://www.meti.go.jp/english/press/2023/pdf/0210_003b.pdf">explicit goal</a> is to deliver “both emissions reduction and economic growth,” without sacrificing either. At the highest level, Japanese corporate and government interests are aligned: “The success or failure of GX initiatives is directly linked to the competitiveness of companies and nations.”</p><p> The immediate carrot is the commitment of 20 trillion yen ($140 billion) of government support for upfront investment over the next 10 years and an envisaged 150 trillion yen of public and private investment. The principal stick is an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/carbon/japans-carbon-pricing-scheme-being-launched-april-2023-03-30/">industrial pricing mechanism</a> for carbon that is in trials now and expected to be phased in starting in 2026. The plan includes both a European-style emissions-trading scheme for high-emissions industries and a surcharge on the supply of fossil fuels.</p><p> Announcing the stick now but phasing it in later in the decade creates the immediate incentive for companies to make the technology investments in their transitions, without penalizing them financially before they have had the opportunity to adapt.</p><p> Japanese companies are partners in this effort as well as counterparties. The intent is not just to reduce Japan&#39;s own emissions, which account for 3% of the world&#39;s total, but to position Japanese companies as service providers helping to reduce other countries&#39; emissions too, through the green technology solutions they will offer.</p><p> Companies worked with METI — or with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, in the case of maritime transport and aviation — to develop technology road maps for 10 sectors that collectively cover 80% of Japan&#39;s carbon emissions. In the technology road map for iron and steel, for example, the specialist committee advising METI included representation from the Japan Iron and Steel Federation, credit analysts, and the Development Bank of Japan, as well as professors in engineering and technology. The METI road map illustrates its general framework with a specific example, JFE Steel; JFE Steel in turn presents its corporate road map as an application of the METI framework. This collaboration helps companies commit to ambitious transition plans, with the confidence that the government is doing its part in creating the conditions that will make them viable in terms of R&amp;D, energy infrastructure, finance, carbon pricing, and more. The GX plan is as much about enabling these road maps as it is about mandating them.</p><p></p><p> The plans are not rigid. In the future, different technologies might win out than what today&#39;s plans project. Both government and industry know the technology assumptions that the plans are based on and thus are able to adapt as needed and aren&#39;t locked in. Pluralism is celebrated: The cover image of METI&#39;s strategy document shows multiple paths up a mountain to the 2050 carbon-neutral summit.</p><p> Creating the conditions for corporate investments in this way is the role for governments&#39; industrial strategy, in partnership with sustainable finance. Without such coordinated industrial policies, merely strengthening disclosure requirements on climate-related data and information might increase regulatory burdens unproductively. Government efforts to step up sustainability-related reporting frameworks need to be matched by government actions on the industrial strategy front.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/economic-incentives-are-key-to-driving-sustainability-at-scale/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> R&amp;D Leaders Must Play a Key Role in the Journey to Net Zero</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/rd-leaders-must-step-up-in-the-journey-to-net-zero/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/rd-leaders-must-step-up-in-the-journey-to-net-zero/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 11:00:07 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Dan Edwards and Michael Zeitlyn. <p>Dan Edwards is group managing director and CEO at Science Group, a science, engineering, and technology consultancy.

Momentum can, of course, be difficult to sustain. Carbon reduction may be imperative for the good of the planet, but it requires businesses to think and operate in new ways, to collaborate with more outside entities, to trust data-gathering processes that are new and developing — and to put R&amp;D and innovation leaders at the center of the process.</p><p> Science Group convened a forum of R&amp;D leaders and CTOs — including executives from Amcor, Bayer, Mars, PepsiCo, Procter &amp; Gamble, Solvay, and Stepan — to identify ways in which companies can translate net-zero ambitions into material progress. In particular, we wanted to help define the pivotal role that innovation teams can play in the journey. Here, we highlight insights that emerged from this forum about practices that help build a <a href="https://sustainability.sciencegroup.com/net-zero-playbook/ ">pathway</a> for both industry and the planet to thrive.</p><p></p><h3> A Mandate for Action</h3><p> If companies want their net-zero pledges to be more than well-intended aspirations, they have to make carbon reduction a core business value: Management must lose sleep over it, the way they have historically lost sleep over safety, quality, and profits. Acting on net zero is a cross-functional initiative, and the division of labor can be murky. Marketing, distribution, and other business functions will contribute to the company&#39;s greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction target on their own timelines. Procurement, for instance, might be able to reduce emissions in short order, whereas R&amp;D — which is, by definition, forward-looking — might be working three, five, or even 10 years out. The key, of course, is that all functions are working in concert toward clearly stated goals. R&amp;D should swiftly and explicitly map out how its own role vis-à-vis carbon reduction differs from that of colleagues in other parts of the business. R&amp;D leaders&#39; capacity to present scientific arguments to other executives can be a valuable assist to colleagues who must shape a similar plan.</p><p> Mapping out a companywide collaboration can be a process of self-discovery — one that reveals interdependencies and potential alliances. As R&amp;D digs into its targets, its leaders should also consider how entities outside their own company — suppliers, customers, regulators, nonprofit advisers, and even competitors — can be recruited for what is, after all, as universal a mission as they&#39;re likely to encounter in their lifetimes. Companies may well have other worthy sustainability initiatives in the works, and leaders must be conversant with all of them and understand the interplay between them.</p><p> But it&#39;s also critical that companies give their R&amp;D leaders and CTOs a clear mandate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Once they have it, they will be well placed to instigate changes to ensure that future products and services have lower associated GHG emissions. The R&amp;D and innovation teams will be on the front lines, reducing GHGs by using alternative raw materials, reimagined product designs, and more climate-friendly technologies. To succeed, net zero must be embedded into each project from its earliest days so that a product&#39;s likely GHG footprint is evaluated early and often. Every R&amp;D conversation should now take GHG into account. And lest anyone think this is a half-hearted exercise in virtue signaling, the team should be judged on how well it executes.</p><p></p><h3> Manage the R&amp;D Portfolio to Deliver Net Zero</h3><p> R&amp;D leaders should now evaluate the “carbon health” of their existing project portfolio to see how well it aligns with their targets. Reaching the goal means knowing exactly where and by when the reductions will happen, and not trusting it to luck or to future technologies that are only barely visible on the horizon.</p><p> To date, sustainability has often been the focus of special projects. Such an approach might help secure investment, demonstrate ambition, create momentum, and burnish a company&#39;s image — and those are undeniably heady inducements. Still, we would argue that integrating carbon reduction into the day-to-day fabric of R&amp;D is more vital. Net-zero success depends on the performance of the portfolio as a whole, not the rise or fall of individual projects. There&#39;s nothing wrong with a few big, speculative longer-term opportunities, but placing smart bets across the entire R&amp;D portfolio is a savvier strategy. Not every project is likely to advance the cause of net zero. And, frankly, R&amp;D can let a particular project underperform in terms of reducing GHG emissions — if commercial needs are simply too urgent, for instance, or if another department can offset the deficit by some other means — as long as the wider portfolio stays on track.</p><p></p><p> Choosing which initiatives to prioritize means identifying the most promising battlegrounds. There will be wins that R&amp;D can instigate and move forward. A product might be a prime candidate for R&amp;D to focus on immediately because rethinking its design or manufacture even minimally could have a significant impact on emissions, or because those changes could be made in the R&amp;D kitchen without creating a ripple effect along the whole supply chain. But many of the big wins will require R&amp;D to work with other partners inside and outside the organization, and although they may be harder and take longer to achieve, the outcome may merit the commitment and investment.</p><p> R&amp;D leaders should expect to provide forecasts of their portfolio&#39;s impact on GHG emissions. Measuring the net contribution (even using a simplistic order-of-magnitude estimate of future impact) will allow the company to balance commercial needs and climate-change intent. Environmental, social, and governance reporting will become more prevalent over time as customers and stakeholders insist on knowing which companies have robust sustainability strategies, and the companies themselves realize that those strategies can reduce costs, spur growth, and minimize issues with regulators. Data on GHG emissions is not yet as accurate as the moment demands, but it will inevitably improve. In the meantime, R&amp;D teams will need to get comfortable with using the available data and accepting approximations.</p><h3> The Commercial Reality</h3><p> It&#39;s often said that corporations have a choice: They can get “green” or they can make money. No one is pretending that there&#39;s no truth in this. But as consumers change, the regulatory environment evolves, stories about reputational damage proliferate, and considerations of carbon impacts become more ubiquitous, a different set of commercial realities will prevail. For now, R&amp;D can build momentum by identifying the customers, products, and brands with a preexisting affinity for net-zero messaging. This is low-hanging fruit. It&#39;s here that carbon-friendly products can command a “green premium” or provide a competitive advantage. In arenas where regulation or standards favor — or even require — carbon-reduced products, the marketplace will likely accept a performance compromise or accept a price premium. Wherever the door is already open, innovators can capitalize on the market value of a climate-friendly product. Elsewhere, they will need to get creative and continually hunt for synergies and flywheels, where innovating for net zero brings other advantages.</p><p> Ideally, innovating to serve the needs of the market — that is, delivering on conventional value parameters — will create collateral opportunities to reduce carbon outputs. No one&#39;s going to object to lowering emissions if it seems to be a happy coincidence. There are manufacturing processes, that, in reducing carbon emissions, may also reduce either upfront capital costs or ongoing energy costs. Projects that can make use of them should be prioritized, and R&amp;D leaders should articulate the benefits of carbon reduction, even if the top priority is cutting expenses.</p><p></p><p></p><p> This next proposal may seem counterintuitive in the extreme, but R&amp;D leaders should also consider trading off on price and/or performance if a reduced-carbon product would enable a different kind of win. The words “new” and “improved” have been fused together in the advertising lexicon for more than a century, so companies won&#39;t be thrilled to announce that they&#39;ve made a less-effective product because they wanted to cut GHG emissions at the plant. But regulation, as well as customer and stakeholder intent, have begun to will it.</p><p> “Accomplishing net-zero goals takes courage,” said Robert Reiter, head of R&amp;D in the Crop Science division of Bayer. “There are going to be tensions, and at some point there will need to be trade-offs when the low-hanging-fruit opportunities are gone. I guess one can wait for regulation to level the competitive playing field, but sometimes a company just needs to lead the way.”</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/rd-leaders-must-step-up-in-the-journey-to-net-zero/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Why Text-to-Image AI Requires a New Branding Mindset</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/why-text-to-image-ai-requires-a-new-branding-mindset/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/why-text-to-image-ai-requires-a-new-branding-mindset/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 11:00:21 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrés Gvirtz and Oguz A.

An old-school brand purist might have raised an eyebrow at the way the brand was represented, but the campaign <a href=" https://www.oneclub.org/awards/theoneshow/-award/49451/ketchup-ai">created undeniable buzz</a> , with 850 million earned impressions around the world.</p><p></p><p> We&#39;ve experienced the transformative potential of generative AI on branding in our own classrooms. Generative AI breathed life into King&#39;s College London&#39;s mascot, a fiery-red <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/ioppn-welcomes-new-students-and-kings-mascot-reggie-the-lion">lion named Reggie</a> , as part of the school&#39;s centennial celebration. Thanks to AI tools, the mascot became more than just a static brand symbol: In classroom sessions, Reggie became animated and “alive,” leading some discussions and even sorting through clothes and adjusting prices as we discussed merchandise management. The result: Bland stock images gave way to a beloved mascot that resonated with our students and elicited overwhelmingly positive reactions. But this is just the beginning of these tools&#39; potential for brands.</p><h3> Creativity Versus Control: Choose Wisely</h3><p> Brands ready to shake off the old, protective mindset will find that generative AI opens new doors to cocreation. Text-to-image AI models, such as OpenAI&#39;s DALL-E, eliminate the barriers for everyday consumers to generate visual designs, allowing unprecedented levels of personal connection and customization.</p><p> In Coca-Cola&#39;s groundbreaking initiative “Create Real Magic,” consumers were invited to unleash their creativity by designing advertisements using ChatGPT and DALL-E. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> The winning entries won&#39;t merely be lauded; they will soon light up the billboards of some of the world&#39;s most iconic advertising stages, including New York&#39;s Times Square and London&#39;s Piccadilly Circus.</p><p> Our research, as well as that of others, shows that these enriched connections don&#39;t just affect the people directly involved; they ripple outward, strengthening relationships and enhancing purchase intentions across the broader market. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p></p><p> Despite these exciting prospects, many brands are reluctant to leave the sidelines, likely held back by fears of losing control. The age-old approach of strictly safeguarding brand identity and symbols could make them lagging adopters of text-to-image models.</p><p> Today&#39;s reality is that absolute control over AI technology remains a pipe dream. While generative AI will get better at rendering consistent styles, it is unable to adhere to the rigid guidelines demanded by many brands today. As seen in Heinz&#39;s campaign, while the technology replicated the familiar bottle shape and color, it fell short of reproducing the exact logo or brand name. Brands banking on a “ready” version of this technology might be in for a long wait. Perhaps more importantly, a myopic focus on control could prevent brands from fully unlocking the doors to consumer engagement that generative AI offers.</p><p></p><h3> Brand Managers Need to Be Enablers</h3><p> The path forward requires a mindset shift: Brand managers must evolve from enforcers and guardians to enablers. It is about focusing on broader innovation and connection opportunities instead of obsessing over minutiae like exact color values.</p><p> <a href="https://www.akqa.com/work/gofundme/help-changes-everything/">GoFundMe&#39;s “Help Changes Everything” campaign</a> made new consumer connections by using text-to-image models to engage with donors in the most personalized way possible. Rather than producing typical year-end content, GoFundMe used tools like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion to produce a series of AI-generated street mural-style images showcasing all of the fundraising campaigns and donors of the past year. These individual pieces were then compiled into a captivating video that resonated strongly with audiences and received widespread acclaim. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a></p><p> Brand managers who are open to such opportunities can leverage text-to-image models to transcend traditional communication boundaries and achieve previously unattainable levels of personalization and authenticity.</p><p> Of course, risk appetites differ. What works for a daring brand like Monster Energy might not for a conservative institution. But even in highly regulated and conservative settings, it is possible to experiment in a way that constrains risks and costs. The risks and potential negative consequences of one-off campaigns or small-scale projects are limited and thus are ideal opportunities for brand exploration. Our endeavor to animate our university&#39;s mascot serves as a case in point.</p><h3> Experiment Safely: Lessons From Coca-Cola</h3><p> This isn&#39;t a call for anarchy. Brands can explore the possibilities of generative AI while keeping within their comfort zones and established boundaries. Coca-Cola&#39;s protective measures include using its own platform, maintaining oversight over <a href="https://www.createrealmagic.com/">content displayed on its site</a> , and providing participants with Coca-Cola-themed templates, all to retain a degree of control over brand portrayal.</p><p> Coca-Cola&#39;s initiative was done in partnership with a text-to-image service alliance of Bain and OpenAI, which helped it switch from a reactive stance to a proactive one. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a> Providers that offer brands such as Coca-Cola security and safeguards will likely emerge as preferred partners.</p><p></p><p> Of course, brand managers must guard against potential misuses and walk a tightrope between creative freedom and control. But let&#39;s not forget: Brand perceptions have always been coauthored with consumers and have depended on an intricate two-way relationship between brands&#39; actions and consumers&#39; reactions. Indeed, consumers have long been instrumental in molding brand perceptions, whether it&#39;s through word-of-mouth endorsements or scathing reviews. Generative AI only intensifies this dynamic, empowering the consumer to wear various hats: They can play the role of designer, cinematographer, or even software developer. In the age of generative AI, active listening, consistent monitoring of consumer sentiments, and an agile approach to recalibrate strategies based on real-time feedback and emerging trends become even more important.</p><p> While brands cannot control every narrative twist, they can guide the dialogue more proactively. One effective approach is to cultivate environments where consumers can connect with one another and the brand and contribute to the brand story within a framework of transparent rules, incentives, and recognition. Coca-Cola&#39;s generative AI campaign, for example, clearly communicates the value it places on consumer input — by rewarding top contributions with highly visible advertising placements, as well as a chance to be selected for a trip to the Coca-Cola headquarters to participate in a content-creation workshop. The brand has invested in a specialized digital platform tailored to promote innovation and deepen consumer relationships while at the same time mitigating risks and maintaining alignment with its core values and identity.</p><h3> Addressing Ethical and Legal Concerns</h3><p> Brand managers also need to be vigilant about ethical and legal issues surrounding text-to-image models. As lawsuits entangle key AI tool companies, staying abreast of these developments around ownership and intellectual property (IP) rights becomes essential. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> Brands are legitimately concerned about legal implications, but where challenges arise, innovation follows.</p><p> Adobe offers one innovative example of how to ease customer concerns regarding IP issues. For its Firefly generative AI tool, which lets people create or enhance images using simple prompts, Adobe trained the AI models on stock images, openly licensed content, and public-domain materials free from copyright constraints. That&#39;s a forward-thinking approach aimed at addressing customers&#39; concerns.</p><p></p><p> Another promising approach is collaborative IP creation agreements that focus on mutually beneficial relationships between AI developers, creators, and brands. A case in point is Shutterstock&#39;s Contributor Fund, which compensates creators when their images are employed in training generative AI models. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a></p><p> Brand managers should opt for partnerships with platforms that have effectively mitigated IP risks. Brand managers could also consider adding specific protections in their contracts, where the platforms confirm that they have properly licensed training data and provide guarantees for any potential IP infringement cases against the brand. For generative AI developers, this serves as a compelling incentive to develop models that respect the copyrights of creators and positions them as desirable collaborators for brands.</p><p> All in all, text-to-image generative AI models are tearing down the walls of the traditional branding castle, creating a new reality ripe with opportunities, risks, and challenges. As we navigate this transformation, every brand manager must confront a vital question: Will your brand be a builder of bridges or barricades in this new era?</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/why-text-to-image-ai-requires-a-new-branding-mindset/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> There Actually Is an &#39;I&#39; in Team</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/there-actually-is-an-i-in-team/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/there-actually-is-an-i-in-team/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 11:00:43 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Elad N.

Your operators work in highly interdependent teams on the assembly lines, and they&#39;re dealing with a fundamental technological change that you recently implemented. Robotic arms and automated machines were put in place to streamline the assembly process, replacing several tasks previously performed by hand.</p><p> Now, the robotic arms handle repetitive and precision movements, such as screwing components together and applying adhesives. This change relieves your operators of mundane work and lets them focus on more complex aspects of the assembly process, such as quality control, troubleshooting, and process optimization. However, they must adjust to the new work environment: They need to individually learn how to operate and maintain the automated systems while also learning how to coordinate differently as a group.</p><p></p><p> This kind of fundamental change to how members of a team relate to their individual roles and to one another plays out in all kinds of workplaces. Whether it&#39;s triggered by organizational decisions to adopt new technology, new regulations, or structural transformations, it requires adaptation on both an individual and team level.</p><p> Members of an accounting team grappling with changes in disclosure laws, for example, may need to individually master new reporting rules as well as rethink collaboration within the team to establish new internal control systems. Employees of an organization transitioning from a functional structure to a divisional structure may need to individually acquire knowledge about the products and services offered by each division in addition to learning how to effectively coordinate with colleagues in the new cross-functional environment.</p><p> Overcoming these dual learning and adaptation challenges is key to successful change management, but as we note in <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2022.1621">our recent paper in <cite>Organization Science</cite></a> , leaders often don&#39;t pay adequate attention to whether, when, or how individuals on their team reskill — and when they do, their focus is often on the team as a whole. Our research shows that there may be benefits to making individual reskilling a priority. Our study of how teams and individuals adapted to change in a manufacturing company revealed that when individual learning happens first, teams adapt more easily to fundamental change.</p><p></p><h3> Reskill the Individual Before the Team</h3><p> Successful teaming requires skills at two different levels: Team members need to become proficient in their own tasks, and they need to work well together. Until team members master their individual skills, we argue, it is difficult for a team to master and maximize collective coordination. This is because collective mastery can often be built only on individual skills. To best deal with fundamental change, individual skill development should occur first.</p><p> These ideas are supported by our study of fundamental change as it unfolded in a division of a large electronics manufacturing company in eastern China that employs more than 10,000 workers. We followed 116 production teams over several months. These teams had just begun adapting to a series of radical technological advances that required the use of novel tools and production processes. To gauge team performance before and after the change, we used the company&#39;s own metric, yield, which is the percentage of products that are manufactured correctly to technical specifications.</p><p></p><p> As we expected, the need to adjust to the change did negatively affect yield. About two weeks before the change, the average yield was 99.15%; about four weeks after the change, the average yield had dropped to 93.82%. But the drop was not distributed equally across all teams. We attributed some differences among teams to variations in the intensity of the change the team faced: Some teams had much more to relearn at both the individual and collective levels.</p><p> However, after accounting for the intensity of the change, we found that the teams that had initially focused on individual reskilling performed 12% better than the teams that, right off the bat, had focused on improving collective coordination. Reward systems played a critical role: Team members who were given more individual-focused rewards (compared with team-focused rewards) at this initial phase excelled early on in recovering from the change.</p><p> When we explored yield again two months later, in a later phase of the change, the average yield across all teams had climbed back to 96.95%. Yet, there was a high variance in team performance compared with pre-change team performance.</p><p> At this point, teams that had built on individual reskilling and were now focused on collective coordination were performing 11% better than teams that had not made that switch. That change in focus was enabled by a more collectively oriented reward system. Teams that emphasized team rewards at this later phase of change more easily shifted their focus from individual reskilling to collective coordination.</p><h3> Manage Change in Two Phases</h3><p> Our research demonstrates how managing fundamental organizational changes requires a two-phased, sequential response.</p><p> In the early periods following a fundamental change, leaders should encourage individual task reskilling. Such reskilling means not only providing relevant training but also giving members time to experiment and master their tasks alone, before making any attempts to improve the team as a whole. In the context of our study, teams that succeeded early on gave members more time to experiment with new ways to complete their own tasks and adapt the standardized equipment to their own needs.</p><p> The reward system should support such individual reskilling in this phase. When rewards reflect individual contributions, team members focus on improving individual skills. Such rewards promote self-focus and the pursuit of personal goals.</p><p></p><p> In the later periods following a fundamental change, once team members have mastered their individual tasks, they can begin experimenting with coordination and task flow and identifying redundancies in their collective processes. For our study, once members had mastered their new tasks individually, it became clear that some of them could complete their tasks faster than before. This outcome implied that the teams had to change how tasks were assigned to maximize workflow efficiency. This is the phase in which a greater emphasis should be placed on team rewards. When rewards are team-focused and the pay differences between members are minimized, team members focus on learning collective skills. These rewards promote a focus on others, collaboration, and the pursuit of team goals.</p><p> The sequencing of rewards is critical to ensuring that team members focus on the right priority in the right order, by moving from an initial focus on individual reskilling to only later practicing collective coordination. Providing only team-oriented rewards right from the beginning fails to incentivize the individual reskilling that forms the basis of team action.</p><h3> Timing Matters</h3><p> While our research provides some empirical evidence to support the idea of building individual skills before team skills to improve adaptation to change in a business environment, we can observe how this principle applies equally in other domains.</p><p> In the early 1990s, a new rule was introduced in soccer that disallowed goalkeepers from using their hands to pick up balls that the defenders had kicked back to them. This represented <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/unsure-footing/">a fundamental change</a> in the way the sport was played, because it required new skills and new types of coordination.</p><p> At first, teams struggled to perform under the new rule. Defenders, by habit, would kick the ball back to the goalkeeper. Because the goalkeepers could not touch the ball with their hands and were less skilled at footwork, teams made mistakes.</p><p> Many soccer coaches initially focused on the handoffs between the goalkeepers and defenders, to improve how this set of players coordinated with each other. Such approaches were not very successful. They put the horse before the cart by asking players to focus on collaboration before both goalkeepers and defenders had developed their new individual skills.</p><p></p><p> In contrast, other coaches focused on helping the goalkeepers and defenders first become proficient on their own dribbling and passing skills without making them work with each other. Only later, once the players had individually acquired those skills, did these teams get them together to coordinate their defense and offense in new and creative ways. This strategy was much more successful and led to a reimagining of how the game as a whole was played.</p><p></p><p> Collective capabilities can grow only on a foundation of strong individual skills. Leaders often forget that and, in times of change, try to rally the team to work better together before members have mastered their individual tasks. Leaders managing change should remember to provide enough space and incentives for individuals to experiment and learn new technologies and knowledge on their own before coming to the team to chart out how best to collectively collaborate.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/there-actually-is-an-i-in-team/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Entrepreneurial AI in the Enterprise: LG Nova&#39;s Shilpa Prasad</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/entrepreneurial-ai-in-the-enterprise-lg-novas-shilpa-prasad/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/entrepreneurial-ai-in-the-enterprise-lg-novas-shilpa-prasad/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 11:00:22 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. <p>Sam Ransbotham ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ransbotham">@ransbotham</a> ) is a professor in the information systems department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College, as well as guest editor for <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> &#39;s Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy Big Ideas initiative.

Each episode, we introduce you to someone innovating with AI. I&#39;m Sam Ransbotham, professor of analytics at Boston College. I&#39;m also the AI and business strategy guest editor at <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> .</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And I&#39;m Shervin Khodabandeh, senior partner with BCG and one of the leaders of our AI business. Together, <cite>MIT SMR</cite> and BCG have been researching and publishing on AI since 2017, interviewing hundreds of practitioners and surveying thousands of companies on what it takes to build and to deploy and scale AI capabilities and really transform the way organizations operate.</p><p>大家好。 Today Sam and I are excited to be joined by Shilpa Prasad, entrepreneur in residence at LG Nova. Hi, Shilpa. Welcome to the show.</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Thank you, Shervin. Excited to be here.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Tell us about LG Nova and your role there.</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> I get asked this a lot. LG Nova is the innovation center of LG Electronics, based here in Silicon Valley. Our mandate is very simple: We&#39;re tasked with finding new business opportunities for LG Electronics that are not core to their bread-and-butter business. LG Electronics is a consumer electronics manufacturer traditionally, looking to make forays into solution-driven businesses. And so [it&#39;s] constantly identifying new technologies and areas that can be interesting for them to build upon and hopefully launch billion-dollar businesses out of it.</p><p> That&#39;s what LG Nova is. My role at LG Nova is entrepreneur in residence, and what that entails is I have many different hats that I wear, one of them being a plain consultant for the corporation. And by consultant, I don&#39;t mean traditional consulting but more in the context of, what are some of the trends to look out for, what new technology areas could be interesting, [and] how can we combine a multitude of technologies, maybe, for a business opportunity? That&#39;s one part of it.</p><p> The second part of it is very much focused on outside-in innovation. Our roots are set on the fact that we don&#39;t want to do what somebody else has already done, and startups are a great example of how quickly they innovate. And we want to bring that innovation into the enterprise that we are and leverage some of that capability to chart out a path together.</p><p> So collaboration with startups is key, and that&#39;s where the entrepreneur side of me kicks in — where you&#39;ve got to be able to understand the mindset of the entrepreneur, the speed at which they function, what drives them, what makes them do the stuff that they do — and convey that to the corporation in an effective way. And then, of course, there&#39;s the reverse role, where the entrepreneurs don&#39;t necessarily — outside of the corporation — understand the workings of the big corporation, and how you bridge that gap, I think, is very crucial to the role. It sounds very simple, but there are a lot of balls in the air in that sense, and you&#39;ve got to be able to juggle all of that at the same time while keeping your eyes on the goal of building new business.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> You&#39;re talking about a large, global, multibillion-dollar company that&#39;s operating at a given speed, and you also want this group to operate at a much faster, I would assume, entrepreneurial speed. So I could imagine why it&#39;s juggling a lot of balls.</p><p> I wanted to ask you, is it identification of these technologies or innovation opportunities/disruptors, or is it an addition — incubation and building — of these as well?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Yeah. So there is the ideation piece, but there is also the venture-building piece, and part of venture-building is incubation. So you have maybe six months to identify an opportunity, build toward something, and then demonstrate that capability both on the product side [and] on the business side to senior stakeholders and investors wherever necessary, and then drive that to new business. So that definitely is a big part of what I do there.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Maybe it&#39;s just what Shervin and I hear a lot of, but there&#39;s a lot of artificial intelligence with startups, and you haven&#39;t mentioned artificial intelligence yet. So how does artificial intelligence intersect with your role?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> AI is not intersecting. It&#39;s at the forefront of what I&#39;m doing. If you remember like a year, year-and-a-half ago, Sam, there was a big hype around the metaverse, and technologies come and go. My focus is to identify real-world problems that can be solved using and leveraging some of these technologies. So AI is definitely at the forefront. There&#39;s a lot of AI-related work that goes on inside of the enterprise which focuses on servicing the existing business units, and that&#39;s not what I&#39;m put in place to do. My role is to look at AI as a technology and identify areas that could be interesting to solve as a problem in this ginormous world and build a business around it.</p><p> I can&#39;t speak too much of exactly what I&#39;m building, but I can talk to the fact that there is an intersection of augmented reality and artificial intelligence that I personally am charting internally here, which will possibly change the way skilled-training transference, upskilling, reskilling, and content around that is going to play out.</p><p> I&#39;m sure you already know this — that with AI in the mix now, so much of this can be so intuitive, with a feedback loop that can be generated for both the trainee and the reviewer and essentially allow workforce development or skill training in particular to move forward at a much faster pace.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> It seems like AI is going to be more of a key ingredient of the mix, not just an additive, and so keeping humans in the mix is going to be even more key. I hear thematically in what you&#39;re talking about a focus on that. So tell us a bit about AI that&#39;s happening. You said you can&#39;t speak much, but I still want to tease some information out of you. So talk about AI that&#39;s happening within this innovation center, or contrast it with AI that&#39;s happening at the enterprise.</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> I&#39;m sure both of you are very familiar with a large enterprise and the channels one has to navigate in order to get anything to market. And what I mean by “get anything to market,” it&#39;s also about releasing something which impacts a lot more inside the enterprise, right? So when you look at the traditional sort of research that happens around AI within the enterprise, and particularly LG Electronics, my understanding thus far has been that the appetite for risk-taking is limited because it disrupts a lot of their existing work, [whereas] something like this that I&#39;m charting out is leveraging some existing technologies that are out there, and when we launch something like this into the market, none of the existing pieces are impacted — in fact, they&#39;re benefited.</p><p> So LG, for example, has 85,000-plus workers across the globe working in factory environments. Everybody understands today that there is a gap in the labor that&#39;s available in the factories from a front-line worker perspective. There are productivity-related asks constantly within the enterprise to make sure that the entire … capacity is being met. These are all real problems that the AI research within the enterprise is not addressing.</p><p> You asked about the time to market. My mandate is six months to figure out whether a business can go to market or not. I think on the enterprise side, it&#39;s a few years, if not more, right? Anywhere between two to five years.</p><p> It has always been a topic of conversation, saying, “Corporate is slow; the startup is fast.” So I&#39;m essentially building a startup inside corporate.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> So, what I&#39;m hearing is sort of unshackled from a lot of the sort of legacy scale — with which comes inertia — and much faster sort of as new ventures that are going out. And, of course, some of that innovation then helps some of the existing enterprise AI that&#39;s going on, right?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Yeah.绝对地。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Wonderful. You talked about upskilling, reskilling, and possibly reimagining the role of humans in this whole mix with AI — in the mix you talked about. Tell us about generative AI and where you see that play out in this.</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> I think the possibilities are humongous, just like with any other opportunity in AI. One of the aspects of, for example, intersecting augmented reality technology with AI means that we&#39;re not only focusing on voice and text with respect to AI but also computer vision-related data streams that are being captured and processed in order for skill transference to happen as effectively as possible.</p><p> So think about a nurse training environment. We&#39;re not practicing on real patients but on the dummy. If you have to teach trainee nurses how to position the patient on the bed in order to do a specific procedure, then there is a multitude of value in capturing the data stream from the head trainer nurse in order to see how to do that and, when you&#39;re actually practicing it, to get real-time feedback, right?</p><p> So we&#39;re looking at multiple data streams here. So not just NLP [natural language processing], but we would be looking at computer vision-based technologies and bringing in AI to almost superpower that process and that trainee and training experience on both sides, right? So that&#39;s an example of how we&#39;re doing it differently.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Normally, I&#39;m pretty excited about the applications of artificial intelligence we talk about, but I get a little threatened here [for] a second. I mean I&#39;m an educator here, and I hear you talking about all sorts of different ways of reskilling and retraining. Where do I go? You mentioned a model before with nurses, where the experienced nurse would teach the less-experienced nurse. Maybe a lot of that gets replaced. What&#39;s the role for that experienced nurse now in this new model?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Yeah. Well, actually, Sam, I think your fear is maybe misplaced here, and let me explain this. We&#39;re not trying to replace the trainer. What we&#39;re doing is actually empowering the trainer with more opportunity to do the stuff that they should be doing. So in the training-of-the-nurses example, a head nurse has to actually physically stand next to the trainee nurses, possibly multiple times during the day, and teach them how they&#39;re doing their specific tasks. Now imagine a scenario where we&#39;ve eliminated at least two levels of feedback, review, and assessment before the head trainer can actually come into the mix and take a look at what&#39;s going on.</p><p> So the certification, I think, is still very, very important, right? Whether it be manufacturing, whether it be health care — the two examples that we&#39;re talking about — the certification is still important, and that certification comes from the trainer, who is the expert. So we&#39;re not removing the expert. It&#39;s actually empowering the expert to also be able to train effectively and not have to monitor 100 screens of trainee nurses that are doing their job. So you see the difference, hopefully.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah. Sam&#39;s a tenured professor, so I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going anywhere. But, Sam, it&#39;s a little bit like the full professor, ie, yourself, sort of not being bogged down with the things that a graduate student can take care of, and you only do the tough ones and the ones that really tease your brain.</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Yeah.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That sounds glorious to me.</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> I think it&#39;s an assistant, right? You&#39;d have an AI assistant that could actually do a lot of the grunt work that otherwise you have to sit and do. So I think there is value in it. At least we&#39;re seeing some inferences of value that we&#39;re able to generate in the very early conversations we&#39;re having.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Wonderful. Shilpa, tell us a little bit about your background, how you ended up in this role.</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> My career is a zigzag line, Shervin; it&#39;s not a straight line to what I&#39;m doing today. Over the years, I think there&#39;s always been a lot of value and joy that I have found in creating something [from the] ground up. The energy, the momentum, and the rigor it requires to scoop something up from nothing and create something out of it has been at the core of everything I&#39;ve done.</p><p> So very early on in my career, I had the opportunity to partner with someone to start [up] a graphic design studio. And there, I learned the mechanics of what it takes to actually create a business. It taught me a lot of the pieces that went into it.</p><p> From there, I&#39;ve always landed myself in roles that were actually entrepreneurial in nature or servicing the entrepreneurial ecosystem. I&#39;d like to mention a company called YouNoodle Inc. that I worked with here when I first came to Silicon Valley. There, I learned the power of selecting the right startups or innovations to work with in order to move innovation forward, whether in the context of corporations, governments, universities even, and large-scale accelerator programs.</p><p> That led me to my own entrepreneurial journey again, during COVID. It was really difficult. I launched a startup called LongPlay and built a team of about 10 people. It was focused around changing the way corporate innovation happens. And one of the things I think there is, when you&#39;re outside of the corporate, there is just no way to understand all of the different moving parts that go on. So we couldn&#39;t prove product-market fit there, which is where Nova came into the mix. I got the opportunity again to try to do a product-market fit in an industry and an environment that was a little different from what I was used to, but I think the nuts and bolts are the same. So that&#39;s just a quick background on me.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> It&#39;s super exciting — very multidisciplinary. And it brings me to my next question: There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to AI, and it&#39;s of course a full ecosystem of engineers and software engineers and prompt engineers and AI engineers and data scientists, etc. But I&#39;ve been noticing a gradual evolution of the skills over the past, I would say, 10, 12, 15 years or so, from hard-core technical-only to also more multidisciplinary, and that “multidisciplinary” could be in a variety of areas. It could be in social sciences or it could be in human-AI interaction, or it could be in philosophy or whatever. But are you seeing the same thing, and what is your perspective on talent of the future in this space of AI?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> It&#39;s an interesting question. I have to say I&#39;m not seeing the same thing.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> OK.</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> I&#39;m not seeing the width as much as I&#39;m seeing the depth. There is still, I think, a tremendous gap in the workforce with respect to being able to be multidisciplinary. There&#39;s a lot of, to your point, deep tech work that happens, especially around AI.</p><p> I think that&#39;s [something that] over the next few years, a lot of the folks like myself that are responsible for how this technology unfolds are going to have to carry with them.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That comes to measurement too. I mean — Shervin, I know that&#39;s a <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/big-ideas/artificial-intelligence-business-strategy/">hot topic for you right now</a> — but when you&#39;re talking about impact, you&#39;ve got to figure out how to measure it. There&#39;s going to have to be some measure of “Is this working? Is this not working?” And these seem like some difficult problems, particularly with the newness of the technology, the freshness of the timelines that you&#39;re talking about. It seems very difficult to figure out if this is working or not working in your role.</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I can give it a little bit of a personal take. My style of building projects has always alluded to testing it as much as possible with the customer who has the problem.</p><p> And that&#39;s where the product focus sort of is very front and center for me, and that&#39;s why venture-building is exciting. When we talk about measurement, there are definitely different ways in which the impact of what we&#39;re creating or what we&#39;re trying to create can be measured. There is a market validation aspect here, right? There is definitely an investor validation aspect, meaning our investors ... It&#39;s not just about my project, right? It&#39;s not just about the project that I&#39;m creating or building. It&#39;s actually more about where the money is going. And, of course, a little bit of it is hype, but a little bit of it is also taking the chance on the next thing that is likely to change the way AI is going to be used in day-to-day environments or contexts.</p><p> I think the third part here is also just about empowering the users, ultimately, of whatever solution we&#39;re creating and whatever we are building, in order for the business opportunity … Ultimately [it] has to add value to the humans — that is, you and I, who are actually going to use that technology to make our lives better. Today, we&#39;re doing the work in the exact same way that we are taught or we&#39;re used to or we have learned how to, and we&#39;re going to have to change that or adapt that and pivot to a new way of doing things.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And is AI enabling you to have better data and information on that? Is AI enabling you to know something that maybe 20 years ago would&#39;ve taken you a lot longer to know?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Absolutely, but I think “Is AI enabling me? Only <em>it</em> will do that,” I think, is perhaps a lot of weight on AI and less relevant to what has been done in the past 10, 15 years in a specific industry. I think AI also has a flip side to it, which is, sometimes it&#39;s putting too much in front of you, where then you have to actually go through the top layers to really figure out where this data can be used and how this data can be applied. So there&#39;s the pro and the con of AI as well.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> You mentioned cons. What kinds of cons are you seeing from these startups you&#39;re working with? What are people struggling with here?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> I think the startups, in particular, are still looking for ways in which whatever they have developed can be applied. The application of AI in effective ways is still to be determined. And so startups are creating all these LLMs [large language models] that can be relevant to the project, but they don&#39;t know <em>how</em> it&#39;s going to actually translate.</p><p> So I&#39;d say there&#39;s still a little bit of a journey there for the startup to be able to understand it. And in the context of the role that I have today, for example, I&#39;m also enabling the startup to understand how they can use the technology that they&#39;ve created and translate it over to a meaningful problem, but … that&#39;s why I said consulting before. It&#39;s consulting for the startup as well: to give them some real-[world] scenarios where you can apply something that we&#39;ve built together and then see how it translates into value. So I think the startups are still learning for sure, Sam.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So those things actually tie back to maybe some of Shervin&#39;s comments about breadth and breadth of knowledge and multidisciplinary, because you didn&#39;t specifically mention that they&#39;re struggling with technology. I heard lots of things there that were not particularly technology-oriented.</p><p> Let&#39;s transition here. One of the things that we do at the end of the episode is we ask you five questions. We&#39;re going to ask them fast. We just want your first reaction from them. What do you see as the biggest opportunity for AI right now?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Health care.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> OK. What&#39;s the biggest misconception that people have about artificial intelligence?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> That it&#39;s going to replace them. That it&#39;s going to replace us as humans. That&#39;s not going to happen, I think. We&#39;re a ways away from that.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Ways away.好的。 What&#39;s the first career that you wanted?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> To be an entrepreneur. I think it was always in my DNA.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Good. Did you have a lemonade stand when you were growing up?</p><p> When is there too much artificial intelligence? Where are we trying to make a square peg fit in a round hole?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> I don&#39;t think I have a concrete answer for you, Sam, there. So if you&#39;re going to switch the question out …</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Ask it this way: Can it be too much?</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Can you put too much artificial intelligence into a product?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. I think an area that comes to mind is cobots — collaborative robots. It could work, it may not work, and then it&#39;s very heavily AI-driven. So automation is key there, but how much of that could be relevant, I think, is questionable for me personally.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> If you were fantasizing, what&#39;s one thing you wish artificial intelligence could do right now that it can&#39;t currently do?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Make me sound as good as I possibly can.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Shilpa, thank you so much. This has been illuminating and wonderful.

This is thought to be particularly true when serving online shoppers, who are known to be less patient and have shorter attention spans; after all, competitor websites are but a few clicks away.</p><p> Most business leaders we know prioritize eliminating friction at the “moment of truth,” when displaying prices and taking payment, because beyond wanting to make life easier for eager customers, they fear giving customers reason to pause and reconsider their decisions. But as we will demonstrate, it is precisely in giving customers time to consider their purchase decisions when money is on the line that longer-term benefits and cost savings can accrue to the firm.</p><p></p><h3> Friction and the Fickle Online Shopper</h3><p> It&#39;s easy to see why making shopping as seamless as possible is so urgent for e-commerce companies, when the average global cart abandonment rate for the last 12 months stood at a staggering 71.7% overall — 60.7% among people using desktop or laptop computers, 65.1% among those using tablets, and 77.4% for those using mobile phones. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> This last figure is perhaps the most troubling, given that mobile shopping in the US grew by more than $200 billion in three years to reach $431 billion in 2022. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> According to the Baymard Institute, the average large e-commerce site could increase conversion by 35% by streamlining and simplifying the checkout process. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p> Not surprisingly, e-commerce titans such as Amazon and Alibaba are investing heavily in quickly ushering consumers through their moments of truth by making prices and payments nearly invisible. Amazon pioneered one-click shopping back in 1999. Today, the attention is on its Just Walk Out technology, which blends computer vision, weight sensors, and deep learning to bring some of the ease of online shopping to physical stores: Patrons tap a credit card when entering a retail location to open a virtual cart, select items from the shelves, and leave without stopping at the cashier. At Alibaba, digital payments and self-service checkout stations are the norm across its 300 Freshippo supermarkets. People can even leverage its Alipay affiliate&#39;s facial recognition technology to “pay by face.”</p><p> Companies with fewer resources are making changes to their purchase processes that are more incremental but no less significant. Consider, for example, the recent popularity of “buy now, pay later” installment financing or of automatic-renewal clauses for subscription-based services, which allow companies to avoid the annual reckoning of customers reconsidering whether they still want the service. Online businesses have embraced these and other opportunities to make spending money less painful simply by allowing customers not to think about it.</p><p> However, it is simplistic to think of friction as having strictly negative effects, such as annoying customers or depressing sales. While it is true that too much resistance in the purchase journey can easily crowd out the desire to buy, too little resistance dumbs down decision-making and leads to missed opportunities to better connect with customers. The question we suggest that business leaders ask themselves, then, is whether they really want their customers to purchase on autopilot.</p><p> In this article, we explain how a little friction in the buying process can help companies engage customers and offer guidance on how to leverage these effects to build stronger customer relationships.</p><h3> No Pain, No Gain</h3><p> Some friction in the purchase journey can protect consumers from fraud, privacy violations, or their own unintended actions. For example, requiring two-step verification and asking the customer to confirm that they want to complete the purchase are two commonsense inconveniences that ultimately ensure that customers are safeguarded from threats and mistakes.</p><p> But either too much or too little friction around a purchase decision can have negative effects. Having too many steps in the purchase journey can distract shoppers, leaving them without the cognitive bandwidth to carefully consider their decisions. This fuels cart abandonment rates and removes opportunities to engage customers with the company through reviews, referrals, recommendations, or other interactions. Too little friction, and people don&#39;t think enough about their decisions, giving in to the human inclination to economize on mental effort. This absence of friction is numbing, and the less connected shoppers are with a purchase, the more ambivalent they become. That lack of commitment can in turn prompt product returns, weaken brands, and reduce satisfaction in the long run.</p><p> A purchase journey that is sufficiently challenging, however, is engaging. Because the transaction is neither stressful nor straightforward, people have an incentive to invest mental effort in the task. In other words, the right amount of friction can prompt customers to refine and consolidate their preferences and can lead to three benefits for companies.</p><p></p><p> <strong>1. Friction helps sellers select the right customers.</strong> Companies that prioritize the long-term profitability of their customer bases over the immediate gain from making a sale must take a holistic and equally long-term perspective on developing relationships with their target audiences. This involves investing in acquisition, retention, and growth. With that idea in mind, the question is whether hurdles that increase the psychological pain of considering an expense will disproportionately deter would-be customers who are more costly to acquire, less likely to purchase again on future occasions, or less likely to increase their spending on the brand over time or recommend the brand. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p> Friction to weed out the wrong customers or select the right ones is a familiar technique in luxury goods markets and in any context where a company wants prospective customers to demonstrate commitment. Ferrari, for example, is known for making it difficult to buy special-edition cars. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> Similarly, luxury fashion brands don&#39;t mind fostering queues, whether virtual or real, or complicating the purchase process by temporarily withholding prices, lengthening the checkout process, or using other approaches. The simple logic behind these tactics is that only the customers who are most interested in the company&#39;s products or most invested in the brand will find working through these inconveniences and complications acceptable in the shopping journey.</p><p></p><p> <strong>2. When friction enables better decisions, customer satisfaction improves.</strong> Using friction to give consumers a moment to pause and consider the implications of their purchases can forestall buyer&#39;s remorse and encourage shoppers to choose the most appropriate option among the available alternatives.</p><p> Making the trade-off between what the potential buyer will pay and what they will receive sufficiently obvious can help prevent mindless purchasing decisions made in the heat of the moment. For example, social media may pitch “buy now, pay later” financing as a savvy way to buy on a budget, but the ease and convenience of such services, now available in many e-commerce sites&#39; checkout processes, can encourage households to overspend, leading to financial strain and debt accumulation. One survey found that 42% of Americans who took out such a loan made at least one late payment on it. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a> In addition, research shows that payments made either long before or long after the natural moment of consumption can reduce people&#39;s attention to cost. Proponents of buy now, pay later assert that this “separates the fun experience of buying from the tedious process of paying,” when in fact such “transaction decoupling” has been shown to reduce the likelihood that the consumer will use the item purchased. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p> The advantage of avoiding bad decisions is relatively clear from a public policy perspective: Most people would agree that overspending and chronic underutilization of purchased goods are not desirable qualities in a society. But encouraging more thoughtful engagement by customers via friction in the purchase process can pay off for businesses, too.</p><p> One immediate benefit is a drop in return rates. In many sectors, online returns are a considerable drag on financial performance — adding up to as much as 15 to 30 cents per dollar of the price of returned merchandise. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> According to a study by Appriss Retail and the National Retail Federation, close to $220 billion worth of merchandise was returned to US digital retailers in 2021, or approximately 21% of total online sales. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a> And this drag, of course, is not just financial — it&#39;s also environmental. Returned products might not be resalable due to wear and tear or other issues and thus end up being sent to landfills or destroyed. According to one report, online returns in the US alone create 5 billion pounds of landfill waste and 15 million tons of carbon emissions annually. <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a> Adding friction also provides customers with time to consider the purchase and become more invested in it. Brands such as Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and Balenciaga delay the communication of prices in a variety of ways — for example, by introducing personalized experiences with salespeople — not only to select better customers, as discussed above, but to put the product center stage and help customers internalize its quality and meaning. Research at the intersection of marketing and neuroscience reports that revealing prices after product information focuses evaluations on attractiveness and desirability (people ask themselves, “Do I like this?”), while doing the opposite focuses evaluations on monetary worth (people ask themselves, “Is it worth it?”). <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a> In a Gartner study, B2B and B2C customers agreed that if they “realized something new about their needs or their own goals,” they were 1.73 times more likely to buy more. <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a></p><p> Using friction to stimulate thinking that results in a decision to purchase can foster a sense of ownership of the product. This can trigger a stronger bond between company and customers and increase customers&#39; willingness to invest additional resources in the relationship. <a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a> As customers put more thought into the purchase decision, they tend to feel more emotionally attached to the product they ultimately choose. And there&#39;s evidence that connecting with customers at the emotional level is a valid route to maximizing customer value. <a id="reflink14" class="reflink" href="#ref14">14</a></p><p> Finally, research also shows that people tend to value products more when they are obtained through effort — the aptly named “Ikea effect,” in reference to the retailer&#39;s policy of outsourcing the assembly of its furniture to customers. <a id="reflink15" class="reflink" href="#ref15">15</a> The experience of effort can influence how people perceive the value and quality of a product or service, and adding effort to the online purchase process can trigger this effect.</p><p></p><p> Overall, we see that friction is successful at triggering engagement, and we know that engaged customers are generally more satisfied with their interactions and experiences with brands and retailers. Engaged customers become advocates, increasing visibility and credibility for companies. They are likely to engage in positive word of mouth, which can lead to new-customer acquisition and elevated brand reputation. They are also likely to have better customer service experiences, feel valued by the company, and provide meaningful feedback and suggestions. Such feedback is valuable for understanding evolving customer needs and making the right improvements to products or services over time.</p><p> <strong>3. Friction creates space for companies to communicate with customers.</strong> Retaining some friction exactly when people face prices and payment, especially when this friction is unexpected, gains attention. This is an opportunity for companies to advertise what they stand for and the merits of their offerings.</p><p> There are several ways to use friction for promotion. First, companies can involve customers in the payment process to evoke positive emotions. For example, one common practice is to give customers the option to round up the transaction amount to the next highest dollar, with the difference being donated to charity. Another possibility is to introduce pay-what-you-want campaigns, where customers choose the price they will pay for the product. While these initiatives do not expedite payment (it is surprisingly effortful to consider how much one wants to pay for something), they can lead to greater emotional connections.</p><p> Companies can also express prices in ways that are intentionally unconventional to force customers to think harder about the underlying message. <a id="reflink16" class="reflink" href="#ref16">16</a> For instance, an advertisement from Ikea uses cans of soda to playfully quantify the prices of its products. Of course, the retailer won&#39;t accept soda as payment for furniture. And although it takes a moment of cognitive effort to understand the “exchange rate,” the message that the furniture is as affordable as a number of small-ticket purchases, such as soda, is conveyed to customers.</p><p> Another example is Stella Artois&#39;s award-winning “reassuringly expensive” campaign. The brand attempted to signal the high quality of its beer by introducing the dependency between price and quality into its price communication. Stella upended consumer expectations by playfully offering a coupon that increased the price of the product (“Bring this coupon and pay an extra $1.25 on your next Stella Artois”). By presenting a seemingly confusing and illogical “deal,” it nudged customers to conclude that the product is far superior to that of its competitors (and worth the cost).</p><p> Friction in the payment process can also be used to communicate the brand&#39;s values. For example, in 2014, the relief organization Misereor increased donation rates by deploying interactive screens in locations such as airports that asked passersby to donate 2 euros by swiping their credit cards over the screen. The swipe activated an engaging interactive sequence, such as depicting the credit card slicing a piece of bread to feed the hungry or freeing an imprisoned child.</p><p> Finally, in a bold example of extreme friction, outdoor retailer REI closed its physical stores and stopped processing online payments on Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year in the US Its goal was to take a stand against consumerism and encourage would-be shoppers to spend time outdoors instead — a message that underscores the company&#39;s dedication to accessible exploration. <a id="reflink17" class="reflink" href="#ref17">17 号</a></p><h3>The Friction Sweet Spot</h3><p> Better customer selection, consumer decisions, and promotion are three good reasons to abandon the simplistic goal of zero friction. Given the drawbacks of encouraging customers to purchase on autopilot, business leaders should seek to determine the right degree of friction for their companies&#39; purchase processes. In our experience, there are at least five factors to consider. We&#39;ll review them and introduce a scorecard that brings them together and helps to guide decision-making. (See “What&#39;s the Right Amount of Friction for Your Online Customer Experience?”)</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> What&#39;s the Right Amount of Friction for Your Online Customer Experience?</h4><p class="caption"> Use this scorecard to help you determine the optimal amount of friction to help you<br /> cultivate enduring customer relationships.</p><p></p></article></aside></div><p> The first step for every company is to adopt a more accurate definition of what friction is. At the moment, all friction is viewed negatively, which reduces organizations&#39; sense of needing to specify what it actually is. By most accounts, friction is operationalized in terms of time saved. But not all time is created equal. In fact, companies should view negative friction as anything that blocks or distracts customers from the purchase decision, and positive friction as anything that optimizes deliberation.</p><p> The second step is to understand what contexts benefit from positive friction — because this need is not universal. What&#39;s at stake in a particular purchase decision, and does it typically require high or low customer involvement? The two often go together, such that high-stakes decisions also require high involvement, but this is not necessarily the case. For instance, a consumer who is financially secure might not engage more with a purchase decision simply because the item is expensive. And it is exactly when this relation breaks down that you want to step in to proactively manage friction. High-stakes decisions might be such because of the significance of the product or service in question, the scale of the financial outlay, or the personal or social consequences of the purchase. In this spirit, using a technology like Amazon&#39;s Just Walk Out in stadiums might not be good for people who are no longer dissuaded from buying unhealthy snacks by excessively long lines at the concession stand.</p><p> Third, think about your commercial objective. If you care about highlighting cost savings relative to competitors&#39; prices, then, yes — reducing friction by posting your almost-too-good-to-be-true price upfront is worthwhile. However, if you compete on the basis of innovation, quality, or customer service, then perhaps retaining a little friction by delaying when the price is presented is best, because this gets customers to think about and crystallize their preferences. Some friction allows businesses to shift the conversation from “Is it worth it?” to “Do I like it?” And if the goal is to strengthen one&#39;s brand, then adding friction is the right way to go.</p><p> Fourth, consider the makeup of your customer base and the relative closeness of customer relationships. Different customer demographics might require more or less friction, depending on expectations around their understanding of a product or service or their ability to pay. Likewise, relationship stage is important. You might want to include more friction in transactions with new customers versus returning customers, in particular those who might be less familiar with your products or product category. You might want to make it harder for a prospective customer to make a purchase, add a bit of friction for a returning customer, and present a frictionless experience to a loyal customer who fully understands the product or service. A company should maximize enduring relationships with clients — because that is the only path to increase customer value.</p><p> Fifth, think about your choice of route to market. All retail environments could potentially benefit from some friction, but their application will be different. In a brick-and-mortar store, adding pain points that incentivize interaction between a salesperson and the customer might be the right type of friction. In an online store, however, adding steps to foster deliberation can reduce returns and increase subsequent satisfaction with the company. On social media, a company could look to balance content that engages customer interaction and not just click-through rates, thereby helping to dissuade users from mindlessly or impulsively shopping.</p><p></p><p> In fact, for a business selling the same product in brick-and-mortar stores and online, more (positive) friction might be needed in the online or mobile channel, given that product returns tend to be greatest in those channels. One interesting technique that some fashion brands have recently introduced is imposing a fee for online returns. Companies like Anthropologie, H&amp;M, and Zara are charging for returning items online (but not for making in-store returns). <a id="reflink18" class="reflink" href="#ref18">18</a> Yes, charging for returns can antagonize some customers. But, again, this point can be key to retaining the most relevant customers and strengthening relationships with those who persist and make a purchase.</p><p></p><p> “How can we make our prices a little less conspicuous and easier to pay?” is among the most common questions asked of user experience teams and experts. But business leaders should embrace the customer moment of truth rather than work to eliminate it. They should not buy into the popular idea that friction is the ultimate conversion killer.</p><p> Without a doubt, when used poorly, friction can derail the customer experience. But a frictionless world is just as dangerous. This is a lesson most of us learned years ago from our high school physics teacher: Too much friction prevents progress toward a goal, but too little friction can throw everything into chaos.</p><p> Indeed, many business leaders are already telling us that they want customers to spend more productive time on their purchase decisions. This sounds like the perfect job for friction. If thinking leads shoppers to make safer, better choices, and in turn these choices impact companies through lower product returns, more sustainable consumer behavior, higher customer satisfaction, and higher loyalty, then let&#39;s all accept and embrace some hassles and hurdles as yet another — albeit surprising — tool at the disposal of customer centricity.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/can-friction-improve-your-customers-experiences/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
