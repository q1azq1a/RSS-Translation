|盖蒂图片社</p></figcaption></figure><p>尽管当前所有重点都集中在使用数据、分析和人工智能来改进组织决策和运营，但仍有太多数据科学项目失败了。即使对于那些成功的人来说，进展往往也是缓慢且昂贵的。为什么？团队之间的组织差距正在严重影响开发、应用和扩展数据科学项目的能力。需要一种新型角色来弥合这些差距。</p><p>我们不要忽视数据科学的许多方面，这些方面可能会让公司陷入困境——从定义正确的业务问题到开发解决方案，然后提供适当的支持。然而，我们与同事罗杰·霍尔 (Roger Hoerl) 和迭戈·库宁 (Diego Kuonen) 合作进行的部分研究对这种情况的诊断表明，许多公司更多地是在解决组织问题，而非解决方案。</p><p></p><p>我们已经确定了造成这种情况的三个根本原因。首先，数据科学已被<a href="https://hbr.org/2023/06/your-data-strategy-needs-to-include-everyone">“固定”到组织结构图上</a>。这在一代人之前可能是可以接受的，当时数据科学只用于解决相对较少的问题，但现在需要建立它，因为数据科学对每个团队都很重要。</p><p>其次，数据科学旨在改善日常运营和决策，这意味着颠覆。但大多数直线经理都力求控制力、可预测性，并且不出现意外。鉴于破坏和控制是截然相反的，生产线管理和数据科学之间存在着比正常情况更大的紧张关系。</p><p>第三，许多公司似乎期望数据科学家能够完成这一切：神奇地了解业务及其所有细微差别，处理数据质量问题，并说服顽固的经理和员工改变他们长期以来所珍视的流程。许多数据科学家更喜欢简单地创建更好的算法，这意味着其他任务常常受到冷遇。</p><p>这些问题无法最小化——它们是深刻的、结构性的，而且往往是政治性的，很可能需要额外的管理策略。在这里，我们将解决组织问题的一个关键方面，即阻碍数据科学模型开发和部署的各个部门之间的差距。</p><h3>使用连接器缩小差距</h3><p>缩小组织差距的明显方法是用人员来填补这些差距。我们通常将担任这些角色的人称为<em>“连接者”</em> 。一段时间以来，公司指派具有系统分析师、业务分析师、覆盖官员和系统工程师等职称的人员来缩小业务和技术部门之间的差距。他们还试图缩小数据科学项目中出现的差距，将负责这样做的人员标记为数据管理员、数据工程师、紫色人员和翻译人员。</p><p>虽然许多此类努力帮助推动了数据科学项目的发展，但它通常感觉像是一场精心设计的打地鼠游戏：缩小一个差距，另一个差距就会出现。此外，仅这些努力并不能解决一些相关问题：</p><ul><li>直线经理和数据科学家通常无法相互理解。这使得双方特别难以就要解决的问题达成一致，数据科学家也很难获取和理解所需数据的细微差别。</li><li>实施模型需要在业务范围内进行广泛的改变：重新设计流程、对模型如何工作进行培训以及提高运行模型的技能。</li><li>双方可能在 IT 基础设施决策上意见不一致，例如与技术债务相关的决策。</li></ul><p>出于这些原因，我们建议公司按照以下三个步骤，以更加规范的方式处理该问题。</p><p> <strong>1. 定义数据科学项目流程并确定相关人员。</strong>虽然具体细节可能有所不同，但该过程应从界定问题并了解业务环境开始，并以监控/更新生产中的新模型结束。关键工作：确定数据科学团队之外的人员必须参与每个步骤。</p><p>例如，在制定问题和选择项目时，公司希望让团队将受到影响的高级领导者和中层管理人员都参与进来。当需要获取和准备数据时，了解数据细微差别的业务领域专家和准备数据的 IT 专业人员应该在场。开发模型时，应咨询外部软件提供商。当需要将模型插入流程时，业务和流程分析师、受影响流程的经理、培训师和变革专业人员都应该参与其中。最后，当组织将模型部署到 IT 基础设施中，然后对其进行监控和更新时，IT 专业人员、构建数据管道的人员和供应链经理应该做出贡献。</p><p> <strong>2. 评估连接器可以在哪些方面提供帮助。</strong>本质上，此步骤旨在澄清差距。问：“所有相关人员是否完全相互联系——也就是说，他们是否了解自己的角色，是否有足够的沟通，以便以合理有效的方式完成工作？”</p><p>我们发现大多数情况下答案都是“不”。事实上，我们发现连接器在以下方面通常是必不可少的：</p><ul><li>制定要通过数据科学解决的问题：例如，高管可能听说过一些有关人工智能的炒作，但对它可以帮助解决哪些问题或该技术在整个组织中的潜力缺乏足够深入的了解。</li><li>业务人员和技术人员之间的翻译——这是一个古老的鸿沟，至今尚未弥合。</li><li>处理数据质量问题。</li><li>在团队内沟通需求、进度和问题——换句话说，将数据科学项目的多个部分联系在一起，并成为不同团队之间的连接器。</li><li>当其他人看不到全局时，跟踪部署和组织变革的总体目标的进展情况。</li></ul><p> <strong>3.明确连接器的具体作用并将其落实到位。</strong>对于单个项目来说，此步骤通常很简单。我们建议公司还考虑在整个数据科学项目和其他业务之间建立连接器。直线经理和数据科学专业人员之间存在 <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/to-succeed-with-data-science-first-build-the-bridge/">天然的紧张关系</a>，直线经理努力在日常工作中建立控制措施，而数据科学专业人员则致力于颠覆事物。</p><p></p><p>如果不加以控制，这种紧张关系会使数据科学团队很难在公司内立足。项目层面的连接器旨在缓解这种紧张关系：他们帮助高级业务领导者了解数据科学的潜力和挑战，帮助数据科学领导者了解业务面临的首要问题，并建立与业务相一致的数据科学项目组合需要。</p><p></p><h3>公司现在正在尝试什么</h3><p>鉴于建立组织能力以利用数据取得成功非常重要，我们很高兴看到公司尝试各种连接器角色并取得成功。例如，Regions Bank 和许多其他组织都聘用数据产品经理，他们采取端到端的视角。根据最近<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/data/cdo-report/">对首席数据官的一项调查</a>，百分之四十的组织现在采用数据产品管理方法。</p><p>科威特海湾银行创建了一个数据大使网络，以领导部门级别的质量和数据科学项目。瑞士联邦统计局采用“数据科学桥梁”来协调其众多统计职能。克罗格的数据科学子公司 84.51° 拥有一组所谓的解决方案设计顾问，这些人具有商业背景，在数据科学家和业务利益相关者之间进行调解。 （84.51°指的是子公司辛辛那提办事处的纵向位置，就像早期的经度地图供应商一样，该公司能够理解复杂的数据问题。）克罗格的84.51°还使用机器学习操作工具形式的技术来监控状态数据科学项目从开始到持续管理的整个过程，并让所有各方了解情况。许多其他组织也采用了此类连接器角色和工具。</p><p>让我们更详细地研究一下地区银行和瑞士联邦统计局的工作。</p><h4> Regions Bank 的数据产品合作伙伴</h4><p>Regions Bank首席数据和分析官Manav Misra观察到，许多数据科学项目并未成功实施，因此他建立了<em>数据产品</em>的概念以及<em>数据产品合作伙伴</em>的新连接器角色来管理它们。</p><p> Misra 将数据产品定义为针对业务问题的端到端软件解决方案。 “数据产品大量利用数据和高级分析来提供该解决方案，”他说。数据产品合作伙伴既充当数据产品经理，又充当业务合作伙伴，负责实现产品并随着时间的推移对其进行管理。</p><p>每个数据产品合作伙伴都被分配到银行的特定业务或支持部门，并与业务合作伙伴一起参加员工会议，以便更好地了解他们的优先事项。大多数合作伙伴来自银行的业务部门，尽管有些合作伙伴也具有分析背景。</p><p>数据产品合作伙伴的工作包括了解业务部门和最终用户的需求，并以最小可行产品开始开发周期。在此过程的早期阶段，数据产品合作伙伴充当双向翻译者，将分析和人工智能的机会与业务需求联系起来。在后期阶段，他们负责评估整个解决方案的采用和使用情况，监控用户界面的运行情况，跟踪有多少人使用它，并确保产品交付或超过承诺中承诺的价值。原始商业案例。</p><h4>瑞士的数据科学桥梁</h4><p>瑞士联邦统计局认识到，如果要满足瑞士政府不断增长的需求，就需要改进其核心数据科学流程，因此它创建了一个数据科学能力中心，这是一种卓越中心。为了确保能力中心与瑞士政府的其他部门完全连接，领导者配备了一座“数据科学桥梁”——一组专门负责<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-data-science-management-process/">管理六个高级流程的</a>连接器：</p><ul><li>推动协作。</li><li>发展人力资本。</li><li>确保数据质量。</li><li>管理项目组合。</li><li>确保产生积极的业务影响。</li><li>确保数据科学以人为本且值得信赖的应用。</li></ul><p>这座桥正在带来真正的红利。它促进了客户群中的实践社区，帮助人们成为数据工具和报告的更有效用户，并鼓励他们基于共同的语言和理解交流数据科学和人工智能的经验。这座桥正在减少上面列出的六个过程中的混乱。</p><p>此外，担任瑞士政府数据科学顾问的库南指出，“最重要的决定都是在桥上做出的”。 （Kuonen 也是瑞士咨询公司 Statoo Consulting 的负责人，也是日内瓦大学日内瓦经济与管理学院数据科学教授。）Kuonen 相信，随着这座桥的成熟，它将带来更多价值。</p><h3>连接器管理挑战：要问的五个问题</h3><p>尽管连接器具有明显的优势，但管理它们却带来了一些棘手的问题。在某些方面，连接器在组织结构图中的“空白区域”中运作，管理起来总是很困难。例如，公司在管理数据管理员方面运气不佳，因为他们试图协调整个公司各种数据元素的定义。</p><p>公司在定义其连接器角色时应考虑以下问题。答案会因组织环境而异，但一些模式已经开始出现。</p><p></p><p> <strong>1. 连接器在组织中应该位于何处？</strong>最常见的是，连接器位于首席数据和分析官或数据科学组织的领导下，但有时也出现在业务部门的团队中。如果公司在其他角色的矩阵管理方面取得了成功，连接器就可以向这两个领域报告。</p><p> <strong>2. 企业应该如何吸引、评估和留住连接者？</strong>正如数据专家<a href="https://tdan.com/how-to-find-the-right-tweener-for-your-organization/31029">特蕾莎·库什纳（Theresa Kushner）指出的</a>那样，连接器角色具有挑战性，因为它们需要业务和数据知识，以及相当多的软技能。商学院目前有数百个分析和数据科学学位课程，是招聘连接器的好地方。组建连接器团队的组织经常要求业务领导者评估此类角色的候选人；例如，宝洁公司要求领导者找出每位候选人帮助实现的一项“突破性业务成果”。留住员工在很大程度上取决于为这些员工提供可行的职业道路。</p><p> <strong>3. 连接器的职业道路是什么？</strong>经验丰富的技术人员可能非常清楚对连接器的需求，但担心如果他们担任这样的角色，他们将失去技术优势。经验丰富的商务人士可能不想放弃其业务部门或职能部门当前的职业道路。从短期来看，公司应该在数据科学组织中建立责任不断增加的角色，例如薪酬丰厚的高级数据产品经理。我们相信，从长远来看，许多组织都会希望每位高级管理人员都拥有数据科学经验。</p><p> <strong>4. 是否需要不止一种类型的连接器？</strong>由于有些连接是在非常高的级别上进行的，而另一些连接则侧重于详细的技术级别，因此逻辑答案是“是”。但一家公司可能无法承担为一个项目雇用多名员工的费用，因此一些公司要求数据产品经理也扮演较低级别的连接器角色。其他组织要求连接器同时在两个或多个项目中发挥作用。</p><p> <strong>5. 连接器的具体职责是什么？</strong>由于连接器可能拥有项目的最佳整体视图，因此通常会要求他们负责端到端管理（如数据产品经理的角色）。如果连接器经验丰富并且了解并重视数据科学项目中的技术角色，那么这是合适的。如果他们不这样做，他们的连接器职责应该受到更多限制，例如不涉及项目成功的端到端责任的翻译角色。</p><p>随着时间的推移，您的组织将会出现这些问题的更详细答案。</p><p></p><p>在我们与成功使用连接器角色的公司的合作中，相关软件供应商和数据科学领导者告诉我们，随着连接器的激增，数据科学项目的部署百分比也有所增加。我们认为，这是一组重要且持续的角色，几乎每个大公司都需要进一步制度化。否则，数据科学可能会成为一门令人沮丧的科学，部署比例较低，并且在改善业务绩效方面记录不佳。</p><p></p>

这种相关性比公司员工生活中的任何其他因素都更加突出。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a>简而言之，正确登上或付出代价。</p><p>有效的入职过程可确保将新员工充分和全面地带入组织。小型修改使新员工能够更好地浏览此过程，并访问可以帮助他们舒适地集成并提高生产力的信息和服务。</p><p>像新移民一样，新员工寻求有关规范，政策，政治和行为的信息，这些信息将帮助他们在新环境中成功运作。新员工需要清楚角色和期望。他们想要有关公司的背景信息。他们想知道如何壮成长，擅长和晋升需要什么，以及掌握自己的工作所需的需要。他们还想知道什么构成了高标准以及应针对的目标。</p><p>一家大型专业服务公司通过发送一系列由首席执行官，一些董事会成员和执行团队的一些成员发送一系列简短视频来推动其入职过程，并在收到工作机会后立即向候选人发送候选人。这三分钟的视频与公司策略保持一致，每天被发送15天。他们与有关公司对多样性的承诺，成为公司一部分的感觉，如果您将错误作为团队的一部分以及人们期望处理这种情况的期望的期望。这些视频还讨论了获得成功机会的含义。</p><p>在另一种变化中，新员工被分配给一个大型客户的工作项目。数据显示，15个视频加上对一个大型项目的分配，从而提高了代表性不足群体的妇女和个人的表现，因为干预措施提高了工作清晰度。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p>在银行业中，有效的入职推动在两个星期，三个月，六个月，九个月和12个月时进行了利益相关者会议。在会议上，员工从组织中至少五年的人们那里听到了，他们讨论了新员工在入职期间遇到的问题，他们如何克服这些挑战，以及他们对公司的看法12个月的过程。</p><p>该方法的一种变化使用了六个月，12个月，18个月和24个月的间隔，在此期间，利益相关者会议每六周举行一次。结果是雇用48个月后，女性和代表性不足的组的保留率更高。</p><p>入职的重要要素之一是创建和构建网络的机会。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a>该网络带来了获得信息和指导机会的访问。它设定了一种社会情感语气，并影响了新员工在工作中的感觉如何。</p><p>一家金融机构的一项干预措施与新员工共享10人的名单，他们受到鼓励，但不需要在12个月内与他们联系。每个列表都包括一群员工，其中一些人处于执行层面。一些新移民收到了解释说明为什么他们应该在清单上与人们接触，而另一些人则没有。实验中的一些参与者收到了电子邮件提醒，以在三个月，六个月和九个月时与名单上的人们联系。</p><p></p><p>根据在招聘过程中捕获的信息，选择了个人将其纳入给定的新员工清单。如果员工对特定业务部门表示兴趣，则名单包括来自该领域的合作伙伴。该清单还可能包括来自新员工亲密家庭成员居住的城市或地区的领导人或人力资源联系。如果员工需要搬迁以照顾父母或其他家庭成员，则已经提供了基本信息。</p><p>来自代表性不足的团体的个人收到了联系列表，解释了他们为什么要联系的原因，以及电子邮件提醒的工作表现更好。他们的网络传播加速了，这是在公司在公司的一生中衡量的。即使在72个月后，接受干预的所有三个要素的人仍比没有接受干预的所有三个要素的人更快地扩展其网络。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p>一家拥有许多办公室的大型公司发现，其较小工作场所的入职过程似乎更有效。人们感到更加整合，并且他们的网络的建立速度比大型办公室更快。相比之下，在较大的地点，新的侧面员工并没有在几代人之间混合，也没有建立网络。</p><p>作为回应，该公司采用了涉及自助餐厅的推动。根据公司在公司的年数，员工被分配给板颜色。新人被分配了一个蓝色的盘子，六个月的雇员有一个黄盘，而其他员工则有绿色的盘子。每周一次，当人们一起吃饭时，拥有相同颜色的人无法坐在一起。颜色混合创造了员工之间的互动，否则他们将彼此看不见。</p><p>该策略使入门变得容易，因为人们正在创建新的网络。干预导致表征个人在网络中的连接的直接程度发生了34％的变化。它还产生了“中心之间”增长18％，这是一个量化个人在网络中传递信息中作用的指标。</p><p></p><p>在我的整个研究，咨询，写作和实验中，沿着职业轨迹的10分都脱颖而出，是特定种类的轻推和干预措施可以支持建立和维持多样化劳动力的目标。除了吸引，招募和入职候选人外，多样性还可以应用于技能建设，避免办公室繁琐，灵活性和福祉，付费平等，发起和信贷，反馈和促进，网络和赞助。</p><p>为了使组织受益并成为公司战略优势的一部分，必须故意欢迎妇女，有色人种和其他代表性不足的群体的个人，并充分融入组织并维持。该过程应以数据为基础，以利用大数据和AI的潜力获得可持续包容性。它们必须有意提供给组织内其他人提供的信息，联系，技能，项目和支持。必须认识到不平等，并且必须以创造平等和包容性的方式来设计中间行动以推动这些条件。以多样性获胜的公司是设计为每个人都有优势和平整竞争环境的过程。</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/diversity-nudges/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>与Gen AI：Shopify的Miqdad Jaffer的微实用程序</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/micro-utility-with-gen-ai-shopifys-miqdad-jaffer/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/micro-utility-with-gen-ai-shopifys-miqdad-jaffer/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 12:00:41 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. <p>Sam Ransbotham（ <a href="https://twitter.com/ransbotham">@ransbotham</a> ）是波士顿学院Carroll管理学院信息系统系的教授，也是<cite>MIT Sloan Management Reviews</cite>的人工智能和商业策略Big Ideas Initiative的客座编辑。 Shervin Khodabandeh是BCG的高级合伙人兼董事总经理，也是北美BCG Gamma（BCG的AI实践）的coeader。可以通过<a href="mailto:shervin@bcg.com">shervin@bcg.com</a>与他联系。</p><p class="mt20"><cite>我，我本人和AI</cite>是<cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite>和Boston Consulting Group的合作播客，由Sam Ransbotham和Shervin Khodabandeh主持。我们的工程师是David Lishansky，协调的制作人是Allison Ryder和SophieRüdinger。</p> ]]>; </dc:creator><category><![CDATA[AI Augmentation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence]]></category><category><![CDATA[Digital Innovation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Experimentation]]></category><category><![CDATA[High-Tech Entrepreneurs]]></category><category><![CDATA[Marketing Innovation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Online Retail]]></category><category><![CDATA[AI & Machine Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Customers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Data, AI, & Machine Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Digital Marketing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Marketing]]></category><category><![CDATA[New Product Development]]></category><category><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy]]></category><description><![CDATA[Miqdad Jaffer brings a background in engineering to his role as director of product for digital marketplace platform Shopify.

因此能够使用其文本及其图像来确定产品类别的想法能够弄清楚它的属性。它有助于频道。它基本上可以帮助您向更广泛的受众推销并获得合理的分类学。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong> MM嗯。</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer：</strong>当Chatgpt出来时，问题是，我们该如何处理这项技术将其放在商人面前？这是我们想依靠的地方，原因有几个。首先，重要的是要尽快将其掌握在商人的手中，并与技术方面的最前沿保持联系。另一部分是，我们实际上看到了第一次有效用，而实用程序很重要，要去那里，看看我们的商人是否会使用它以及我们可以从中学到什么。</p><p>因此，我们从一个简单的道路开始：“商人正在挣扎的事情是什么？”我们看到他们每天都在苦苦挣扎。在Shopify中有数十亿美元，我们认为这是一个很广泛的工作空间，我们围绕着良好的产品描述的所有条件。然后我们感到“好的，让我们来看看人们如何使用它，看看这是否是可口的。”</p><p>因此，我们迅速求助了一个团队，我们依靠几个不同的原则。 Shopify通常建立在一组原则的基础上，并允许团队快速发展。我们所做的一些原则是，这一定很容易，这必须集成到他们的工作流程中，并且商人需要能够对那里的什么来代表他们的业务。</p><p>这是一个简单的开始。我们说：“好，让我们弄清楚好产品描述的规则是什么。应该多长？它应该使用什么音调？将使用什么类型的单词类型，什么使它真正好？”我们做了提示这一点的基本事情，然后说：“好吧，商人应该提供哪些其他上下文，我们应该寻找什么才能帮助他们？”</p><p>因此，我们说：“好吧，他们可能可以列出一些有关其产品的关键字，这符合<em>他们</em>所知道的知识领域，其余的应该是我们。就像，这应该像按下按钮一样简单。它应该感觉像魔术。”因此，我们将其命名为Shopify Magic，我们想坚持下去。商人要做的就是输入几个关键字，他们选择语调，然后按“生成”。就是这样。那是第一个版本。我们试图快速发货，看看会发生什么，而我们得到的反馈是：“这真是太神奇了。你能到处这样做吗？”</p><p>因此，就像，“好，所以这里有一些积极性。那么，接下来我们该怎么办？”因此，我们添加了一个“特殊说明”字段，最初是在试验中，我们正在做诸如“添加与我的产品有关的名人的报价”，就像如何尝试尝试如何尝试的模因。然后我们看到商人以不同的方式使用它。</p><p>我们看到他们将其用于语言，这很有趣。我们介绍了支持八种语言的能力，我们看到人们用它写翻译，这是可以预料的，但是很有趣。我认为我们看到的最有趣的人之一是，有些商人不会说英语，想向英语观众出售，并将产品描述视为弥合差距的一种方式 - 意外，但同时，同时，这是将产品掌握在用户手中的事情之一，然后用户决定将其使用的用途。值得注意的是，我们为甚至一小窗口开放了企业家精神，甚至比以前更多。</p><p>这就是AI的努力使球滚动的原因。在那之后，每个团队都想要一支球队，每个团队都想做某事，我们以各种方式加速了它。我们试图从UX [用户体验]的角度来系统化事物；每当商人看到某些东西时，他们就会知道这就是要做的。而且，我们还试图研究建筑搭档，这是一位支持AI-AI-IS助手，专门为商业而建造的助手。因此，这就是我们进入的旅程。我们有专门的团队正在研究特定功能，然后我们拥有整个公司，他们正在寻找AI可以加速商业的机会。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>因此，当我和Shervin首次听到您在做什么时，我认为这让我们兴奋的是多么普遍。诸如Shopify将人工智能纳入其工具之类的效果是巨大的。而且我认为我们正在谈论之前，您谈论过在2月[2023]介绍该产品。这是在生成[AI]时期很早的。</p><p>很多人都在调查生成剂，但这是一个令人兴奋的故事，您在生产中使用这些工具很快。我敢肯定，这有点痛苦 - 也许您可以谈论您遇到的任何痛苦或困难；也许其他人从中学到了，但也有多么普遍。这两种都是人们可以从您所做的事情中学到的有趣方式。</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer：</strong>是的。早期的挑战是挑战，但我认为这是一种乐趣。这很有趣，因为这是最新的技术。它有很多效用，我们只是想把它掌握在用户手中。一路上，我们不得不弄清楚您如何进行评估？这是什么提示的东西？您如何系统化这一点并使这是有道理的？这些破布的东西是什么 - 抹布正在<em>检索增强的一代</em>？我如何将更多数据带入提示的这种情况下，以及如何使这一点有意义？</p><p>疯狂的部分是，每周都是其他技术时期的一个月或一年的价值，突然之间有一件新事物需要尝试，我们不想错过这个新事物， 任何一个。每当有新事物出来时，我们都尝试了，我们就探索了。而且我认为Shopify的文化是探索者之一，也是手工艺者和建筑商之一。我们试图做的就是将其交给可以建造和尝试事物的人们手中。我们还在内部做了一些事情来鼓励使用人工智能，我们建立了自己的内部chatgpt实例。我们有内部Wiki进行搜索和发现。我们试图做的就是将其纳入公司的结构。这是正常的。这是预期的。然后，随之而来的所有风险和挑战（包括幻觉）都是人们熟悉的事情。一旦我们让他们熟悉它，我们就弄清楚了在某些情况下也可以解决它并接受它的方法。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我认为这是您提出的非常重要的一点，因为当我回顾自己的经验和BCG在这一领域的经验时，我们正在与许多公司合作，其中许多公司与您具有相同的心态和野心描述并正在将解决方案投入生产中，并正在接受它。然后，我要说的是，有些是对此保留的。我要说的是，其中一些是基于一些毫无根据的恐惧。</p><p>我的意思是，现实是这是新技术，它具有很大的风险，而且风险可能比传统AI高一些，因为它会变得多么普遍。但是我认为等待其他人弄清楚所有风险的心态，然后使您处于某种巨大的劣势，因为您所描述真正领先这些事情的方法是开始进行尝试并对其感到满意。</p><p>我敢肯定，在董事会级别上有一些风险和一些担忧。也许只是对当时的许多人的思考与现实是什么，对我们的某些听众的看法，以便他们了解这些风险可以缓解这些风险，而您却永远远离了这些风险。</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer：</strong>是的。我要说的第一件事是，我想描述谁是企业家，甚至将其置于上下文中。我遇到过的每位企业家都有我见过的任何人的风险承受能力最高。他们愿意放弃生活中的一切来开展业务，有时除了想创业之外，他们什么都不知道。这些人天生就可以容忍风险，因此我们的用户组与其他人大不相同。显然，您将在该用户群中获得一系列公差，但是从本质上讲，这是一个愿意潜入，冒险并尝试事物的群体。然后我们观察到的一件事是他们已经在使用它。因此，我们已经有了使用Chatgpt或其他任何东西的商人，以便能够提示，找出替代方案并将其直接使用到他们的软件中。</p><p>我们进行了短暂的研究，我们问了许多商人：这是您所知道的吗？您如何使用它？你用它做什么？他们中的许多人都喜欢，“是的。好吧，我的意思是，我只是问一切，所以我只是要弄清楚。”我们已经看到了这种情况。所以对我们来说，“好吧。好吧，我们已经拥有了这个耐风险的商人基础，并且我们通常在两个向量上担心的最大问题。”</p><p>向量的恐惧是对失去控制的恐惧。因此，沿着“这怎么说？如果幻觉我该怎么办？这对我来说是正确的吗？它会和我的买家说话吗？”因此，所有这些最初的问题以及对失去控制的恐惧很容易缓解。所以我们说：“好。好吧，这是一个快速的恐惧。我们如何减轻这种恐惧？”而且，我们通过将控制权放回用户手中来减轻人们对失去控制的恐惧。</p><p>因此，Carte Blanche原则是“如果没有用户干预，AI将永远不会写”，因此商人将始终能够看到该消息将是什么。因此，所有的幻觉风险，所有“它将要做什么？”风险消失了，因为现在它将控制权立即放回了用户手中。</p><p>第二个风险是围绕它是否准确，这通常是很多人遇到的一种风险。我们试图管理的方式是，最了解产品的人是出售产品的人。他们最了解的是他们的产品，这就是他们试图谈论的产品，他们正在尝试谈论<em>自己的</em>品牌。因此，对于我们来说，人们对我们的风险并不那么冒险，因为这将由商人决定如何以事实方式代表他们。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>您以这样的方式谈论这一点，但是当您在这里考虑实际的关键词时，这是<em>用户</em>，实际上，当您考虑它时，我们的许多工作人类和人工智能与单独的人类或单独的人AI。感谢您谈论这一点。那是非常关键的。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>我也真正喜欢的一件事是您一直在使用<em>“实用程序”</em>一词。我和Shervin谈论的许多示例，我们会问人们一个例子，他们会提出一些AI繁重的应用程序，他们实施了这些应用程序，这些应用程序跨越了组织的许多部分，这很重要，那是很棒的。但是您所谈论的实用程序似乎是微实用程序。因此，我的意思是，正如您提到的那样，人们可能已经去了一些大型语言模型并生成一些文本，然后将其粘贴到Shopify中。</p><p>您在这里的增量实用程序是在这两个工具之间来回节省了一些，但随后会逐步使其在您的工具和上下文中更好地工作。当您考虑所有这些小块如何乘以数十亿美元时，我认为这很令人兴奋。这与我和Shervin有时看到的故事不同，这是：“我们有一个很大的系统，它具有很大的实用性，并且可能没有太多的用户。”</p><p>我想回到您之前提到的东西 - 也许我只是挑选了您的语气 - 但是您在谈论欺诈检测以及这些传统的人工智能用途。现在感觉就像是矛盾的，但是您说：“哦，是的。我们正在使用它进行欺诈。我们将其用于后端业务优化和这些事物。耶耶耶。我们做了所有这些事情，但这是非常酷的东西。”您能够保持前进似乎真的很令人兴奋。下一步是什么？</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer：</strong>这是一个很好的问题。我认为对我们的希望是，我们希望AI降低企业家精神的进入障碍。我认为对我们的想法是，让我们看一下空间上的一切。因此，我们最近对图像生成做了一些事情。我们认为这是“好吧，好吧，我们也可以依靠这里。我们可以使用不同的操作模式。”因此，我们释放了拥抱的脸管，这背后的想法是“让我们将其投放到市场上，让我们看看人们将如何使用它，让我们以一种无害的方式进行。”</p><p>它背后的想法是您上传产品图像，然后选择需要切换的背景。其中一些，在隆起的场景后面有一些有趣的东西，抬高图像，弄清楚它的遮罩，确保反射和阴影将是好的，然后产生各种背景，这些背景很有意义在商业的静脉下。从中我们可以看到的是以不同方式探索的能力。我们试图与AI一起做的事情，以及您对用户群的风险承受能力的观点，这并不意味着对他们现有的工作流程造成破坏。 Many of them — especially established ones — have existing workflows where they do everything in their specific way, and that&#39;s what works for them.</p><p> All we&#39;re doing is, for anyone that needs that extra push or needs that extra piece, there&#39;s a button to click, a way to invoke this, and it is their choice to make on that. And, Shervin, I like some of the stuff that you were talking about in terms of putting the user in place, and our adage has always been that this is meant to be something that augments and isn&#39;t a replacement. So this is always going to be something that helps a user be the best version of themselves.</p><p> And with image generation, we see the opportunity for them to holistically change their storefront if they want to. If they have a Thanksgiving sale coming up and they want to be able to change all the backgrounds to be fall themed, it&#39;s a quick, easy move for them to do. Their product stays at the forefront, their branding stays at the forefront, but they can merchandise just for the specific event — if it&#39;s Thanksgiving, if it&#39;s Christmas, if it&#39;s New Year&#39;s, whatever it might be. Something that would require additional photo shoots might be a lot easier to achieve now than [it was] previously.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Exactly. Let&#39;s just remember how complex and unnecessarily process-oriented something like this would have been, you know, a few years back, where you have just agreeing on the background and the photoshoot and the look and feel and impact on brand and all of that, and now you&#39;re putting it all in the hands of the merchant.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> For us, it was really important that many people across Shopify were using this, asking the right questions, pushing the boundaries, and understanding some of the nomenclature around it. When I say “hallucination,” I can almost guarantee that 99% of Shopify knows what that means and how that happens and [how] that works. And that makes the conversation much different every time you go toward product development, because it&#39;s not bringing it up and relitigating it every single time. It&#39;s people trying a solution around the normal problems that come up with this technology.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> If I squint, I kind of see something developing over this market of artificial intelligence. You alluded to it with the ease of transfer learning. You&#39;re able to take these existing models and augment them slightly, and I see that as an improvement over the past decade from “Oh, yeah.当然。 You can download these tools and build them yourselves” to “Hey, no, you can take what we&#39;ve done and what we&#39;ve trained our GPUs and burned up our GPUs on and incrementally burn up a little GPU on your own but then move forward.” I think that&#39;s a dynamic that&#39;s happening in this market here.</p><p> But let me go darker here and talk about another dynamic. Is there, let&#39;s say, a race toward mediocrity? And I think that&#39;s a little charged way of saying it, but if all of your users in Shopify are using the same tools to generate the same sort of product descriptions, isn&#39;t that going to lead to a sort of vanilla feeling of all product descriptions? How do we push back and get beyond that? It&#39;s great that we get everybody to mediocre well; how do we get people distinctive? Where do we build off of that? How do we make that beyond mediocre?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Yeah. The problem you&#39;re talking about is a local maxima, effectively, right? So everyone moves toward this standard, simplistic, homogeneous, boring thing. And what we&#39;ve looked at is that all of the tools that we provide will get you started. The idea is not to be “This is the finish line.” The finish line is the merchant. The finish line is their product. The finish line is their brand and being able to represent accordingly. For many cases, this is about getting you something, which is better than nothing, and getting you started and thinking.</p><p> We had one merchant that really described it well for me. He wanted to set up an outlet store for some of the overstock inventory that they had, and they had 3,000 SKUs that they wanted to put together — 3,000 different products that they wanted to put on this initial outlet store. And what he said to me was, “Typically, what I would have done is I would have hired a team, we would have taken three months to get this thing spun up, and we would have tried to put it together.” And he said, “I spent the weekend by myself, and I just used your generation feature. It got me started. I made a couple changes. And in three days, I had an outlet store stood up and ready to go for all my products. And I made the changes necessary. I don&#39;t like the style that you had, so I gave it some specific instructions, and it got to what I wanted.”</p><p> And I think the idea is flexibility within the framework. So provide a framework, let them get started, but give them all the flexibility in the world to do what is appropriate for their business and for them to be able to differentiate to their audience. And I think the key is, every audience is different, and nobody understands that better than the merchant themselves. The idea is capability and augmentation, not replacement. And you&#39;re right; there could be a point of local maxima for people. But we want to leave every escape hatch possible so that they can get out of that.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> One thing I want to stick back to, and you&#39;d alluded to it, was the deterministic versus stochastic nature of this. That seems really difficult to work with [from] a production standpoint — that you&#39;re using tools that have stochastic outputs, but you&#39;d like to have a “defined, tested, refined” process. And those two things seem antithetical to me in many ways.你怎么处理那件事呢？</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Part of it is, there needs to be a risk tolerance built in. So there needs to be almost an expectation that the system will fail and that the user needs to have a way to be able to work through that failure. So product description is a great one. We actually see that it takes multiple generations before the user is happy with what they have in front of them. So with that in mind, you have to allow for that second, third, fourth, fifth generation to take place with no effort whatsoever.</p><p> And so that&#39;s an error case that we know is going to happen, so we plan for it. So there&#39;s this “Regenerate” button right there; it presents multiple options. In other cases, we will try to present as many options as we possibly can to make it easier. So subject lines: You get three options to choose from.你可以改变它。做任何你想做的事。 Then, the other part of this is that we understand that technology is going to change, and the way that people use it is going to change, and their expertise level is going to change.</p><p> So there are people that are going to try and break the system, and there are people that are going to try and work around the system. It&#39;s important that we plan for that scenario, too. So every risk and every failure case has to be considered upfront. And then you almost do it in a fun way, and the one that is typical is prompt hacking, where people are trying to figure out what the prompt was that was used for this. In most of those cases, you do the best you can, but you expect that the prompt will get out there. So you write the prompt in a way that, when it gets out there, it&#39;s like, “Hey, you found me.那太棒了！ You want to apply for a job or something?” There are lots of different ways to like think about this.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Your human in the loop solves a lot of this too.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Correct.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Your whole design philosophy, it really addresses, I think, a lot of the backstops, a lot of the stochastic nature too. Can you give us a bit of your background? How did you get to your role?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I started out as an engineer. I think since I was, like, 12 years old I was programming and trying to figure out how to make the computer do what I wanted it to do. And I took an initial role as an engineer and was introduced to product management in what was then meter data management. So it was like big data for utilities had just come out. I got to work in that space, and then I moved into document classification, then ad tech, and then retail data platform management.</p><p> I&#39;ve always been adjacent to data, and at Shopify, my journey had been [to] build our infrastructure and data platforms, work on our machine learning platforms, and figure out what needs to be built there. And I always had one toe in the machine learning/AI pool at all times. Then I had teams that were focused on the analytics side of it and what merchants were going to experience and how they were going to understand their business. And the mandate was always like “How do I optimize my business with data?” And we looked at opportunities with ML, we looked at opportunities with AI. And then, when generative AI came out, it was just the next step along the way.</p><p> So it&#39;s by luck, by accident, by design — who knows? But I&#39;ve always been in data for the last 15, 20 years, and this was the next step.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> OK. Time for five questions. Miqdad, do you know what that is?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I do not.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> OK.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I mean, I know what five questions are, but …</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Good! So we&#39;re going to ask you five questions rapid-fire style. Just tell us the first thing that comes to your mind.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Sure.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What do you see as the biggest opportunity for AI right now?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I think the biggest opportunity is solving cold start for many people. What I mean when I say “cold start” is looking at a blank screen and not knowing what to do, whether it&#39;s how to navigate a system, write a thing, or whatever it might be — just that unknown moment. I think that&#39;s where AI steps in and does the biggest [benefit].</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I love that. What is the biggest misconception about AI?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> That it will take over. I think that there&#39;s a long way to go. It&#39;s an augmentation, not a replacement, and I think it&#39;s the same as when Photoshop came out. Designers got much better and much more creative, and I think this will raise the bar for everyone in terms of what they can do.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Is there such a thing as too much AI? When is there too much?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I think it&#39;s too much when the user is out of the loop. I think the user needs to have a stronghold in how they use AI and how they interact with it. I think this is not about replacing, and I think this is a matter of augmenting and helping the user be better.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What was the first career you wanted?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I wanted to be a doctor, but I faint at the sight of blood, so that didn&#39;t work out so well.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What is the one thing you wish AI could do that it cannot do right now?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I wish we could incorporate all of the modes of a user wanting to interact, whether it be a combination of voice, facial expressions — just to be able to get that semantic meaning behind the scenes that words can&#39;t do by themselves 。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Wonderful.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> We really appreciate the idea that what you&#39;re doing is using generative AI right now, just barely after it got started. I think a lot of people are wringing their hands and wondering how to use these technologies, and what you&#39;ve shown is a great example of how people can get real utility from this tool right now. Thanks for taking the time to join us today.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Thank you so much for having me, both.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Thanks for listening.

However, companies are rightly worried about the risks of sharing data with third-party AI services, as in the well-publicized case of a Samsung employee exposing proprietary company information by uploading it to ChatGPT.</p><p> These concerns echo those heard in the early days of cloud computing, when users were worried about the security and ownership of data sent to remote servers. Managers now confidently use mature cloud computing services that comply with a litany of regulatory and business requirements regarding the security, privacy, and ownership of their data. AI services, particularly generative AI, are much less mature in this regard — partly because it is still early days, but also because these systems have a nearly inexhaustible appetite for training data.</p><p></p><p> Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT have been trained on an enormous corpus of written content accessed via the internet, without regard for the ownership of that data. The company now faces a lawsuit from a group of bestselling authors, including George RR Martin, for having used their copyrighted works without permission, enabling the LLM to generate copycats. Proactively seeking to protect their data, traditional media outlets have engaged in licensing discussions with AI developers; negotiations between OpenAI and <cite>The New York Times</cite> , however, broke down over the summer.</p><p> Of more immediate concern to companies experimenting with generative AI, however, is how to safely explore new use cases for LLMs that draw on internal data, given that anything uploaded to commercial LLM services could be captured as training data. How can managers better protect their own proprietary data assets and also improve data stewardship in their corporate AI development practice in order to earn and maintain customer trust?</p><h3> The Open-Source Solution</h3><p> An obvious solution to issues of data ownership is to build one&#39;s own generative AI solutions locally rather than shipping data to a third party. But how can this be practical, given that Microsoft spent hundreds of millions of dollars building the hardware infrastructure alone for OpenAI to train ChatGPT, to say nothing of the actual development costs? Surely, we can&#39;t all afford to build these foundational models from scratch.</p><p> Safer experimentation with generative AI is becoming increasingly possible thanks to a burgeoning open-source AI movement that recalls the excitement around Linux in the 1990s. Back then, the development of a free operating system whose source code could be read and edited by anyone birthed an international community of developers who built upon one another&#39;s work to develop a mature suite of software tools that run much of the internet today.</p><p></p><p> Such a <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-01-30-ai-linux">“Linux moment” for AI</a> has now arrived. Open-source models such as <a href="https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/bloom">Bloom</a> , <a href="https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/">Vicuna</a> , and Stable Diffusion, among many others, provide foundational models that can be fine-tuned to specific tasks. Research into highly optimized training routines (such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685">LoRA</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10199.pdf">BitFit</a> ) has found that they can be fine-tuned using commodity hardware, leading to a burgeoning <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3545111">ecosystem of models</a> approaching the performance of ChatGPT (though many <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15717.pdf">technical challenges</a> remain). A leaked memo in which a Google researcher laments “we have no moat” reveals that some see this explosion of open-source innovation as threatening the tech giants&#39; control of LLMs. Still, capitalizing on the rapid developments of these emerging open-source tools safely and responsibly will require new investments in people and processes.</p><p></p><h3> Managing the Risks of Open-Source AI</h3><p> While locally controlled AI solutions keep proprietary data in hand, managers must still take a number of actions to ensure their safe, effective, and responsible use.</p><p> <strong>Navigate model and data licenses.</strong> The term <em>open source</em> is, in many cases, misleading. While some models allow commercial uses, others are restricted to academic or nonprofit use. Sometimes the source code is released with the model; other times, only one or the other is released. Recently created types of licenses restrict specific use cases deemed to be harmful or irresponsible. For example, Bloom and Stable Diffusion are released under <a href="https://www.licenses.ai/">Responsible AI Licenses</a> , which might legally prevent their use in certain criminal justice and health applications. One must also consider the types of data the model was trained on. While including copyrighted material in data sets for training AI models might be considered fair use in some scenarios in the US, case law is far from settled. Having a thorough accounting of the data fed into each model will help organizations better navigate these issues. Emerging efforts like the Data Nutrition Project are adding more structure and reporting requirements to data sets to help users better understand their contents and risks.</p><p> <strong>Prevent data leakage.</strong> Even without submitting data to third-party AI services, organizations risk leaking their own data through open-ended user interfaces such as chatbots. An emerging use case allows LLMs to serve as a conversational interface to a database, which can be a powerful way to let customers quickly find answers to common questions that are customized to their own data. However, preventing the LLM from revealing private information about other customers, or proprietary data of the company, can be challenging. Research by Pew shows that these conversational agents are a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/02/22/60-of-americans-would-be-uncomfortable-with-provider-relying-on-ai-in-their-own-health-care/">concern for many users</a> , especially around sensitive topics like health care. Safeguarding data is made even more difficult by <em>prompt injection attacks</em> , in which malicious users attempt to trick the agent into revealing information it was explicitly instructed not to reveal. In an adversarial setting, the same aspect of AI systems that allows them to be creative and flexible also becomes a security threat.</p><p> <strong>Adapt to changing data.</strong> Another complication with hosting on-premise models is ensuring that they are using the latest data. While the initial release of ChatGPT (GPT-3) famously could not answer questions about events past 2021, more recent models can combine current data with models pretrained on historical data. Firms must balance updating the system with new information while also maintaining stability and consistency in user experience.</p><p> <strong>Mitigate systemic biases.</strong> AI systems can easily perpetuate and amplify social and economic inequalities encoded in the training data. It is well known that LLMs are prone to stereotyping based on gender, race, and ethnicity — such as assuming that nurses are female and doctors are male. While there has been considerable research into how to reduce such behavior, in the end this problem will not be solved by solely technological solutions. Organizations should continuously audit AI systems, measuring their performance and results to ensure that different subpopulations are being treated equitably.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Build trust with customers.</strong> Companies should anticipate heightened sensitivities over how personal data is used and be transparent with customers about any intentions to use their data for AI training — and, ideally, allow individuals to opt in. This is particularly important when it comes to data that is perceived as being extremely personal, such as audio, video, and health data. Simply updating the terms of service and sending out notifications about the change, as some companies have done, can leave customers feeling exploited and broadly damage trust. For example, after Zoom&#39;s recent move to claim such rights to using customer data made news, blowback from users and privacy advocates compelled the videoconferencing provider to not only walk back the changes but declare in its terms of service that it would never use such data to train AI models.</p><h3> Responsible Data Use in the AI Era</h3><p> If open-source AI models continue to be adopted across industries, it will not just be Big Tech facing concerns over data ownership. Every company that wants to deploy these models for tasks as wide-ranging as internal help tools and public-facing chatbots will have to confront issues related to how data is collected and used by AI systems.</p><p></p><p> While there are <a href="https://mozilla.ai/">startups</a> , <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/2048a947-5714-4220-905b-e662cbcd14c8/resource/60050608-0095-4c11-86cd-0a1fc5c29fd9/download/ocha-data-responsibility-guidelines_2021.pdf ">governmental working groups</a> , and <a href="https://responsibledata.io/">academic communities</a> all working on these topics, best practices and recommended policies are still emerging. Stanford Law School&#39;s <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/2023/03/09/a-data-stewardship-framework-for-generative-ai/">AI Data Stewardship Framework</a> specifically addresses generative AI techniques. The Association for Computing Machinery, the world&#39;s largest computing professional organization, has also recently released a set of guidelines around the <a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/public-policy/ustpc-approved-generative-ai-principles">design and deployment of generative AI</a> systems, including LLMs. Those resources cover some of the issues discussed here, including limits on deployment, data and output ownership, and personal data control. We recommend that organizations of all sizes looking to capitalize on open-source AI keep a close eye on relevant guidelines and frameworks for the responsible and ethical collection and use of data for training models. They can be helpful for thinking through the potential technical and social risks of any potential project, and for developing rigorous auditing and monitoring processes to ensure safe and effective deployment.</p><p> At Tulane, we have recently established the <a href="https://tulanecs.github.io/tuceai/">Center for Community-Engaged Artificial Intelligence</a> to investigate such issues. Through a cross-disciplinary team of technologists, social scientists, and civil rights activists, we are working with nonprofits and community groups in New Orleans to understand how AI affects their work. We are brainstorming new ways of building AI systems that cede control over the data and technology behind AI to the people most affected by it. Our work is part of growing efforts around participatory or human-centered AI and data, which recognize that all stakeholders need to be included in the value created by these systems. As corporations move deeper into AI development, adhering to similar values might help them be better stewards of the data that they collect and use.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/use-open-source-for-safer-generative-ai-experiments/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>如何明智地利用人才市场</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-start-smart-with-a-talent-marketplace/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-start-smart-with-a-talent-marketplace/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 12:00:47 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Jeff Williamson and Donncha Carroll. <p>Jeff Williamson is a leader in human resources at Booz Allen.

At Booz Allen, we experienced that truth during the first year after launching our pilot project. Here, we&#39;ll examine some of the challenges we faced, how we overcame them, and what we learned about change management and talent marketplaces.</p><p> Having a talent marketplace represented an important change for Booz Allen. For years, we&#39;d been deploying professional staff members through informal, internal networks that operated based on who you knew and who you trusted. But this path limited our flexibility to make use of available resources and match the right talent to the right work. More importantly, it limited our people&#39;s control over their own career paths, and that hurt engagement and retention.</p><p></p><p> To test a better approach, Booz Allen launched a talent marketplace pilot project in partnership with Lotis Blue Consulting in January 2022. With the pilot, we sought to address talent management challenges that constrained growth and hurt our ability to deliver a compelling value proposition to employees — namely, issues in hiring, deployment, talent development, technology and its adoption, and culture change. We wanted to solve these problems systematically and holistically rather than introduce point solutions, which often fail to compound value.</p><p> But the level of cultural transformation required to activate and operate a talent marketplace is significant. It takes a sustained effort to work through several human behavioral- and perception-driven issues — and overcoming these issues is key to success.</p><h3> The Road to a Talent Marketplace</h3><p> Booz Allen wanted to end its reliance on traditional hiring networks centered around clients or teams. These highly localized networks made it tough to find resources in other parts of the organization that would meet enterprise, regional, or local needs. In contrast, the marketplace established a centralized approach to assess demand and source talent enterprisewide (via external hiring, internal deployment, or upskilling) and created the capability to deploy people across the entire organization.</p><p></p><p> The marketplace pilot focused on skills rather than networks. This gave employees new visibility to open opportunities across the enterprise and managers new insights into talent who could do the work. This high-resolution view on job and development opportunities vastly expanded the scope of what people could explore, improving employee engagement and delivering higher levels of individual and business performance. The pilot doubled the internal fill rate on open positions for the pilot population and garnered positive employee feedback on transparency and ease of pursuing new opportunities. Additionally, this skills-based approach gave underrepresented candidates more opportunities in technical domains with public sector clients.</p><p> In the early months of the pilot, we needed to overcome a few important challenges to build interest and excitement. Most importantly, we needed to seed the marketplace with a sufficient number of high-quality opportunities and available talent to engage both employees and managers. In so doing, we learned several important lessons — especially around change management.</p><h4> Lesson 1: Bring on the gamification.</h4><p> As our clients&#39; environments and needs are changing, the nature of our work is evolving, and we are seeing a rapid shift in in-demand skill sets. Our technical talent&#39;s ability to deliver against a client&#39;s mission depends on how quickly they can learn and adapt.</p><p> To address this, Jim Hemgen, Booz Allen&#39;s strategic talent development leader, and his learning and development (L&amp;D) team designed and launched a badging program alongside the marketplace pilot. The program aimed to develop strategic enterprise capabilities by illuminating different career pathways and the skills required to access different opportunities. To qualify for a badge, an employee needed to both earn the credential and have a manager validate that they had applied the skill on the job. This gamified learning and offered recognition and rewards to employees who invested in their own development.</p><p> The L&amp;D team engaged a large segment of the company&#39;s technical workforce in building strategic capabilities through a combination of internal badging and external certifications. In the past year, employees have earned more than 4,000 badges or certifications that are critical to the future of the business.</p><p></p><h4> Lesson 2: Data goals must be relevant to individual career goals.</h4><p> We encountered several technical challenges associated with the pilot, including data structure (establishing the right job architecture), data quality (ensuring that skills data was complete, for example), and algorithm design (how best to perform the recommendation process for talent and open职位）。</p><p> To get the complete skills data, we needed wide adoption. In reality, adoption closely correlated with the value that users expected to extract from the platform. We had a slow start as employees and managers explored the functionality and benefits.</p><p> That changed once John Grumbine, the marketplace operations leader, helped launch the Career Hub, an internal web app, in January 2023. The app served as a one-stop shop for employees to find jobs, training and development, mentors, and communities in the talent marketplace based on their skills and preferences. Employees now had a vested interest in keeping their skills and preferences up to date because that information drove recommendations for the opportunities, training, and the mentors they could access; further, it drove how they might be discovered or identified by project managers seeking to fill roles.</p><p> Launching the Career Hub app led to a substantial increase in talent marketplace adoption. As of September 2023, more than 50% of Booz Allen employees had onboarded into the Career Hub and were accessing job, learning, and mentoring opportunities.</p><h4> Lesson 3: Even change management needs to change.</h4><p> In the realm of cultural transformation, we quickly experienced four key challenges after launching the pilot. (See “Four Culture Challenges to Conquer.”)</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Four Culture Challenges to Conquer</h4><p class="caption"> You&#39;re likely to encounter these issues as you lead through the culture change related to a talent marketplace:</p><table id="Chart#" class="no-mobile"><thead><tr><th>挑战</th><th>商业影响</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Managers want to keep their best resources or are concerned about becoming a net exporter of talent in an open market.</strong><p></td><td><p> Instead of leaving the team, high-performing talent leaves the organization.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> <strong>Employees are reluctant to seek out reassignment openly for fear that they will appear disloyal to their current supervisors.</strong><p></td><td><p> Engagement and performance of captured staff declines over time.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> <strong>Project managers are reluctant to accept resources they don&#39;t know personally and to trust recommendations from managers outside of their personal network.</strong></p></td><td><p> Assembling the right team for each project is much more challenging.

In response, our team prioritized several important actions to drive the culture change we needed:</p><ul><li> Build, refine, and map out skills-based talent profiles to provide greater clarity on the work people can do or have done.</li><li> Focus (initially) on high-volume in-demand job profiles to create enough liquidity in the system that participants have the opportunity to move.</li><li> Form a small, agile, and action-oriented operations team to collaborate with subject matter experts (for example, from business leadership and talent acquisition) as different challenges arise.</li><li> Provide human-centric support in the form of marketplace navigators — people specifically tasked with helping all participants (employees and managers) follow marketplace rules and guidelines and get the most value from the platform.</li></ul><p> All of these steps can be built into a launch plan for a talent marketplace.</p><h4> Lesson 4: Momentum, motivation, and measurement matter a great deal.</h4><p> At a high level, it&#39;s important to launch several services of an integrated talent management system simultaneously in order to exceed expectations and build adoption momentum.</p><p> To effect behavioral change, leaders must deeply understand what motivates different people, as well as how the changes they&#39;re making will address people&#39;s needs. The pilot provided valuable feedback on marketplace utility, helped prioritize enhancements, and established the level of change management required to support evolving and scaling the design.</p><p></p><p> Monitoring and measuring marketplace performance helped our team try new things, fail fast, and continually enhance the marketplace&#39;s value to participants. More specifically, our metrics included the number of opportunities posted, trends within those opportunities, the level and breadth of employee interest by type of posting, the percentage of aging opportunities (those that went unfilled for a long time), and the percentage of positions填充。 This data helped us evaluate the health and strength of the platform and gave us insight into how system adjustments were influencing performance.</p><h3> Commit to Continuous Improvement</h3><p></p><p> Through the talent marketplace and our other talent system investments, we are delivering a better employee value proposition. Our employee retention improved more than 4% after the pilot. However, this journey never ends. Continuous investment in evolving talent, as well as the solution, is essential to success for the business.</p><p> Addressing obstacles that come up along the way is part of the journey and ultimately leads to a better design and better results. A talent marketplace offers important benefits in today&#39;s evolving labor market: By prioritizing employee mobility and development, companies can better adapt to the changing skill requirements and realize higher levels of innovation, collaboration, and flexibility within their workforces.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-start-smart-with-a-talent-marketplace/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Balancing Change and Continuity During a Transformation</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/balancing-change-and-continuity-during-a-transformation/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/balancing-change-and-continuity-during-a-transformation/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 15:03:53 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Carsten Lund Pedersen and Laurianne McLaughlin. <p>Carsten Lund Pedersen is an associate professor at the IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark.

He highlights Gilbert Daniels, an anti-averager hero, whose research in the 1950s led the US Air Force to design planes with personalized cockpit features to suit pilots of all shapes and sizes rather than just the average male pilot — an innovation that dramatically increased safety记录。</p><p> Marketing strategy also hinges on the principle of acting on differences. Think segmentation: Marketers tend not to design a product or service for the average consumer. Indeed, polarizing brands such as Red Bull pride themselves on the notion that as many people hate their product as love it.</p><p> Yet when it comes to marketing budgets, a common but flawed practice is to use average figures touted by well-meaning researchers. Two of the most established CMO surveys that examine marketing budgets are The CMO Survey, conducted biannually by Duke University (and run by this article&#39;s second author since 2008), and Gartner&#39;s annual CMO Spend and Strategy Survey. The CMO Survey has found that 2023 marketing budgets, on average, represent 11% of revenues in the US, and Gartner has found that 2023 budgets represent 9.1% of total company revenues across North America and parts of Europe. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p> We know from experience that these averages are too often taken at face value. When budgets are lower than average, CMOs inevitably yammer for more spending power. And when they are higher than average, the CFO can find reasons to tighten the financial thumbscrews.</p><p> We argue, however, that an average marketing budget can be highly misleading for planning purposes. CMOs should heed the Monty Python film <cite>Life of Brian</cite> — “You&#39;re all individuals. … You&#39;ve all got to work it out for yourselves!” — and select appropriate peer benchmarks. To help leaders do this, we analyzed marketing budget data through a new lens.</p><p></p><h3> The Key Differentiator: A CMO&#39;s Realm of Control</h3><p> So if the average marketing budget is not correct, which size does fit?这得看情况。 First, the average glosses over systemic sector differences. As The CMO Survey shows, for example, at an average of 13.9% of revenues, B2C marketing budgets tend to be higher than B2B budgets, which average 9.3%. Taking a different view, product brands tend to have higher marketing budgets, at 11.4% of revenues, than service brands, at 10.3%. Companies with $10 million or less in sales have the largest budgets (16.8% of revenues), but this number drops to 9.5% for companies with $10 billion or more in sales. Similarly, budgets exceed 17% at companies with 50 or fewer employees, but they drop to 9.8% for companies with 10,000 or more.</p><p> But why does company size matter, and why are B2C and product brand budgets higher than B2B and service brand budgets? To examine this question, The CMO Survey asked 314 marketing leaders about the breadth of their strategic responsibilities. We found that a significant factor affecting marketing budgets is the realm of control CMOs have at different types of companies. The results highlight significant deviations in marketing budgets based on these responsibilities and entirely account for variations based on company size. In fact, the marketing responsibilities we refer to below account for over 71% of the differences between sectors. In other words, although a peer-benchmark budgeting approach might be appealing, it is also misleading.</p><p></p><p> Our research showed that in 28% of companies surveyed, marketers&#39; job descriptions did not extend beyond communications to operational responsibilities such as sales or e-commerce. And for those “comms-only” companies, marketing budgets were roughly half of the average, at 5.6%. (Almost universally, communication activities included positioning, brand advertising, digital brand promotion, PR, social media, and/or lead generation.) In B2B comms-only companies, marketing budgets stood at 5.9%, or less than two-thirds of the sector average, and in B2C companies, they stood at a meager 4% — less than one-third of the sector average. Comparisons for service (6.1%) and product brands (5.1%) tell a similar story. Surprisingly, for these comms-only brands, budgets are actually larger for B2B and service companies than for B2C and product brands — the opposite of what we see in the average analysis.</p><h3> Strategic Marketers Have the Biggest Budgets</h3><p> In companies where marketing is responsible not only for communications but also for at least one key <em>operational</em> activity — such as sales, distribution, customer service and experience, e-commerce, or customer relationship management — the average budget is higher, at about 7.6% of revenues.</p><p> As in the comms-only organizations, B2B budgets (8.1%) are higher than B2C budgets (5.7%). However, among these marketing-plus-operations companies, budgets are back to being higher for product brands (8.6%) than for service brands (6.8%), which makes sense given the potentially higher channel costs for the former. Having said that, even for this broader realm of control, budgets are still lower than the average, even at the sector level.</p><p> The real difference maker is the addition of at least one <em>strategic</em> activity, such as new products and innovation, market selection and entry, pricing, or growth, to a company&#39;s marketing responsibilities. Among them are areas that business schools have traditionally taught as marketing functions but are not under the auspices of marketing in many companies. The average budget for marketing functions responsible for communications, operations, and strategy stands at 13.4% across companies. Among these, it is now higher for B2C brands (15%) than B2B brands (11.8%) because B2C marketers tend to have a broader realm of control than B2B marketers do. Interestingly, budgets for these companies are also higher for service (14.5%) than for product brands (12.8%), perhaps due to customer experience expenditures.</p><p> Many more areas of control could be considered. When marketing is responsible for privacy in addition to the more traditional marketing functions above, overall budgets leap to 17.7% of revenues. And when managing talent is added to the mix, marketing budgets account for a whopping 23% of revenues. However, comparisons here become unreliable, especially at the sector level, because there are relatively few companies at which marketing is responsible for areas such as talent (11.5%) or privacy (9%).</p><p></p><p></p><p> What&#39;s the moral of the story? If your budget-setting process relies on averages as a benchmark or the wisdom of crowds, make sure you&#39;re using the right crowd as a peer comparison. This requires identifying a benchmark that matches the responsibility profile for your company. Our CMO Survey analysis now provides a way to do so. While the above numbers don&#39;t provide a personalized benchmark, they are far more meaningful than the broad averages typically kicked around in research reports and the popular press.</p><p> A final thought for CMOs is that it&#39;s not all about the money. Above-average budgets come with above-average responsibilities. And that is a topic for organizational design: selecting a distribution of responsibilities that fits the company&#39;s strategy and marketing capabilities.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-end-of-averages-for-marketing-budgets/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> AI Ethics at Unilever: From Policy to Process</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ai-ethics-at-unilever-from-policy-to-process/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ai-ethics-at-unilever-from-policy-to-process/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 18:00:20 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Thomas H.

Most also realize that AI has an ethical dimension and that they need to ensure that the AI systems they build or implement are transparent, unbiased, and fair.</p><p> Thus far, many companies pursuing ethical AI are still in the early stages of addressing it. They might have exhorted their employees to take an ethical approach to AI development and use or drafted a preliminary set of AI governance policies. Most have not done even that; in <a href="https://www.conversica.com/conversation-automation-resources/report/ai-ethics-survey/">one recent survey</a> , 73% of US senior leaders said they believe that ethical AI guidelines are important, yet only 6% had developed them.</p><p></p><p> We see five stages in the AI ethics process: <em>evangelism</em> , when representatives of the company speak about the importance of AI ethics; <em>development of policies</em> , where the company deliberates on and then approves corporate policies around ethical approaches to AI; <em>recording</em> , where the company collects data on each AI use case or application (using approaches such as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomdavenport/2021/05/27/the-future-of-work-now-ethical-ai-at-salesforce/?sh=312432713eb6">model cards</a> ); <em>review</em> , where the company performs a systematic analysis of each use case (or outsources it to a partner company) to determine whether the case meets the company&#39;s criteria for AI ethics; and <em>action</em> , where the company either accepts the use case as it is, sends it back to the proposing owner for revision, or rejects it.</p><p> It is only in the higher-level stages — review and action — that a company can actually determine whether its AI applications meet the transparency, bias, and fairness standards that it has established. For it to put those stages in place, it has to have a substantial number of AI projects, processes, and systems for gathering information, along with governance structures for making decisions about specific applications. Many companies do not yet have those preconditions in place, but they will be necessary as companies exhibit greater AI maturity and emphasis.</p><h3> Early Policies at Unilever</h3><p> Unilever, the British consumer packaged goods company whose brands include Dove, Seventh Generation, and Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s, has long had a focus on corporate social responsibility and environmental sustainability. More recently, the company has embraced AI as a means of dramatically improving operations and decision-making across its global footprint. Unilever&#39;s Enterprise Data Executive, a governance committee, recognized that the company could build on its robust privacy, security, and governance controls by embedding the responsible and ethical use of AI into the company&#39;s data strategies. The goal was to take advantage of AI-driven digital innovation to both maximize the company&#39;s capabilities and promote a fairer and more equitable society. A multifunctional team was created and tasked with exploring what this meant in practice and building an action program to operationalize the objective.</p><p> Unilever has now implemented all of the five stages described above, but, looking back, its first step was to create a set of policies. One policy, for example, specified that any decision that would have a significant life impact on an individual should not be fully automated and should instead ultimately be made by a human. Other AI-specific principles that were adopted include the edicts “We will never blame the system; there must be a Unilever owner accountable” and “We will use our best efforts to systematically monitor models and the performance of our AI to ensure that it maintains its efficacy.”</p><p> Committee members realized quickly that creating broad policies alone would not be sufficient to ensure the responsible development of AI. To build confidence in the adoption of AI and truly unlock its full potential, they needed to develop a strong ecosystem of tools, services, and people resources to ensure that AI systems would work as they were supposed to.</p><p></p><p> Committee members also knew that many of the AI and analytics systems at Unilever were being developed in collaboration with outside software and services vendors. The company&#39;s advertising agencies, for example, often employed programmatic buying software that used AI to decide what digital ads to place on web and mobile sites. The team concluded that its approach to AI ethics needed to include attention to externally sourced capabilities.</p><p></p><h3> Developing a Robust AI Assurance Process</h3><p> Early on in Unilever&#39;s use of AI, the company&#39;s data and AI leaders noticed that some of the issues with the technology didn&#39;t involve ethics at all — they involved systems that were ineffective at the tasks they were intended to accomplish. Giles Pavey, Unilever&#39;s global director of data science, who had primary responsibility for AI ethics, knew that this was an important component of an AI use case. “A system for forecasting cash flow, for example, might involve no fairness or bias risk but may have some risk of not being effective,” he said. “We decided that efficacy risk should be included along with the ethical risks we evaluate.” The company began to use the term <em>AI assurance</em> to broadly encompass its overview of a tool&#39;s effectiveness and ethics.</p><p> The basic idea behind the Unilever AI assurance compliance process is to examine each new AI application to determine how intrinsically risky it is, both in terms of effectiveness and ethics. The company already had a well-defined approach to information security and data privacy, and the goal was to employ a similar approach that would ensure that no AI application was put into production without first being reviewed and approved. Integrating the compliance process into the compliance areas that Unilever already had in place, such as privacy risk assessment, information security, and procurement policies, would be the ultimate sign of success.</p><p> Debbie Cartledge, who took on the role of data and AI ethics strategy lead for the company, explained the process the team adopted:</p><blockquote><p> When a new AI solution is being planned, the Unilever employee or supplier proposes the outlined use case and method before developing it. This is reviewed internally, with more complex cases being manually assessed by external experts. The proposer is then informed of potential ethical and efficacy risks and mitigations to be considered. After the AI application has been developed, Unilever, or the external party, runs statistical tests to ascertain whether there is a bias or fairness issue and could examine the system for efficacy in achieving its objectives. Over time, we expect that a majority of cases can be fully assessed automatically based on information about the project supplied by the project proposer.</p></blockquote><p> Depending on where within the company the system will be employed, there also might be local regulations for the system to comply with. All resume checking, for example, is now done by human reviewers. If resume checking were fully automated, the review might conclude that the system needs a human in the loop to make final decisions about whether to move a candidate to interview. If there are serious risks that can&#39;t be mitigated, the AI assurance process will reject the application on the grounds that Unilever&#39;s values prohibit it. Final decisions on AI use cases are made by a senior executive board, including representatives from the legal, HR, and data and technology departments.</p><p> Here&#39;s an example: The company has areas in department stores where it sells its cosmetics brands. A project was developed to use computer vision AI to automatically register sales agents&#39; attendance through daily selfies, with a stretch objective to look at the appropriateness of agents&#39; appearance. Because of the AI assurance process, the project team broadened their thinking beyond regulations, legality, and efficacy to also consider the potential implications of a fully automated system. They identified the need for human oversight in checking photos flagged as noncompliant and taking responsibility for any consequent actions.</p><h3> Working With an Outside Partner, Holistic AI</h3><p> Unilever&#39;s external partner in the AI assurance process is Holistic AI, a London-based company. Founders Emre Kazim and Adriano Koshiyama have both worked with Unilever AI teams since 2020, and Holistic AI became a formal partner for AI risk assessment in 2021.</p><p> Holistic AI has created a platform to manage the process of reviewing AI assurance. In this context, “AI” is a broad category that encompasses any type of prediction or automation; even an Excel spreadsheet used to score HR candidates would be included in the process. Unilever&#39;s data ethics team uses the platform to review the status of AI projects and can see which new use cases have been submitted; whether the information is complete; and what risk-level assessment they have received, coded red, yellow (termed “amber” in the UK), or green.</p><p> The traffic-light status is assessed at three points: at triage, after further analysis, and after final mitigation and assurance. At this final point, the ratings have the following interpretations: A red rating means the AI system does not comply with Unilever standards and should not be deployed; yellow means the AI system has some acceptable risks and the business owner is responsible for being aware of and taking ownership of it; and green means the AI system adds no risks to the process. Only a handful of the several hundred Unilever use cases have received red ratings thus far, including the cosmetics one described above. All of the submitters were able to resolve the issues with their use cases and move them up to a yellow rating.</p><p> For leaders of AI projects, the platform is the place to start the review process. They submit a proposed use case with details, including its purpose, the business case, the project&#39;s ownership within Unilever, team composition, the data used, the type of AI technology employed, whether it is being developed internally or by an external vendor, the degree of autonomy, and so forth. The platform uses the information to score the application in terms of its potential risk. The risk domains include explainability, robustness, efficacy, bias, and privacy. Machine learning algorithms are automatically analyzed to determine whether they are biased against any particular group.</p><p></p><p> An increasing percentage of the evaluations in the Holistic AI platform are based on the European Union&#39;s proposed AI Act, which also ranks AI use cases into three categories of risk (unacceptable, high, and not high enough to be regulated). The act is being negotiated among EU countries with hopes for an agreement by the end of 2023. Kazim and Koshiyama said that even though the act will apply only to European businesses, Unilever and other companies are likely to adopt it globally, as they have with the EU&#39;s General Data Protection Regulation.</p><p></p><p> Kazim and Koshiyama expect Holistic AI to be able to aggregate data across companies and benchmark across them in the future. The software could assess benefits versus costs, the efficacy of different external providers of the same use case, and the most effective approaches to AI procurement. Kazim and Koshiyama have also considered making risk ratings public in some cases and partnering with an insurance company to insure AI use cases against certain types of risks.</p><p> We&#39;re still in the early stages of <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/big-ideas/responsible-ai/">ensuring that companies take ethical approaches to AI</a> , but that doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s enough to issue pronouncements and policies with no teeth. Whether AI is ethical or not will be determined use case by use case. Unilever&#39;s AI assurance process, and its partnership with Holistic AI to evaluate each use case about its ethical risk level, is the only current way to ensure that AI systems are aligned with human interests and well-being.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ai-ethics-at-unilever-from-policy-to-process/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Rise of Exit Bans and Hostage-Taking in China</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-rise-of-exit-bans-and-hostage-taking-in-china/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-rise-of-exit-bans-and-hostage-taking-in-china/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 12:00:18 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Jack Wroldsen and Chris Carr. <p>Jack Wroldsen is an assistant professor of business law and public policy in the Orfalea College of Business at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, California.

On top of the high-level geopolitical and economic risks to consider, the growing incidence of exit bans, which prevent foreign executives from leaving China if their company becomes involved in a dispute, imposes a very individual human risk. While there has been widespread media coverage of a few cases — the exit ban placed on a Singaporean executive from US investigations company Mintz Group and the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-65061116">detention of five of its Chinese employees</a> ; the tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/huawei-s-meng-wanzhou-2-michaels-what-next-china-u-n1280229">detention of two Canadian businessmen</a> in retaliation for US fraud charges brought against a Huawei executive arrested in Canada — many companies operating internationally confront the reality of exit bans and commercial hostage-taking in relative obscurity.</p><p> This risk is increasing and unlikely to abate soon. Little in the ordinary course of business is more disruptive or volatile than the detention of company executives or employees abroad. Companies operating in China should prepare for these potential scenarios in advance.</p><p></p><p> Exit bans can arise from civil business disputes as well as more serious legal entanglements. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-chinese-law-raises-risks-for-american-firms-in-china-u-s-officials-say-cf62c1a0">Recent amendments to China&#39;s counterespionage law</a> , including vague, open-ended prohibitions on possessing “documents, data, materials, or items related to national security,” could easily encompass everyday business activities in any industry, exposing foreign executives to greater risk of arrest. The <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/china-travel-advisory.html">US Department of State recently warned</a> that the Chinese government “arbitrarily enforces local laws, including issuing exit bans on US citizens and citizens of other countries, without fair and transparent process under the law.”</p><p> Someone subject to an exit ban for business reasons often receives no advance notice before being prevented from boarding an international flight at the airport. The person is typically interrogated but not given information about the reason for the exit ban or how to contest it.</p><p> Exit bans in cases of business disputes are typically lifted only after the foreigner accedes to the demands of their Chinese counterparty — which gains enormous leverage in the dispute by limiting the individual&#39;s personal freedom. Even if the foreigner is willing to spend the necessary time and money to pursue the case in court while remaining trapped in China, a Chinese court is unlikely to rule in favor of the foreign party.</p><p></p><p> Consider Henry Cai, a native of China who moved to California with his wife in the 1980s and became a US citizen. In 2012, Cai invested in a Chinese technology startup for an 8% stake and served as a director of the company. A few years later, when the startup faced cash-flow problems and defaulted on a loan, Cai traveled to China multiple times to deal with the situation. Then, in 2017, Cai was stopped at the airport and denied exit from China, at which time he realized that he had been implicated in a lawsuit filed against the company by its creditors. Six years later, he remains <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-us-exit-ban-diplomacy-11668357015">stuck in China</a> , unable to pay the millions of dollars demanded to lift the exit ban. The human, emotional, and financial toll is high, for him in China and for his wife and their two children in California.</p><p></p><p> Another example is Brian Horowitz, a California businessman who purchased gas-powered blenders from a Chinese manufacturer. After a contract dispute arose because the blenders failed to meet California air-quality standards, Horowitz traveled to China to meet with the supplier. When he attempted to return home, he was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2011-jan-28-la-fi-china-horowitz-20110128-story.html">detained at the Shanghai airport</a> ; the supplier had filed a contract claim against his company, and the court had imposed an exit ban without Horowitz&#39;s knowledge. After two weeks, his wife wired $250,000 to the Chinese supplier to allow her husband to return home.</p><p> While exit bans in the case of business disputes are legal in China, foreign executives are also at risk of falling victim to illegal commercial hostage situations. In such cases, they might be confined in a hotel room or a company facility such as an office or factory. Holding commercial hostages is punishable by up to three years&#39; imprisonment. In practice, however, Chinese <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/08/chinas-police-think-hostages-arent-their-problem/">law enforcement often refuses to</a> intervene in these situations unless violence occurs.</p><p> In one case, a senior executive of a US jewelry company traveled to China to discuss a dispute with a manufacturer over a product order and a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3692138">$650,000 payment</a> . After the executive entered the manufacturer&#39;s facility, her purse and passport were confiscated. She was then taken back to her hotel and guarded by employees of the manufacturer for five days. She escaped with the help of a US lawyer fluent in Chinese who traveled to China, helped her evade the guards, and brought her to the embassy.</p><p> Another case occurred when a US company sent two midlevel executives to visit a Chinese factory that produced goods for it. The US company had already paid the manufacturer for the goods, but its executives learned that the factory workers were refusing to release the products because their wages had not been paid for months. The workers locked the executives inside the factory and demanded payment for their release. To free the hostages and obtain the goods, the US company had to pay both the manufacturing company and the workers.</p><p> Commercial hostage-taking situations are usually resolved within days or weeks, whereas exit bans might not be lifted for months or years. Neither situation is officially tracked, and businesspeople often keep their predicaments confidential. Nonetheless, based on data from the governments of six countries (the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, and Australia) and media reports, we documented more than <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/tie.22261">100 business exit bans and commercial hostage situations</a> in roughly the past十年。 This is likely a significant undercount, given that government documentation on this phenomenon is not comprehensive, and not every case would have received media attention.</p><h3> Take a Multifaceted Approach to Prepare for the Worst</h3><p> The acutely personal nature and the geopolitical dynamics of these situations make them particularly challenging to plan for and to resolve. How much should you pay to free your colleague (or yourself) from being held hostage? How do you talk to your employee&#39;s spouse about the reasons for their partner&#39;s detention and your plan to negotiate for their return? Is it part of your job to engage with the media to bring about political pressure to free an employee?</p><p> To prepare for such a scenario, it&#39;s critical that business leaders acknowledge the risk of this happening to their employees who travel to China, in addition to becoming more informed about it — such as by establishing a dialogue with others who have experienced it. They should also develop and maintain trusting relationships with US consular officials abroad, Chinese officials and police chiefs in the cities where the company operates, federal and state government leaders in the US, members of local and national media, and applicable industry groups, such as the US-China Business Council.</p><p> Companies should preassemble a crisis team and develop an action plan that assigns specific responsibilities to key employees and advisers in both China and their home country. This plan should include external communications, such as using social media to draw attention to the plight of trapped employees. And a company should consult with its business insurer to find out whether any relevant coverage is available to mitigate the financial impact of an exit ban or commercial hostage situation.</p><p> Executives with business interests in China should also pay close attention to accounts payable, contractual obligations, and the tone of business relationships to identify potential sources of conflict or disagreement. They should try to anticipate problems before they arise and should be especially vigilant about any outstanding debts or situations where a product has been delivered but, for any reason whatsoever, has not yet been completely paid for.</p><p></p><p> If a lawsuit has been or is suspected to have been initiated, or any debts are owed to a Chinese entity, companies should avoid having employees travel to China. If such travel is unavoidable, employees should remain in frequent communication so that others know their whereabouts and schedules, and they should avoid traveling alone. If a dispute has arisen but not yet materialized into a lawsuit, and employees must travel to China, consider suing preemptively in the US, assuming that a US court has jurisdiction over the Chinese business. For example, if the US company alleges a contract breach in a US court, then the employee should carry documentation of the US lawsuit, translated into Chinese, while abroad.</p><p></p><p> Leaders must also be prepared to support and help employees and their families. A crisis team set up in advance should have a plan for communicating honestly and sensitively with employees trapped abroad and with their families, as well as with employees throughout the company. Show that you care. Be transparent and truthful. These situations are emotionally draining, disorienting, and frightening; they are also opportunities to build trust, solidarity, and a culture of care. It is more about people than money.</p><p> Of course, it&#39;s important to remain committed to helping affected employees and their families in tangible ways. Arrange for the delivery of personalized care packages to affected families; visit their homes, and meet face-to-face with them. Where possible, also send care packages to employees trapped abroad and facilitate calls with family members.</p><p> Scenarios like exit bans and commercial hostage situations are human rights and geopolitical issues that are also intensely personal business challenges. Business leaders are wise to prepare for such challenges by developing a comprehensive strategic approach.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-rise-of-exit-bans-and-hostage-taking-in-china/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Are RAI Programs Prepared for Third-Party and Generative AI?</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/are-rai-programs-prepared-for-third-party-and-generative-ai/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/are-rai-programs-prepared-for-third-party-and-generative-ai/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 12:00:11 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[David Kiron and Steven Mills. ]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence]]></category><category><![CDATA[Infographic]]></category><category><![CDATA[Policy Making]]></category><category><![CDATA[Risk Mitigation]]></category><category><![CDATA[AI & Machine Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Data, AI, & Machine Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[IT Governance & Leadership]]></category><category><![CDATA[Managing Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Responsible AI]]></category><description><![CDATA[In 2023, MIT Sloan Management Review and BCG completed their second year of researching responsible AI (RAI).
