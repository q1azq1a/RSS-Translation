src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bhattacharya-1290x860-1.jpg" alt="" /><br /></figure><p>尽管许多公司谈论可持续发展，声称将环境和社会问题纳入其商业模式，但真正付诸实践的公司却少之又少：管理者通常将可持续发展视为其他人的问题，并将其归咎于某个部门甚至个人。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a>另一方面，那些成功将商业模式转变为更加可持续的公司已将可持续发展融入其企业 DNA。这意味着他们赋予员工可持续的主人翁意识，激励他们采取更多支持可持续发展的行为。当每位员工将环境和社会问题纳入每项业务决策时，可持续发展进程就会加速——这是所有公司的理想目标。</p><p>为了了解嵌入可持续发展的现状并找出关键瓶颈，匹兹堡大学可持续商业中心与哈里斯民意调查合作对美国员工进行了一项调查。我们想了解他们的雇主是否正在采取我们早期研究认为对促使员工从可持续发展角度开展业务非常重要的措施。我们的调查收集了代表美国员工群体的 1,056 名员工的反馈。我们将受访者的可持续发展定义为“将环境和社会问题纳入商业决策和行动中”。</p><p></p><p>我们要求受访者按照 4 点李克特量表（从“非常同意”到“非常不同意”）对一系列 19 个关于现状的陈述进行评分，例如“我的公司有一个明确的业务案例来提高我们的可持续发展绩效”。我们还向受访者提出了一系列可能对可持续发展进程构成挑战的 12 个问题，例如“可持续发展并未纳入我们的业务战略”，并要求他们评价这对他们的公司来说是一个实际挑战的程度（从“重大挑战”到“根本不是挑战”）。</p><p>大约三分之一的受访者声称，他们的雇主在可持续发展之旅中取得了重大进展。尽管考虑到我们面临的任务的艰巨性，这个数字可能听起来很低，但好消息是存在动力，我们可以通过指出员工认为的障碍来帮助加速这一势头。下面，我们根据我们的数据为寻求将可持续性融入组织文化和商业模式的管理者提供了六项关键建议。</p><p><strong>建立基于价值观的目标。</strong>目标是企业存在的理由——回答最重要的问题：“我们为什么要做我们所做的事情？”联合利华前首席执行官、企业可持续发展运动的领导者保罗·波尔曼 (Paul Polman) 表示：“可持续发展完全是由目标驱动的。” <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a>成功融入可持续发展的组织会阐明其旨在为利益相关者提供的社会效益，并且这一总体目标指导组织所做的一切。</p><p>在我们的研究中，36% 的受访者强烈同意“我的公司希望改变人们的生活，而不仅仅是盈利”，而 33% 的受访者强烈同意“我的公司除了利润最大化之外还有更高的目标”。如果目标是可持续发展的起点，那么我们做得并不好；显然，利润最大化的说法依然存在。 43% 的员工始终将短期关注、缺乏投资者兴趣以及更重要的是“我们的领导者不相信可持续发展”视为挑战。除非首席执行官和高层管理团队认识到利润是为所有利益相关者创造价值的<em>结果</em>，而不是战略制定和执行的起点，否则进步将受到抑制。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>将可持续发展纳入企业战略。</strong>学术研究人员和其他人指出，在可持续发展方面取得有意义进展的努力必须由企业战略驱动。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a>这样做会增加这样的可能性：随着时间的推移，“做绿色事情”将被视为员工工作的正常组成部分，并且越来越多的决策将通过可持续发展的视角做出。只有 29% 的受访者强烈同意“我的公司有一个明确的业务案例来提高我们的可持续发展绩效”，27% 的受访者同意“可持续发展是我的公司执行业务战略的核心”，看来我们还有很长的路要走。与现状一致，43% 的受访者认为，他们的公司未能将可持续发展纳入其业务战略是一个挑战。</p><p><strong>培训员工并激励促进可持续发展的行动。</strong>成功吸引员工的公司已经投资于培训，为员工提供有关如何提高可持续性的指导。只有 30% 的受访员工强烈同意“我了解如何通过我的角色提高公司的可持续发展绩效”这一说法，因此员工个人似乎缺乏特定于角色的知识。 44% 的受访者将缺乏培训视为主要/中等挑战，而类似数字 (45%) 则表示他们不知道应采取哪些行动来提高可持续发展绩效。公司需要在培训和可持续发展知识创造方面投入更多资金，以便员工知道他们在自己的角色中可以做<em>什么</em>以及<em>如何</em>做需要做的事情。</p><p>管理者还必须采取更多措施，为员工提供推动可持续发展议程的激励措施：49% 的受访者发现，缺乏此类激励措施是提高可持续发展绩效的主要或中等障碍。领导者还应该考虑管理文化是否通过给予员工解决可持续发展挑战的自主权来鼓励参与和内在动力，这通常需要创造性思维。然而，当我们要求调查受访者评价他们对“我的公司允许我自己做出很多与可持续发展相关的决定”和“我的公司让我有机会利用我的个人主动性或判断力来实施可持续发展举措”这句话的同意程度时，我们发现最多有 29% 的受访者强烈同意。</p><p><strong>在您的组织中创建可持续发展文化。</strong>管理者可以通过沟通进展、庆祝里程碑、认可成就以及在内部和与行业合作伙伴合作解决方案来保持可持续发展在组织文化中的突出地位。我们的研究发现，缺乏可持续发展文化是取得进步的最大障碍之一，48% 的受访者表示，这是其组织的主要或中度障碍。向员工传达可持续发展进展是可持续发展文化的关键组成部分，因为它将问题放在首位。庆祝成功将激发员工的兴趣，并使可持续发展对组织的重要性合法化——但只有 31% 的受访者强烈同意他们的公司庆祝可持续发展的成功。</p><p></p><p>与传统竞争对手的合作——对于解决这些复杂的“ <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/tragedy-of-the-commons-impact-on-sustainability-issues">公地悲剧</a>”问题越来越有必要——向员工发出信号，表明公司认真对待转型变革，并强化了员工文化。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a>只有 25% 的受访者强烈同意“我的公司与其他组织合作解决复杂的可持续发展问题”这一说法，显然，要让企业领导者认识到通过合作取得进步的潜力，还需要做大量工作。</p><p><strong>通过可持续发展的视角开展业务。</strong>想象一下，如果每家公司的每一位员工（从邮件收发室到董事会会议室）都将环境和社会问题纳入他们所做的每一项业务决策中，我们将会取得怎样的进步。我们认为，这是通过可持续发展的视角开展业务——如果我们要克服生存危机，这是一个令人向往但又必要的目标。正如之前的研究表明，员工对可持续发展的个人所有权是参与可持续发展行为的关键驱动力。在我们的调查中，28% 的受访者强烈同意“我公司的员工有责任提高可持续发展绩效”这一说法，而 45% 的受访者认为员工中认为“可持续发展是别人的责任”的信念是一项挑战。我们的调查结果反映了个人对可持续发展绩效缺乏主人翁意识：只有 27% 的受访者强烈同意他们“投入创意和创造力”来帮助公司实现可持续发展，只有 24% 的受访者强烈同意他们做出的每项业务决策都是从可持续发展的角度来看待的。</p><p></p><p><strong>打通最后一公里。</strong>我们注意到企业员工和一线员工对我们问题的回答存在显着差异。与担任客户支持等职务的一线非管理人员相比，担任企业职务的管理人员将可持续发展视为根深蒂固的可能性平均高出约 15%。</p><p>为了确保他们对可持续发展的承诺是真实的，并为组织带来切实的利益，领导者必须解决公司和一线员工之间的最后一英里差距。在这种情况下，广泛传达有关企业宗旨以及环境、社会和治理目标的信息可能还不够；确实需要通过可纳入整个组织员工执行的日常任务和例行公事的实际举措和行动来推动可持续发展。</p><p></p><p>有趣的是，将可持续发展视为组织中更深入的一部分，也能让员工看到阻碍进步的障碍和挑战。我们的数据显示，相比那些敬业度较低的员工，敬业度较高且认为可持续发展更加深入的员工平均也会感知到更多的障碍。</p><p>这里的含义是，当公司弥合嵌入可持续发展的最后一英里差距时，随着员工对这个问题的参与度增加，他们应该准备好回答更多问题并听取更多意见。公司应该使用一对一的辅导、行动手册和量身定制的沟通方式，让可持续发展成为每个人的工作。公司需要做好准备，投入更多资源来融入可持续发展，并让整个组织从可持续发展的角度开展业务。</p><p></p>

The past decade has seen dramatic growth in robot adoption across an increasing number of industries, and it shows no signs of slowing. In a recent McKinsey survey of companies worldwide, 88% of respondents said they plan to invest in robotics for their business. Our research [&#8230;]]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><figure class="article-inline"><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Wu-Robots-1290x860-1.jpg" alt="" /><br /></figure><p>我们正处于机器人革命之中。过去十年，越来越多的行业采用机器人的速度急剧增长，而且没有任何放缓的迹象。麦肯锡最近对全球公司进行的一项调查显示，88% 的受访者表示他们计划为其业务<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/advanced%20electronics/our%20insights/growth%20dynamics%20in%20industrial%20robotics/industrial-robotics-insights-into-the-sectors-future-growth-dynamics.ashx">投资机器人技术</a>。我们的研究发现，一个同样甚至更重要的转变正在发生：机器人的采用正在提高公司认可和奖励员工良好表现的能力。</p><p>在每个组织中，领导者都面临一个基本问题：我们如何让员工发挥最大作用？最常见的方法之一是提供与绩效挂钩的金钱奖励（通常是定期奖金）。这种做法的基础是更好的表现应该得到更高的奖励。但这种方法在实践中实施起来并不简单，因为它要求对绩效进行足够好的衡量才能进行有效评估。对于大多数角色来说，实现这一点都具有挑战性，对于个别员工来说更是如此。由于大量工作是在团队中完成的，而管理者无法监控每个员工的具体活动或准确衡量个人绩效，因此许多组织选择根据团队或公司绩效而不是个人绩效来支付奖金。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p></p><p></p><h3>当同事是机器人时衡量人类表现</h3><p>这一切与机器人有什么关系？在我们的研究中，我们发现采用机器人的公司提高了衡量人类绩效的能力。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a>为了说明这一点，假设您在一个两人团队中工作。您的经理可以查看和评估您作为一个团队的综合生产力，但无法查看和评估每个人在任何时候都在做什么。理论上，你们应该平等地做出贡献；实际上，您正在做更多的工作，而您忙碌的经理看不到这些工作。</p><p>那么，假设你的队友被机器人取代了。作为一台机器，机器人在执行工作任务时更加精确和一致，甚至可以在操作时提供有关其性能的数据。因为它是如此一致和透明，所以生产力的任何中断或峰值都可以更清楚地识别出是来自机器人还是来自您。如果您的组织中还有其他人以类似的方式使用相同类型的机器人，那么就更容易看出他们的个人生产力与您的有何不同。</p><p>换句话说，由于机器人本质上比人类更加一致和透明，因此如果机器人加入团队，人类活动就会变得更容易观察。相对于人类而言，机器人越多，就越容易区分和衡量人类个体的表现。</p><p></p><p>在一个真实的例子中，美国一家大型电子公司的维修设施在使用机器人来协助工人进行维修过程后，观察员工生产力的能力得到了显着提高。由于机器人与人类不同，在执行重复性任务时不会感到身体疲劳，因此它们能够更加一致地执行任务。这减少了生产过程中的差异，并使管理人员能够更清楚地观察员工的个人行为。许多员工遵循早上比下午更有效率的常规模式，但下午的效率却存在很大差异。结果，许多工人为了完成每日配额而不得不在当天晚些时候完成更多的维修工作。这种“临时抱佛脚”的工作尤其成问题，因为它通常会因工人们的仓促而导致更多错误。</p><p>将机器人集成到维修过程中可以通过两种方式简化对单个员工生产力的跟踪。首先，机器人会犯与人类不同类型的错误。机器人的错误是一致的，这使得人为错误更容易区分。其次，机器人本身提供了有关其自身表现的精确数据，这使得更容易隔离由人类行为引起的积极和消极的表现结果。这种数据生成功能使管理人员能够更好地监控整体生产力，并更容易地发现生产过程中的弱点。例如，在机器人被纳入生产流程之前，维修厂的经理们并没有意识到下午临时抱佛脚的行为有多严重。一旦问题被明确识别，他们就能够重新组织工作流程以减少错误；此后，该设施的总体错误率有所改善。</p><p></p><p>这些类型的绩效衡量改进与基于绩效的激励相结合，可以对生产力产生特别显着的影响。如果更容易观察和衡量组织内单个员工的绩效，那么表现良好的人（由于衡量挑战而可能获得很少的奖励或认可）就会变得更容易识别和奖励，领导者确实可以在从团队中获得最佳表现方面做得更好。这正是我们在研究中发现的：采用机器人的公司也更有可能采用与个人绩效而不是团队或组织绩效直接挂钩的奖金激励措施。更好的衡量可以为组织中的优秀员工带来更多奖励，并提高工作场所的生产力。对于在组织中工作的人员来说，使用机器人更加公平。</p><p></p><p>机器人正在改变工作的性质。除了消除一些工作岗位和创造新的工作岗位之外，机器人还正在改变组织充分发挥员工潜力的能力，以及我们体验工作本身的方式。机器人为企业提供了一个令人兴奋的机会，可以重新设计与之合作的人类的角色和责任，使这些公司相对于竞争对手具有竞争优势，不是因为先进的技术，而是因为更好的流程。机器人革命不会消除对人类的需求。相反，它为识别、奖励和管理人才带来了新的挑战和机遇。</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-robots-can-enhance-performance-management-for- humans/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>用人工智能检测好与坏：Airbnb 的 Naba Banerjee</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/detecting-the-good-and-the-bad-with-ai-airbnbs-naba-banerjee/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/detecting-the-good-and-the-bad-with-ai-airbnbs-naba-banerjee/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 18 Jul 2023 11:00:04 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. <p>Sam Ransbotham ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ransbotham">@ransbotham</a> ) 是波士顿学院卡罗尔管理学院信息系统系教授，也是<cite>《麻省理工学院斯隆管理评论</cite>》人工智能和商业战略大创意计划的客座编辑。 Shervin Khodabandeh 是 BCG 的高级合伙人兼董事总经理，也是北美 BCG GAMMA（BCG 人工智能业务）的联合领导者。您可以通过<a href="mailto:shervin@bcg.com">shervin@bcg.com</a>联系他。</p><p class="mt20"> <cite>《我、我自己和人工智能》</cite>是<cite>麻省理工学院斯隆管理评论</cite>和波士顿咨询集团合作推出的播客，由 Sam Ransbotham 和 Shervin Khodabandeh 主持。我们的工程师是 David Lishansky，协调制作人是 Allison Ryder 和 Sophie Rüdinger。</p> ]]>; </dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Ethics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Information Sharing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Operational Innovation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Predictive Analytics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Psychological Safety]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crisis Management]]></category><category><![CDATA[Data, AI, & Machine Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Managing Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Security & Privacy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy]]></category><description><![CDATA[Naba Banerjee’s identity as a “forever learner” led to her become the first female engineer in her family.

Khodabandeh：</strong>我是 Shervin Khodabandeh，BCG 的高级合伙人，也是我们人工智能业务的领导者之一。自 2017 年以来， <cite>MIT SMR</cite>和 BCG 一直在人工智能方面进行研究和出版，采访了数百名从业者，并对数千家公司进行了调查，了解如何构建、部署和扩展人工智能能力，并真正改变组织的运营方式。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>今天，Shervin 和我正在与 Airbnb 信托产品和运营总监 Naba Banerjee 进行交谈。纳巴，感谢您加入我们。</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>谢谢；很高兴来到这里。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>我认为大多数人都知道 Airbnb，但也许可以告诉我们该公司的简要概述以及您的业务。</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong> Airbnb 代表着一个促进联系和归属感的地方。数以百万计的主人向完全陌生的人开放他们的家，你我和我们的家人可以去一个充满异国情调的目的地旅行，而不是住在酒店，你实际上可以真正沉浸在当地文化中。有时，如果您真的很幸运，您可以住在房东的家里，真正体验到房东的本来面目，从而建立和促进联系和归属感。</p><p>在这个日益变得孤立、联系变得越来越稀有的世界里，我很高兴能成为一家致力于创造更多联系的公司的一员。我的团队（爱彼迎的信任与安全团队）的工作贯穿于整个客户旅程，从您在爱彼迎创建帐户的整个旅程开始。有时，可能会出现问题：可能会创建虚假帐户，或者您的帐户可能会被接管。您想要入住的房源可能是假房源；您正在查看的评论可能并不完全真实。但我们的工作是确保您可以专注于您的神奇住宿，房东可以专注于成为完美的房东，我们会尽力预测其中一些风险，并将发生此类问题的风险降至最低。我的团队所做的就是利用技术和数据来实现神奇的用户旅程。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>我想我们都听到过出现问题的头条新闻。在您进行的无数交易过程中出了多少问题？</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>这是一个很好的问题。 2021 年，爱彼迎上发生了大约 7000 万次旅行，其中不到 0.1% 的旅行导致房东或房客报告该次住宿期间可能发生的问题。当我们的团队深入调查并实际查看真正的伤害发生在哪里或必须将某人从平台上删除时，这个数字甚至更小。</p><p>我知道即使是一件糟糕的事件也可能太糟糕了，不应该发生，但在更大范围的事情中，你回过头来意识到大多数人实际上都是好人。百分之九十九点九的人只想处理日常事务、享受愉快的住宿或成为出色的主人。但有时，在极少数情况下，当坏事发生时，我们希望确保降低这种风险。</p><p>如果你仔细观察一个人在哪里对另一个人造成了伤害，你会发现这些事件只是一小部分。但当我们谈论安全时，我们关注的是[诸如]一氧化碳气体泄漏。可能会滑倒；这可能是财产损失，玻璃破裂，地毯上可能有污渍。我们也在研究此类问题。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我从你的话中听到的是，你的角色是，第一，一个好角色。你是善良的保护者和邪恶的“守护者”，对吧？</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>我喜欢这个。您应该成为我们品牌团队的一员。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>这是一件好事，对吧？这是一个非常有目的的角色。第二部分是，你谈论的是微观上的小事件。</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>是的，大海捞针。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·霍达班德：</strong>对吗？这些都是有趣的问题。告诉我们更多关于幕后的信息——会发生什么？</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong>我想说它分为三个部分。一是，我们从“为什么”开始，也就是说——你说得很好——我们是善的保护者，并试图抵御坏的。我们永远不能说我们阻止了一切不好的事情。就像山姆所说的那样，你不能那样做。但我们如何学习并变得更好呢？这就是人工智能和机器学习[机器学习]的用武之地，[我们问]“我们如何利用数据和技术的力量来学习并变得更好？”每年，风险都不会保持不变；数据不断增长。</p><p>第二件事是，“我们如何负责任地使用技术？”也就是说，您可能会过于直率，并尝试尽可能多地阻止，专门关注欺诈和安全事件并将其压低，但是，如果您用来做出这些决策的数据存在偏见，可能会造成不公平，那么您可能会向许多真正只是想拥有良好住宿体验的好人关上大门。所以[它是关于]负责任地使用技术。 ......它有自治机制，也就是说，我们有我们的隐私团队，我们的数据隐私团队，我们的信息安全团队，我们的反歧视团队，它们......几乎就像信任团队的镜子。 [还有] Airbnb 的其他团队，每次我们真正专注于这个特定的欺诈媒介、机器人检测、帐户接管检测或当事人检测时，他们都会不断确保我们以安全和透明的方式使用数据，为用户提供控制权，而不是引入偏见。</p><p>最后，我们有办法为人们提供一条回头路，也就是说，我们将根据我们可用的数据、可用的技术以及该技术的成熟度，做出最好的决定。但如果我们错了，我们是否可以创建透明度和一个流程，让用户在我们阻止或删除他们时提出申诉并重新回到平台，以便我们能够再次学习并变得更好？因此，在最高层面上，这就是我的团队在幕后工作的方式。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>有哪些用例？</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong>我们已经讨论过很多次的用例之一是，你知道......我将给你讲一个小故事，那就是，当我在 2020 年加入信托团队时，世界刚刚关闭；疫情肆虐。与世界等待疫苗的方式非常相似，在等待疫苗的过程中，我们进入了封锁模式。</p><p>这是一个生硬的工具……防止人们将自己暴露在不安全的情况下。同样，Airbnb 不幸成为适合未经授权的家庭聚会的产品市场。不幸的是，当酒店和酒吧关闭时，只有不到 1% 或 0.1% 的用户在寻找可以举办派对的地方，开始出租 Airbnb。结果，我们意识到这给使用这个基于信任基础的平台的房东和房客社区带来了很多痛苦。所以最初，我们不得不使用一些非常生硬的工具。</p><p>我们首先制定了全球派对禁令，称爱彼迎不允许举办任何类型的派对。其次，我们开始研究一些模式，发现 25 岁以下的人会在离家不到 50 英里左右的地方预订整个房屋一晚或两晚 - 这些似乎都是导致聚会的信号。当聚会发生时，我们通常会发现……该帐户是昨天创建的。然后我们实施了一项名为“25 岁以下”的生硬规则，并将其落实到位。现在，我们必须小心，因为这些规则并不完全适用于全球。但这在北美奏效了，我们立即发现未经授权的团体数量有所减少。</p><p>但随着时间的推移，就像规则一样，我们看到人们开始玩弄这些规则。他们会找一位年长的朋友为他们预订房间。他们不会预订一晚，而是预订三晚，依此类推。 [并且]对优秀用户的影响是如此之大，以至于我们说：“我们需要转向机器学习。我们需要变得更聪明。”因此，我们在澳大利亚进行了第一次试点，在那里我们对地方进行了细分，并比较了拥有我们建立的新派对模式的地方与其他地方。我们看到减少了吗？再说一次，这就像大海捞针一样，但我们仍然发现该地区采用派对模式的派对比不使用派对模式的派对少了 35%。当我们开始在北美进行实验时，我们确实发现它与启发式方法一样有效，但对优秀用户的影响较小。</p><p>这给了我们继续前进的信心，因为什么都不做不是一种选择。我们必须做点什么，而且必须聪明地去做。这是我们可以出去讨论的用例之一——并不是说我们正在阻止所有各方，但至少 Airbnb 对此采取了强硬立场。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>在您描述问题和解决方案时，我听到的一个共同点是需要不断适应和持续学习，并使用正确的工具来完成正确的工作。有时这是一个规则，然后可能是无监督学习，然后是人工干预。这听起来确实是一个跨学科的问题，包括规则改变的部分，或者欺诈者操作方式改变的部分，你还会有“是不是太生硬了？”的问题。它是否限制了一些无意识但良好或良性的行为？”在这些情况下，人机协作或交互如何进行？</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong> Shervin，你总结得非常好，也就是说，这不是一件一劳永逸的事情。你构建它，然后你必须不断地学习和优化，甚至是你正在做出的决策，以及你周围的世界如何演变。这是人类真正擅长的一个领域，也就是说，你必须遵守纪律，用最新的数据、正确的数据来训练你的模型，并就最佳阈值做出权衡决策，达到这个阈值你就会说：“好吧，这是有风险的，我们已经准备好利用这个风险了。”</p><p>在 Airbnb，我们一直致力于如何在循环中利用人类。除了产品和规划团队之外，我还有一个信托运营团队。该运营团队由全职员工以及全球代理组成。每当我们构建一个新模型时，一开始我们经常让模型做出基于风险阈值的决策：“这是前 1%。这是下一部分。这是下一部分。”有时，我们会将其发送给人类，然后在此基础上创建标签，表示“我同意模型的决定”或“我不同意模型的决定”，然后将其作为训练数据返回给模型。</p><p>然后，当我们对模型的决策能力更有信心时，我们就会转向自动决策。这个派对模式，就你的观点而言，现在完全是自动决定的。但最终发生的情况是，当我们收到用户的申诉，说“我被错误地阻止了”，那么该申诉就会作为客户告诉我们的数据。然后一名特工查看了该上诉并说：“实际上，这个决定是错误的。”如果代理做出了正确的决定，该客户提出了正确的上诉，并且没有发生任何事件，我们就知道这是误报。</p><p>但假设代理商批准了，然后该客户继续举办派对；那是假阴性。我们不断从中学习，但我们是迭代地进行的。首先，我们尝试将模型直接应用于人类。再说一遍，不能保证人类比模型更擅长决策，但我们会不断衡量其表现。然后我们会转向[更少]人类决策的高阶决策。有时我们也会……假设政党模式做出决定。人们继续他们的快乐方式，有保留。有时，在预订完成后，我们仍然会让人查看风险最高的 1% 预订，以尝试并纠正任何可能的情况。</p><p>因此，它要么试图平衡这一点，即人类什么时候是做出决定的合适人选？机器什么时候应该做出决定？我们经历了一段并不轻松、非线性的旅程。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>您一开始提到您可能会审查更多案例，然后从这些案例中学习。但与此同时，人们……这 7000 万笔交易正在不断发生。例如，当您举例说明酒店在大流行开始时关闭时，这就是个别房东和顾客发生这种情况的时候。您如何平衡需要快速到位和需要完成流程之间的权衡？</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>这可能是最困难的事情，也是我整个职业生涯中处理过的最困难的事情。在此之前，我负责管理 Samsclub.com（沃尔玛的一部分）的所有产品，当时我认为我的工作很辛苦。当我们为客户提供服务、帮助他们结账时，我们仍然感觉自己处于增长的道路上，我们可以选择增长的速度或增长的速度。我总是有团队关注那些试图检查但无法检查的人，并在我们构建长期架构时为他们提供服务，但人们的生命并没有受到威胁; [这是]人们的钱——诈骗者利用偷来的信用卡骗取了公司数百万美元。</p><p>爱彼迎有一个团队正在努力保护好人，避免坏事。我们所做的是，你必须真正擅长确定优先级，这在信任和安全的世界中也很难做到。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·科达班德：</strong>我的意思是，从很多方面来说，选择就是萨姆，你一开始就说过：这些经济体并非没有风险。它们不可能没有风险。总体而言，好处多于坏处，因此一切都取决于优先顺序。但我不得不说，我们已经与许多在其他组织中扮演类似角色的人进行了交谈——你提到了山姆会员店等——他们正在使用技术、数字人工智能/机器学习来驱动各种用例。我认为你的突出之处在于它是一个持续的平衡行为，而且风险很高。然后你就会有这样的目标和谦虚地说：“好吧，我们相信我们会犯错误，而且这个系统不可能没有错误。”</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>是的。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>但随着时间的推移，情况正在变得更好。这引出了我的下一个问题：你如何衡量你的有效性？是指事件的数量、不良事件发生的严重程度和频率吗？</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong>我很高兴你问这个问题，因为我很自然地会朝着这个方向发展，也就是说，在最高层面上，我们衡量自己的指标是每百万次旅行中的欺诈事件数量、每百万次旅行中的安全事件数量以及良好的用户影响。这是衡量“我们屏蔽了多少优质列表？”的平衡指标。我们阻止了多少好主人和好客人继续前进，无法真正理解我们的误报和漏报？”但归根结底，我们全面考虑的是美好的旅行。</p><p>我们还从可能发生的欺诈损失的角度来考虑美元。我们正在查看收到的客户支持票证、因遇到我们团队提出的摩擦而产生的用户 NPS [净推荐值]。因此，在基本层面上，我们正在研究这些指标。但在我的职业生涯中，我第一次遇到的挑战之一是——在欺诈领域，我们可以进行 A/B 测试——我们不断迭代我们的模型。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>当你这样做时，你也可能会阻止相当良性的行为和意图。但正如你所说，在某种程度上，人类的判断需要压倒一切，并说这对一个人来说风险可能太高了。是的，我的意思是，当谈到机器学习时，我们总是谈论探索和利用，以及持续的反馈循环，但是学习总是有成本的，对吧？但是当我向你发送营销信息时你可能不喜欢，学习成本非常小，所以我会给你发送很多这样的信息，并且我会做各种A/B/X测试。但是，当我对风险较高的群体或人群进行这种 A/B 测试时，您可能会做出不这样做并依赖回顾性数据的人类判断。</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>是的。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我认为您为我们很好地阐明了这一点。</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>是的。我们问自己的一个问题是，是什么让一个人信任另一个人？是什么让人们信任 Airbnb？我们意识到，我们可以在后台[训练]各种模型，而你甚至不知道自己是否处于 1% 还是 2% 的风险阈值内，或者是否被标记为良好用户。</p><p>但爱彼迎和您作为房客、您作为房东、或者房东和房客之间也需要进行对话，才能真正建立信任。就像当我们问某人“如果你 17 岁的女孩想在上大学之前背包旅行时，你愿意把她送到希腊的一个陌生人家里吗？”您可能会说这是个人经历。我有一个17岁的孩子，即将上大学。我意识到，第一个想法是“不——不会发生”，我在 Airbnb 负责信任和安全。但后来我想，“好吧，如果我能和主持人谈谈就好了；”如果她要和别人住在一起；如果那个人是像我这样的妈妈……”</p><p><strong>谢尔文·科达班德：</strong>是的。</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong>作为 Airbnb，我们可以说，“我们在后台运行所有这些模型；别担心，你的女儿很安全”——我认为这不会成功。我认为作为父母，您会希望获得需要查看的信息，即使您的判断可能并不比机器更好。所以我们也在努力，我们需要说什么，我们需要做什么？有时，当我们说“Airbnb 不会允许在同一社区内最后一刻预订的一晚住宿”时，我认为这也会让很多家长感觉更好，好吧，至少这个选项消失了。他们可能会想出其他办法。这个信息不能令人费解。该消息必须很简单。必须清楚地理解该信息。除了询问人们不应该做什么之外，我们还需要鼓励人们应该做哪些良好行为，例如与主人交谈、与客人交谈、提出问题。</p><p>我们推出了一项针对单身女性旅行者的计划，因为我们开始发现单身女性旅行者在私人房间内发生的人身安全事故的发生率可能略高。我们开始鼓励[女性]弄清楚，你的房间里会有锁吗？那把锁还能用吗？您可以独自使用浴室吗？哪些空间是共享的？哪些不是？所以这不是一个阻止任何事情的模型。这只是我们以多种语言发布的一个教育模块，这对我们的独行旅行者来说非常有帮助。我团队的部分工作不仅是建立隐形防御，而且还通过教育和信息传递预先建立信任和信任感。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>说得很好。我不得不说，你提到你是五个孩子的母亲。我不得不说，我认为在告诉你的孩子他们能做什么和不能做什么时，你的立场非常坚实，因为你有这么多的数据和丰富的经验，而当我说一些话时，他们会说，“好吧，你怎么知道？”你可以说：“好吧，相信我；我每年进行 7000 万笔交易，我知道发生了什么。”</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>并且不断成长。是的。顺便说一句，我很高兴与您的孩子交谈。任何时候。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>是的，那就太好了。我会带你去解决这个问题。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>关于你的测量，我认为很有趣的一件事，也许回过头来谈一下。您也提到了一些积极的指标。所以我认为这有点诱人，我认为即使在这次谈话中我们也已经这样做了，我们是在向负面方向滴定。这就是新闻的普遍问题——坏消息可以提高报纸销量。嗯，我认为在这次谈话的过程中，我们已经转向了这一点。但我认为你提到的一些指标对他们来说有更积极的影响，不是吗？</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>是的，绝对如此。这是我们过去几年的顿悟，因为任何类型的机器学习模型在有大量数据可供学习时通常都会表现良好。在此类案例中，在超过 7000 万次出行中，只有 0.1% 的行程甚至会产生报告，而其中的一小部分会导致有人被驱逐的实际事件，因此几乎没有什么可以借鉴的，因此，这些模型需要时间才能成熟。当然，随着技术的发展，情况会变得更好，但我们意识到我们拥有更多关于良好用户行为的数据。</p><p>我们有更多的用户实际进来，提前几个月预订住宿；他们可能会准时入住，让房源比他们发现时更好，与房东和房客沟通，留下诚实的评价。因此，如果我们能够真正扭转这一局面，虽然我们需要继续寻找异常情况、趋势和不良行为者，但如果我们能够真正擅长了解什么是良好行为，同时确保我们也在收集和使用这些数据的方式上衡量潜在的偏见或歧视以及隐私合规性，那么当某些事情看起来确实有风险时，这对于告知信息可能会非常有效。例如，如果一个帐户通常是从美国访问的，[并且]突然我们看到该 IP 现在正在从菲律宾访问，感觉就像“哦，这是一个帐户接管”。但如果这是一个经常环游世界的好用户，也许这不是帐户接管，并且良好的用户行为中有历史记录，可以让我们更聪明地了解“正常情况是什么样子，异常情况是什么样子？”不是广泛的，而是非常具体的，基于用户细分。</p><p>所以这不是新东西，但我认为我们有时倾向于真正了解不良行为是什么样子并善于检测它，而不是补充异常行为与正常行为的样子。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·霍达班德：</strong>是的。您在一个真正不断发展的领域拥有如此丰富的见解和信息。我的意思是，这不像典型的协同过滤情况，“像你这样的用户也买了这个”。我的意思是，在匹配方面还有很多事情要做。这一定是一个非常有趣且值得您关注的问题。</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>是的。它要求我们摆脱信任和安全的束缚，与我们的搜索、相关性和个性化团队密切合作，因为我们的工作——与我以前在电子商务工作时的工作不同——不仅仅是进行协同过滤并说，“像你这样的人买了这个，所以你应该买这个，”或者，“你去了巴黎，所以也许接下来你想去罗马。”</p><p>这是关于……这次你和家人一起旅行。你有小孩；您可能需要日托服务，我们知道该房东提供日托服务，并且这个位置可能非常适合您。或者同一个客户可能独自旅行，也许我们需要提供不同的建议。将这些信任和安全信号嵌入到我们的搜索相关性算法中，可以非常有效地将正确的人与正确的列表相匹配。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong> Naba，你并不是从 Airbnb 开始的。告诉我们一些你是如何到达那里的。您提到了沃尔玛和那里的一些背景，但您是如何最终担任目前的职位的？</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong>我是家里第一位女工程师。我父亲抓住了我的机会，对我说：“你很好奇。你是一个永远的学习者。你想做工程吗？”当时我不知道什么是工程学，但我还是报名了，并成为我家里第一位女工程师。</p><p>我曾在塔塔咨询服务公司工作，然后加入 Cognizant，通过 Cognizant 来到美国，并在 AAA 工作了一段时间。我会继续从事不同的项目和不同的工作，这将帮助我学习全新的东西。</p><p>沃尔玛发生在2006年左右。我被要求在沃尔玛从事供应链方面的工作，如果你想在一家公司学习供应链，那可能就是你应该去的公司。当我从事供应链工作时，每年我都不断承担越来越大的责任和项目，直到我发现自己从沃尔玛领导几乎所有的供应链团队到山姆会员店，这是沃尔玛的一部分——领导所有的产品、前端、购物车、结账、营销和定价，这是我以前从未做过的。但这让我有机会获得全面的经验，了解大型零售商的后端如何运作，以及前端客户体验如何运作。</p><p>山姆会员店结束后，我被要求领导搜索工作。就在那时，我开始对机器学习和人工智能运行的世界真正感兴趣，而搜索对我来说是一个很好的着陆点。有趣的是，我在麻省理工学院修了一门课程，学习人工智能和机器学习的应用，这给了我承担搜索工作的勇气。</p><p>从那时起，差不多 13 年后，Airbnb 在沃尔玛诞生了。我对旅游业和这个市场非常好奇，它与我在沃尔玛所做的任何事情都非常不同。所以这里的主题是，我总是倾向于一些能够帮助我利用我所拥有的技能的东西，然后利用我的好奇心和学习去做一些全新的事情，并在我前进的过程中增强自己。这就是我的背景。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong> Naba，我们现在有一个部分，我们会问您一系列快速问题，然后告诉我们您想到的第一件事。您最自豪的 AI/ML 时刻是什么？</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong>你要求我在不同的球队之间进行选择，这对我的职业生涯来说是限制。但我要说的是，我们在政党检测和政党风险降低方面所做的工作是开创性的，业内没有其他人像我们一样做到这一点，所以这对我来说是一个非常自豪的时刻。但我为我所有的团队感到自豪，郑重声明。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>这是一个很好的答案。您对人工智能有何担忧？</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong>令我担心的是它的威力有多大。当 [OpenAI 首席执行官] Sam Altman 来到 Airbnb 时，我们有机会近距离亲眼见到他。这项技术的进步速度有多快，其能力有多大……我担心它会落入坏人之手。我担心，虽然我的团队拥有这项技术，但欺诈者也拥有这项技术，所以我担心，如果今天我们担心假身份证和假垃圾邮件被发送给我们的主人和客人，那么这项技术将会变得多么先进，以及我们辨别好坏的难度将会有多大。我认为人工智能也将在检测假人工智能方面发挥作用。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>您最喜欢的不涉及技术的活动？</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong>水彩画。我喜欢画自然。因此，纸张、水彩画，以及平静与安宁，没有科技，是我最喜欢做的事情。当然，拥抱我的孩子们，花时间和他们在一起，聆听他们的一天，努力让他们在跟我说话时不要玩手机。那两个。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>说得很好。你想要的第一个职业：你长大后想做什么？</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>我想成为一名老师。我来自一个教师家庭，当我看到某人的眼睛因知识的恩赐而发光时，我感到非常高兴。我是一个永远的学习者。我所从事的每一份工作都与我之前的工作完全不同；这是因为我喜欢学习。所以，是的，这就是我想成为的人。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>无论如何，您可能在当前的职位上进行了大量的教学工作。</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong>我做了很多指导工作。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>您教会了我们很多东西。</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>谢谢，谢谢。我确实做了很多指导，因为我觉得如果其他人可以看到我做我所做的事情，这会让他们觉得他们也能做到。所以如果我能做到这一点，那就是我一生的使命完成了。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>未来您对人工智能最大的愿望是什么？</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong>实际上，我对世界最大的愿望就是不要那么害怕；给它一个机会。因为我认为有时我们对坏事的恐惧会阻碍我们拥抱美好。有太多浪费的精力投入到本应通过人工智能自动化的活动中——如此多的患者没有得到治疗；如此多的公司可能需要帮助并需要大量资金来支持人工智能可以完成的基本事情；可能有很多不发达的国家[但可以]获得如此多的优势。我知道，当它落入坏人之手时，它可能会被用来做坏事，但世界上好人多于坏人，我相信我们利用人工智能行善的力量——利用我们的集体善良。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>我想每个人都可能会认同你的观点，即世界好于坏。我们确实倾向于听到大多数负面故事，但令人耳目一新的是，一是您付出了多少努力来尝试和防止这些故事，同时也听到了您的平台带来的好故事。感谢您今天抽出时间与我们交谈。我们很享受。</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>谢谢你，山姆。谢谢你，谢尔文。我的荣幸。</p><p><strong>萨姆·兰斯博瑟姆：</strong>感谢您的聆听。下次我们将邀请主创产品

The ubiquitous corporate practice of repurchasing shares has been the focus of much political and media scrutiny. The federal Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 included a 1% excise tax on repurchases (which President Biden has proposed increasing to 4% in his 2024 [&#8230;]]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><figure class="article-inline"><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023SUM-Kothari-1290x860-1.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption><p class="attribution">卡罗·詹巴雷西/theispot.com</p></figcaption></figure><p>股票回购真的像人们想象的那么糟糕吗？普遍存在的企业回购股票做法一直是许多政治和媒体关注的焦点。 2022 年联邦通胀削减法案包括对回购征收 1% 的消费税（拜登总统提议在 2024 年预算中将其提高至 4%）。此外，民主党高层表示有兴趣禁止高管在回购后三年内出售股票，联邦政府建议放弃回购的公司将获得优惠待遇，证券交易委员会建议大幅增加回购报告的范围和频率。</p><p>迄今为止，关于股票回购的经济后果的争论往往集中在小样本或精心挑选的例子上。鉴于每年有数千家公司回购其股票，并且过去五年每年回购总额超过 5000 亿美元，我们认为有必要对回购行为进行大样本研究。我们的研究发表在<cite>《财务管理》</cite>杂志上，概述了这种做法的好处，正如其支持者所说，并提供了证据，对其批评者所称的成本提出质疑。</p><p></p><p>回购批评者通常会提出三个反对这种做法的论点。首先，他们声称股票回购使公司能够通过增加对股票的需求（从而提高股票价格）或通过夸大每股收益（EPS）来欺骗天真的投资者来操纵市场。其次，他们声称股票回购使内部人员能够通过补偿合同或以高价出售股票而受益。最后，批评者指责股票回购挤出了投资，从而牺牲了创新和长期经济增长。</p><p>与此同时，那些支持或参与股票回购的人为这种做法提供了一些理由。首先，向股东支付的股息通过减少自由现金流的潜在滥用来协调经理和股东的激励。其次，使用回购代替股息或在股息之外使用回购可以使公司在返还给股东的现金金额方面具有灵活性，能够将回购的股票作为股权补偿奖励给员工，为股东提供适度的税收优惠（自2003年股息税削减以来不太明显），并且能够向市场表明公司的良好前景。最后，股票回购代表自愿参与者之间按照当前市场价格进行的公开且受监管的公平交易。</p><p>鉴于监管股票回购的动力，我们希望在公共数据中可以观察到其缺点的证据。为了测试这一点，我们记录了回购趋势，并比较了回购和不回购股票的公司的交易量、股价表现、首席执行官薪酬以及公司财务活动（通过投资和盈利能力证明）。我们以两种方式对回购股票的企业进行了细分：（1）小额正回购与大额正回购（定义为低于中值与高于中值），（2）频繁回购者与不频繁回购者（定义为在一两个季度而不是一年中三四个季度回购的公司）。</p><p>我们对过去三十年数千家美国交易所上市公司的大样本证据表明，回购在美国是一种主流的企业金融活动，每年为股东返还数千亿美元的资本。从总体来看，我们发现这种活动既不会创造也不会破坏太多财富（也就是说，它不会导致股价发生重大变化）。此外，虽然回购与过去较高的盈利能力有关，但与首席执行官薪酬过高或投资不足无关。</p><p>随着时间的推移，回购活动总量的趋势表明，虽然回购价值迅速增长，但增长的大部分可归因于通货膨胀和市值的增加。此外，回购规模目前与股息相似，并且在相当长的一段时间内没有比股息增长得更快。然而，与股息不同，回购在公司面临压力时会急剧（且暂时）下降，这表明回购实际上为公司提供了上述支付灵活性的好处。</p><p></p><h3>仔细看看数据</h3><p>通过我们的分析，我们能够系统地解决针对股票回购的每一项批评。</p><p>首先，公司是否利用股票回购来操纵市场，通过创造过剩需求来推高股价？如果这样做，回购股票的公司的交易量应该比不回购股票的公司更高。但所有上市公司的平均交易量基本上保持相似，无论它们是否回购股票或回购股票的频率如何。事实上，近年来，不回购股票的公司的交易量大大超过了回购公司的交易量，这表明回购带来的超额交易量与其他力量相比相形见绌。</p><p>如果天真的投资者因为每股收益通胀而被诱骗购买进行回购行为的公司的股票，我们应该观察到短期价格上涨，随后长期业绩不佳。然而，无论公司是否回购股票、回购股票的强度和频率如何，我们都没有发现任何证据表明公司在回购股票的季度中表现明显优于大盘。虽然我们确实发现了一些边际证据表明，大量回购的公司在回购后的季度中表现略好，但我们没有发现未来短期或长期逆转的证据。这种表现优异的模式更符合公司利用回购来发出低估信号的情况——这对投资者有利——而不是操纵市场。</p><p></p><p>第二个批评是回购让内部人士获得不公平的利润。如果股票回购作为内部人员的寻租行为是一种普遍的、系统性的滥用行为，那么回购股票的公司的首席执行官将获得异常高的薪酬，包括工资、奖金和股权奖励的价值。使用模型生成的超额薪酬衡量标准（该指标已在早期学术文献中经过审查），我们估计进行大量正回购的公司首席执行官的收入仅比不回购股票的公司首席执行官多 51,000 美元——无论从统计角度还是从经济角度来看，这一超额薪酬数额微不足道。当我们将经常回购的公司的首席执行官与不回购的公司的首席执行官进行比较时，差异甚至更小——4,000 美元。与 CEO 数百万美元的平均薪酬相比，这些差异在经济上微不足道。令人惊讶的是，不频繁回购或回购小额正数的公司首席执行官获得的超额薪酬最少，甚至低于不回购公司的首席执行官。所有这些证据都表明公司利用回购来提高首席执行官的薪酬。</p><p>第三个也是最后一个批评是，回购降低了公司利用投资机会的能力，从而牺牲了创新和经济增长。我们发现，不回购股票的公司投资更多，但利润却明显低于回购股票的公司。频繁、大量回购的公司利润丰厚，过去一直稳定投资，并且继续进行大量投资，同时向股东返还资本。这表明盈利的公司在保持稳定的投资水平的同时回购股票，而盈利较低或亏损的公司不会（或可能无法）回购股票，而是更加密集地投资以期实现盈利。虽然可能存在一些管理不善的公司选择避免有利可图的投资，而是将资本返还给愿意的股东的孤立例子，但很难看出鼓励或激励这些经营不善的公司保留现金的指令会如何引导他们做出良好的投资。</p><p>可能受到回购规定影响的潜在利益相关者包括经理、其他员工、股东、政府和整个社会。 If a company is profitable, a CEO can pay excess cash out to shareholders in the form of buybacks or dividends, keep the money on their balance sheets, or invest in new projects. A small tax on share repurchases may not change corporate behavior significantly and might raise a small amount of revenue for the government. But if the tax rate grows high enough, companies will choose to not buy back shares and instead pay out exclusively via dividends or retain cash. In that case, the government raises no revenue but implements a de facto ban on share repurchases.</p><h3> How a Buyback Ban Could Backfire</h3><p> If a company were to switch to only paying out dividends, shareholders would lose the ability to choose whether to receive a cash payout and could face negative tax ramifications, given that dividends are taxed as income while capital gains are often taxed at a lower rate, and only when gains are realized. In addition, the company would lose important flexibility in difficult times, because cutting dividends is punished more by the market than cutting repurchases.</p><p></p><p> However, the move to restrict stock buybacks seems intended not to motivate companies to shift to paying back shareholders through dividends but to invest more in the business. There is evidence that retained cash is correlated with CEOs making value-destroying decisions, such as pursuing empire-building mergers, accruing personal expenses, or funding pet projects. It seems implausible that restrictions on share repurchases would induce CEOs of poorly governed companies to invest in value-enhancing projects that they otherwise would not have been funding.</p><p></p><p> From an employee standpoint, there is some evidence that labor unions are able to negotiate more successfully if their employers have excess cash, but there is plenty of evidence that constraints on a company&#39;s flexibility to raise and distribute capital is bad for employees, especially during downturns. Empire-building mergers can also be bad for employees, given that M&amp;As often result in the employees of the acquisition target being laid off and employees of the acquiring company being misallocated. In addition, some repurchased shares are reissued to employees, making any actions that are bad for shareholders also bad for stockholding employees.</p><p> Overall, our results show an absence of correlation between share repurchases and price manipulation, return reversals, excess CEO compensation, and underinvestment, which makes it highly implausible that economically significant causal effects of share repurchases still underlie the data. Corporations lose flexibility if they have to rely only on dividends, and evidence shows that poorly governed CEOs who retain cash often spend it on value-destroying mergers, expenses, or pet projects. It is implausible that policies designed to reduce repurchases will also reduce alleged but unobserved malpractices without imposing costs on US public companies and other stakeholders.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-case-against-restricting-stock-buybacks/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Are You Ready for the Next Supply Disruption?</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/are-you-ready-for-the-next-supply-disruption/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/are-you-ready-for-the-next-supply-disruption/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 13 Jul 2023 13:46:34 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[M.

But it&#39;s possible to have a high-performing, healthy workplace culture in a hybrid workplace, with flexibility in when and where people work. It just needs to be managed differently.</p><p> That was the message of Future Forum&#39;s Brian Elliott, who presented on a panel with N. Sharon Hill of the George Washington University School of Business and Julie Dervin of Atlassian during <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/series/work-23-the-big-shift/">Work/23</a> , an <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> symposium held in May 2023.</p><p> Elliott said that 93% of the 10,243 knowledge workers his company polled said they want flexibility in when they work. Those who were given some choice, he said, had <a href="https://futureforum.com/research/future-forum-pulse-winter-2022-2023-snapshot/">productivity scores 39% higher</a> than those who were not. Those with some flexibility about <em>where</em> they work also scored higher (8%).</p><p></p><p></p><p> Finding an equilibrium between employees&#39; desire for flexibility and an organization&#39;s strategic goals requires a reexamination of the kinds of work that need to be done in person. It also may require different work configurations for different groups within the same organization, and it certainly requires different ways of benchmarking the work employees accomplish.</p><p> Attendees had more questions for the presenters than there was time for, and Elliott agreed to answer some after the event. (Questions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity.)</p><h6> How do you measure productivity? Most workers say they are more productive working from home and on their own schedule, but are they really?</h6><p> Here&#39;s a heretical take: We need to stop trying to measure productivity in knowledge work and focus all that time and energy on measuring outcomes.</p><p> Productivity metrics take outputs (emails sent, cases closed) and divide them by inputs (hours active), and the better ones adjust for quality (cases reopened). That can work, somewhat, for rote, routine tasks, which are what get automated over time. But also, those metrics can be gamed, and people will game them — up to and including buying <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHBQQVG">mouse jigglers</a> . As Dominic Price of Atlassian has <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/the-problem-with-productivity-metrics">written</a> , “Productivity has always been a good way to measure the impact of machines and capital. It&#39;s just never been a good way to measure the impact of <em>humans</em> .”</p><p> At Future Forum, we&#39;ve ventured into this; we compared populations with and without flexibility to see that those with location flexibility report higher productivity scores, and those with schedule flexibility have an even bigger advantage. There are also academic studies by Stanford&#39;s <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30292">Nick Bloom</a> , HBS&#39;s <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30292">Raj Choudhury</a> , and others that show the same thing.</p><p> But it&#39;s an odd question in that we didn&#39;t ask it when people were in the office. We simply assumed that because people were present, they were doing something productive. We all know that&#39;s not accurate.</p><p> Instead, let&#39;s skip the whole mess and take the time to get clear on our organization&#39;s objectives and key results (OKRs), and do it in a way that those can cascade down by business unit and function, and to the team level. From the team level, much can be taken to the individual level to find the individual&#39;s impact both in terms of what they did and how they were as a teammate.</p><p> Assessing people on the impact they have on a team&#39;s goals is harder but will take us a lot further than installing more productivity metrics that measure their inputs and outputs.</p><h6> Random collisions seem to be key in driving innovation. How do you promote serendipity in terms of making connections across teams?</h6><p> Connections are an essential part of employee engagement and retention, but the connection to innovation is at best spurious. <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=991">Study</a> after <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4093796">study</a> has shown that what really enables innovation is psychological safety.</p><p> In research we conducted in 2021, Future Forum found that location (whether fully onsite, hybrid, or fully remote) had little to no correlation to team innovation. Instead, what <em>did</em> matter were factors like whether people felt they could ask questions and whether teams were willing to take risks — that is, whether they felt psychological safety.</p><p> Building connections is important, but we should do it intentionally in organizations instead of relying on random chance. Here are three ways you can do this:</p><p> <strong>1. Intentional cross-team connections.</strong> Programs like open brown-bag lunches where a rotating cast of internal experts present or host an “ask me anything session,” bringing leaders from other functions into your quarterly planning cycles, and creating public channels in Slack or Teams for sharing insights based on topics (like AI) can go a long way.</p><p> <strong>2. Leverage tools to build connections.</strong> Products like Donut, an app for Slack or Teams that pairs up individuals across teams programmatically, help ensure that everyone gets connected, not just those who work on the same floor or in the same building.</p><p> <strong>3. Help new employees build a network.</strong> One of the big challenges of the past few years is that too many companies hired people without rethinking how they build connections and get to understand the culture. One of my favorite tips comes from Genpact in Europe, where new employees are given six people to meet outside their team, either in person or at a virtual coffee, and each of those is supposed to provide two to three more contacts.</p><p> Investing in new tools and processes can also be a big boost. Think about processes like <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/12/using-brainwriting-for-rapid-idea-generation/">brainwriting</a> before a brainstorming session: Allowing people the heads-down space to think about some research results or a problem, write out their thoughts ahead of time, and then share with the group at the same time brings out more new ideas. It also lowers the odds of groupthink.</p><p></p><h6> How can you communicate an expectation that people should come into the office one or two days a week in a way that is inspiring and inclusive, and not forceful and dictatory?</h6><p> The last two years are littered with companies that declared that three days a week in person is the answer and saw 1.5 days a week as an average. This hides the fact that there&#39;s typically a more junior group of employees coming in two or three days a week, while more senior employees are coming in less often.</p><p> Repeating the policy doesn&#39;t work, and threatening to fire people who don&#39;t come in more often is unrealistic and breeds resentment. Leadership knows that it&#39;s some of the more experienced, critical talent that&#39;s coming in less often. The junior staff knows this too.</p><p> Instead, what we&#39;ve seen work is focusing on helping teams figure out their own rhythms through team-level agreements. The needs of a sales team and an engineering team, for instance, are different. The sales team might end up mandating two days a week that are default days in the office, and stacking those days with specific activities that are more “heads-up” than heads-down, such as training sessions, mentoring hours, and one-on-ones. The engineering team, on the other hand, might end up with one week of the month in person for planning, lunches together, and demo days.</p><p> Encouraging senior staff to come in at least one day a week for mentoring sessions, to be available for training, and for coffee with junior staff goes a lot further than simply telling them to show up.</p><p> The other critical element is that coming to the office can&#39;t be consistently worse than working at home. People don&#39;t want free lunch all the time, they want a place for team meetings, the ability to find a quiet spot for customer calls, and Wi-Fi that works. For a large number of companies, that requires redesigning the workspace.</p><h6> What should managers do to avoid having flexible work perpetuate or even exaggerate existing biases in the workplace? Being “out of sight, out of mind” is a real concern.</h6><p> Proximity bias and the chances of presenteeism leading to better opportunities as well as rewards is a real risk. We need to create a level playing field, and that starts with training managers and leaders to assess team and individual performance on the outcomes they generate, not the inputs (hours in the office, speed of response, being always-on). Leaders and their people partners need to look not only at the promotion and rewards cycle but also at their talent development pipeline and who&#39;s getting the new, shiny projects.</p><p> Working with the Slack executive team, we set a rule that all of the senior executives&#39; regular reviews — such as the CMO&#39;s weekly review of new project proposals — be done entirely virtually. That helped not only the usual challenges of people not hearing those at the other end of the room but also the pressure to be “in the room where it happens” for those meetings, which more junior staff might attend only once or twice a year.</p><h6> Many companies and industries outside of tech have a split between knowledge workers and those who need to be present in person to do their job (such as retail and manufacturing). How would you recommend positioning flexibility so as not to create an unfair dual standard?</h6><p> The differences between desk (office) workers and deskless (or front-line) workers extend far beyond the ability to work remotely: They include pay, benefits, facilities, training, and more.</p><p> The talent shortage in deskless workers is a massive challenge for many companies. But I don&#39;t think the answer is to force desk workers back into offices full-time. That doesn&#39;t really solve any issues for deskless workers.</p><p> The answer here is investing in the specific needs of deskless workers. According to <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/why-deskless-workers-are-leaving-and-how-to-win-them-back">research by Boston Consulting Group</a> , schedule flexibility and choice are top factors in talent retention. Leaders are investing in programs like the ability to swap shifts and having multiple types of schedules for call center workers. Neiman Marcus Group reduced turnover by 20% by offering sales associates flexibility in choice of stores and departments, as well as hours.</p><h6> I&#39;m at a startup. In a budding company, management focuses a lot on work culture as they grow. How does a startup, or any enterprise for that matter, build culture while allowing a remote or hybrid model?</h6><p> I&#39;m a strong believer that culture is built regardless of where you are located, the slogans on the wall, or the quality of the happy hours. Culture gets built based on the everyday experiences your employees have and the decisions you make: what you prioritize as a company, how you treat your customers and employees, what projects you resource, and whom you reward.</p><p></p><p> That said, there are a set of practices that I&#39;ve seen used that really help build a solid foundation. Here are three of them:</p><p></p><p> First, digital-first doesn&#39;t mean “never in person.” Getting people together, even if widely distributed, is an important part of building culture. For teams, I&#39;d recommend — at least quarterly — a few days focused primarily on team building, socialization, and connection. As a startup grows, this often goes from everyone quarterly to teams quarterly and everyone once a year.</p><p> Second, get clarity on how you work together, and share more about yourself. Your <a href="https://futureforum.com/2022/06/23/team-level-agreements/">team-level agreement</a> shouldn&#39;t just focus on how often people are together, it should also get into how you communicate, how you make decisions, and more. Sharing tools like <a href="https://futureforum.com/2022/07/15/personal-user-manual/">personal user manuals</a> can also go a long way toward establishing a culture of trust.</p><p> And third, create transparency at work. One of the key factors that drive culture is leadership communication, and as a company scales, it&#39;s important to remain transparent while putting in place guardrails. What topics matter to your company and mission most? How do we interact with one another? Scaling internal communications from CEO “ask me anything” sessions to public forums for knowledge sharing takes time and effort; <a href="https://slack.com/blog/transformation/a-modern-leaders-guide-to-organizational-transparency">guidelines from others</a> can help.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/flexible-and-effective-leadership-strategies-for-the-hybrid-workplace/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> How to Support Your Team When Uncertainty Is High</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-support-your-team-when-uncertainty-is-high/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-support-your-team-when-uncertainty-is-high/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 12 Jul 2023 11:00:05 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Liz Fosslien. <p>Liz Fosslien ( <a href="https://twitter.com/fosslien">@fosslien</a> ) is an expert on emotions at work and the coauthor and illustrator of <cite>The Wall Street Journal</cite> bestseller <cite>No Hard Feelings: The Secret Power of Embracing Emotion at Work</cite> (Portfolio, 2019) and <cite>Big Feelings: How to Be Okay When Things Are Not Okay</cite> (Portfolio, 2022).

I want to give everyone some kind of assurance, but I don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going to happen in six months either. What can I do?”</p><p> If you&#39;ve found yourself in a similar situation recently, you&#39;re not alone. Almost every people leader I&#39;ve met with over the past year has asked me some version of this question. And in a recent study, 89% of HR leaders shared that their teams have voiced concerns about <a href="https://www.humu.com/blog/the-toll-of-workplace-anxiety-and-what-to-do-about-it">job security, leadership changes, or reorgs</a> .</p><p> When uncertainty is high, managers should aim to make work a place of stability rather than another source of stress. “The most effective managers clearly communicate that they care about the people on their team,” explained Molly Sands, head of practices for Atlassian&#39;s Team Anywhere. “Research shows that what managers of top-performing teams consistently do differently is to make their reports <a href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/601872ae12d42e2264ff9ac4/62d6d89b1037a1bb82393638_Infographic _ Actions that drive great management.pdf">feel valued and comfortable</a> .”</p><p></p><p> How can you offer assurance when a lot of big decisions — and broader economic conditions — are outside of your control? It may seem almost impossible, but it&#39;s not. Here are seven ways managers can support their teams during turbulent times without making promises they can&#39;t keep.</p><p> <strong>Help each employee work toward their dream job.</strong> You can&#39;t always guarantee someone a promotion (or, unfortunately, even job stability), but you can commit to giving your employees the kinds of valuable learning opportunities that will help them no matter what comes next.</p><p> To surface the experiences or projects your team members would be excited to take on, ask them to show you a job posting for a role they&#39;d be thrilled to have in three to five years. Walk through the listed responsibilities together, and pinpoint any for which they think they lack the skills or compelling experience. Then commit to helping them grow in these areas by offering them relevant tasks or projects.</p><p> It can also be useful to make career chats a habit. Every six weeks, schedule 30 minutes with each of your reports to ask questions like these:</p><ul><li> What kinds of projects or tasks do you enjoy most?</li><li> What parts of your current responsibilities do you find energizing?</li><li> Do you feel like you&#39;re learning and growing in your role?</li><li> Are there skills you&#39;re looking to grow in the future?</li></ul><p> Make it a point to create or offer them relevant opportunities based on these conversations.</p><p> <strong>Cocreate a medium-term mission with your team.</strong> When faced with uncertainty or frequently shifting priorities, we often feel stuck or like we have little to show for all the effort we&#39;re putting in. This sense of helplessness can lead to apathy and disengagement. In fact, research my team at Humu conducted in February on the impact of continued uncertainty showed that roughly 40% of <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/web-assets-humu/eBooks/FY24 Q1 eBook - Uncertainty/eBook_Uncertainty_01.pdf">employees felt less ambitious</a> than they did a year earlier.</p><p> To reenergize your team members, bring them together to define and work toward a shared three-month goal. Looking three months out can create a longer-term sense of stability for your people, but it&#39;s a short enough time period that, even if things shift around you, you likely won&#39;t have to change your mission. For example, a marketing team might aim to increase website traffic by 25% over the next quarter, or run experiments on how to more quickly share information and make decisions. As Jamie Woolf and Heidi Rosenfelder, founders of Creativity Partners, advise, “To better enlist your team in the cocreation of the future, try asking questions like &#39;What new sources of profit can replace dwindling ones?&#39; or &#39;What can we do to break down silos within our team?&#39;”</p><p></p><p> <strong>Help your team achieve wins within two weeks.</strong> Quickly boost your team members&#39; sense of progress by focusing them on what they <em>can</em> control and giving each of them a specific task they can cross off within a week or two. Start by dividing your medium-term mission or longer-term goals into mini-milestones, and track and celebrate each one as it&#39;s achieved.</p><p> Sarah, an engineering manager, recently split an ambitious product launch into a series of specific features and updates and then assigned her reports individual tasks from the list. She also set up a 15-minute team check-in at the end of each week to celebrate what they had achieved and track the group&#39;s collective progress toward their shared goal.</p><p> <strong>Create clarity when you can.</strong> Thoughtful explanations in tough situations are critical to earning trust and reducing anxiety. The next time you have an update to share, prepare to walk through the story of how the decision was made, and think through any concerns or questions that might come up. Plan how you&#39;ll address each one. If you&#39;re unsure of what to say, ask other leaders or HR for recommendations. When you do share the decision with your team members, encourage them to ask clarifying questions.</p><p> It&#39;s also important for managers to speak to their own emotions — while avoiding emotionally processing news in front of their team. “You should say, &#39;I am disappointed about the results this quarter,&#39; but not, &#39;I am so disappointed by the results. I am so terrified we are all going to lose our jobs. I don&#39;t know what to do,&#39;” Sands suggested. “Transparency doesn&#39;t mean you have to share everything you feel or are concerned about.”</p><p></p><p> You can also run a clarity audit by talking with your team about a recent decision that affected them (such as a new product road map or a change in the expense policy). In your next series of one-on-one meetings, ask the following questions:</p><ul><li> How and when did you learn about this decision?</li><li> Is anything unclear?</li><li> What can I do differently the next time I&#39;m communicating a change with the team?</li></ul><p> These conversations can help you identify how to improve transparency — and make it clear to employees that you&#39;re doing your best to keep them up to date.</p><p> <strong>Provide context when you can&#39;t create clarity.</strong> Managers tend to stay quiet until they can share a concrete decision. But a lack of communication is still a form of communication — and it usually breeds mistrust and gossip.</p><p></p><p> To avoid misunderstandings, explain why you can&#39;t offer more details, and aim to provide a timeline for when you expect to have more information. For example, you might say something along the lines of “I haven&#39;t heard back on what changes will be made to the sales pitch. I&#39;m hoping to have more to share with you in a week or so, but I wanted to be as transparent as possible with where we are right now.”</p><p> <strong>Encourage your team to benefit from benefits.</strong> Studies show that up to 80% of employees are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2019/07/02/only-half-of-employees-understand-their-benefits-heres-what-hr-leaders-can-do-about-it/?sh=a4a1a578133c">confused about the benefits</a> their company provides. When budgets shrink, it can be an uphill battle to design and fund new ways to support your team. You might be surprised at how much you can boost morale simply by making employees aware of what already exists. For example, though my former employer offered women returning from maternity leave the option to work part time for their first month back, many expectant mothers were unaware of this policy. After Sands, then a product leader at Humu, flagged this option on a companywide Slack channel, several women (including me) took advantage of it and expressed gratitude for the policy.</p><p> Review your company handbook, or schedule a quick meeting with HR for a refresher. In an upcoming team meeting, give a brief overview of your organization&#39;s benefits, and encourage your team members to take full advantage of them. You might want to specifically highlight mental health benefits, vacation policies, or flexible work options. Start by saying something like “I know it&#39;s been a stressful time and uncertainty is high, so I want to highlight a few programs and benefits our company offers that might help you feel better.”</p><p> <strong>Help your team say no.</strong> Preserve your team&#39;s mental health by stepping in to protect their time. Set clear and reasonable expectations, and back your reports when they turn down nonurgent requests.</p><p></p><p> You can also look for ways to get more visibility into everything they&#39;re being asked to do — and aim to set up friendly barriers. For example, when I learned that my team was being overwhelmed with requests from sales, I created a short form and advised my reports to direct all of the requesters to complete it in order to start the process. This served three functions: (1) It allowed me to better understand what my team was being pulled into, (2) I could help my reports prioritize or say no as necessary, and (3) it reduced the number of requests, because few people actually filled out the form.</p><p></p><p> Uncertainty breeds anxiety, and although managers can&#39;t snap their fingers and magically make everything fall perfectly into place, they can take steps to help their teams feel more empowered, supported, and able to succeed. Offering team members personally meaningful growth opportunities and helping them achieve quick wins can restore their sense of control and motivation. Creating transparency around changes and updates — or explaining why a decision has not yet been announced — can restore employee trust. And helping people invest in their well-being and set healthy boundaries can make it easier for them to weather workplace storms.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-support-your-team-when-uncertainty-is-high/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Improve Key Performance Indicators With AI</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/improve-key-performance-indicators-with-ai/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/improve-key-performance-indicators-with-ai/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 11 Jul 2023 11:00:38 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Michael Schrage, David Kiron, François Candelon, Shervin Khodabandeh, and Michael Chu. <p class="mt20"><strong>Michael Schrage</strong> is a research fellow with the MIT Sloan School of Management&#39;s Initiative on the Digital Economy.

In the spring of 2023, we fielded a global survey and subsequently analyzed records from 3,043 respondents representing more than 25 industries and 100 countries. We also interviewed 17 executives leading AI initiatives in a broad range of companies and industries, including financial services, media and entertainment, retail, travel and transportation, and life sciences.</p><p> Our research examines how managers and leaders use AI to enhance strategic measurement to advance strategic outcomes. It explores how organizations have adapted — and even generated new — KPIs with AI to define and deliver measurably better performance.</p></aside><p> Improving key performance indicators is a clear mandate for most organizations. According to our seventh annual <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/big-ideas/artificial-intelligence-business-strategy/">global executive AI survey</a> , 7 out of 10 respondents agree that enhancing KPIs — not just improving performance — is critical to their business success. As one executive notes, “We need to evolve our KPIs all the time so we don&#39;t run our business on legacy metrics.”</p><p> A growing number of companies now use AI — in a variety of ways — to accelerate that evolution. “I&#39;m very excited about what machine learning can do in terms of having our senior leaders move away from metrics that look backward to metrics that can look forward,” says Avinash Kaushik, chief strategy officer at digital marketing agency Croud and a former senior director of global strategic analytics at Google.</p><p></p><p> Early on at Lyft, engineers designed an algorithm to maximize revenue by matching driver supply and customer demand. “It looked at all the possible combinations of riders and drivers and picked the combination that — based on the ride being requested, where the driver was located, all of the system dynamics — would maximize revenue,” says Elizabeth Stone, former vice president of science at Lyft. Then, as data scientists began testing other objectives, something interesting emerged. One AI solution discovered that optimizing conversion rates — how often a user ordered a ride after opening the app — would, in turn, deliver more ride requests in the future. More ride requests ultimately mean more revenue. As a result of using AI, Lyft transformed its revenue KPI from one focused on ride and driver combinations to one that also focuses on optimizing conversion rates. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p> At Tokopedia (part of GoTo Group), one of Indonesia&#39;s largest marketplaces, AI sifts through petabytes of data to detect signals that are correlated with credibility and reliability. These are key considerations, given that 86.5% of its 14 million merchants — selling 1.8 billion products — are new entrepreneurs. Having more-credible merchants makes the marketplace more appealing, effective, and efficient. “They might have good products to sell, but they don&#39;t know how to manage their stock,” says Herman Widjaja, Tokopedia&#39;s CTO. “With AI, we connect our customers to the right product that is served <em>by the right merchants</em> that they want.” The company synthesized millions of possible signals into a scoring system that represents a new KPI around merchant quality.</p><p> While most respondents understand the need for enhanced KPIs, a clear majority currently rely on inadequate tools and technologies to manage their metrics. Even as machine learning algorithms and generative AI transform enterprise capabilities, human judgment remains the overwhelmingly dominant approach to KPI enhancement. Two-thirds of survey respondents affirm that managers make judgment calls when adjusting their organization&#39;s KPIs. While common, this approach often fails to yield the desired results: Barely a third of survey respondents relying only on human judgment see their KPIs improve.</p><p></p><p> In contrast, companies that use AI to inform their KPIs are far more likely to see improved metrics. Ninety percent of respondents who use AI to create new KPIs say they see their KPIs improve. These AI-informed KPIs offer business benefits and demonstrate new capabilities: They often lead to more efficiency and greater financial benefit and are more detailed, time sensitive, and aligned with organizational objectives. (See “Creating New KPIs With AI.”) We observe a growing awareness among executives that KPIs need to become smarter and more predictive. </p><div class="callout-highlight callout-highlight--transparent"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Creating New KPIs With AI</h4><p class="caption"> Of the 34% of organizations surveyed that use AI to create new KPIs, 90% see improvements. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/AI-BusinessStrategy_Article02_fig1-final.png" alt="Creating New KPIs With AI" /><br /></article></aside></div><p> All of the leaders we interviewed for our research voiced similar rationales for enhancing KPIs. As legacy metrics become static and outdated, their value as tools for defining and achieving organizational goals diminish. In fact, they become measurably less useful. Both individually and collectively, KPIs need to be updated and enhanced to ensure that they advance desired organizational outcomes. Improving performance without enhancing KPIs creates competitive risk. Companies that focus on — or align around — suboptimal measures are at a competitive disadvantage. Focusing on performance without a commensurate focus on its measure creates an inherent imbalance that can sabotage a company&#39;s efforts to compete effectively.</p><p> Based on our research — which includes results from a global survey of more than 3,000 managers and qualitative analysis of more than a dozen executive interviews — we have identified three ways to enhance strategic metrics with AI:</p><ul><li> <strong style="font-size:1.25em;">I</strong> mprove existing KPIs.</li><li> <strong style="font-size:1.25em;">C</strong> reate new KPIs.</li><li> <strong style="font-size:1.25em;">E</strong> stablish new relationships among KPIs.</li></ul><p> This article explains how this Improve-Create-Establish, or ICE, framework can help leaders and managers repurpose KPIs to make their people, processes, and technologies more effective. Our research shows that AI-enhanced KPIs are associated with strategically valuable business benefits, including increased efficiency, better alignment, and greater financial benefit. Integrating AI into the strategic measurement process has enormous implications for the future of capital allocation, customer engagement, employee experience, EBITDA, and every other executive metric.

We offer several practical steps on how to use AI to enhance their KPIs.</p><p></p><h3> Improve Existing KPIs With AI</h3><p> Companies that initially use AI to boost performance numbers tend to find that the technology creates opportunities to revisit and review key performance parameters.</p><h4> The Substitution Effect at Wayfair</h4><p> Wayfair&#39;s AI approach makes that case. While losing a sale may appear to be a straightforward measure, the online furniture retailer used AI to reexamine the fundamentals behind its lost-sales KPI. As CTO Fiona Tan recalls, “We used to think that if you lost the sale on a particular product, like a sofa, it was a loss to the company. But we started looking at the data and realized that 50% to 60% of the time, when we lose a sale it is because the customer bought something else in the same product category.”</p><p> This AI-enabled analysis allowed Wayfair to experiment with substitute offers based on customer concerns such as price points, shipment times, and other factors. Demand for these substitute products provided a new lens on what had been previously measured and interpreted as lost sales. Recognizing this “substitution effect” led Wayfair to adjust pricing across its entire sofa domain, revamp product configurations in its fulfillment centers, and reprioritize legacy KPIs.</p><p></p><p> At one level, Wayfair used AI to transform its legacy lost-sales KPI into a more valuable metric that differentiated truly lost sales from actual sales. But at another level, the AI behind this upgraded KPI also enabled more sweeping changes. Tan&#39;s team used the substitution effect to develop a “profit-awareness framework,” which changed the way the company interacted with customers. Wayfair&#39;s furniture recommendations began to factor in delivery times and shipment costs, as well as product incidents and product profitability, when making next-best offers. Explicitly measuring and incorporating the substitution effect reframed lost sales as sales opportunities and led to pricing shifts. This reframing consequently aligned product placement decisions with the needs and capacities of distribution centers and warehouses, which improved both employee and customer experiences.</p><p> Companies across the industry landscape are finding ways to use AI to improve existing KPIs. Some use AI to deepen their understanding of factors that drive KPI outcomes, whereas others use AI to identify and prioritize which KPIs deliver the most value to the organization. While our survey results suggest that most companies will satisfice around improving KPIs (that is, rely on human judgment), we also see companies recognizing that AI makes possible altogether new KPIs that can achieve, and drive, next-level performance.</p><h3> Create New KPIs</h3><p> In addition to improving existing performance metrics, AI offers the potential for managers to algorithmically discover and generate entirely new KPIs. While our survey shows that only 16% of respondents&#39; organizations use AI to generate new KPIs, 90% agree that their use of AI has measurably improved their KPIs.</p><p> For example, hunting for indicators that can help physicians preempt sudden cardiac death, which afflicts 300,000 people in the US every year, is an ongoing effort for physicians and researchers. These types of deaths come out of nowhere; doctors can&#39;t predict them, since patients don&#39;t present as high risk. It&#39;s an especially frustrating condition because there is a known effective treatment — installing a cardiac defibrillator — if doctors can identify at-risk patients in time. One of the researchers in this hunt, Ziad Obermeyer, a physician and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, is working with Region Halland Health System in Sweden whose electronic health record data can be linked to a variety of government data. He and his collaborators trained an algorithm to predict sudden cardiac death in the year after an electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed, using death certificates, and a variety of other data points taken from government records and electronic health records.</p><p> “The algorithm became quite good at predicting who&#39;s going to succumb to sudden cardiac death in the year after an ECG is taken. Every time someone gets an ECG, it generates a risk score that measures the probability the individual will die from sudden cardiac arrest,” says Obermeyer. That ECG score can also function just like a key performance indicator: With the score in hand, a doctor might observe how it changes if the patient is prescribed a medication such as a beta blocker or an ACE inhibitor. While the research is at a very early stage, it might one day empower doctors and patients to work together to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death — and identify new interventions that might decrease the risk. “Having the ability to turn these very complicated biological signals into indicators is very powerful,” Obermeyer says, “and I think that&#39;s going to be something that we&#39;ll see a lot more of, not just for sudden cardiac death but for diabetic complications and all sorts of other preventable, high-stakes conditions.”</p><p> Obermeyer&#39;s use of AI to create a new KPI for sudden cardiac death promises to improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance physicians&#39; sense of their own efficacy. Developing and discerning new key performance indicators with AI is an emergent phenomenon across the business landscape and among large companies we interviewed, such as DBS Bank, General Electric, General Motors, Sanofi, Schneider Electric, and Walmart. These companies are using AI to identify indicators of future performance at earlier and earlier stages of corporate activity. This capability facilitates better situational awareness and a more effective response to changing market conditions, among other benefits.</p><h3> Establish New Relationships Among KPIs</h3><p> No KPI is an island. Many executives we spoke with emphasized that better managing their business requires that they bring local KPIs together into a more integrated set of metrics. Executives across industries explicitly remarked on the inherent organizational and computational tensions between maximizing local KPIs and optimizing higher-level, more macro KPIs. As KPI features and parameters evolve, the importance of anticipating, modeling, and coordinating multiple KPI interactions with AI becomes more critical.</p><h4> DBS Bank Integrates Its KPIs With AI</h4><p> Singapore-based DBS Bank once relied on independent KPIs for each function touching different points along a customer journey. That is, for a given product, marketing would, for instance, have its own customer engagement metrics, product would have its own attrition metrics, finance would have its own revenue metrics, etc. Over the past three years, however, the multinational banking and financial services company has replaced that vertical model with a horizontal one. DBS created a value map that ties the use cases together into a single customer journey with outcomes in four categories: customer experience, employee experience, profitability, and risk. “We call it &#39;managing through journeys,&#39;” says Sameer Gupta, DBS&#39;s chief analytics officer. “Each customer journey would have multiple drivers, and each driver would in turn have multiple metrics to measure. You can imagine how quickly these scale, and it would be humanly impossible to optimize such a large number of drivers and metrics. AI is a force multiplier that gives us the ability to analyze large numbers of drivers and metrics and also identify those that need to be acted on now.”</p><p> In the new model, the outcome data is visible to cross-functional squads, whose members all have a stake in optimizing results in all four categories. “Everyone is looking at the same data, and everyone is accountable for the same outcome,” Gupta notes. The squads use experimentation, data analytics, customer immersion, and AI to continually review the factors driving different outcomes. In addition, they retain a sharp focus on choosing the correct metrics.</p><p> Establishing these interrelationships among their KPIs has been, in Gupta&#39;s words, “a fundamental shift.” He anticipates that AI will have an increasingly prominent role as the organization continues to coordinate its metrics in a drive toward continuous improvement. “We are starting to unpack to ask, &#39;Do we currently make that decision through data and AI enablement? Is there an opportunity to make it through data and AI enablement? If there is, how can we do it?&#39;” Gupta says. Discerning new relationships among KPIs with AI and other analytical techniques can yield new business opportunities, new insights, and a valuable set of data around which to manage organizational behaviors.</p><h3> Leadership Takeaways</h3><p> The future of strategic measurement belongs to smarter KPIs. Our research suggests, however, that few legacy organizations are strategically using AI to improve their KPIs. This makes both AI and KPIs undervalued assets. Leadership needs to invest accordingly. Using AI to improve KPIs, create new KPIs, and establish new relationships among KPIs creates an opportunity to capture measurably greater value. The ICE framework invites executive and boardroom discussions that should lead to management investment in improving strategic measurement.</p><p> Our research also emphasizes the need for leaders to align not only on which KPIs to pursue but, even more fundamentally, on the purpose of those KPIs. Will KPIs be primarily retrospective, or will they predictively lean into the future?</p><p> If the latter, organizations need road maps for improving existing KPIs; a commitment to exploration and experimentation around creating new KPIs; and a recognition that relationships among KPIs may matter as much as, if not more than, the individual KPIs themselves. Intelligent KPIs should not be primarily managed as independent performance silos; rather, their interdependencies and interrelationships must be understood and addressed. As our examples have shown, these shifts represent operational, organizational, and cultural challenges to leadership.</p><p> As has been the case with almost every successful AI initiative, KPIs, like the algorithms that comprise them, must be transparent and explainable. KPIs — organizationally, culturally, and operationally — cannot be seen as black boxes. They should be designed and deployed to be trusted. This cultural component should not be minimized or taken for granted. Otherwise, people at all levels of the organization will seek to game the metrics that guide them, ensuring organizational misalignment.</p><p></p><p> Underlying this new emphasis on AI and KPIs, and on strategic measurement more broadly, is an acknowledgment that quality KPIs depend on quality data. KPIs trained or supervised on biased, incomplete, and flawed data sets are likely to be biased, incomplete, and flawed. Data quality matters more wherever KPIs matter more. We see organizations committed to AI-driven KPIs becoming even more committed to cultivating data as an asset. They see investments in data reflected in KPI improvements.</p><p> Finally, as AI-influenced KPIs become more influential in the enterprise, their own performance will require new levels of monitoring and oversight. Leadership will need to be able to evaluate how well their KPIs are doing, individually and collectively. Are they the right KPIs for sustainable success? Are they appropriately anticipating the future? Are they making the right decisions — and helping humans make the right decisions — for achieving desired and desirable outcomes? Simply put, KPIs will require their own KPIs to help answer those important questions.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/improve-key-performance-indicators-with-ai/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The 10 Most Popular Articles in 2023 (So Far)</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-10-most-popular-articles-in-2023-so-far/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-10-most-popular-articles-in-2023-so-far/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 06 Jul 2023 11:00:48 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[MIT SMR Editors. ]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence]]></category><category><![CDATA[Corporate Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hybrid Workplace]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership Development]]></category><category><![CDATA[Remote Work]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership]]></category><category><![CDATA[Organizational Behavior]]></category><category><![CDATA[Talent Management]]></category><category><![CDATA[Workplace, Teams, & Culture]]></category><description><![CDATA[Three-plus years after COVID-19 interrupted office-based operations with a sudden transition to remote work, managing hybrid teams remains a pressing issue for leaders.

Today, Shervin and I are excited to be joined by David Hardoon, who holds several senior positions at the Aboitiz Group. David, thanks for joining us.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Thank you very much, Sam, Shervin.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Can you first tell us a bit about the Aboitiz Group? Where do you work?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> The Aboitiz Group is a 100-plus-year-old conglomerate that originated starting in Spain — Catalonia — and relocated to the Philippines. It started in the hemp business but is now quite diversified, from the main business — power generation and distribution across the Philippines — [to] financial services, cement, construction, utilities, [real] estate, airports, food, agriculture. We&#39;re now going through a transformation and becoming — I love this term, by the way — a techglomerate.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What is Aboitiz Data Innovation?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> About seven years ago, give or take, the bank started with all digitalization of the banking services. And what that had resulted in, as you would imagine, [was] a tremendous amount of data. The more you engage your consumers digitally, the more you have digital services — well, surprise, surprise — the more data you have.</p><p> And the question came as well, how are we really using it? Are we using it? What&#39;s the best way to put it to good use? And that question kind of also went beyond just the bank into the rest of the businesses, as you can imagine. Power has a lot of data; agriculture, airports, etc., have a lot of data.</p><p> We were born with a very on-point mandate: operationalizing data, operationalizing AI. Really, how do we put it to good use?</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What are some of these uses?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> I mean, there&#39;s the usual financial side, where we all learn from hyperpersonalization, financial crime. And don&#39;t get me wrong — that stuff … always gets me all excited. I spent a few good years in the financial regulator [space] here in Singapore.</p><p> But let me give you an oddity: cement, an industry that you wouldn&#39;t really associate with data or AI. We sat down with the CEO at the time, and we said, “Look, even in the world of cement, you have a lot of data.”</p><p> How can this work? So let me give you a little tidbit of how the world of cement works. And this is something that was new to me. So basically, it&#39;s like baking. I don&#39;t know if you bake, but it&#39;s like baking. It&#39;s basically, you have mixtures. You have these kind of formulas, and you end up with cement, which will have different types of properties. And these properties [are] what&#39;s absolutely critical depending on what you&#39;re planning to build, whether it&#39;s a mall, a high rise, a low rise, residential, etc., and so forth.</p><p> Having said that, as with baking, you kind of need to do a bit of trial and error. You need to try out these different mixtures to make sure it produces the right one. That results in operational overhead. It results in wastage. I mean, as with baking, you stick this stuff into kilns — literally, it&#39;s a furnace — to bake it. Using data, using the information that&#39;s coming from all the devices, the IoT, using AI, being able to actually tell the bakers or, in this case, the chemical engineers what is going to be the output of this mixture before they even start, while at the same time maintaining that quality control, which is absolutely crucial. Now this is, by the way, not just hypothetical. This is already operational for the past year in all the plants — about six plants in the Philippines — and results in operational efficiency, results in reduction in [the amount] of wastage, resulted in what I like to call quantifiable ESG [environmental, social, and governance]: a 35 kiloton reduction of CO <sub>2</sub> emissions. So that&#39;s a nice unusual example I like to give in terms of how data is used.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Well, I could tell you, Sam and I are going to love that. We&#39;re both chemical engineers.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Oh, well, there you go.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Actually, when you said baking, I did my Ph.D. in catalyst synthesis, so I spent a lot of my time baking various aluminosilicates to create catalysts. And you&#39;re completely right: You try all these things. Some work; some don&#39;t work. And had there been the ability for me to know ahead of time, I probably would have gotten my Ph.D. in a tenth of the time.</p><p> But seriously, this is quite interesting. Now, if you go from personalization and cyber and fraud, and you also have this example in baking cements, then we must believe that there is such a wide portfolio of things that you are considering. So tell us more about what makes it into that portfolio, because there is no end to what you could do. What are the kinds of things you get excited about?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> You&#39;re absolutely right. Being fortunate working in a conglomerate, you kind of wake up every day and discover something new. So there are kind of two dimensions to it. On the one hand — and I&#39;m going to go back to this term <em>operationalization</em> , operationalizing data and AI — it&#39;s stuff that has to make sense to the business. So revenue, operational efficiency, risk management. And then we have to look at the things around the corner. We have to experiment. But those may not be things that get immediately deployed. Like, effectively in agricultural builders, we have the animals; we have pigs, swine, and poultry. And as part of that process, we want to make sure that the animals have the best possible care provided to them. On an experimental side, we say, “OK, how can we use technology that&#39;s already available but may not have been put in exactly in this particular context, not in Southeast Asia?” So we&#39;re using voice recognition and image recognition for pigs to help identify stress and detect illnesses, so that could be automatic alerts to the caregivers.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What&#39;s the ground truth on that? That would be interesting to know.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That&#39;s a great question.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What&#39;s the training data?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> So this is the amazing stuff. It&#39;s a very expressive animal. So when you actually go there with the people who take care of them, they can literally point at them and say, “This animal is distressed,” and you&#39;re constantly recording.</p><p> We&#39;re kind of, “OK, is this really something that&#39;s relevant? Does it make sense?” Like, can we have that conversation with the baker, you know, the chemical engineer? Can we have a conversation with the animal keeper, the veterinarian and so forth, or the pole engineer when we&#39;re dealing with electricity cables? It&#39;s extremely important.</p><p> And that&#39;s one of the things that I realized throughout my career of doing data, is where things failed, where you suddenly had this divergence of exploring scientific research — and I came from the world of science, you know, like ex-academic — without really seeing that connectivity. And if we go all the way back, even when radar was invented, the reason things fall apart is whereby the very, very small gaps of “Well, it&#39;s not quite there; oh, it&#39;s not quite usable.” So that&#39;s the first part.</p><p> Then, the second level is seeing, well, is this something that, as much as possible, is truly going to make a difference to either our internal users — because that&#39;s extremely important — and for many of the businesses which are within the group, which are actually B2B, like in power, where, essentially, we provide power and wholesale [electricity]? So it&#39;s our internal users in terms of, let&#39;s say, predictive asset maintenance — critically important.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That is really fantastic. I mean, what you&#39;ve said is inspiring on so many levels. One is, let your imagination be the limit, right, because [of] the question of “Can something be done better, more effectively? Can you see around the corner there?” And there&#39;s data, then, yes. That&#39;s one thing that&#39;s inherent in all these examples that you gave.</p><p> You started with what most would consider quite advanced and interesting things, and we have guests who talk about those all the time: personalization, fraud, cyber. All of those are very important. And then you went to cement. And then you went to pigs. And then you talked about human and AI …</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Yeah.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Which is quite critical too. I just find that very, very energizing.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Well, it&#39;s the nexus between human and AI. There are two critical things that I believe have to go hand in hand — have to. While this may change in the future to some degree or extent — I mean, who knows what&#39;s going to happen around the corner? Things change so rapidly. But I&#39;ll be the first one to admit this: I truly came to this appreciation when I worked [for] the regulator — surprise, surprise — [of the] criticality of combining governance and innovation. And I used to get asked this question repeatedly, of “Oh, but don&#39;t you think governance inhibits innovation? It stifles us.” And I came to the view of, I&#39;m vehemently against that perspective.</p><p> I would argue that not only it does not stifle it — it would result in more and even better innovation. It&#39;s essentially about just simply having, you know, common sense. I was privileged in being in the process and coming up with the FEAT principle. So this was <em>fairness</em> , <em>ethics</em> , <em>accountability</em> , and <em>transparency</em> , back at the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p><p> I remember that when it came out — and we deliberately kept it very simple — and I showed it to our governor, our managing director, and he was just like, “David, isn&#39;t this just common sense?” And I just smiled, and I was like, “Well, no; even common sense has to ... it&#39;s not always that common. It has to be written down.” But it&#39;s critical. That&#39;s No. 1.</p><p> And No. 2, what you were mentioning is that, yes, while AI and data can do what is seemingly miraculous stuff, it&#39;s critical that this combination with us humans and <em>how</em> we use it is baked in at the very beginning. And even now, obviously, everyone&#39;s talking about ChatGPT, but remember: All the data that it&#39;s trained on is from <em>us</em> to a certain extent.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah. You can&#39;t take humans out of the loop, because after a while, they will lose what makes them human.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> But we have examples of that. I mean, that&#39;s OK in some places. I mean, neither of you know how to navigate by the stars, I&#39;m guessing, unless, Shervin, you&#39;ve got some tricks up your sleeve that I haven&#39;t learned yet. I mean, most people don&#39;t drive a manual transmission; that seems to be a skill that&#39;s … well, OK, maybe one or two of us do here. But the point is, we don&#39;t have to retain all possible skills. We just have to be savvy about which ones we hang on to.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> That&#39;s exactly [right], what you said: It&#39;s some, not all. But sometimes you find that you see this trend of like, “Oh, look what it can do. <em>Everything</em> gets automated.” And I remember, if I go to my early days as a consultant — you know, I used to be a consultant doing AI — you would find a lot of times, potential clients and people you spoke to, even if they didn&#39;t say it explicitly, what they were trying to achieve was like, “Oh, just do everything automatically with AI.”</p><p> And you need to have almost this natural inclination by saying, “OK, if it&#39;s contextual, if it makes sense.” Like you said, maybe I want to pick up star navigation because I&#39;m interested in it. I want to learn about astrology or astrophysics or whatnot.伟大的。 But you see it now becomes a niche topic that some people pick up. The general public doesn&#39;t need to know how to do it. But we need to be able to identify that decision point rather than just go [into a] “No, everything now, AI galore” kind of situation.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Well, I mean, what you&#39;re saying is, there&#39;s value in the ongoing dialogue. There&#39;s value in ongoing challenge. And every time there is a dialogue, I mean, even back in Socrates&#39;s time, the dialogue is where it elevates the conversation. And you&#39;re rightly pointing out that the moment you say AI is the be-all and end-all is the moment that you are under-delivering on AI, and then you&#39;re for sure under-delivering on the human potential.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Well you&#39;re losing a potential answer. Let me give you two examples. In the financial section, we have Union Bank of the Philippines, amongst others. While AI governance regulation is not yet — <em>yet</em> — a requirement, let&#39;s say, in the Philippines, we&#39;ve situated a working group, which is an interesting combination of people, from your risk officer, legal, compliance, and then you have marketing, customer engagement, experience. What happens is, while you still have the traditional process of model validation, etc., from a statistical, mathematical, data point of view, the models are presented in this working group for us to have a debate. Because a model may pass all the statistical tests, but if this model goes wrong — even that 10% or 5% — there is a significant reputational risk at play or there&#39;s a potential impact to the consumers. That debate is important because if you just looked at it from that statistical, even a potentially automated process, you would miss it.</p><p> Now, the resolution, interestingly enough — and I honestly tell you, like, maybe eight out of 10 times so far — isn&#39;t data, isn&#39;t AI. The resolution a lot of times is process, which is people. And that makes us actually wiser and understanding, “OK, how do we use it, and how do we engage with it? And when do we allow” — Sam, to your point — “that automation?” And when we go “no,” I retain the veto to overrule, to a certain extent. So that&#39;s one example.</p><p> The other one is if I go back to my cement [example], and in fact, we did this very deliberately at the very beginning because we didn&#39;t want our colleagues and chemical engineers to think, “Oh, great. Why do you need me? You&#39;re just going to automate the whole thing.”</p><p> No. The whole point was, we absolutely need them because there may be new types of mixtures that we haven&#39;t considered. You will still need to have that experimentation. The whole goal is providing information.</p><p> What it has resulted in is efficiency. If I give a swing again to another one — when ChatGPT came out, I got asked straightaway from a few boards, “What does this mean?” And my instinctive reaction, rather than going into this whole lengthy explanation of liberation, I just responded by saying, “It means that every one of us can have the productivity of 10 people.”</p><p> So this is what this stuff means, and that&#39;s what that nexus, the dialogue, the integration, the augmentation means — is that we now have the ability to be far more productive, whatever “productive” means in that context. For some people, they may say, “I just want to work two hours but [appear] as if I work the whole day.” Some may say, “I want to work the whole day.” … It may differ. But that&#39;s what it means because now we&#39;re able to take all this data.</p><p> I&#39;m sure some of you remember, back in 2000, you had these memes online of “getting information off the internet is like drinking from a fire hose.” It&#39;s still true. We&#39;re inundated with information, with data, but it&#39;s like distilling it down to something that&#39;s relevant to me, usable, that I can do something with it and get that gain, essentially.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I think one thing that&#39;s coming out of this conversation — Shervin used the word <em>Socratic</em> , and, David, you used the word <em>dialogue</em> . What&#39;s nice about this is it&#39;s dropped this hubris that I feel like I see in a lot of machine learning. Machine learning seems to be about humans teaching machines. So it&#39;s this sort of “We know all. We make the machines emulate us, and if they do, they pass the Turing test, and, yes, everything&#39;s golden.” But then you get pushback, and you say, “Oh, no. The machine can teach <em>us</em> things we&#39;ve never known before.” Well, that just has switched the direction. It still has that same directional hubris, but the things that you&#39;re both talking about are much more [oriented around the] Socratic and dialogue.</p><p> When you think about what that group can form together — and Shervin and I have got some results from last year&#39;s research that said about 60% of the people are thinking about AI as a coworker. And that strikes me as that sort of a relationship, because between the two, yes, you find some new compound that maybe someone wouldn&#39;t have tried. I don&#39;t know what the chemical engineering equivalent of the Fosbury flop is. Do you remember the Fosbury flop, where he learned a different way of jumping over the high bar, and then suddenly everyone else adopted that technique? That sort of idea seems like it could come out of this approach.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> It&#39;s actually really interesting you bring that up. I mean, I&#39;d love to say, “Oh, yeah, we had this all intended in the very beginning,” but I&#39;ll be very honest and say, I think it&#39;s more of a nice consequence that wasn&#39;t fully intended at a point in time.</p><p> But I want to go back to that FEAT principle. One of the principles resulted in a lot of discourse — and I mean a <em>lot</em> — where we had a statement amongst all of them that said that we should hold AI to at least the same standard as human decisions. So AI-based decisions should be held to at least the same standard as human-based decisions. And the debate was phenomenal and [people] said, “Oh, no, we should hold it to a higher one,” etc., and so forth.</p><p> But what the intention of that principle was saying is, if you&#39;re using now … so let me go back again to, let&#39;s say, a financial [example]: loan provisioning. And if [you&#39;re] using an AI algorithm and you&#39;re finding that “oh, we&#39;re discriminating,” OK, yeah, absolutely, that&#39;s something that needs to be addressed, reviewed, and corrected. But hold your horses there. Take a step back. Take the AI out of the equation. Had you been discriminating before the AI? And that&#39;s really the question because ... I remember I had long debates with many regulators. Maybe debate is the wrong word: <em>discussions</em> with many regulators. And I was actually a bit opposed to regulating AI, and I&#39;ll explain what I mean by that.</p><p> I&#39;m not opposing regulation. But when they said “regulating AI,” I got a bit defensive. I said, “What I&#39;m worried about is that we&#39;re like, &#39;OK, well, since AI now is showing me all this stuff that I don&#39;t want to know about, then I&#39;m just not going to use AI.&#39; And we&#39;re going to go back to the same procedures previously, which, guess what — it&#39;s the same problem. You just weren&#39;t paying attention to it because that information, that knowledge, wasn&#39;t bubbled up to the surface.”</p><p> So, what I kept on arguing is that, yes, the regulation has to be in play. And yes, there may be certain scenarios whereby AI requires higher scrutiny. But the regulation is still on the outcome. The regulation is still in the fact that, for example, it&#39;s a case of discrimination. You should not be discriminating; whether you&#39;re using a human-based process or an AI-based process is kind of beside the point. But I just want to emphasize that point, Sam, because it really goes back to what you were saying of, it&#39;s now teaching <em>us</em> things that we may have been, let&#39;s say, sometimes consciously ignorant of, sometimes inadvertently unaware of.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> David, tell us about your background. How did you end up where you are?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> If I roll back all the way to the beginning, and I&#39;m going to say this again with a big smile myself, how did I end up where I am? Detention. That&#39;s how I ended up here.</p><p> I must have been, what, 14, 15, 16 years old, and I got sent to the library because of detention. And, you know, if you&#39;re in a library, you have nothing better to do. I picked up a book on Prolog. Don&#39;t ask me why, from all the books I could have picked up, I picked up one about Prolog. And this is really before knowing anything about the whole world of, well, I guess in that case, it would be expert-based systems. And I started reading, and I just couldn&#39;t put it down. And that kind of triggered this exploration of, how can we better capture knowledge? How can we better learn?</p><p> And that obviously resulted in kind of learning a bit more about neural networks, AI. In fact, I was one of the first two students who took the degree of computer science with artificial intelligence. It was literally brand-new, from that perspective.</p><p> My Ph.D. thesis was about semantic models, so literally the representation and encapsulation of knowledge, effectively, and information; [it] was on learning musical patterns/music, or generating music from brain patterns. And the whole idea about that is essentially providing expert-based systems knowledge, if you think about it in that way, for people who, say, can&#39;t sit in front of a piano and play but are fully capable cognitively.</p><p> So that&#39;s kind of what brought me here. I know it&#39;s a very weird kind of journey. But yeah, I need to thank my literacy teacher: Thank you for sending me to detention.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> OK, so we&#39;ve got a segment where we&#39;re going to ask you some quick questions. What are you proudest of in terms of artificial intelligence? What have you done that you&#39;re proudest of?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Where to begin? What I&#39;m most proud of is the way we&#39;ve been able to graduate — and I literally mean that — from the academic world to the industrial world.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What worries you about AI? You&#39;ve mentioned some worries today. But what worries you?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> What worries me is I don&#39;t think we&#39;re fully appreciating what we&#39;re creating. I think we need to focus head on with the realization of what we&#39;re creating and what we&#39;re seeding for possibilities, for good and for bad.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your favorite activity that does not involve technology?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> SUP: stand-up paddling. Being on the water and just paddling away. It&#39;s extremely soothing. It&#39;s actually phenomenal exercise, for those who haven&#39;t tried.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I&#39;ve tried and I&#39;ve missed the stand-up part. I&#39;m OK with the paddling, but the stand-up seems to lead to trouble. What&#39;s the first career you wanted while you were sitting in detention? What did you want to be when you grew up?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> I wanted to be an astrophysicist.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your greatest wish for AI in the future? What are you hoping we can gain from this?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> I don&#39;t know. Self-actualization? I hope we learn more about ourselves. It&#39;s already giving us capabilities. I mean, for example, I&#39;m dyslexic. Thank heavens for auto spell-checkers!</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Well, thank you for taking the time. I think that there&#39;s a lot that you&#39;ve mentioned. I think we can go back to even examples of food 100 years ago. We had a terrible food cleanliness [problem], and now we have a supply chain we can trust. Perhaps we can build that same sort of supply chain with data. Thank you for taking the time to talk with us today. It&#39;s been a pleasure.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Thank you, Sam, Shervin.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah.谢谢。</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> And maybe, if I may just add another note, I think that&#39;s really the critical thing: It&#39;s AI <em>trust</em> . It&#39;s about trust.非常感谢。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Thanks for listening. Next time, Shervin and I talk with Naba Banerjee, head of trust product and operations at Airbnb, about how the travel platform uses AI and machine learning to make travel experiences safer.</p><p> <strong>Allison Ryder:</strong> Thanks for listening to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> .

These technologies are taking over more and more aspects of business as they seep into the collective consciousness. As Vox put it, generative AI is “ <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2023/1/5/23539055/generative-ai-chatgpt-stable-diffusion-lensa-dall-e">suddenly everywhere</a> ,” and it&#39;s poised to profoundly change daily life within organizations in many ways, particularly in the sphere of communication.</p><p> More than ever, when people receive texts, emails, or other digital messages, they have reason to wonder whether an actual human being wrote them. ChatGPT is even being used to write <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/chatgpt-is-being-used-to-write-emails-big-companies-are-embracing-it.html">custom messages</a> to individual executives on LinkedIn. In response, tools are being created to help people determine whether a message was really <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90830518/tools-to-detect-ai-generated-text-chatgpt">written by a human</a> . Some of these tools are made by the same companies whose technologies generate such text. But few people are likely to use these detectors in the short term, and even if they do, there will be a continuous cycle of AI-based text generators constantly working to outsmart the detectors.</p><p></p><p> The net result is clear: When it comes to digital communication, we&#39;re unlikely to trust most “personal” digital messages for a while to come. This is why, in working to build authentic relationships, sidestepping technology altogether has newfound power.</p><h3> Handwritten Messages Take on New Value</h3><p> Few people answer calls from unrecognized phone numbers these days. And executives are increasingly aware that AI is also being used to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/11/why-chatgpt-ai-are-taking-over-the-cold-call-salesforce-leader.html">schedule such calls</a> , which can make them feel like just another name on a list.</p><p> In an effort to connect with decision makers, I recently tried going a different route: I wrote notes by hand to several executives and dropped them in the mail. Some of these have led to very positive personal responses and meetings, and even contract discussions. These relationships are being built on <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-on-books/author-talks-susan-mcpherson-on-building-meaningful-relationships-in-business-and-in-life">meaningful foundations</a> that could lead to long-term business growth.</p><p> There have always been people who prefer to write business notes by hand, but it&#39;s never before carried such a significant connotation — that a real person has taken the time to write out a personalized message rather than choosing an easier option. And a recent study shows how powerful that can be: Researchers from business schools at the University of Maryland and Yonsei University in South Korea found that “presenting a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10949968221102306?journalCode=jnma">handwritten note</a> has a positive and significant effect on customer spending” and that “warmth underlies the key findings.”</p><h3> Humanizing Communication</h3><p></p><p> A similar principle applies to internal communication as well. Some managers now use technology for things like employee recognition and turn to generative AI to create and send complimentary messages to team members. While this may be helpful for overwhelmed and exhausted managers, it can also reduce the sense of meaning and personalization that employees may be looking for. This is why handwritten notes can be a powerful way for managers to show employees — especially <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-create-belonging-for-remote-workers/">remote workers</a> , who aren&#39;t in the office to receive such recognition face to face — their genuine appreciation.</p><p> Writing notes by hand may not be the right move for everyone — such as if someone&#39;s penmanship is particularly difficult to read. But there are other ways to personalize communication, including creating videos or voice memos tailored to a specific individual, or even leaving a voicemail if a phone call goes unanswered. Some people block off a time in their schedule and say, “I&#39;m going to keep this two-hour block open in hopes that you might want to chat. Reach out anytime within that time frame, and I&#39;ll drop whatever I&#39;m doing.”</p><p> The key is to always be on the lookout for ways to emphasize our humanity in our communications. The more we do that, the less of an interloper AI will be in our relationships — and the more authentic and rewarding they&#39;ll become.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/amid-growing-ai-humanize-communication-to-strengthen-relationships/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
