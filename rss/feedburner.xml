<a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a>与此同时，员工越来越希望看到自己的价值观和优先事项体现在公司的运营方式中。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a>自疫情爆发以来，许多人正在重新划定工作与个人生活之间的界限，以保护自己的福祉。</p><p>这些趋势加剧了美国工人和企业领导人之间的紧张关系，导致信任逐渐削弱，关系日益紧张。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a>我们可以直接从劳动力争议的兴起中看到这一点，例如罢工和其他有关工资、工作条件、多样性、平等机会、健康和安全的争议；以及间接地通过员工脱离。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p></p><p>除了造成代价高昂的运营中断和降低工作质量之外，劳工争议和离职还给企业吸引和留住人才带来了重大挑战。此外，此类争议阻碍了公司应对网络安全、数字化和可持续发展等业务挑战的能力，这些挑战需要员工保持警惕并与员工合作。</p><p>我们对德国 50 强上市公司的分析表明，尽管长期以来一直有让员工参与公司董事会的传统，但管理层管理劳动力纠纷和促进员工敬业度的能力却各不相同。我们发现董事会的结构和组成与其有效性关系不大；相反，对于减少冲突最重要的是最高管理层和董事会领导人在多大程度上积极让员工参与关键战略决策。 （参见“研究”。）我们采访了经历过较少劳动力争议的公司的主要利益相关者。通过与一系列行业的董事会董事、首席执行官、首席财务官和员工代表的对话，我们确定了领导者用来包容员工的三种策略：确定共同目标和利益，促进包容性决策流程，并赋予员工战略责任。</p><p>这些战略促进最高管理层领导者、外部董事和员工在关键问题上的积极合作，同时促进三个群体之间的信任。 （参见“避免劳动力争议的三种策略。”） </p><div class="callout-highlight callout-highlight--transparent"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>避免劳动力争议的三项策略</h4><p class="caption">当公司关注员工和领导者的共同利益，让员工参与决策，并赋予员工与高级管理人员一起制定业务战略的责任时，他们可以提高参与度并减少劳动力争议。 </p><p style="text-align:center;"><img

class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p>采用这些战略的领导者可以更有效地解决广泛的战略问题，包括商业模式转型、重组、并购、撤资、分拆、技术采用、环境可持续性和社会问题。同时，为解决问题奠定坚实的基础，可以为员工加入管理层创造价值奠定基础。</p><p>任何地区的公司都可以利用这些好处，即使它们缺乏让员工参与决策的正式结构（例如董事会代表）。虽然研究重点是在董事会中拥有员工代表的公司，但在文章末尾，我们将解释没有这种结构的公司如何将这些策略纳入其现有的决策流程。</p><h3> 1. 确定共同目标和利益</h3><p>企业领导者常常忽视这样一个事实，即员工对公司的长期成功至关重要——毕竟，他们的生计以及未来的安全往往都依赖于公司。但我们样本中劳动力争议最少的公司认识到并利用了员工利益与组织利益之间的内在联系。这些公司的领导者努力确定共同目标，并专注于如何以解决管理层和员工担忧的方式实现这些目标。他们没有将潜在冲突视为两个对立双方之间的谈判，而是将此类情况视为需要解决的共同问题。在此过程中，他们形成了寻找解决方案的共同主人翁意识和责任感。</p><p>而且，这些公司偏离了让人力资源主管主要负责与员工沟通的传统做法。在我们研究的公司中，首席执行官和首席财务官直接与员工董事会代表接触，解释可能有争议的决策背后的理由，然后再将这些决策提交给全体董事会。阿迪达斯前首席执行官、美国和欧洲多家公司董事会董事赫伯特·海纳表示，首席执行官公开透明的沟通可以为员工提供更广泛的决策背景，并帮助他们与公司目标保持一致。</p><p>风力涡轮机制造商 Nordex 董事会主席、半导体制造商英飞凌科技公司前首席执行官沃尔夫冈·齐巴特 (Wolfgang Ziebart) 建议强调，如果董事会成员、最高管理层领导人和员工代表只关注自己集团的权利和议程，可能会产生后果。 “从长远来看，每个人都会遭受损失，”他观察到。</p><p>工业工程和钢铁制造集团蒂森克虏伯的重组工作说明了缺乏连贯的沟通策略时所产生的影响。 2019年，为了应对蒂森克虏伯竞争行业的全球变化，首席执行官玛蒂娜·梅尔茨制定了一项雄心勃勃的计划，其中包括出售电梯制造、船舶系统和钢铁三大核心业务。经过充分讨论，董事会和员工代表同意了该方案。</p><p>蒂森克虏伯在2020年以204亿美元剥离了电梯业务。随后出售钢铁部门的努力失败了。尽管管理层在两年多的时间里为钢铁和船舶部门探索了一系列选择，包括出售、政府股权合作和首次公开募股（IPO），但他们从未向董事会提出具体计划。</p><p>这种模糊性阻碍了员工代表评估和解决员工的担忧，他们的挫败感引起了董事会的共鸣。在 2023 年 3 月发给蒂森克虏伯 10 万名员工的备忘录中，员工代表批评管理层缺乏远见且浪费时间。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a>一周后，默茨辞职。四个月后，首席财务官宣布合同到期打算离职。</p><p>蒂森克虏伯的员工并没有抵制重组。相反，他们希望看到公司成功适应行业变化。他们支持最初的计划，尽管数万名工人将受到影响——仅钢铁部门就有 26,000 名工人受到影响。他们并没有撤回对这一目标的支持。管理层未能与员工沟通和参与，引发了争议。</p><p>相比之下，当金融服务提供商安联改变其核心业务模式时，公司领导者确保员工理解并被改变​​背后的原因及其时机所说服。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p>该组织各个级别的领导者都参与了沟通工作，包括业务转型和战略劳动力规划的全球负责人、安联集团在 30 个国家的公司的首席执行官以及这些公司内运营实体的领导者。他们解释了这种转变对员工意味着什么，包括在新的业务模式下当前和未来的角色会是什么样子。他们还提供了变革过程的时间表，以及具体的里程碑以及如何评估它们。</p><p></p><p>这种方法使公司领导者获得了安联董事会员工代表的重要支持，这对于成功推出重新配置的组织、产品和服务至关重要。</p><p>当公司与员工沟通并让他们参与有关敏感问题的决策时，即使一项举措没有成功，他们也会赢得他们的信任。欧洲最大的工业制造公司西门子的长期员工董事哈拉尔德·科恩 (Harald Kern) 讲述了西门子移动与飞机制造商庞巴迪之间的拟议合并。西门子的员工代表发现，快速理解管理层的意图并预测对公司及其员工的影响具有挑战性。为了帮助他们了解合并决策背后的动机，管理层利用行业分析师的见解补充了公司信息。</p><p>最终，外部因素阻碍了合并。但科恩表示，管理层对公开对话和共享资源的承诺巩固了员工对西门子领导层的信任。</p><p></p><h3> 2. 促进包容性决策过程</h3><p>企业领导者通常优先考虑结果而不是实现结果的方式。然而，我们发现，在决策时采取刻意措施将员工纳入其中的公司，所遇到的劳动力争议较少。</p><p> 2020年，西门子剥离了能源业务，该部门拥有近10万名员工，占公司销售额的40%。在关于董事会决定的初步讨论中，员工代表提出了在这种不确定情况下常见的担忧，例如潜在的工作不安全感和员工角色的变化。管理层不仅回应了这些担忧，还分享了有关能源部门面临的战略和财务挑战的信息。随着员工获得更深入的了解，他们开始将分拆视为最可行的解决方案，并且流程后期阶段发生冲突的可能性显着减少。西门子能源公司工会主席罗伯特·肯斯博克表示，“虽然存在风险，但增长机会胜过风险。” <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p>通过从一开始就让员工参与，西门子管理层不仅获得了他们的支持，而且随着计划的展开，对业务运营有了更深入的了解。员工们提出了提高效率并将节省的成本重新分配给员工培训的建议。</p><p>此外，他们建议并倡导将一家专门建造石油和燃气轮机的工厂转变为一个创新中心，专注于为使用可再生能源的工厂开发发电和输电技术。首次公开募股后，该工厂推出了开创性的创新技术，为西门子能源公司赢得了全国赞誉，并使该公司成为可再生能源行业的领导者。 <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a></p><p></p><p>在我们研究的这个案例和其他案例中，董事会的行为（从主席开始）既为员工的参与奠定了基调，也决定了员工的参与方式。一位具有重组经验的受访者表示，当董事会主席积极邀请员工批评管理计划、保持开放的心态并寻求了解他们的观点时，员工就更有可能接受、理解并有效应对重组过程中的挑战。多个行业的公司。另一位曾在多个德国董事会任职、曾任高盛国际非执行董事的受访者强调，这种做法应该得到所有股东代表的认可，而不仅仅是董事会主席。</p><p>此外，我们的采访表明，劳动力争议最少的公司的董事会主席会采取措施，确保所有员工感到舒适和受到尊重，并确保他们的贡献得到平等重视。我们的受访者指出了员工代表在董事会中占有一席之地的公司的一些有效做法，包括以下内容：</p><ul><li>按字母顺序排列董事的座位，以防止轻易识别他们各自作为股东或员工代表的角色。</li><li>或者，定期轮换席位，以便在每次董事会会议上，员工代表坐在不同的股东董事旁边。</li><li>指导新员工代表，让他们感到舒适并学习如何在董事会审议过程中保持高效。</li><li>指定股东董事作为导师，指导员工董事会技能的发展。</li></ul><p>董事会主席可能会更进一步，要求每位股东董事每三到六个月与两名员工代表共进午餐或晚餐，从而为董事会外的非正式讨论创造机会。我们采访的一位董事会主席举办节日晚宴等社交活动，以营造更具包容性的氛围。我们的采访表明，这些做法提高了董事会成员之间的社会凝聚力，否则他们自然不会花时间相互了解。</p><p>空客公司非执行董事 Stephan Gemkow 表示，当董事会承诺让员工参与关键决策时，整个决策过程就会变得更加协作。主席不是围绕由股东成员或管理层的优先事项驱动的严格议程来构建董事会活动，而是成为鼓励公开讨论、邀请不同观点并营造所有成员积极贡献的环境的促进者。 Gemkow 表示，这种方法对于发现复杂战略问题的创新解决方案是必要的，例如如何解决重组期间的裁员问题。</p><h3> 3.赋予员工战略责任</h3><p>我们的研究表明，劳动力争议较少的公司通过在正式委员会和非正式渠道赋予员工代表战略性角色和责任，努力缩小员工、领导层和股东代表之间的权力差距。</p><p>董事会委员会是行动的所在地。成员对其领域内的问题进行严格的研究和分析，与组织中的关键人物会面，并为全体董事会提出行动建议。他们有权制定董事会议程并影响其决策。</p><p>在德国公司治理框架下，董事会在任命员工代表进入委员会时拥有很大的自主权。我们发现，在董事会委员会任职的员工代表比例与公司面临的劳动力争议数量之间存在直接关系。</p><p>在过去五年没有发生过劳动力争议的公司中，董事会委员会中平均有 70% 的员工代表。相比之下，在这段时间内面临五次或更多争议的公司，董事会委员会中的员工代表平均只有 38%。此外，当除了主要关注员工或非战略事务的委员会之外，将员工代表分配到财务或技术等战略董事会委员会时，公司遇到的劳动力争议也会大大减少。</p><p>在我们的分析中得分最高且劳动力争议最少的公司包括物流提供商 DHL、电信运营商德国电信和软件制造商 SAP。在这三家公司中，绝大多数员工代表都在董事会委员会中任职：DHL 为 80%，SAP 为 89%，德国电信为 100%。除了专注的审计和人事委员会之外，他们还是财务和投资、技术和创新、战略和可持续发展等战略委员会的成员。</p><p>相比之下，大众汽车和汉莎航空是我们研究期间劳动力争议最多的公司之一。在大众汽车，只有一半的员工代表在董事会委员会任职，而在汉莎航空，这一比例为 40%。此外，在每家公司，员工代表主要在审计等战略性较低的委员会中任职。 <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p>当员工代表在数量更多、范围更广的委员会中任职时，他们会对公司的整体战略和财务要求有更深入的了解。他们不仅可以有效影响决策，还可以承担更大的执行决策的责任。</p><p>这种安排通过提高透明度和客观性来促进健康的制衡。他们还确保股东董事在考虑管理层决策时从员工那里获得有关管理层决策潜在长期影响的第一手信息。具体来说，员工代表可以提醒外部董事注意供应链中断、生产效率低下、投资积压和员工流动趋势等重大风险。</p><p>我们采访的员工和股东代表表示，当员工被赋予战略责任时，还可以帮助公司实现长期目标，例如将可持续发展融入公司系统和流程，以及保持领导层继任决策的连续性。</p><p>例如，在拜耳，员工和股东代表在监督关键绩效指标和高管薪酬（包括首席执行官）的委员会中拥有平等的代表权。员工代表影响了激励措施的纳入，以鼓励高层管理人员追求可持续发展目标。 2021年，委员会建议首席执行官20%的薪酬基于与环境、社会和治理（ESG）因素相关的六个目标的进展情况，包括为可持续农业以及全球妇女的健康和福祉提供支持，通过减排或抵消举措应对气候变化。</p><p>西门子董事会走得更远。它促进员工代表与正在考虑担任高管职位的最高管理层以下两级的经理之间的会议。这种做法使员工代表能够评估潜在未来领导者的能力和概况，评估他们与公司价值观的一致性，并为未来与他们的合作奠定基础。重要的是，这一举措向员工传达了一个强烈的信息：他们是塑造公司未来领导力的重要合作伙伴。</p><h3>让员工参与的多种方式</h3><p>公司有多种途径将员工纳入战略决策，即使他们没有正式的结构，例如董事会中的员工代表。下面，我们建议一些执行这三种策略的替代方法。</p><p><strong>委员会和工作组。</strong>包括员工和管理层在内的委员会或工作组对于实施我们的前两项战略至关重要——确定共同目标和利益以及促进包容性决策流程。当公司有一个明确的项目或问题需要解决时，例如决定一个业务部门的命运，这些小组使员工能够直接向公司领导传达他们的担忧和建议。此外，首席执行官和首席财务官还有机会阐明关键决策背后的战略和财务逻辑。</p><p>委员会应包括负责制定和实施正在讨论的计划的高级管理人员以及代表最有可能受到影响的单位的员工。员工应由同事选出，以确保他们反映与领导者决策结果密切相关的人员的观点。</p><p>理想情况下，领导者从一开始就让员工参与其中。通过这种方式，他们向整个组织展示了委员会的价值及其对包容性决策的承诺。这将表明员工正在参与游戏。</p><p><strong>与董事会成员的互动。</strong>可以邀请员工参加董事会会议或务虚会，以促进更具包容性的决策流程。这样做可以让外部董事了解他们可能无法从公司领导那里获得的观点和信息。</p><p>例如，在定期董事会会议上，关键员工可以分享他们的同事在合并后遇到的运营和文化整合问题。在特别的董事会会议或务虚会上，整个组织的员工可以分享他们对更广泛主题的见解和专业知识。例如，如果董事会开会探讨自动化机会，员工可以权衡拟议举措的实用性和适用性，并为受影响的角色推荐解决方案。</p><p><strong>员工咨询小组。</strong>员工咨询小组提供了一种赋予员工战略责任的方法。与委员会和工作组不同，顾问小组旨在长期运作。他们通常关注广泛的组织问题，包括员工对公司及其工作的感受。由于这些团体在帮助其组织应对员工的价值观、担忧和愿望方面发挥着作用，因此他们可以负责针对持续存在的问题和公司的未来方向开发和推荐解决方案。</p><p>例如，由 IT、营销和运营员工组成的数字化转型咨询小组可以持续评估人工智能等新兴技术的影响，监督数字化举措的实施，并就数字化战略提供建议，从而确保组织保持灵活性和竞争力。</p><p>同样，由来自业务领域的擅长环境合规和可持续发展实践的员工组成的咨询小组可以指导组织在这些领域的方法和举措，以确保符合 ESG 标准。</p><p>当董事会认真对待员工咨询小组的建议并将其纳入决策时，员工就会获得更大的权力，他们的观点也会融入公司的长期目标中。</p><p></p><p></p><p>我们对德国领先公司的分析表明，当董事会和公司领导者对员工对战略决策的意见持开放态度并愿意赋予他们有影响力的作用时，会带来好处。他们不仅可以更有效地解决劳动力和劳工问题，还可以通过挖掘员工对企业长期成功的兴趣，获得使他们更具弹性的见解。</p><p>员工参与委员会、工作组和员工咨询委员会以及与董事会成员的接触可以帮助公司在董事或公司领导者与其员工之间建立更牢固的关系，同时从员工为公司决策和治理带来的见解中获益。</p><p>采用这些做法的组织可以在最高层培养协作、公平和包容的决策。</p><p></p>

class="attribution">丹·佩奇/theispot.com</p></figcaption></figure><p>大型语言模型（LLM）似乎将改变企业。他们能够用简单的语言和代码对查询生成详细的、创造性的响应，这引发了一股兴奋浪潮，使得 ChatGPT 在首次推出后以比任何其他技术更快的速度覆盖 1 亿用户。随后，投资者在 2023 年上半年<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/venture-capital-funding-plunges-globally-first-half-despite-ai-frenzy-2023-07-06/">向人工智能初创公司投入了超过 400 亿美元</a>——占全球风险投资总额的 20% 以上——从种子期初创公司到科技巨头，公司都在开发该技术的新应用。</p><p>但是，虽然法学硕士非常强大，但它们生成类人文本的能力可能会导致我们错误地认为它们具有其他人类能力，从而导致技术的误用。通过更深入地了解法学硕士的工作方式及其基本局限性，管理人员可以就如何在其组织中使用法学硕士做出更明智的决策，通过互补技术和人类治理的结合来解决其缺点。</p><p></p><h3> LLM 的机制</h3><p>LLM 从根本上来说是一种机器学习模型，旨在预测单词序列中的下一个元素。早些时候，更基本的语言模型按顺序运行，根据训练数据中单词的概率分布来预测序列中的下一个单词。 （想象一下您的智能手机键盘会建议短信中的下一个单词。）但是，这些模型缺乏考虑单词出现的更大上下文及其多重含义和关联的能力。</p><p>最新的神经网络架构——Transformers——的出现标志着现代法学硕士的重大演变。 Transformer 允许神经网络同时处理大量文本，以便在单词与其出现的上下文之间建立更牢固的关系。在越来越多的文本上训练这些变压器已经导致了复杂性的飞跃，使法学硕士能够对提示产生类似人类的反应。</p><p> LLM 的这种能力取决于几个关键因素，包括模型的大小（由可训练权重的数量（称为<em>参数 ）</em>表示）、训练数据的质量和数量（由<em>标记</em>的数量定义，指的是单词或子词单元） ），以及模型可以接受作为提示的最大输入大小（称为其<em>上下文窗口大小</em>）。模型中的每个参数都封装了从训练数据推断出的关系的一些信息，因此参数数量较多的模型往往知识更丰富、更细致。 （例如，OpenAI 的 GPT-3 拥有 1750 亿个参数。）训练数据量也会显着影响模型的泛化能力，更大的数据集可以提供更多样化的语义关系和事实表示。 （GPT-3 接受了大约 5000 亿个令牌的训练。）模型可以接受的提示的大小也会影响其准确性。 （GPT-3 的上下文窗口包含 2,000 个标记。）上下文越详细，模型的预测就越准确。</p><p>为了响应提示，法学硕士利用其训练建立的关系来逐个标记地生成文本的延续。每个步骤都需要根据提供的上下文预测下一个标记的概率，并且算法根据这些概率选择标记。此选择的随机程度由模型的<em>温度</em>设置调节。较高的温度会产生更多“创造性”或不太可能的选择，而较低的温度会产生更可预测的反应。为了提高法学硕士对特定提示的反应的准确性，并限制其产生不适当、不相关或有毒反应的能力，可以通过<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/25/technology/chatgpt-rlhf-human-tutors.html">人类反馈强化学习或 RLHF 等</a>技术对预训练模型进行微调，该技术已被用于微调- 调整 ChatGPT 等模型。</p><h3>法学硕士的四个重要限制</h3><p>基于对法学硕士如何工作的理解，我们可以检查当我们将人类直觉应用于看似人类的输出时，它们可能产生的错误印象。</p><h4> 1. 推理的局限性</h4><p><strong>提示：</strong><em>根据2007年卷心菜种植者联盟的报告，收集的卷心菜中80%是重的（超过0.5公斤），10%的卷心菜是绿色的，60%是红色的，50%是大的（直径超过0.5公斤）。 10 厘米）。以下哪项陈述一定是错误的？</em></p><ol><li><em>所有的红甘蓝都不大。</em></li><li> <em>30%的红甘蓝很大。</em></li><li><em>没有既绿又大的卷心菜。</em></li><li><em>一半的卷心菜很小。</em></li></ol><p> <strong>LLM 回复：</strong><em>错误的说法是 4。一半的卷心菜很小。</em></p><p>正确的答案是陈述 1 是错误的——至少有些红甘蓝一定很大。</p><p>与他们可能给人的印象相反，法学硕士并不是为了复杂的推理而建立的。例如，研究发现 OpenAI 最先进的法学硕士 GPT-4 只能在 2.4% 的情况下正确<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/over-just-few-months-chatgpt-232905189.html">验证数字为素数</a>，在视觉模式预测方面也存在类似的弱点。其他研究表明，<a href="https://owainevans.github.io/reversal_curse.pdf">法学硕士</a>无法理解训练数据集中单词之间的关系：例如，GPT-4 可以正确回答“谁是汤姆·克鲁斯的母亲？”这个问题。 （玛丽·李·菲佛）但无法推断出“谁是玛丽·李·菲佛的儿子？”的答案。 ——模型正确回答前一类问题的正确率是 79%，而后者的正确率是 33%。</p><p>从本质上讲，法学硕士只学习<em>口头模拟</em>基本逻辑规则，但不具备将它们链接在一起以产生和验证复杂结论的技能。此外，法学硕士在多步骤逻辑推理中很容易出现错误累积，因为该模型的基本概率性质意味着每个步骤都有非零的错误机会。最后，法学硕士无法总能勾勒出得出结论的“思路链”，这使得人们很难确定错误是否发生或发生在何处。</p><p></p><p>最近由波士顿咨询集团 750 多名顾问进行的一项实地实验强调了这一限制对现实生活的影响。使用 GPT-4 的参与者在尝试解决简单的业务问题时，得到错误答案的概率比没有获得 LLM 的对照组高出 23%——因为<a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/how-people-create-and-destroy-value-with-gen-ai">GPT-4 不仅经常得到错误的答案</a>，而且提供了如此有说服力的答案其解决方案的理由是用户从表面上接受了它。</p><p></p><h4> 2. 知识或专业知识的局限性</h4><p>我们要求一位法学硕士向我们提供五篇发表在同行评审学术期刊上的关于核聚变可行性的论文，包括论文标题、发表年份和主要作者姓名。 LLM返回了五个结果，其中两个是新闻文章，不是同行评审的论文，一个是一篇不存在的论文。</p><p>法学硕士的知识由其培训数据决定。如果数据缺乏特定的领域知识，没有特定概念的实例不足或不采取最新情况，那么LLM可能会响应提示而浮出水面。同样，LLM可能会重现培训数据中存在的错误。最后，这些模型可以通过“幻觉”陈述中不在培训数据中创建错误。负责ChatGpt的研究人员为各种癌症病例生成治疗计划，发现<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-generates-error-filled-cancer-treatment-plans-study-2023-8">LLMS的回答中有三分之一包含不正确的信息</a>- 通常与正确的适应症混合在一起，并以一种使外行者难以确定什么方式表达是准确的。在另一个备受瞩目的例子中，两名律师及其公司在提交了Chatgpt在法院申请中产生的<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/23/two-us-lawyers-fined-submitting-fake-court-citations-chatgpt">假引用</a>后被罚款：LLM幻觉了六个法律案件，包括司法意见和行情。</p><p>最后，知识的局限性也可能导致缺乏一致性，而LLM在矛盾的举止上对不同时间点的同一提示做出了响应。例如，爱荷华州的教育工作者使用Chatgpt来确定<a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/iowa-chatgpt-book-ban/">学校图书馆的书籍适当性</a>，以遵守一项新的州法律。他们为LLM提供了所有图书馆书籍的列表，并要求它指出包含违反法律的内容的内容，从而导致图书馆删除了19个标题。但是，当记者后来询问Chatgpt时，这表明其中只有4个包含与法律不一致的内容。</p><h4> 3.理解的局限</h4><p><strong>提示：</strong><em>蓝色盒子里有一个苹果。蓝色盒子里还有一个红色盒子。红色盒子上有一个盖子。我该如何获得苹果？</em></p><p> <strong>LLM响应：</strong><em>要从盒子中检索Apple，您可以按照以下步骤操作：</em></p><ol><li><em>打开红色盒子的盖子：由于红色盒子在蓝色盒子内部并且上面有一个盖子，因此您需要先打开红色盒子的盖子。</em></li><li><em>从蓝色框中卸下红色盒子：一旦打开红色盒子的盖子，您就可以从蓝色框中取出整个红色盒子。</em></li><li><em>打开红色框：从蓝色框中删除红色框后，您可以打开红色框以访问其内容。</em></li><li><em>取回苹果：最后，您可以在红色盒子内伸出来，然后取出苹果。</em></li></ol><p> Chatgpt未能理解Apple不在红色框中。</p><p> LLM可能无法“理解”它的提示。缺乏足够的背景，它可能会使它动摇，并且其输出可能会变得脱节或不连贯。<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02312">研究人员分析了Chatgpt对在线软件工程论坛堆栈溢出的500多个人类提取的问题的回答</a>。他们发现，该模型的响应中有52％是不准确的，其中一半以上是由于Chatgpt而导致的一半错误不了解问题的概念或细节，或者关注问题的错误部分。这意味着，当用户缺乏足够的问题来提供良好提示时，LLM甚至可能不会有所帮助。</p><h4> 4.计划和执行的局限性</h4><p>LLM可以为请求的任务输出明确的分步指南，从而给人以一种模型可以计划实用解决方案的印象。但是，鉴于LLMS的推理能力有限和对任务的有限理解，建议的行动可能是不切实际的或天真的。例如，当被要求制定<a href="https://fortune.com/recommends/mortgages/i-used-chatgpt-as-my-financial-planner/">为房屋所有权节省的</a>计划时，Chatgpt提供了一些扎实的财务建议，但没有考虑到收入或利率转移的潜在变化。此外，它不考虑人类的谬误：既不质疑目标的现实主义，也不质疑用户的信念，而是要意识到他们的确切支出习惯。</p><p>对于企业，所有这些限制都会破坏可靠性；不能确定LLM提供的信息是完整的，相关的，可行的或真实的。鉴于这些限制，LLM当然不能指望做出关键决定或自动执行计划。但是，委派平凡的任务似乎仍然很吸引人 - 例如，涉及与现有IT服务的程序交互的人，例如Web浏览和刮擦，或社交媒体监视和消息传递。的确，Auto-GPT是由GPT-4提供支持的开源应用程序，该应用程序将LLM输出融合在一起以自主执行用户设定的目标 - 使爱好者能够创建许多令人印象深刻的自动化示范，包括 <a href="https://lifehacker.com/you-can-try-auto-gpt-the-next-generation-of-chatgpt-r-1850343691">对产品进行研究</a>，编码网页编码网页或应用程序，甚至<a href="https://dataconomy.com/2023/04/19/best-autogpt-examples-use-cases/">订购披萨</a>。但是，AI研究员吉姆·范（Jim Fan）建议，工作演示<a href="https://twitter.com/DrJimFan/status/1647616587199815684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1647616587199815684%7Ctwgr%5E53a5539ffd940932a855d641438099af4aa992a5%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2023%2F04%2F22%2Fwhat-is-auto-gpt-and-why-does-it-matter%2F">“大量挑选了樱桃”</a> - 对自主代理的研究表明，在现实的环境中，它们的<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.13854.pdf">成功率仅约为10％</a> 。</p><h3>克服限制</h3><p>与其仅仅将LLMS的应用程序限制为不适用其限制或错误并不关键的常规案例（例如为进一步考虑生成新产品创意），还应考虑其所有实施情况，考虑到局限人类的监督和其他技术。</p><p>将人类保持在循环中至关重要，因为企业将LLM集成到其运营中。这应该包括验证AI生成的输出，以增强技术对技术的信心。它也可以扩展到让专家将业务问题转化为AI的提示，并通过适当地量身定制上下文和细微差别来确保模型提供的信息足够。</p><p>除了考虑如何制定人类和人工智能的最佳系统外，企业还应探索可以解决LLM局限性的补充技术。在这个快速发展的空间中，正在不断进行新的创新，这有望增强技术的能力，因此不断更新您的理解也是至关重要的。</p><p>例如，为了增强<em>推理</em>能力，研究人员正在<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.07697.pdf">通过推理引擎探索扩大LLM</a> ，这些引擎将特定于领域的信息编码为代表专业概念与事实之间关系的<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.01157.pdf">知识图</a>。研究人员还正在培训专业模型，以评估提示和LLM输出中的前提之间的逻辑连贯性。为了增强<em>知识</em>和<em>专业知识</em>，正在对特定领域的数据库进行培训，例如<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-can-help-doctors-and-hurt-patients/">Google和DeepMind的Med-Palm模型</a>，该模型已显示出在美国医疗许可考试上的表现明显超过了通用的LLM。通过<a href="https://github.com/opendilab/awesome-RLHF">从人类专家收集的反馈意见，</a>可以通过加强学习来提高LLM的可靠性。 LLM还可以通过编程来提出澄清后续问题，然后再提供答案，从而提高他们对用户初始提示的理解。</p><p></p><p></p><p> LLMS近乎全世界适用性的承诺意味着，企业对探索这项强大的新技术感到兴奋。但是，这些模型的产生类似人类文本输出的不可思议的能力很容易使我们归因于它们所没有的功能。对他们的局限性的正确理解应指导其实施的方式和背景。</p><p>企业在涉及逻辑推理，事实很重要，可复制性或赌注很高的领域应特别警惕。在这些情况下，公司需要使用互补技术来探索，以解决LLM的局限性（例如知识图，推理引擎和专业领域模型），并确保有适当的人类投入和监督。</p><p></p>

已经获得了半百万的观看次数。</p><p>他在早上的大部分时间里都从一组软件工程师那里进行了问题，他们发现与目前的薪水相似的角色类似于在工作现场上市的角色，而他的营销领导团队来回探讨了新仪表板上的数字是否或旧电子表格正确。就在午餐前，他的女儿给他发短信：“爸爸。你最近看过你的玻璃门吗？”她用诸如“我无法确定管理层是愚蠢，罪犯或只是犯罪愚蠢的评论”之类的评论屏幕截图了他的公司的糟糕评级。”</p><p></p><p>到他踩踏公司自助餐厅时，弗兰克已经有一个星期的痛苦。而且只是中午。</p><p>欢迎来到一个超透明世界中的领导力。弗兰克是虚构的，但他的挑战是真实的。 HoaryCliché是真实的：今天的信息以光速流动……它的移动太快了，许多领导人都无法抓住它。无论是社交媒体渠道使公司肮脏的洗衣店公开（甚至显示“干净的内衣”信息 - 不是丑闻，但并非打算广泛看到），还是内部技术系统将一系列脱皮数据扔到未经准备的人的屏幕上，以解释它自工作世界黎明以来，技术正在有意义地侵蚀了信息优势的信息。</p><h3>再见，水冷酷者抱怨； Hello Quittok</h3><p>知识就是力量 - 今天，每个人似乎都拥有它。</p><p>不幸的是，在微观和宏观尺度上<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/why-pay-transparency-regulations-are-a-strategic-management-opportunity/">，有关工资，裁员或多样性（裁员或多样性）以及业务绩效指标等劳动力问题</a>的信息有更多的信息，这意味着普通的工人受到了更糟糕或至少不舒服的袭击。对于领导者和员工而言，这促使艰难的对话产生了有意义的压力来源：我一遍又一遍地听到客户的消息，即使是经验丰富的领导者也经常难以进行这些具有挑战性当他们开始时。</p><p>如今，领导者的行动立即以书面形式和大规模的内部和外部平台进行讨论。仅内部消息传递应用程序即可拥有<em>每秒</em>发送的300,000条消息，每天有1.45亿人登录Microsoft团队，进行类似的讨论。每月<a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">有1500</a>万人使用公司反馈平台Glassdoor，而LinkedIn上有7.74亿人来谈论工作。截至2022年4月，人们对#quittok主题标签标记的社交媒体<a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">内容</a>被认为是令人震惊的4100万次<a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">。3</a>对战略领导决策的反应被限制在一些水冷却器的日子里，已经消失了。</p><p></p><p>那么，在一个可以感觉到每个人都知道一切并一直在谈论的世界中，领导者如何保持理智和有效？组织可以做些什么来确保适当的信号在噪音的刺耳上弹出，并且噪音不会从自上而下挑战他们所使用的每个人的福祉？</p><p></p><h3>领导者的四种实用策略</h3><p>这是一个超透明世界的四个通往理智和清晰度的途径。</p><p> <strong>1.通过拨打正确的组织诚实来减轻领导者的负担。</strong>陷入困难的对话似乎不可能 - 但是，一个客户最近对我照亮了一个简单的策略：“当我们更诚实时，我们的领导者更容易。这样，他们只是不必进行那么多艰难的对话。”这个声明有这样的真相。如果人们无论如何都会看到特定情况的现实，那么从跳跃中沟通这一现实意味着在面对团队时，各个领导者不必争先恐后地和背部。</p><p>现在，这是否需要将每种情况的每个细节传达给每个受众？绝对不。这意味着将每个沟通的框架从“我们希望人们相信的是什么？”中改变框架？要“在这种情况下，人们需要做出明智的决定的基本事实和背景是什么？”这改变了信息级联的性质。</p><p>在旧模型中，领导者将配备一组静态的消息，该组织认为该消息将不受干扰地传播到团队的手中，并毫无疑问地（或至少有礼貌）采取行动。在新模型中，该组织更加专注于为一系列新兴事实建立背景 - 隐含的理解是，具有挑战性甚至矛盾的信息可能会通过未被禁止。该目标从强加一组想法转变为创建讨论，该讨论即使存在分歧或信息正在发展，也可以最大程度地减少人际摩擦并最大化生产行动。</p><p> <strong>2.基于“一个世界”基础进行交流 - 结束内部/外部区别。</strong>人们经常说，我们生活在环境崩溃的世界中，在这些世界中，信息通过看似截然不同的沟通圈立即传播，而这些沟通圈本来会脱节或至少在过去的时间段。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p>领导者曾经有奢侈的内部交流，然后将信息在周到的进步中选择外部数字。今天，一旦发生了什么事情，他们就可以合理地假设它将在各种各样的受众中在内部和外部闻名。为了解决这一现实，许多组织已合并了内部和外部通信功能，或者迄今迄今派往外部集中的通信部门，以确保与内部利益相关者的消息传递一致。以统一的方式塑造通信不仅会在泄漏的世界中创造稳定的消息传递，而且通常提高了内部通信工作的标准 - 因为内部消息的压力与向外界发布的声明相同的严格测试。</p><p>即使组织没有相应地重组其通信功能，各个领导者也可以努力确保他们的消息传递在内部和外部受众中保持一致。尽管有价值的练习，但这可能是一个微妙的平衡行为：领导者面临模仿社交媒体帖子的语言，同时又抚养他们的同事和主管，以确保发布足够的信息以满足奇怪的内部利益相关者的需求。</p><p> <strong>3.关于基本沟通技巧的“回到未来”，但增加了21世纪的情商。</strong>尽管超透明的世界是许多快速发展的技术的产物，但在这种情况下，最终的领导力超级大国是一个明显的低技术：能够说话或写一个简单，清晰的句子。就像在拥挤的城镇广场上聊天的钟声一样，具有出色基本沟通能力的领导者在通过噪音中听到自己的声音就更好了。在刺激迅速而疯狂（例如通过社交媒体或内部聊天渠道）进行刺激的情况下，尤其需要口头交流，并且信息可能从某种程度上到完全不准确。我们需要大喊“冻结！”的能力。并让所有人停下来思考。</p><p></p><p>从历史上看，途中被允许下摆，笑话或大肆宣传的领导者会因当代沟通流的强力而迅速淹没自己 - 无论这些流是真实的还是对业务进步的帮助。所有的话，事实和逻辑本身是不够的。一句句子是以往任何时候（经典的写作指南，<cite>风格的元素</cite>在100多年之后都很好），但是科学已经教会了我们有关人们如何吸收信息的大量知识。例如，触发情感反应的信息更有可能在社交媒体上重新发布，从而使其常常更快，更广泛地散发。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5名</a>被教导要冷静和无情地交流的领导人可能会发现他们的信息不会像同龄人更情绪化的陈述那样快。</p><p>在一个超透明世界中，我们甚至可能想研究神经科学的发现，即警告我们，将理性和情感思维分开是一种错误的二分法，因此，我们应该停止尝试制作完全无情感的领导力信息。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p> <strong>4.建立您的判断力肌肉和您的团队。</strong>让我们考虑到世界和工作场所的透明本质只会从现在开始增加。在这样的环境中，您有能力快速，明智地决定如何处理一条信息（您的判断）成为生存和成功的关键工具。领导者将自己想自觉地从事这项技能，但是鉴于他们不能一直在一组倍增的对话中进行，因此他们还希望他们的团队能够更好地判断。我几年前与我合作的一家银行开始为前线工人提供与历史上为高级管理人员保留的一些相同的领导力发展机会，这是基于这样的理由，即有了更多的信息，这些工人将做出同样的类型曾经做过许多步骤的呼叫。</p><p>即使您不在周围时，也能够信任您的团队做正确的事情，即使面对奇怪而矛盾的信息，也有巨大的价值。在这方面，练习场景规划是一个有用的工具，即使对于那些可能没有天生强烈的判断力来到桌子的团队成员也是如此。对于团队来说，练习评估信息的真实性以做出更好的决定也可能会有所帮助。在一个生成AI的世界中，这是一项关键技能。</p><p></p><p></p><p>当领导者手头有一些实用的策略时，在超透明世界中领导不必感觉像通过一条矛盾，不完整且经常充满情感的信息通过小行星驾驶摇摇欲坠的航天器。我们有时可能会有弗兰克早晨的版本，但是我们也可以有弗兰克的下午 - 在那里他清理日历，开始专注于与合适的人在他的公司及其他地区进行正确的讨论。</p><p>六个月后，有人在社交媒体频道上发布了有关弗兰克公司的信息：“管理并不完美，但他们试图说实话，我完全感谢。他们真的在努力做正确的事情，您每天都可以看到它。”</p><p>弗兰克喜欢并分享信息。</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/leading-in-the-the--age-og-of-exploding-transparency/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>为未来的工作构建神经多样性人才管道</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/building-the-neurodoverity-talent-pipeline-pipeline-futor-the-future-fork/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/building-the-neurodoverity-talent-pipeline-pipeline-future-the-future-fork/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 28 Nov 2023 12:00:27 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Maureen Dunne. <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maureen-n-dunne-ph-d-a2609a45/details/experience/">莫琳·邓恩（Maureen Dunne）</a>博士是全球认可的神经多样性专家，也是伊利诺伊州社区学院受托人协会的前主席，这是美国第三大社区学院财团。她是即将出版<cite>的《神经多样性边缘：拥抱自闭症，ADHD，阅读障碍和其他神经系统差异的基本指南》</cite>的作者（Wiley，2024）。</p> ]]>; </dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Neurodiversity]]></category><category><![CDATA[Talent Acquisition & Management]]></category><category><![CDATA[Diversity & Inclusion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Talent Management]]></category><category><![CDATA[Workplace, Teams, & Culture]]></category><description><![CDATA[Carolyn Geason-Beissel/MIT SMR &#124; Getty Images During recent economic policy updates, Jerome Powell, chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, announced that the American labor market is suffering from a structural labor shortage.

人口变量，例如人口老龄化和提前退休，由于19009年大流行而导致的许多工人的悲惨损失或持续的缺席以及移民的历史下降等等，但现在数量太大了忽略。去年年底，每个可用的工人大约有两个职位空缺，将劳动差距扩大到约1000万工人。政治经济学家<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/09/20/american-post-pandemic-labor-shortage-explained/">尼古拉斯·埃伯斯塔特（Nicholas Eberstadt）以这种方式对其进行了核心</a>：“是的，美国有一个抑郁级的工作问题。”</p><p>同时， <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/20/-neurodivergent-workers-help-companies-meet-the-demand-for-talent.html">目前估计有30％至40％的神经变性成年人失业</a>。受过大学教育的自闭症患者的失业率可能<a href="https://www.benefitnews.com/news/how-to-create-equitable-workplace-experiences-for-autistic-talent">高达85％</a> 。今天，美国估计有5000万人， <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/diversity-inclusion/inclusivity-minute/2022/neurodiversity">全球人口的15％至20％</a>属于今天的神经脱落伞。</p><p></p><p>神经多样性范式倡导一种基于优势的理解方法，包括和评估具有认知类型的神经差异的个体，例如自闭症，注意力缺陷/多动障碍，阅读障碍，衰弱障碍，副局局，亲切性和失调症。太多的神经差异人正在裂缝中掉下来。这种失败不仅是道德问题。在高等教育，我们的工作场所和我们的社区中，成功和真实的神经多样性途径的匮乏具有切实的影响，并阻碍了各地组织的成功。由于如此多的工作空缺以及许多可能未实现的候选人，这些失衡的理论双赢解决方案肯定值得探索。</p><h3>认知多样性和明天的工作场所</h3><p>利用神经厌恶的人的潜力可以帮助雇主建立更具未来的劳动力。创造力，横向（或非线性）思维，解决问题的逆向工程，复杂的视觉空间技能，系统思维，直观的见解，超焦点和多感官模式识别 - 神经差异候选者可能会变得越来越重要的不同领域 - 所有这些都变得越来越重要，因为它们都变得越来越重要人工智能将自己嵌入我们的日常生活中。</p><p>神经化的领导人已经在包括军队在内的每个行业都占据了顶级职位，尽管许多人不愿透露其地位。有足够的证据表明，在有效且合适的工作环境中，这些相同的人可以在一系列职位上表现出色，甚至比其神经型同龄人更好。根据摩根大通（JPMorgan Chase）的自闭症工作计划负责人詹姆斯·马奥尼（James Mahoney）的说法，一项内部研究发现，自闭症员工（正确入职） <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/behavioral-competencies/global-and-cultural-effectiveness/pages/viewpoint-how-to-become-a-champion-for-employees-with-autism.aspx">的生产率比在同一职位上雇用的神经型同伴高出140％</a> 。</p><p></p><p>没有两个神经化的人是一样的，鉴于不同的人表现出自己的独特优势和挑战，重视各种思想的丰富性和多样性很重要。也就是说，越来越多的证据表明，不同的不同神经型和罕见的技能之间存在相关性，例如增强的创新能力或创新的意识。众多研究的结果表明，神经认知与增强的创造力和创新思维呈正相关，并且自闭症患者比一般人群更容易出现认知偏见，而<a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/autistic-people-challenge-preconceived-ideas-about-rationality">在做出理性决策方面更加一致</a>。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a>这些独特的观点和技能本质上对雇主在个人层面上有价值，同时提供了额外的群体级别价值作为对集体思维的关键对冲。</p><p></p><h3>社区大学人才管道</h3><p>很大一部分神经异常的人开始了在社区大学的高等教育之旅；一项2015年的一项研究发现，在自闭症上学的人中，有多达80％的人参加了一所社区大学。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a>将神经差异带入商业经济的努力应开始或至少与这些机构合作，并可能是改变神经多样性友好的就业机会途径的游戏规则改变者。</p><p>鉴于美国最高法院最近对<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-outlawing-collegiate-affirmative-action-will-impact-corporate-america/">大学录取决定的多样性</a>裁决所定的基调，这可能是尤其如此的，该裁决剥夺了精英大学生机构的多样性。致力于这样一种观念的公司，各种多样性都是无价的资产，可能需要更具创造性地思考可以找到多样性的地方。</p><p>然后，负担依靠社区大学的学生扩大机会途径。在担任伊利诺伊州社区学院受托人协会主席期间，我们希望激励社区学院，地方和地区经济发展组织和雇主之间的合作。全州工作委员会的第一个未来，旨在促进与雇主的直接行业合作伙伴关系，以为学生，社区和企业创造新的机会途径，并促进有关新兴行业和职业的对话。</p><h3>与行业建造桥梁</h3><p>英镑，社区大学系统是我们生产合格候选人的最有效方法，以满足教育系统最终用户的需求：公司经济。但是，只有在从一开始就培养和维持的神经多样性友好的机会途径，雇主才能利用该人才池的全部深度和广度。</p><p>社区大学已经充当满足当地雇主需求的强大合作伙伴。如果他们提供诸如心理健康支持，专业辅导，时间管理工具，执行功能指导以及同伴导航员等环绕式支持，神经厌恶的学生将更有可能在学位完成和随后的工作中浏览学位的道路。</p><p>学徒制，付费实习和与社区雇主的工作障碍机会在弥合赚取技能和成功就业之间的差距中起着关键作用。许多社区学院提供了“赚钱和学习”模式的学徒制，例如杜佩奇学院的项目雇用学徒计划，雇主在这里支付学生的学费，以帮助他们在开发新技能的同时学习新技能工作经验在相关角色中工作。</p><p></p><p>鉴于神经化的人在该领域工作，网络安全为此类计划的目标行业提供了一个很好的例子。根据美国劳工统计局的，信息安全分析师职位预计将从<a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/information-security-analysts.htm">2022年到2030年增长32％</a> 。全国各地的社区学院，包括芝加哥城市学院和拿骚社区学院，提供了更多负担得起的网络安全证书计划，该计划将候选人定位在当地需求的职业道路上。基于能力的教育，例如刘易斯和克拉克社区学院的焊接技术计划，代表了一个同样有吸引力的框架，可以为有不同需求的学习者提供灵活的选择，通过技能掌握铺平了赚取的学分的途径。</p><p>神经多样性运动提高了人们对神经异常求职者的才能的认识，并在上学教育和工业之间发展了更强大的协作计划。例如，彭博社报道说，美国情报服务已开始寻找<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-18/people-on-the-autism-spectrum-may-be-ideal-for-some-ai-work#xj4y7vzkg">神经化社区</a>，以增强他们的机器学习和网络安全实践。目睹<a href="https://businesschief.com/human-capital/top-7-companies-hiring-and-nurturing-neurodiverse-talent">EY，JPMORGAN，MICROSOFT</a>和其他备受瞩目的公司之后，完全不同行业的公司遵循诉讼，利用了优先考虑多样性的优势。</p><p>这些努力提供了路线图。行业合作伙伴，经济发展协会和社区大学之间的合作，这些社区学院利用神经多样性友好的环绕式支持计划，学徒制，付费实习和造成工作范围的计划代表了劳动力市场生态系统中的一项新功能。通过依靠这一趋势，我们有机会培养了一条准备工作的神经化的人才管道，能够对合格候选人的外观挑战过时的，无效的假设。</p><h3>在办公的地方</h3><p>为了真正利用神经化的人才库，工作安置协调员和雇主必须实施正确的流程。在雇主方面，人力资源部门应审查招聘和招聘实践，并强调包容性。他们还应努力进一步将同事和管理层的入职策略制度化，以促进对如何支持神经运动团队的更深入的了解。</p><p>从实际层面上讲，这可能需要在入职期间为神经差异人员提供指导 - 提供明确的成功指标，避免歧义，并允许普遍访问噪声遇到的耳机以及其他适应性的工具和实践。此外，在熟悉的环境中，一些神经差异的人的生产力要高得多，因此证明对混合或远程工作场所协议的开放性可能表明对他们的需求更加接受态度。</p><p></p><p>但是，当组织文化未能接受心理安全，信任，反欺凌政策和明确的沟通标准时，这些步骤几乎没有影响。换句话说，无论您有多少阳光和水，花园都不会在有毒的土壤中生长。赌注很高，对于愿意接受真实的神经多样性包容和归属感的前瞻性组织而言，收益可能是巨大的。但是，化妆品的努力不会产生任何影响。</p><p>通过打击刻板印象；允许灵活的结果驱动的工作安排；并促进热情的组织文化，在人们不需要掩盖其认知差异的情况下，我们可以开始集体利用神经多样性劳动力的全部潜力。</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/building-the-neurodrovesity-talent-pipeline-pipeline-futor-the-future-of-work/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>数据科学中连接器角色的兴起</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-rise-of-connector-roles-in-data-science/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-rise-of-connector-roles-in-data-science/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 27 Nov 2023 12:00:38 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Thomas C.

Even for those that succeed, progress is often slow and expensive.为什么？ Organizational gaps between teams are wreaking havoc with the ability to develop, apply, and scale data science projects. A new type of role is needed to bridge these gaps.</p><p> Let&#39;s not minimize the many aspects of data science that can trip a company up — from defining the right business problem to developing a solution and then supporting it properly. However, our diagnosis of the situation, researched in part with our colleagues Roger Hoerl and Diego Kuonen, shows that many companies struggle less with the solution and more with the organizational issues.</p><p></p><p> We&#39;ve identified three root causes for this. First, data science has been <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/06/your-data-strategy-needs-to-include-everyone">“bolted on” to the organizational chart</a> . This might have been acceptable a generation ago, when data science was reserved for relatively few problems, but it needs to be built in now that data science matters to every team.</p><p> Second, data science aims to improve day-to-day operations and decision-making, and that means disruption. But most line managers strive for control, predictability, and no surprises. Given that disruption and control are polar opposites, there is a far greater-than-normal tension between line management and data science.</p><p> Third, many companies seem to expect data scientists to do it all: magically understand the business and all its nuances, deal with data quality issues, and convince recalcitrant managers and staff members to change their long-cherished processes. Many data scientists prefer to simply create better algorithms, which means those other tasks often receive short shrift.</p><p> There is no minimizing these issues — they are deep, structural, and often political and may well demand additional management strategies. Here, we will address one critical aspect of the organizational problem, namely the gaps between the various departments that inhibit the development and deployment of data science models.</p><h3> Closing the Gaps With Connectors</h3><p> The obvious way to close organizational gaps is to fill them with people. We generically call people in these roles <em>connectors</em> . For some time, companies have assigned people who have job titles such as systems analyst, business analyst, coverage officer, and systems engineer to close gaps between business and technical departments. They&#39;ve also tried to close gaps that crop up in data science projects, labeling the people tasked with doing so data wranglers, data engineers, purple people, and translators.</p><p> While many such efforts have helped move data science projects along, it often feels like an elaborate game of whack-a-mole: Close one gap, and another pops up. Also, these efforts alone don&#39;t resolve some of the related issues:</p><ul><li> Line managers and data scientists often don&#39;t understand each other. This makes it particularly difficult for both parties to agree on the problem to be solved and for data scientists to obtain and understand the nuance in needed data.</li><li> Implementing a model requires extensive changes within the business: redesigned processes, training on how the models work, and upskilling to run them.</li><li> The two sides might not see eye to eye on IT infrastructure decisions, such as those related to technical debt.</li></ul><p> For those reasons, we recommend that companies approach the issue in a more disciplined manner, following these three steps.</p><p> <strong>1. Define the data science project process and identify the people involved.</strong> While the specifics might vary, the process should start with framing the problem and understanding the business context and end with monitoring/updating the new model in production. The critical work: identifying who, outside the data science team, must be involved in each step.</p><p> For example, when framing the problem and selecting a project, companies want to involve both senior leaders and middle managers whose teams will be affected. When it&#39;s time to obtain and prepare data, business domain experts who understand the data nuances and IT professionals who prepare data should be in the room. When developing the model, external software providers should be consulted. When it&#39;s time to insert the model into processes, business and process analysts, managers of the affected processes, trainers, and change professionals should all be involved. Finally, as an organization deploys the model into the IT infrastructure and then monitors and updates it, IT professionals, people building the data pipes, and supply chain managers should contribute.</p><p> <strong>2. Evaluate where connectors can help.</strong> Essentially, this step aims to clarify the gaps. Ask, “Are all of the people involved fully connected — that is, do they understand their roles, and is there sufficient communication such that work gets done in a reasonably effective manner?”</p><p> We find that most often the answer is “no.” Indeed, we find that connectors are often essential in the following ways:</p><ul><li> Framing the problem to be solved with data science: For example, executives might have heard some of the hype surrounding AI but lack a deep enough understanding of what problems it can help solve, or the technology&#39;s potential across the organization.</li><li> Translating between business and technical people — an age-old gap that has yet to be closed.</li><li> Dealing with data quality issues.</li><li> Communicating requirements, progress, and issues within the team — in other words, tying the many pieces of a data science project together and being the connector between diverse teams.</li><li> Keeping track of progress toward the overall goal of deployment and organizational change when nobody else sees the big picture.</li></ul><p> <strong>3. Clarify specific roles for connectors and put them in place.</strong> This step is generally straightforward for individual projects. We recommend that companies also consider having connectors between the entire data science program and the rest of the business. There is a <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/to-succeed-with-data-science-first-build-the-bridge/">natural tension</a> between line managers, who work hard to establish a measure of control in their everyday work, and data science professionals, who aim to disrupt things.</p><p></p><p> Left unchecked, this tension makes it extremely difficult for a data science team to establish itself within a company. Connectors at the program level aim to ease this tension: They help senior business leaders understand both the potential and challenges of data science, help data science leaders understand the top problems facing the business, and establish a portfolio of data science projects that aligns with business需要。</p><p></p><h3> What Companies Are Trying Now</h3><p> Given that building the organizational capabilities to succeed with data is so important, we are delighted to see companies experimenting and enjoying success with a wide range of connector roles. For example, Regions Bank and many other organizations make use of data product managers, who take an end-to-end perspective. Forty percent of organizations now take a data product management approach, according to a recent <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/data/cdo-report/">survey of chief data officers</a> .</p><p> Gulf Bank in Kuwait has created a network of data ambassadors to lead quality and data science projects at the department level. The Federal Statistical Office of Switzerland employs a “data science bridge” to coordinate its many statistical functions. Kroger&#39;s data science subsidiary, 84.51º, has a set of what it calls solution design consultants — people with business backgrounds who mediate between data scientists and business stakeholders. (84.51º refers to the longitudinal location of the subsidiary&#39;s Cincinnati office, and like early purveyors of longitude maps, the company makes sense of complex data problems.) Kroger&#39;s 84.51º also uses technology in the form of machine learning operations tools to monitor the status of data science projects from inception to ongoing management and keep all parties informed. Many other organizations have also adopted such connector roles and tools.</p><p> Let&#39;s examine the work at Regions Bank and the Federal Statistical Office of Switzerland in more detail.</p><h4> Data Product Partners at Regions Bank</h4><p> Manav Misra, chief data and analytics officer of Regions Bank, observed that many data science projects were not being successfully implemented, so he established the concept of <em>data products</em> and the new connector role of <em>data product partner</em> to manage them.</p><p> Misra defines a data product as an end-to-end software solution to a problem that the business has. “A data product leverages data and advanced analytics heavily in order to deliver that solution,” he said. Data product partners function as both data product managers and partners with the business who bring products to fruition and manage them over time.</p><p> Each data product partner is assigned to a particular business or support unit of the bank and attends staff meetings with their business partners in order to better understand their priorities. Most partners come from the business side of the bank, though some also have analytics backgrounds.</p><p> The job of the data product partner includes understanding what the business unit and end users need and starting the development cycle with a minimum viable product. During the early stages of the process, data product partners serve as bidirectional translators, connecting the opportunities of analytics and AI with business needs. At the later stages, they are responsible for assessing how the complete solution is adopted and used, monitoring how well the user interface is working, keeping track of how many people use it, and ensuring that the product delivers or exceeds the value promised in the original business case.</p><h4> The Data Science Bridge in Switzerland</h4><p> The Federal Statistical Office in Switzerland recognized that it needed to improve its core data science processes if it was to meet the growing needs of the Swiss government, so it created a data science competence center, a type of center of excellence. To make sure the competence center was fully connected to the rest of the Swiss government, leaders staffed a “data science bridge” — a group of connectors specifically charged with <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-data-science-management-process/">managing six high-level processes</a> :</p><ul><li> Driving collaboration.</li><li> Developing human capital.</li><li> Ensuring data quality.</li><li> Managing the project portfolio.</li><li> Ensuring a positive business impact.</li><li> Ensuring a human-centric and trustworthy application of data science.</li></ul><p> The bridge is paying real dividends. It has facilitated communities of practice in the customer base, helping people become more effective users of data tools and reports and encouraging them to exchange their experience with data science and AI, based on a common language and understanding. The bridge is reducing chaos in the six processes listed above.</p><p> Moreover, “most important decisions are taken on the bridge,” noted Kuonen, who serves as an adviser to the Swiss government on data science. (Kuonen is also head of Statoo Consulting, a Switzerland-based consultancy, and professor of data science at the Geneva School of Economics and Management at the University of Geneva.) Kuonen believes that the bridge will deliver more value as it matures.</p><h3> Connector Management Challenges: Five Questions to Ask</h3><p> Despite the apparent advantages of connectors, managing them presents some tough issues. In some respects, connectors operate in “white space” in the org chart, where management is always tough. For example, companies have not had much luck managing data stewards as they seek to align the definitions of various data elements across a company.</p><p> Companies should think through the following questions as they define their connector roles. The answers will vary by organizational circumstance, but some patterns are beginning to emerge.</p><p></p><p> <strong>1. Where should connectors sit, organizationally?</strong> Most commonly, connectors sit under the chief data and analytics officer or the data science organization, but they are sometimes found in business-side groups. If the company has been successful at matrix management for other roles, connectors could report to both areas.</p><p> <strong>2. How should companies attract, evaluate, and retain connectors?</strong> As data expert <a href="https://tdan.com/how-to-find-the-right-tweener-for-your-organization/31029">Theresa Kushner has pointed out</a> , connector roles are challenging, given that they require knowledge of both the business and data, as well as considerable soft skills. There are now several hundred analytics and data science degree programs in business schools, which are a good place to recruit connectors. Organizations putting together a team of connectors often ask business leaders to evaluate candidates for such roles; Procter &amp; Gamble, for example, asked leaders to identify one “breakthrough business result” that each candidate helped to achieve. Retention will depend in large part on offering these hires a viable career path.</p><p> <strong>3. What is the connector career path?</strong> Experienced technical people may very well recognize the need for connectors but fear that if they take such a role, they will lose their technical edge. Experienced business people might not want to fall off their current career path within their business unit or function. In the short run, companies should establish roles of increasing responsibility in the data science organization, such as senior and well-compensated data product managers. We believe that in the long run, many organizations will want every senior executive to have data science experience in their background.</p><p> <strong>4. Is more than one type of connector needed?</strong> Since some connecting is performed at very high levels, while other connecting is focused on the detailed technical level, the logical answer is “yes.” But a company might not be able to afford to hire more than one for a project, so some companies are asking data product managers to play a lower-level connector role as well. Other organizations ask connectors to play their roles across two or more projects at once.</p><p> <strong>5. What exactly are a connector&#39;s responsibilities?</strong> Since connectors might have the best overall view of a project, it is common to charge them with managing it end to end (as in the role of data product manager). This is appropriate if connectors are experienced and if they understand and value the technical roles on a data science project. If they don&#39;t, their connector responsibilities should be more circumscribed, such as translator roles that don&#39;t involve end-to-end responsibility for project success.</p><p> More detailed answers to these questions will emerge for your organization over time.</p><p></p><p> In our work with companies that have successfully employed connector roles, the software vendors and data science leaders involved have told us that the deployment percentage of data science projects has increased as connectors have proliferated. We believe that this is an important and ongoing set of roles that needs further institutionalization in almost every large company. Otherwise, data science might become a dismal science with a low deployment percentage and a poor record of improving business performance.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-rise-of-connector-roles-in-data-science/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Ask Sanyin: How Can I Convince Myself I Belong in Leadership?</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ask-sanyin-how-can-i-convince-myself-i-belong-in-leadership/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ask-sanyin-how-can-i-convince-myself-i-belong-in-leadership/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 22 Nov 2023 12:00:10 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sanyin Siang. <p>Sanyin Siang is a CEO coach and leads the Fuqua/Coach K Center on Leadership &amp; Ethics (COLE) at Duke University.需要建议吗？ Send an <a href="mailto:asksanyin@mit.edu">email to Sanyin</a> .</p> ]]>; </dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Leadership Advice]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership Development]]></category><category><![CDATA[Managerial Psychology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Team Dynamics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership Skills]]></category><category><![CDATA[Managing Your Career]]></category><description><![CDATA[Dan Pinnolis/MIT SMR &#124; Getty Images I have just moved up to an executive job, and while I know I’m ready, I don’t feel very confident in front of my team.

I was the first in my family to go to college and still carry the feeling of having to prove I belong, even though I have a track record of accomplishments at this company. How do I tamp down the impostor syndrome and feel like a leader?</p><p> Don&#39;t beat yourself up for experiencing impostor syndrome. Some self-doubt is normal when taking on a more senior role. Instead of trying to banish it, you can transform it into something powerful as you build new relationships with your team members.</p><p> Impostor syndrome is seen as concern about our capabilities, but I think that concern arises from whether we feel that we belong in a particular space. Insecurity about being seen, included, and accepted is a relational issue that others on your team likely also feel at times.</p><p></p><p> One of the best antidotes for impostor syndrome, especially for someone in a leadership position, is to build a sense of belonging and community. By creating connection and fostering inclusion for others, we can also create a greater sense of belonging and confidence for ourselves. There are three practices that managers can use to increase inclusion and inspire confidence among their team members.</p><p> <strong>Acknowledge contributions.</strong> It can take courage for people to speak up in meetings. But when we fail to adequately recognize the speaker, or adopt their idea without giving credit, they might leave the meeting feeling unheard or unappreciated. Make a habit of acknowledging people in the moment: “That&#39;s a new idea — thank you,” or “To build on Tom&#39;s idea … ,” for instance. Managers can and must create an atmosphere where team members feel their contributions are welcome.</p><p> <strong>Make good introductions.</strong> Build a sense of belonging by introducing people with some comments about their strengths, expertise, and history. Good introductions help others know the role the person plays and the value they bring, but they also reinforce the person&#39;s sense of self and confirm their ownership of their responsibilities. As a leader, it can be especially meaningful to introduce members of your team in this way to people outside the company. It shows respect for them and confirms that they matter.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Emphasize superpowers.</strong> I believe everyone has one inimitable and intrinsic gift — their superpower — and it&#39;s important to acknowledge a person&#39;s superpower when you see it in practice. These abilities are often invisible, undiscovered, or minimized by the individual. Many of us don&#39;t recognize them in ourselves until a perceptive leader or colleague points them out. Helping employees see their gifts can quiet the inner voices telling them they don&#39;t belong.</p><p> The leaders who experience impostor syndrome most acutely are often those who came to the role from less privileged backgrounds, have followed a nontraditional path, or are from underrepresented demographic groups. Those experiences can build our awareness of our own vulnerability and an understanding of the limits of what we&#39;re able to control on our own — that is, humility. Add genuine empathy for team members to those qualities, and guess what: You possess the traits of the kind of leader who can be most effective in these challenging times. And you&#39;ll be embraced for your leadership by your team.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ask-sanyin-how-can-i-convince-myself-i-belong-in-leadership/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Diversity Nudges</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/diversity-nudges/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/diversity-nudges/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 18:00:29 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Paola Cecchi-Dimeglio. <p>Paola Cecchi-Dimeglio ( <a href="https://twitter.com/hlspaola">@hlspaola</a> ) is the faculty chair of the Executive Leadership Research Initiative for Women and Minority Attorneys and a senior research fellow at the Center for the Legal Profession at Harvard Law School.

These interventions are often small, easy to implement, and inexpensive, but when they are applied to choices, processes, and organizational levers in the attraction, recruitment, onboarding of people and along the employee path cycle, they can help make a workplace more diverse和包容性。</p><p></p><h3> Nudges That Attract Diverse Talent</h3><p> The conversion rates (CRs) at one e-commerce giant were below target within certain segments of shoppers, including lower-income people of color and middle-income LGBTQIA+ people. Meanwhile, the company&#39;s primary competitor had successfully hired more women, Black and Latine people, Pacific Islanders, and LGBTQIA+ persons in marketing, behavioral analysis, and other roles, and their diverse perspectives were translating into higher CRs.</p><p> The company launched a major campaign to attract diverse talent. It engaged a search firm that cast a national net and ran print and digital ads that highlighted the company&#39;s commitment to diversity and inclusion. Then leadership sat back and waited for those diverse candidates to appear. Views of the online job posting peaked around three and a half weeks after the advertising blitz but flatlined by the seventh week. Fewer than 11% of site visitors applied for a position. Only three applicants were interviewed; two received offers, one of which was declined. In other words, if you build it — with impressive resources and at great expense — they still might not come.</p><p> As this company discovered, it is not enough to simply gain the attention of the potential candidates you seek to attract. Converting appropriate talent to applicants and candidates requires additional outreach and cultivation. Individuals from underrepresented demographics — including people of color, those who identify as LGBTQIA+, and people with disabilities — often have fewer contacts at competitive employers and know fewer people who can help them navigate the application process. Organizations that want to increase diversity can attract more candidates from underrepresented groups by using nudges — modifications in the language and content presented in the talent acquisition process — in ways that help generate a diverse candidate pool, maintain the pool throughout the process, encourage top candidates to accept job offers, and help keep them onboard.</p><p></p><p> Nudges can help build trust and reduce information asymmetries early on. In one such intervention, a company displayed the numbers of women and underrepresented individuals among its leadership, as well as its diversity and inclusion goals and a timeline, beside an online job posting. A video at the bottom right of the screen featured the CEO speaking about his commitment to inclusion and diversity. This intervention increased the percentage of women and underrepresented groups that applied by 22% in the short term and 18% over the long term. Candidates from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds rose by 17% overall. And, importantly, the conversion rate from applying for a job to accepting a position rose by 8 percentage points.</p><p> Nudges that enhance familiarity with a potential employer can help maintain the applicant pool throughout the process. For example, even if the job seeker does not personally know someone at the company, facilitating a connection can make the company more attractive. One online experiment randomly allocated 1,276 applicants to one of four conditions after they had submitted applications and before they had heard from the company:</p><ul><li> Applicants were given the opportunity to ask questions of women employed at the company while their application was in process.</li><li> Applicants were given the opportunity to ask questions of men employed at the company while their application was in process.</li><li> Applicants were given the opportunity to ask questions of a group that comprised one male employee and one female employee.</li><li> Applicants were not given the opportunity to ask questions of any employees.</li></ul><p> When women could ask questions of women employed at the company, those candidates performed better during their interviews than under any other condition. Their scores as assessed by interviewers increased by 34%. These same candidates were also more satisfied with the application process and the company&#39;s image. And those who did not receive a job offer were more likely to reapply within the next 24 months.</p><p> Along similar lines, in an online experiment at a tech firm, I randomly allocated 1,478 applicants to one of several conditions after they had submitted their applications and before they had heard from the company. Some applicants were assigned a fellow job seeker as a buddy with whom they could practice the required tasks if they were selected for an interview; some were not. Of those applicants assigned buddies, some women were paired with women, some women were paired with men, and some men were paired with men.</p><p> Job seekers who were partnered with a buddy after applying experienced a 40% higher interview selection rate; the impact was particularly notable among underrepresented groups and for junior positions. Women who were paired with men received interview scores that were 9% higher than in other conditions. Candidates participating in the buddy system were more satisfied with the process, even if they were not selected for an interview or if they were interviewed but not offered a position. This increase in satisfaction was 28% for women and 29% for men.</p><p> Having a friend or acquaintance in the industry can reduce the trepidation felt by people who are seeking employment in areas that have traditionally excluded them. These candidates are seeking information: “What is it like?我应该穿什么？ How should I prepare? What should I say or not say?如果什么 …？” Knowing takes away much of the fear, and potential employers can fill that information gap by recognizing this condition and intervening to redesign the dynamic. Balancing the exchange with information that candidates are seeking mends the divide and engenders trust. Information provided by a potential employer lets candidates decide whether the company is a good fit, whether they can see themselves working there, and whether they will be embraced by the organization.</p><p> Consider the transport and logistics industry, for instance, which is overwhelmingly male-dominated. Closing such a wide gender gap requires creativity. One company that sought to hire more women took photographs of each woman employed at the company. It then graphically illustrated the gender gap by placing the women&#39;s pictures adjacent to a blank space that represented the additional women required to close the gender parity gap. The date by which the organization wanted to hire enough women to fill in the empty space was also included in the illustration.</p><p> Not only did the company display the image and text on its website, but it also talked to all of the relevant search and recruitment firms and launched a major campaign aimed at getting women to apply. Over six months, the efforts produced a 30% increase in female applicants, including more women from underrepresented groups.</p><p> The design of job applications can also affect the number of candidates who apply. Small things like requesting information related to gender and race on applications have proved significant in previous experiments and interventions, but the placement of these requests can either repulse or attract candidates. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p> A company study that involved 320 applicants sought to determine the impact of collecting gender information at the beginning of the application, at the end, and not at all. Where gender identity was requested at the end, 7% more women completed the application than in the other two conditions.</p><p></p><h3> Nudges for Recruiting Diverse Talent</h3><p> Dropping demographic indicators from CVs can allow unbiased assessment of the candidate. At one global company, applicants were directed to enter their CVs in an online portal, which made the look, feel, and format identical for everyone. All of the reviewers saw the same thing, and all indicators of race and gender were removed. The stripped data included names, affiliations, volunteer activities associated with a religious or cultural group, hobbies, language skills, or connections to special advocacy or community organizations.</p><p> The removal of such data reduced the likelihood of bias and made job experience the primary focus of the hiring teams. Candidates were also asked to describe their workplace results and contributions. This neutral format focused the assessment process and increased the pool of underrepresented groups, in both Europe and the United States, by roughly 40% within 18 months. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a></p><p> Applying similar principles during a consulting engagement with a tech company, we used AI voice alteration to mask gender. Candidates used a tool called Gap Jumper to solve skill-based challenges without disclosing their gender, as well as a voice modulation device to anonymize gender and ethnic or racial background. The resulting increase in job offers was almost 16% for women and 18% for members of underrepresented racial groups.</p><p> After a fair and neutral process has been designed, it is still necessary to make a hiring decision. When practicing the art of hiring, a useful strategy is to change the question from “Whom should we include?” to “Whom should we exclude?” In this case, rather than struggling with criteria that indicate who should be chosen, decision makers determine who should be excluded and, from that, are able to identify a smaller group of the strongest candidates. Although this approach might seem counterintuitive in the context of seeking to be more inclusive, it forces decision makers to focus closely on core qualifications and exclude candidates who do not meet them.</p><h3> Nudges for Onboarding Diverse Talent</h3><p> At a global financial services company with multiple offices in the New York City area, several partners were celebrating the hiring of eight new staff members. The group was diverse in gender, race, and age — a mix of millennials, Gen Xers, and a baby boomer.</p><p> The millennials seemed to have no trouble finding their footing, and the Gen Xers were familiar with the organization and had many colleagues who were already part of their network. But the onboarding process didn&#39;t welcome and assimilate Carlton, a Black man in his late 50s hired at the executive level, like it had the seven others. Although he was impressively talented and skilled, Carlton had diminished access to information, and it impacted several of his assigned projects. In less than 18 months, shortly after his first performance review, he left the company for a competitor. His departure measurably damaged the company. In the short term, the cost of replacing him would range between $1.5 million and $1.75 million. In the long term, his assessment of the company as a place of employment would negatively resonate throughout his network.</p><p> The data has found a link between individuals leaving an organization after 12 to 24 months and their onboarding experience — a correlation that stands out more than any other factor in the life of the employee at the company. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> In short, get onboarding right or pay the price.</p><p> An effective onboarding process ensures that new hires are brought fully and inclusively into the organization. Small modifications enable new hires to better navigate this process and access the information and services that can help them integrate comfortably and become productive.</p><p> Like new immigrants, new employees seek information about the norms, policies, politics, and behaviors that will help them function successfully in the new setting. New hires require clarity regarding roles and expectations. They want background information about the company. They want to know how to thrive, what it takes to excel and get promoted, and what it takes to master their jobs. They also want to know what constitutes a high standard and where they should aim.</p><p> One large professional services firm nudged its onboarding process by sending a series of short videos featuring the CEO, some board members, and some members of the executive team to candidates as soon as they received job offers. These three-minute videos were aligned with company strategy and were sent each day for 15 days. They were paired with messaging about the company&#39;s commitment to diversity, what it felt like to be part of the company, what to expect if you were to make a mistake as part of a team, and how people were expected to handle such an occurrence. The videos also discussed what it meant to have equal opportunities to succeed.</p><p> In another variation, the new hires were assigned to a work project for a large client right away. The data showed that the 15 videos plus the assignment to a large project upfront resulted in improved performance among women and individuals from underrepresented groups because the interventions increased job clarity. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p> In the banking industry, an effective onboarding nudge featured stakeholder meetings at two weeks, three months, six months, nine months, and 12 months. In the meetings, the hires heard from people who had been at the organization for at least five years, who discussed problems the new employees had encountered during onboarding, how they had overcome those challenges, and their perceptions of the company as they moved through the 12-month process.</p><p> A variation of that approach used intervals of six months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months, during which stakeholder meetings took place every six weeks. The result was a higher retention rate for women and underrepresented groups 48 months after hiring.</p><p> One of the important elements of onboarding is the opportunity to create and structure one&#39;s network. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> The network brings with it access to information and opportunities for mentorship. It sets a social-emotional tone and influences how at ease a new hire will feel in the job.</p><p> One intervention at a financial institution hinged on sharing with new hires a list of 10 people that they were encouraged but not required to contact within 12 months. Each list included a mix of employees, some of whom were at the executive level. Some of the newcomers received an explanation of why they should reach out to the people on their lists, while others did not. And some participants in the experiment received email reminders to contact the people on the list at three months, six months, and nine months.</p><p></p><p> Individuals were selected for inclusion on a given new hire&#39;s list based on information that had been captured during the recruitment process. If an employee had expressed interest in a particular business unit, the list included a partner from that area. The list might also include leaders or HR contacts from cities or regions where the new hire&#39;s close family members lived. If the employee needed to relocate to take care of a parent or other family member, that essential information had already been provided.</p><p> Individuals from underrepresented groups who received a contact list, an explanation of why they should make contact, and email reminders performed better in their jobs. There was an acceleration in their network spread, which was measured along their lifetime at the company. Even 72 months later, people who had received all three elements of the intervention were still expanding their network faster than those who had not received all three elements of the intervention. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p> A large company with many offices discovered that the onboarding process at its smaller workplaces seemed more effective. People felt more integrated, and their networks were established faster than in the large offices. In contrast, at the larger sites, new lateral hires were not mixing across generations and were not building their networks.</p><p> In response, the company applied a nudge that involved the cafeteria. Employees were assigned plate colors based on the number of years they had been at the company. New people were assigned a blue plate, employees who were six months into a role got a yellow plate, and other employees had green plates. Once a week, when people dined together, people with the same color plates could not sit together. Color mixing created interaction among employees who would otherwise be invisible to one another.</p><p> The strategy made onboarding easy because people were creating new networks. The intervention led to a 34% shift in the degree of directness characterizing an individual&#39;s connections within the network. It also produced an 18% increase in “betweenness centrality,” a metric quantifying an individual&#39;s role in passing information within the network.</p><p></p><p> Throughout my research, consulting, writing, and experimentation, 10 points along the career trajectory stand out as places where specific kinds of nudges and interventions can support the goal of building and sustaining a diverse workforce. In addition to attracting, recruiting, and onboarding candidates, diversity nudges can be applied to skill-building, avoiding office drudgery, flexibility and well-being, pay equality, origination and credit, feedback and promotion, and networking and sponsorship.</p><p> To benefit an organization and become part of a company&#39;s strategic advantage, women, people of color, and individuals from other underrepresented groups must be intentionally welcomed, integrated fully into the organization, and sustained. This process should be data-driven, harnessing the potential of big data and AI to achieve sustainable inclusion. They must be purposely supplied with the same or equalizing information, connections, skills, projects, and support that are provided to others within the organization. Inequalities must be recognized, and intervening actions must be devised to nudge these conditions in a manner that creates equality and inclusivity. The companies that win at diversity are the ones that design processes that are advantageous to and level the playing field for everyone.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/diversity-nudges/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Micro Utility With Gen AI: Shopify&#39;s Miqdad Jaffer</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/micro-utility-with-gen-ai-shopifys-miqdad-jaffer/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/micro-utility-with-gen-ai-shopifys-miqdad-jaffer/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 12:00:41 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. <p>Sam Ransbotham ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ransbotham">@ransbotham</a> ) is a professor in the information systems department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College, as well as guest editor for <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> &#39;s Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy Big Ideas initiative.

Find out on today&#39;s episode.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I&#39;m Miqdad Jaffer from Shopify, and you&#39;re listening to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> .</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Welcome to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> , a podcast on artificial intelligence in business. Each episode, we introduce you to someone innovating with AI. I&#39;m Sam Ransbotham, professor of analytics at Boston College. I&#39;m also the AI and business strategy guest editor at <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> .</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And I&#39;m Shervin Khodabandeh, senior partner with BCG and one of the leaders of our AI business. Together, <cite>MIT SMR</cite> and BCG have been researching and publishing on AI since 2017, interviewing hundreds of practitioners and surveying thousands of companies on what it takes to build and to deploy and scale AI capabilities and really transform the way organizations operate.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Hi, everyone. Today Shervin and I are pleased to be joined by Miqdad Jaffer, director of product at Shopify. Miqdad, thanks for taking the time to talk with us.让我们开始吧。</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Thanks for having me. I&#39;m happy to be here and excited to talk a little bit about AI.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Great. We all use Shopify, but we may not know it. Can you give us a brief overview of Shopify and tell us what a director of product actually does?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Sure. So Shopify is a platform for entrepreneurs to be able to set up their storefronts online. You may have seen Shopify whenever you&#39;re going to purchase an item from a retailer. You may have gone to the checkout and seen that purple Shop Pay button, and for many of us, that&#39;s probably where you&#39;ve been exposed to Shopify. It&#39;s a way for an entrepreneur to be able to set up their storefront on the internet and for … you as a buyer to be able to transact in the fastest, simplest way possible to be able to make sure that the item arrives at your door.</p><p> In other cases, you may have seen Shopify on a platform like Shop.ai, where you might have searched for a specific event that you&#39;re putting together, a specific product that you&#39;re looking for, and tried to filter it all down across the many merchants on Shopify.</p><p> A merchant would go into Shopify and log in. There is a product section on the left, as an example. They would go into the product section, they would click “Add a new product,” and then within “Add a new product,” there is space for a title, description, and some other fields.</p><p> In terms of my role, my responsibilities are, how do we think about AI and how can it fit into that realm of entrepreneurship, and what can we do to accelerate our merchants&#39; success and progress as they build up their storefronts, sell their products, and grow as entrepreneurs?</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So how does that involve artificial intelligence? I hear a lot of “e-commerce,” I hear a lot of “connecting,” but how does that involve artificial intelligence?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Yeah, it&#39;s a great question. I think that when people are looking to start as an entrepreneur, there&#39;s a lot to it, so there are considerations of “What&#39;s the right product? What&#39;s the right price? What&#39;s the right placement? What&#39;s the right promotion? How do I set up everything with my storefront? How do I maintain what &#39;good&#39; looks like as I grow and as I advance?” What we&#39;ve seen is that AI is an opportunity to make entrepreneurship accessible for everyone.</p><p> With every business unit, we wanted to utilize AI to create more efficiency, from managing administrative tasks to supporting business operations. Administrative tasks can be as simple as creating a new product description [or] figuring out what the right subject line for an email could be. And then, the business operation side of it could be just about everything from understanding the business, figuring out the analytics of it, what questions should I ask, what&#39;s the strategy that I should employ? And we view AI as a powerful assistant that can weave itself in and out of that process.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What you&#39;re saying is, Shopify is letting the entrepreneurs focus on the actual product and their brand and all of that kind of stuff but then have Shopify be a platform for how they take that to market, how they want their brand to appear, and a lot of the back-end operations. Obviously, AI could be quite prevalent across all of those. Was AI embedded from day one as it launched?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> We&#39;ve had AI in its most traditional sense embedded since early days. We did things along the lines of fraud detection, where a transaction comes in — and it&#39;s not as easy to tell whether this is fraudulent or nonfraudulent. We&#39;ve done basic classification models to be able to determine whether something <em>is</em> fraudulent and then provide a score back to the merchant in a reasonable fashion. That&#39;s been in there from the start.</p><p> Then generative AI comes along, and there are opportunities to be able to do a lot more, and what we&#39;ve seen is, we&#39;ve created a suite of products called Shopify Magic. And the idea behind this was, how do we embed this directly into the workflows that our merchants are having to go through, and how do we make that easier to start, run, and grow your business?</p><p> We did things like Autowrite, where we can create a description for a product, create a blog, create a new page, help with the subject line of an email, create the body of an email, and look at ways, on the customer service side, to be able to provide responses for a merchant as they interact with their customer. So those are some of the early stages, but we&#39;re trying to accelerate it even more these days.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> A lot of companies are thinking about generative AI, and it seems like you&#39;ve been <em>doing</em> it for quite some time. Can you comment a bit on when you started thinking about it, prepping for it, and, I would assume, to some extent, redirecting or upscaling or reskilling some of your technical folks to be able to actually take these things to market.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I&#39;ll give you a little bit of the genesis of how we kind of started with the first thing and accelerated it even more. We have some general themes that come up every year in terms of things that we should be looking at, and one of the ones that&#39;s usually pretty prevalent on there is [that] staying on the cutting edge of technology is critical. What we want to do is try to bring as much of the latest technology into the hands of our merchants so they have every advantage possible.</p><p> And we&#39;ve always tried to do things with AI, and one of the more recent ones, even before generative AI, was product classification — so the idea of being able to determine the category of a product using its text as well as its image to be able to figure out where this belongs. It helps in channels. It helps you basically market to a wider audience and get a reasonable taxonomy set.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> When ChatGPT came out, the question was, what can we do with this technology to put it in front of merchants? And this was one where we wanted to lean in for a couple reasons. One, it&#39;s important to get this in the hands of merchants as fast as possible, staying with the cutting edge of the technology side. And the other part of it was, we actually saw that there was utility for the first time, and that utility was important to get out there and to see whether our merchants would use it and what we could learn from it.</p><p> So we started with a simple path of “What&#39;s the thing that merchants are struggling with?” And we saw them struggling with product descriptions daily. There&#39;s billions of them across Shopify, and we saw that as a wide space to work in, and we had all of the conditions around what would make a good product description. And then we felt “OK, let&#39;s get this in and see how people use it and see whether this is something that&#39;s palatable.”</p><p> So we quickly spun up a team, and we relied upon a couple different principles. Shopify generally builds off of a set of principles and allows the team to go fast. Some of the principles we worked off of were, this has to be easy, this has to be integrated into their workflow, and the merchant needs to be able to have final say as to what goes out there to represent their business.</p><p> It&#39;s a simple start. We said, “OK, let&#39;s figure out what the rules of a good product description are.应该多长？ What&#39;s the tone it should be used in? What are the types of words that will be used, and what makes it really good?” We did the basic thing of prompting against that and then said, “OK, what additional context should the merchant provide, and what should we look for to be able to help them?”</p><p> And so we said, “OK, well, they can probably list out a couple keywords about their product, and that fits into the realm of knowledge <em>they</em> know about, and the rest of it should be us. Like, this should be as simple as like pressing a button. It should feel like magic.” So apropos to that, we named it Shopify Magic, and we wanted to stick with that. All a merchant has to do is they enter a couple keywords, they pick a tone of voice, and they press “Generate.”就是这样。 That was the first version. We tried to ship that real quick and see what would happen, and the feedback we got was, “This is amazing. Can you do this everywhere?”</p><p> So it&#39;s like, “OK, so there&#39;s, there&#39;s some positivity here. So, what can we do next?” And so we added a “special instructions” field, and initially in our trials, we were doing things like “Add a quote from a famous celebrity that would relate to my product,” just as, like, a meme for how to try it 。 And then we saw merchants using it in different ways.</p><p> We saw them using it for language, and this was an interesting one. We introduced the ability to support eight languages, and we saw people writing translations with it, and that was expected, but it was interesting to see. And I think one of the most interesting ones we saw was, there were merchants that didn&#39;t speak English and wanted to sell to an English audience and saw product descriptions as a way to bridge that gap — unexpected, but at the same time, it&#39;s one of those things where you put the product in the hands of the user and then the user decides what they&#39;re going to use it for. And it was remarkable to see that we opened up entrepreneurship for even a small window more of people than were there previously.</p><p> And that&#39;s what kind of got the ball rolling on the AI efforts. After that, it was every team wanted a piece, every team wanted to do something, and we accelerated it in every way we could. We&#39;ve tried to systematize things from a UX [user experience] perspective; whenever a merchant sees something, they know that this is what that&#39;s going to do. And we&#39;ve also tried to look into building Sidekick, which is a first-of-its-kind AI-enabled assistant, purpose-built for commerce. And so that&#39;s kind of been the journey that we&#39;ve gone into. We have dedicated teams that are working on specific features, and then we have the entire company that is looking at opportunities of where AI can accelerate commerce.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So when Shervin and I first heard about what you were doing, I think what kind of got us excited was how pervasive this is. The effect of something like Shopify integrating artificial intelligence into its tool is huge. And I think we were talking earlier, you had talked about introducing this product in February [2023]. This is very early on in the generative [AI] days.</p><p> A lot of people are investigating generative, but this was an exciting story where you&#39;re using these tools in production very quickly. I&#39;m sure that was a little bit painful — maybe you could speak a little bit about any of the pain or difficulty you had; maybe other people have learned from that, but also at how pervasive it is. Both of those are interesting ways that people can learn from what you&#39;ve done.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Yeah. Early days came with the challenges, but I think that that&#39;s kind of the fun of it. It was interesting because this was the latest technology. There was so much utility to it, and we just wanted to get that in the hands of our users. Along the way we had to figure out things like, how do you do evaluation? What is this prompting stuff? How do you systematize this and make this make sense? What&#39;s all this RAG stuff about — RAG being <em>retrieval augmented generation</em> ? How do I bring more data into this context of a prompt, and how do I make this make sense?</p><p> And the crazy part was, every week, a months&#39; or a years&#39; worth of other technology time passes, and all of a sudden there&#39;s a new thing to try and a new thing to explore, and we didn&#39;t want to miss that ， 任何一个。 Every time something new came out, we tried, we explored. And I think that the culture at Shopify is one of exploration and one of crafters and builders. And what we tried to do is put this in the hands of people that could build, and to try things. And we also did things internally to encourage the use of AI, and we built our own kind of internal ChatGPT instance equivalent. We have it for our internal wikis for search and discovery. And what we&#39;ve tried to do is just make this into the fabric of the company.这是正常的。这是预期的。 And then, all of the risks and challenges that come with it — hallucinatory included — are things that people are familiar with. And once we got them familiar with it, then we figured out ways to work around it and to embrace it in some cases, too.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I think that&#39;s a very important point you&#39;re making because as I reflect back on my own experience and BCG&#39;s experience in this field, we&#39;re working with many companies, and many of them have the same mindset and ambition as you&#39;ve described and are putting solutions in production and are embracing it. And then there are some that are, I would say, quite reserved about this. And some of that is based on, I would say, some unfounded fears.</p><p> I mean, the reality is this is new technology and it comes with a lot of risk, and maybe a little bit more risk than traditional AI because of how pervasive it can become. But I think the mentality of waiting for all of the risks to be figured out by other people then puts you at somewhat of a huge disadvantage, because the only way, as you describe — I mean, I love how you said it — the only way to actually get ahead of these things is to start experimenting with it and getting comfortable with it.</p><p> I&#39;m sure at the board level there were some risks and some concerns. Maybe just comment on what many people thought back then versus what the reality was and put it in perspective for some of our listeners so that they understand that these risks can be mitigated versus you just stay away forever.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Yeah. One of the first things I&#39;ll say is that I want to describe who an entrepreneur is, to even put this into context. Every entrepreneur I have ever come across has the highest risk tolerance of anyone I&#39;ve ever met. They are willing to drop everything in their life to start a business, and sometimes they don&#39;t know anything except that they want to start a business. And these people are inherently risk tolerant, so our user group is very different than others. And obviously, you&#39;re going to get a spectrum of tolerances across that user base, but by nature, this is a group that is willing to dive in, take risks, and try things. And then one of the things that we observed was that they were already using it. So we already had merchants that were using ChatGPT or whatever was out there, to be able to prompt it, figure out alternatives, and use it directly into their software.</p><p> We did a brief round of research where we asked a number of merchants: Is this something that you know about? How have you used it?你用它做什么？ And many of them were like, “Yeah. Well, I mean, I just ask it everything, and so I&#39;m just getting to figure it out.” And we already saw that happening. So for us it was, “All right. Well, we already have this risk-tolerant merchant base, and the biggest concerns that we have are typically on two vectors.”</p><p> Vector one is a fear of losing control. So asking questions along the lines of “What&#39;s it going to say? What do I do if it hallucinates? Is this going to be right for me? Is it going to speak to my buyer?” So all of those initial questions and that fear of losing control was easily mitigated. So we said, “OK. Well, here&#39;s a quick fear. How do we mitigate this fear?” And we mitigate a fear of losing control by putting the control back in the hands of the user.</p><p> So the carte blanche principle was “The AI will never write without user intervention,” and so the merchant will always be able to see what the message is that&#39;s going to go out there. So all of the hallucination risk, all of the “What&#39;s it going to do?” risk is gone because now it puts control right back in the hands of the user.</p><p> The second risk is around whether it&#39;s factually accurate or not, and that&#39;s typically one that a lot of people come across. The way that we&#39;ve tried to manage that is, the person that knows the most is the person selling the product. The thing that they know the most about is their product, and that&#39;s what they&#39;re trying to talk about, and they&#39;re trying to talk about <em>their</em> brand. And so that one didn&#39;t feel as risky for us either because it was going to be up to the merchant to decide how they were going to be represented in a factual way.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> You talk about this in such a matter-of-fact way, but when you think about the actual key word here, it&#39;s the <em>user</em> , which is actually, when you think about it, Sam, a lot of our work around human and AI versus just human alone or AI alone. Thanks for talking about that. That&#39;s very key.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> One of the things I really like, too, is you keep using the word <em>utility</em> . A lot of the examples that Shervin and I talk about, we&#39;ll ask people for an example, and they&#39;ll bring out some AI-heavy application that they&#39;ve implemented that crosses lots of parts of their organization and it&#39;s a big deal, and those are great. But the utility you&#39;re talking about seems like micro utility. And so, what I mean by that is that, as you mentioned, people may have already been going out to some large language model and generating some text and then pasting it into Shopify.</p><p> Your incremental utility here was saving them some back and forth between those two tools, but also then incrementally making it work better within your tools and within your context. And I think that&#39;s exciting, when you think about how all those tiny pieces multiply by the billions. And that&#39;s a different story than what Shervin and I see sometimes, which is, “We have a big system which has a big utility, and there may be not so many users of it.”</p><p> I want to come back to something that you mentioned earlier — and maybe I just picked up on your tone of it — but you were talking about fraud detection and these somewhat traditional uses of artificial intelligence. That feels like an oxymoron now, but you said, “Oh, yeah. We&#39;re using it for fraud. We&#39;re using it for back-end business optimization and these sorts of things.耶耶耶。 We do all that stuff, but here&#39;s the really cool stuff.” It seems really exciting that you&#39;re able to stay forward.下一步是什么？</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> It&#39;s a great question. I think the hope for us is that we want AI to lower the barrier of entry for entrepreneurship, period. And I think the idea for us is, let&#39;s look at everything that&#39;s on the space. So we did something relatively recently about image generation. And we saw this as “OK, well, we can lean in here, too. There&#39;s different modes of operating that we can play with.” So we release the Hugging Face pipeline, and the idea behind this was “Let&#39;s put this out into the market, let&#39;s see how people are going to use it, and let&#39;s do it in a way that&#39;s going to be innocuous.”</p><p> The idea behind it is you upload a product image, and then you pick what background needs to be switched out. And some of this, there&#39;s some fun stuff behind the scenes of uplift, upscaling the image, figuring out the right mask for it, making sure that the reflections and shadows are going to be good, and then generating all sorts of backgrounds that make sense in the vein of commerce. And what we see from this is the ability to explore in a different way. What we&#39;ve tried to do with AI, and to your point about the risk tolerance of our user base, it&#39;s not meant to be something that is just disruptive to their existing workflows. Many of them — especially established ones — have existing workflows where they do everything in their specific way, and that&#39;s what works for them.</p><p> All we&#39;re doing is, for anyone that needs that extra push or needs that extra piece, there&#39;s a button to click, a way to invoke this, and it is their choice to make on that. And, Shervin, I like some of the stuff that you were talking about in terms of putting the user in place, and our adage has always been that this is meant to be something that augments and isn&#39;t a replacement. So this is always going to be something that helps a user be the best version of themselves.</p><p> And with image generation, we see the opportunity for them to holistically change their storefront if they want to. If they have a Thanksgiving sale coming up and they want to be able to change all the backgrounds to be fall themed, it&#39;s a quick, easy move for them to do. Their product stays at the forefront, their branding stays at the forefront, but they can merchandise just for the specific event — if it&#39;s Thanksgiving, if it&#39;s Christmas, if it&#39;s New Year&#39;s, whatever it might be. Something that would require additional photo shoots might be a lot easier to achieve now than [it was] previously.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Exactly. Let&#39;s just remember how complex and unnecessarily process-oriented something like this would have been, you know, a few years back, where you have just agreeing on the background and the photoshoot and the look and feel and impact on brand and all of that, and now you&#39;re putting it all in the hands of the merchant.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> For us, it was really important that many people across Shopify were using this, asking the right questions, pushing the boundaries, and understanding some of the nomenclature around it. When I say “hallucination,” I can almost guarantee that 99% of Shopify knows what that means and how that happens and [how] that works. And that makes the conversation much different every time you go toward product development, because it&#39;s not bringing it up and relitigating it every single time. It&#39;s people trying a solution around the normal problems that come up with this technology.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> If I squint, I kind of see something developing over this market of artificial intelligence. You alluded to it with the ease of transfer learning. You&#39;re able to take these existing models and augment them slightly, and I see that as an improvement over the past decade from “Oh, yeah.当然。 You can download these tools and build them yourselves” to “Hey, no, you can take what we&#39;ve done and what we&#39;ve trained our GPUs and burned up our GPUs on and incrementally burn up a little GPU on your own but then move forward.” I think that&#39;s a dynamic that&#39;s happening in this market here.</p><p> But let me go darker here and talk about another dynamic. Is there, let&#39;s say, a race toward mediocrity? And I think that&#39;s a little charged way of saying it, but if all of your users in Shopify are using the same tools to generate the same sort of product descriptions, isn&#39;t that going to lead to a sort of vanilla feeling of all product descriptions? How do we push back and get beyond that? It&#39;s great that we get everybody to mediocre well; how do we get people distinctive? Where do we build off of that? How do we make that beyond mediocre?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Yeah. The problem you&#39;re talking about is a local maxima, effectively, right? So everyone moves toward this standard, simplistic, homogeneous, boring thing. And what we&#39;ve looked at is that all of the tools that we provide will get you started. The idea is not to be “This is the finish line.” The finish line is the merchant. The finish line is their product. The finish line is their brand and being able to represent accordingly. For many cases, this is about getting you something, which is better than nothing, and getting you started and thinking.</p><p> We had one merchant that really described it well for me. He wanted to set up an outlet store for some of the overstock inventory that they had, and they had 3,000 SKUs that they wanted to put together — 3,000 different products that they wanted to put on this initial outlet store. And what he said to me was, “Typically, what I would have done is I would have hired a team, we would have taken three months to get this thing spun up, and we would have tried to put it together.” And he said, “I spent the weekend by myself, and I just used your generation feature. It got me started. I made a couple changes. And in three days, I had an outlet store stood up and ready to go for all my products. And I made the changes necessary. I don&#39;t like the style that you had, so I gave it some specific instructions, and it got to what I wanted.”</p><p> And I think the idea is flexibility within the framework. So provide a framework, let them get started, but give them all the flexibility in the world to do what is appropriate for their business and for them to be able to differentiate to their audience. And I think the key is, every audience is different, and nobody understands that better than the merchant themselves. The idea is capability and augmentation, not replacement.你是对的； there could be a point of local maxima for people. But we want to leave every escape hatch possible so that they can get out of that.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> One thing I want to stick back to, and you&#39;d alluded to it, was the deterministic versus stochastic nature of this. That seems really difficult to work with [from] a production standpoint — that you&#39;re using tools that have stochastic outputs, but you&#39;d like to have a “defined, tested, refined” process. And those two things seem antithetical to me in many ways.你怎么处理那件事呢？</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Part of it is, there needs to be a risk tolerance built in. So there needs to be almost an expectation that the system will fail and that the user needs to have a way to be able to work through that failure. So product description is a great one. We actually see that it takes multiple generations before the user is happy with what they have in front of them. So with that in mind, you have to allow for that second, third, fourth, fifth generation to take place with no effort whatsoever.</p><p> And so that&#39;s an error case that we know is going to happen, so we plan for it. So there&#39;s this “Regenerate” button right there; it presents multiple options. In other cases, we will try to present as many options as we possibly can to make it easier. So subject lines: You get three options to choose from. You can change it.做任何你想做的事。 Then, the other part of this is that we understand that technology is going to change, and the way that people use it is going to change, and their expertise level is going to change.</p><p> So there are people that are going to try and break the system, and there are people that are going to try and work around the system. It&#39;s important that we plan for that scenario, too. So every risk and every failure case has to be considered upfront. And then you almost do it in a fun way, and the one that is typical is prompt hacking, where people are trying to figure out what the prompt was that was used for this. In most of those cases, you do the best you can, but you expect that the prompt will get out there. So you write the prompt in a way that, when it gets out there, it&#39;s like, “Hey, you found me.那太棒了！ You want to apply for a job or something?” There are lots of different ways to like think about this.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Your human in the loop solves a lot of this too.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Correct.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Your whole design philosophy, it really addresses, I think, a lot of the backstops, a lot of the stochastic nature too. Can you give us a bit of your background? How did you get to your role?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I started out as an engineer. I think since I was, like, 12 years old I was programming and trying to figure out how to make the computer do what I wanted it to do. And I took an initial role as an engineer and was introduced to product management in what was then meter data management. So it was like big data for utilities had just come out. I got to work in that space, and then I moved into document classification, then ad tech, and then retail data platform management.</p><p> I&#39;ve always been adjacent to data, and at Shopify, my journey had been [to] build our infrastructure and data platforms, work on our machine learning platforms, and figure out what needs to be built there. And I always had one toe in the machine learning/AI pool at all times. Then I had teams that were focused on the analytics side of it and what merchants were going to experience and how they were going to understand their business. And the mandate was always like “How do I optimize my business with data?” And we looked at opportunities with ML, we looked at opportunities with AI. And then, when generative AI came out, it was just the next step along the way.</p><p> So it&#39;s by luck, by accident, by design — who knows? But I&#39;ve always been in data for the last 15, 20 years, and this was the next step.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> OK. Time for five questions. Miqdad, do you know what that is?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I do not.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> OK.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I mean, I know what five questions are, but …</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Good! So we&#39;re going to ask you five questions rapid-fire style. Just tell us the first thing that comes to your mind.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Sure.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What do you see as the biggest opportunity for AI right now?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I think the biggest opportunity is solving cold start for many people. What I mean when I say “cold start” is looking at a blank screen and not knowing what to do, whether it&#39;s how to navigate a system, write a thing, or whatever it might be — just that unknown moment. I think that&#39;s where AI steps in and does the biggest [benefit].</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I love that. What is the biggest misconception about AI?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> That it will take over. I think that there&#39;s a long way to go. It&#39;s an augmentation, not a replacement, and I think it&#39;s the same as when Photoshop came out. Designers got much better and much more creative, and I think this will raise the bar for everyone in terms of what they can do.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Is there such a thing as too much AI? When is there too much?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I think it&#39;s too much when the user is out of the loop. I think the user needs to have a stronghold in how they use AI and how they interact with it. I think this is not about replacing, and I think this is a matter of augmenting and helping the user be better.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What was the first career you wanted?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I wanted to be a doctor, but I faint at the sight of blood, so that didn&#39;t work out so well.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What is the one thing you wish AI could do that it cannot do right now?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I wish we could incorporate all of the modes of a user wanting to interact, whether it be a combination of voice, facial expressions — just to be able to get that semantic meaning behind the scenes that words can&#39;t do by themselves 。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Wonderful.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> We really appreciate the idea that what you&#39;re doing is using generative AI right now, just barely after it got started. I think a lot of people are wringing their hands and wondering how to use these technologies, and what you&#39;ve shown is a great example of how people can get real utility from this tool right now. Thanks for taking the time to join us today.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Thank you so much for having me, both.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Thanks for listening.

However, companies are rightly worried about the risks of sharing data with third-party AI services, as in the well-publicized case of a Samsung employee exposing proprietary company information by uploading it to ChatGPT.</p><p> These concerns echo those heard in the early days of cloud computing, when users were worried about the security and ownership of data sent to remote servers. Managers now confidently use mature cloud computing services that comply with a litany of regulatory and business requirements regarding the security, privacy, and ownership of their data. AI services, particularly generative AI, are much less mature in this regard — partly because it is still early days, but also because these systems have a nearly inexhaustible appetite for training data.</p><p></p><p> Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT have been trained on an enormous corpus of written content accessed via the internet, without regard for the ownership of that data. The company now faces a lawsuit from a group of bestselling authors, including George RR Martin, for having used their copyrighted works without permission, enabling the LLM to generate copycats. Proactively seeking to protect their data, traditional media outlets have engaged in licensing discussions with AI developers; negotiations between OpenAI and <cite>The New York Times</cite> , however, broke down over the summer.</p><p> Of more immediate concern to companies experimenting with generative AI, however, is how to safely explore new use cases for LLMs that draw on internal data, given that anything uploaded to commercial LLM services could be captured as training data. How can managers better protect their own proprietary data assets and also improve data stewardship in their corporate AI development practice in order to earn and maintain customer trust?</p><h3> The Open-Source Solution</h3><p> An obvious solution to issues of data ownership is to build one&#39;s own generative AI solutions locally rather than shipping data to a third party. But how can this be practical, given that Microsoft spent hundreds of millions of dollars building the hardware infrastructure alone for OpenAI to train ChatGPT, to say nothing of the actual development costs? Surely, we can&#39;t all afford to build these foundational models from scratch.</p><p> Safer experimentation with generative AI is becoming increasingly possible thanks to a burgeoning open-source AI movement that recalls the excitement around Linux in the 1990s. Back then, the development of a free operating system whose source code could be read and edited by anyone birthed an international community of developers who built upon one another&#39;s work to develop a mature suite of software tools that run much of the internet today.</p><p></p><p> Such a <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-01-30-ai-linux">“Linux moment” for AI</a> has now arrived. Open-source models such as <a href="https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/bloom">Bloom</a> , <a href="https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/">Vicuna</a> , and Stable Diffusion, among many others, provide foundational models that can be fine-tuned to specific tasks. Research into highly optimized training routines (such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685">LoRA</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10199.pdf">BitFit</a> ) has found that they can be fine-tuned using commodity hardware, leading to a burgeoning <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3545111">ecosystem of models</a> approaching the performance of ChatGPT (though many <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15717.pdf">technical challenges</a> remain). A leaked memo in which a Google researcher laments “we have no moat” reveals that some see this explosion of open-source innovation as threatening the tech giants&#39; control of LLMs. Still, capitalizing on the rapid developments of these emerging open-source tools safely and responsibly will require new investments in people and processes.</p><p></p><h3> Managing the Risks of Open-Source AI</h3><p> While locally controlled AI solutions keep proprietary data in hand, managers must still take a number of actions to ensure their safe, effective, and responsible use.</p><p> <strong>Navigate model and data licenses.</strong> The term <em>open source</em> is, in many cases, misleading. While some models allow commercial uses, others are restricted to academic or nonprofit use. Sometimes the source code is released with the model; other times, only one or the other is released. Recently created types of licenses restrict specific use cases deemed to be harmful or irresponsible. For example, Bloom and Stable Diffusion are released under <a href="https://www.licenses.ai/">Responsible AI Licenses</a> , which might legally prevent their use in certain criminal justice and health applications. One must also consider the types of data the model was trained on. While including copyrighted material in data sets for training AI models might be considered fair use in some scenarios in the US, case law is far from settled. Having a thorough accounting of the data fed into each model will help organizations better navigate these issues. Emerging efforts like the Data Nutrition Project are adding more structure and reporting requirements to data sets to help users better understand their contents and risks.</p><p> <strong>Prevent data leakage.</strong> Even without submitting data to third-party AI services, organizations risk leaking their own data through open-ended user interfaces such as chatbots. An emerging use case allows LLMs to serve as a conversational interface to a database, which can be a powerful way to let customers quickly find answers to common questions that are customized to their own data. However, preventing the LLM from revealing private information about other customers, or proprietary data of the company, can be challenging. Research by Pew shows that these conversational agents are a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/02/22/60-of-americans-would-be-uncomfortable-with-provider-relying-on-ai-in-their-own-health-care/">concern for many users</a> , especially around sensitive topics like health care. Safeguarding data is made even more difficult by <em>prompt injection attacks</em> , in which malicious users attempt to trick the agent into revealing information it was explicitly instructed not to reveal. In an adversarial setting, the same aspect of AI systems that allows them to be creative and flexible also becomes a security threat.</p><p> <strong>Adapt to changing data.</strong> Another complication with hosting on-premise models is ensuring that they are using the latest data. While the initial release of ChatGPT (GPT-3) famously could not answer questions about events past 2021, more recent models can combine current data with models pretrained on historical data. Firms must balance updating the system with new information while also maintaining stability and consistency in user experience.</p><p> <strong>Mitigate systemic biases.</strong> AI systems can easily perpetuate and amplify social and economic inequalities encoded in the training data. It is well known that LLMs are prone to stereotyping based on gender, race, and ethnicity — such as assuming that nurses are female and doctors are male. While there has been considerable research into how to reduce such behavior, in the end this problem will not be solved by solely technological solutions. Organizations should continuously audit AI systems, measuring their performance and results to ensure that different subpopulations are being treated equitably.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Build trust with customers.</strong> Companies should anticipate heightened sensitivities over how personal data is used and be transparent with customers about any intentions to use their data for AI training — and, ideally, allow individuals to opt in. This is particularly important when it comes to data that is perceived as being extremely personal, such as audio, video, and health data. Simply updating the terms of service and sending out notifications about the change, as some companies have done, can leave customers feeling exploited and broadly damage trust. For example, after Zoom&#39;s recent move to claim such rights to using customer data made news, blowback from users and privacy advocates compelled the videoconferencing provider to not only walk back the changes but declare in its terms of service that it would never use such data to train AI models.</p><h3> Responsible Data Use in the AI Era</h3><p> If open-source AI models continue to be adopted across industries, it will not just be Big Tech facing concerns over data ownership. Every company that wants to deploy these models for tasks as wide-ranging as internal help tools and public-facing chatbots will have to confront issues related to how data is collected and used by AI systems.</p><p></p><p> While there are <a href="https://mozilla.ai/">startups</a> , <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/2048a947-5714-4220-905b-e662cbcd14c8/resource/60050608-0095-4c11-86cd-0a1fc5c29fd9/download/ocha-data-responsibility-guidelines_2021.pdf ">governmental working groups</a> , and <a href="https://responsibledata.io/">academic communities</a> all working on these topics, best practices and recommended policies are still emerging. Stanford Law School&#39;s <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/2023/03/09/a-data-stewardship-framework-for-generative-ai/">AI Data Stewardship Framework</a> specifically addresses generative AI techniques. The Association for Computing Machinery, the world&#39;s largest computing professional organization, has also recently released a set of guidelines around the <a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/public-policy/ustpc-approved-generative-ai-principles">design and deployment of generative AI</a> systems, including LLMs. Those resources cover some of the issues discussed here, including limits on deployment, data and output ownership, and personal data control. We recommend that organizations of all sizes looking to capitalize on open-source AI keep a close eye on relevant guidelines and frameworks for the responsible and ethical collection and use of data for training models. They can be helpful for thinking through the potential technical and social risks of any potential project, and for developing rigorous auditing and monitoring processes to ensure safe and effective deployment.</p><p> At Tulane, we have recently established the <a href="https://tulanecs.github.io/tuceai/">Center for Community-Engaged Artificial Intelligence</a> to investigate such issues. Through a cross-disciplinary team of technologists, social scientists, and civil rights activists, we are working with nonprofits and community groups in New Orleans to understand how AI affects their work. We are brainstorming new ways of building AI systems that cede control over the data and technology behind AI to the people most affected by it. Our work is part of growing efforts around participatory or human-centered AI and data, which recognize that all stakeholders need to be included in the value created by these systems. As corporations move deeper into AI development, adhering to similar values might help them be better stewards of the data that they collect and use.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/use-open-source-for-safer-generative-ai-experiments/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>如何明智地利用人才市场</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-start-smart-with-a-talent-marketplace/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-start-smart-with-a-talent-marketplace/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 12:00:47 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Jeff Williamson and Donncha Carroll. <p>Jeff Williamson is a leader in human resources at Booz Allen.

At Booz Allen, we experienced that truth during the first year after launching our pilot project. Here, we&#39;ll examine some of the challenges we faced, how we overcame them, and what we learned about change management and talent marketplaces.</p><p> Having a talent marketplace represented an important change for Booz Allen. For years, we&#39;d been deploying professional staff members through informal, internal networks that operated based on who you knew and who you trusted. But this path limited our flexibility to make use of available resources and match the right talent to the right work. More importantly, it limited our people&#39;s control over their own career paths, and that hurt engagement and retention.</p><p></p><p> To test a better approach, Booz Allen launched a talent marketplace pilot project in partnership with Lotis Blue Consulting in January 2022. With the pilot, we sought to address talent management challenges that constrained growth and hurt our ability to deliver a compelling value proposition to employees — namely, issues in hiring, deployment, talent development, technology and its adoption, and culture change. We wanted to solve these problems systematically and holistically rather than introduce point solutions, which often fail to compound value.</p><p> But the level of cultural transformation required to activate and operate a talent marketplace is significant. It takes a sustained effort to work through several human behavioral- and perception-driven issues — and overcoming these issues is key to success.</p><h3> The Road to a Talent Marketplace</h3><p> Booz Allen wanted to end its reliance on traditional hiring networks centered around clients or teams. These highly localized networks made it tough to find resources in other parts of the organization that would meet enterprise, regional, or local needs. In contrast, the marketplace established a centralized approach to assess demand and source talent enterprisewide (via external hiring, internal deployment, or upskilling) and created the capability to deploy people across the entire organization.</p><p></p><p> The marketplace pilot focused on skills rather than networks. This gave employees new visibility to open opportunities across the enterprise and managers new insights into talent who could do the work. This high-resolution view on job and development opportunities vastly expanded the scope of what people could explore, improving employee engagement and delivering higher levels of individual and business performance. The pilot doubled the internal fill rate on open positions for the pilot population and garnered positive employee feedback on transparency and ease of pursuing new opportunities. Additionally, this skills-based approach gave underrepresented candidates more opportunities in technical domains with public sector clients.</p><p> In the early months of the pilot, we needed to overcome a few important challenges to build interest and excitement. Most importantly, we needed to seed the marketplace with a sufficient number of high-quality opportunities and available talent to engage both employees and managers. In so doing, we learned several important lessons — especially around change management.</p><h4> Lesson 1: Bring on the gamification.</h4><p> As our clients&#39; environments and needs are changing, the nature of our work is evolving, and we are seeing a rapid shift in in-demand skill sets. Our technical talent&#39;s ability to deliver against a client&#39;s mission depends on how quickly they can learn and adapt.</p><p> To address this, Jim Hemgen, Booz Allen&#39;s strategic talent development leader, and his learning and development (L&amp;D) team designed and launched a badging program alongside the marketplace pilot. The program aimed to develop strategic enterprise capabilities by illuminating different career pathways and the skills required to access different opportunities. To qualify for a badge, an employee needed to both earn the credential and have a manager validate that they had applied the skill on the job. This gamified learning and offered recognition and rewards to employees who invested in their own development.</p><p> The L&amp;D team engaged a large segment of the company&#39;s technical workforce in building strategic capabilities through a combination of internal badging and external certifications. In the past year, employees have earned more than 4,000 badges or certifications that are critical to the future of the business.</p><p></p><h4> Lesson 2: Data goals must be relevant to individual career goals.</h4><p> We encountered several technical challenges associated with the pilot, including data structure (establishing the right job architecture), data quality (ensuring that skills data was complete, for example), and algorithm design (how best to perform the recommendation process for talent and open职位）。</p><p> To get the complete skills data, we needed wide adoption. In reality, adoption closely correlated with the value that users expected to extract from the platform. We had a slow start as employees and managers explored the functionality and benefits.</p><p> That changed once John Grumbine, the marketplace operations leader, helped launch the Career Hub, an internal web app, in January 2023. The app served as a one-stop shop for employees to find jobs, training and development, mentors, and communities in the talent marketplace based on their skills and preferences. Employees now had a vested interest in keeping their skills and preferences up to date because that information drove recommendations for the opportunities, training, and the mentors they could access; further, it drove how they might be discovered or identified by project managers seeking to fill roles.</p><p> Launching the Career Hub app led to a substantial increase in talent marketplace adoption. As of September 2023, more than 50% of Booz Allen employees had onboarded into the Career Hub and were accessing job, learning, and mentoring opportunities.</p><h4> Lesson 3: Even change management needs to change.</h4><p> In the realm of cultural transformation, we quickly experienced four key challenges after launching the pilot. (See “Four Culture Challenges to Conquer.”)</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Four Culture Challenges to Conquer</h4><p class="caption"> You&#39;re likely to encounter these issues as you lead through the culture change related to a talent marketplace:</p><table id="Chart#" class="no-mobile"><thead><tr><th>挑战</th><th>Business Implications</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p> <strong>Managers want to keep their best resources or are concerned about becoming a net exporter of talent in an open market.</strong><p></td><td><p> Instead of leaving the team, high-performing talent leaves the organization.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> <strong>Employees are reluctant to seek out reassignment openly for fear that they will appear disloyal to their current supervisors.</strong><p></td><td><p> Engagement and performance of captured staff declines over time.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> <strong>Project managers are reluctant to accept resources they don&#39;t know personally and to trust recommendations from managers outside of their personal network.</strong></p></td><td><p> Assembling the right team for each project is much more challenging.

In response, our team prioritized several important actions to drive the culture change we needed:</p><ul><li> Build, refine, and map out skills-based talent profiles to provide greater clarity on the work people can do or have done.</li><li> Focus (initially) on high-volume in-demand job profiles to create enough liquidity in the system that participants have the opportunity to move.</li><li> Form a small, agile, and action-oriented operations team to collaborate with subject matter experts (for example, from business leadership and talent acquisition) as different challenges arise.</li><li> Provide human-centric support in the form of marketplace navigators — people specifically tasked with helping all participants (employees and managers) follow marketplace rules and guidelines and get the most value from the platform.</li></ul><p> All of these steps can be built into a launch plan for a talent marketplace.</p><h4> Lesson 4: Momentum, motivation, and measurement matter a great deal.</h4><p> At a high level, it&#39;s important to launch several services of an integrated talent management system simultaneously in order to exceed expectations and build adoption momentum.</p><p> To effect behavioral change, leaders must deeply understand what motivates different people, as well as how the changes they&#39;re making will address people&#39;s needs. The pilot provided valuable feedback on marketplace utility, helped prioritize enhancements, and established the level of change management required to support evolving and scaling the design.</p><p></p><p> Monitoring and measuring marketplace performance helped our team try new things, fail fast, and continually enhance the marketplace&#39;s value to participants. More specifically, our metrics included the number of opportunities posted, trends within those opportunities, the level and breadth of employee interest by type of posting, the percentage of aging opportunities (those that went unfilled for a long time), and the percentage of positions填充。 This data helped us evaluate the health and strength of the platform and gave us insight into how system adjustments were influencing performance.</p><h3> Commit to Continuous Improvement</h3><p></p><p> Through the talent marketplace and our other talent system investments, we are delivering a better employee value proposition. Our employee retention improved more than 4% after the pilot. However, this journey never ends. Continuous investment in evolving talent, as well as the solution, is essential to success for the business.</p><p> Addressing obstacles that come up along the way is part of the journey and ultimately leads to a better design and better results. A talent marketplace offers important benefits in today&#39;s evolving labor market: By prioritizing employee mobility and development, companies can better adapt to the changing skill requirements and realize higher levels of innovation, collaboration, and flexibility within their workforces.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-start-smart-with-a-talent-marketplace/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Balancing Change and Continuity During a Transformation</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/balancing-change-and-continuity-during-a-transformation/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/balancing-change-and-continuity-during-a-transformation/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 15:03:53 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Carsten Lund Pedersen and Laurianne McLaughlin. <p>Carsten Lund Pedersen is an associate professor at the IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark.
