These technologies are taking over more and more aspects of business as they seep into the collective consciousness. As Vox put it, generative AI is “suddenly everywhere,” and it’s poised to profoundly change daily life within organizations [&#8230;]]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><figure class="article-inline"><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Clark-Handwritten-1290x860-1.jpg" alt="" /><br /></figure><p>随着 ChatGPT 等人工智能工具今年向公众开放，人工智能进入了一个新时代。随着这些技术渗透到集体意识中，它们正在接管商业的越来越多的方面。正如 Vox 所说，生成式人工智能“ <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2023/1/5/23539055/generative-ai-chatgpt-stable-diffusion-lensa-dall-e">突然无处不在</a>”，并且它将在许多方面深刻改变组织内的日常生活，特别是在通信领域。</p><p>当人们收到短信、电子邮件或其他数字信息时，他们比以往任何时候都更有理由怀疑这些信息是否是真人所写。 ChatGPT 甚至被用来在 LinkedIn 上向个别高管编写<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/chatgpt-is-being-used-to-write-emails-big-companies-are-embracing-it.html">自定义消息</a>。作为回应，人们正在创建工具来帮助人们确定消息是否真的是<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90830518/tools-to-detect-ai-generated-text-chatgpt">由人写的</a>。其中一些工具是由使用技术生成此类文本的同一家公司制造的。但很少有人可能在短期内使用这些检测器，即使他们这样做，基于人工智能的文本生成器也会不断地工作，以智取检测器。</p><p></p><p>最终结果很明显：在数字通信方面，我们在未来一段时间内不太可能信任大多数“个人”数字消息。这就是为什么在努力建立真实的关系时，完全回避技术具有新的力量。</p><h3>手写信息呈现新价值</h3><p>如今，很少有人接听来自无法识别的电话号码的电话。高管们越来越意识到人工智能也被用来<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/11/why-chatgpt-ai-are-taking-over-the-cold-call-salesforce-leader.html">安排此类电话</a>，这会让他们感觉自己只是名单上的另一个名字。</p><p>为了与决策者建立联系，我最近尝试了一条不同的路线：我手写笔记给几位高管，然后将其邮寄给他们。其中一些引起了非常积极的个人反应和会议，甚至合同讨论。这些关系建立在<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-on-books/author-talks-susan-mcpherson-on-building-meaningful-relationships-in-business-and-in-life">有意义的基础</a>上，可以带来长期的业务增长。</p><p>一直有人喜欢手写商务笔记，但它从未具有如此重要的内涵——一个真正的人花时间写下个性化的信息，而不是选择一个更容易的选择。最近的一项研究表明，这一点的威力有多大：马里兰大学和韩国延世大学商学院的研究人员发现，“出示一张<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10949968221102306?journalCode=jnma">手写便条</a>对客户支出具有积极而重大的影响”，并且“温暖是关键发现。”</p><h3>人性化沟通</h3><p></p><p>类似的原则也适用于内部沟通。一些经理现在使用技术来进行员工识别等工作，并转向生成式人工智能来创建并向团队成员发送赞美信息。虽然这可能对不知所措和疲惫不堪的管理者有帮助，但它也会降低员工可能寻求的意义感和个性化。这就是为什么手写笔记可以成为管理者向员工（尤其是不在办公室面对面接受这种认可的<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-create-belonging-for-remote-workers/">远程员工）</a>表达真诚谢意的有效方式。</p><p>手写笔记可能并不适合每个人——例如，如果某人的笔迹特别难以阅读。但还有其他方法可以实现个性化沟通，包括创建针对特定个人的视频或语音备忘录，甚至在电话无人接听时留下语音邮件。有些人在他们的日程安排中划出一个时间并说：“我将保留这两个小时的时间，希望你可能想聊天。在这段时间内随时伸出援手，我就会放弃我正在做的事情。”</p><p>关键是要始终寻找在沟通中强调人性的方法。我们做得越多，人工智能在我们的人际关系中的闯入就越少，而且它们也会变得更加真实和有价值。</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/amid-grinding-ai- humanize-communication-to-strengthen-relationships/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>每周工作四天：如何让它在您的组织中发挥作用</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-four-day-workweek-how-to-make-it-work-in-your-organization/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-four-day-workweek-how-to-make-it-work-in-your-organization/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 29 Jun 2023 11:00:45 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew Barnes. <p>安德鲁·巴恩斯 (Andrew Barnes) 是新西兰最大的企业信托公司 Perpetual Guardian 的创始人。他也是 4 Day Week Global 的联合创始人，也是<cite>《The 4 Day Week》</cite> （Piatkus，2020）一书的作者。</p> ]]>; </dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Corporate Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Workplace Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Organizational Behavior]]></category><category><![CDATA[Performance Management]]></category><category><![CDATA[Work-Life Balance]]></category><category><![CDATA[Workplace, Teams, & Culture]]></category><description><![CDATA[As cofounder of 4 Day Week Global, Andrew Barnes has a front-row seat to the world’s largest experiment on the effects of scaling back the workweek.

Some individuals with ADHD may find that their differences disrupt these goal-oriented actions, even when they possess a clear vision, knowledge, skills, and motivation. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> Though medication can help regulate concentration, inhibition, and working memory, inclusive work practices and accommodations across five daily behavior dimensions can help to unlock potential and create the conditions for success. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p> ADHD is often underdiagnosed in adults due to the misconception that it is only a childhood diagnosis or one that all children eventually grow out of. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> Gender and racial disparities in underdiagnosis introduce additional complications. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> Undiagnosed and untreated ADHD can lead to secondary anxiety and depression, as well as significant and sometimes devastating costs at both an individual and collective level in terms of lost productivity, health care expenses, unemployment, justice system impacts, and spillover costs to family members. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a> A proper ADHD diagnosis and inclusive work practices can reduce these costs and enable individuals with ADHD to live fuller work and personal lives.</p><p></p><p> Gender differences in ADHD are frequently overlooked, which has widened the diagnosis and treatment gap for women. <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a> Males are three times more likely to receive an ADHD diagnosis than females, and they are typically diagnosed at a much younger age. <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a> Many early educators mistakenly believe that ADHD is mainly a diagnosis for boys and thus under-identify it in girls. Males generally present with hyperactivity and external displays of problems (such as classroom disruptions or fighting with peers), whereas females often internalize the symptoms of inattention, exhibiting low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. This makes detection and referral more challenging among females, who may be misdiagnosed with anxiety or depression rather than ADHD. In the workplace, women with ADHD may feel overwhelmed and unsupported, and consequent low self-esteem and anxiety about deadlines or project details, or worries about making mistakes, can lead to decreased productivity, weakened performance, and missed career opportunities.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> ADHD Resources for Better Understanding</h4><ul><li> National Institute of Mental Health: “ <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/adhd-what-you-need-to-know">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Adults: What You Need to Know</a> ”</li><li> Children and Adults With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: “ <a href="https://chadd.org/for-adults/diagnosis-of-adhd-in-adults/">Diagnosis of ADHD in Adults</a> ”</li><li> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: “ <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/diagnosis.html">Symptoms and Diagnosis of ADHD</a> ”</li><li> Russell A.

Aligning virtual work practices around these suggestions can enhance the productivity of all employees. That said, neurodivergent employees often know what conditions are most conducive to their effectiveness at work and should be consulted on changes to work practices that affect them. </p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand-column"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Inclusive Virtual Work Practices to Enhance Productivity</h4><p class="caption"> In remote work environments, leaders can adopt these approaches to enhance the productivity of all employees, whether they&#39;ve been diagnosed with ADHD or not. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-06-22_Hamdani_Figure.png" alt="Inclusive Virtual Work Practices to Enhance Productivity"><br /></article></aside></div><p></p><h4> 1. Time Management and Planning</h4><p> While individuals with ADHD can effectively formulate a big goal or vision, some of them might struggle with daily minutiae, in large part due to <em>time blindness</em> , which is a skewed perception of time. <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a> This can lead to difficulty organizing activities in a timely manner to fulfill daily tasks and meet demands, along with procrastination, missed deadlines, forgotten and unfinished tasks, and difficulties with multitasking. Time management can be especially challenging in remote work models due to the lack of external time cues, such as driving to work or lunch breaks, and weaker daily supervision and accountability in these settings.</p><p> To support planning and time management, managers should work with their reports to translate big goals into daily, actionable chunks using an easily accessible daily planner. They can also create a daily accountability system, such as peer check-ins or daily progress charts. Using tangible markers of the passage of time, such as putting a clock on one&#39;s home office desk, scheduling daily reminders to start a task, and setting timers to finish tasks, followed by breaks, can help as well. Whenever possible, managers should consider offering extended deadlines to factor in difficulties with time perception.</p><p> When working with virtual teams, managers should balance meeting schedules and productivity expectations. <a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a> Think carefully about how many weekly team meetings are necessary and, when possible, use asynchronous communication to help employees perform the assigned tasks at their preferred time. Implementing a hybrid model in which people go to the office some days to attend meetings and remain home (or in a distraction-free office space) other days for focused work can be a viable option to balance productivity with meeting schedules.</p><h4> 2. Mental Organization and Working Memory</h4><p> Due to differences in their working memory, some adults with ADHD may benefit from using external tools to do simple calculations, keep multiple pieces of information in mind while solving a problem, organize their thoughts while communicating, and remember to return calls or keep appointments. To support mental organization, encourage the use of external tools that bring important information into one&#39;s visual field, such as daily checklists, Post-it notes, written instructions, color-coded visual cues, and clearly visible deadlines.</p><p> Remote work can be mentally taxing and feel overwhelming due to the speed and volume of information sharing. Having to attend multiple virtual meetings — which can incorporate a mix of video, audio, text chat, and file sharing — within a single day can be especially demanding, particularly for neurodivergent employees.</p><p> Rather than creating a competitive atmosphere where everyone vies for a chance to be heard, consider ways to make virtual meetings more accommodating and inclusive. For example, meeting organizers can formalize routines for taking turns and allowing people time to gather their thoughts before speaking; schedule pauses for questions and answers; and turn off chat features for large groups, to minimize distracting cross-talk. Sharing materials in advance and distributing notes, recordings, and transcripts afterward can also be especially helpful for those who find it difficult to take notes while simultaneously paying attention to conversations.</p><h4> 3. Self-Motivation on Prolonged Tasks</h4><p> Certain individuals with ADHD might find it tough to stay motivated and focused during lengthy tasks without immediate rewards. Managers can encourage these employees to break down larger tasks into smaller steps, complete with mini deadlines and rewards. For instance, set 30-minute or one-hour goals and celebrate each accomplishment with small rewards, such as a cup of coffee or a short stroll outside. It&#39;s important to set timers for these breaks to return to work; the <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-managers-can-help-workers-tackle-digital-distractions/">Pomodoro Technique</a> can serve as a helpful model.</p><p> To combat “Zoom fatigue,” allow for transition time in between back-to-back meetings, and provide breaks during longer meetings to regulate focus. This approach will help prevent employees from zoning out and can help them to recharge their mental energy.</p><h4> 4. Inhibition of Impulses</h4><p> Individuals with ADHD can struggle with impulse control, causing them to react inappropriately, make impulsive comments, interrupt others, talk excessively, be emotionally reactive, experience difficulty waiting, or not recognize and fix mistakes quickly. These challenges can be even more prominent in remote settings, where social cues are limited.</p><p> Employing a coaching and feedback model can increase employees&#39; self-awareness about impulsive behaviors. <a id="reflink14" class="reflink" href="#ref14">14</a> Rapport-building practices, such as the use of a workstyle preference survey, can help managers discover ways to increase productivity and minimize frustration for neurodivergent employees. <a id="reflink15" class="reflink" href="#ref15">15</a> Remember to be compassionate and give employees grace; behaviors such as zoning out or speaking out of turn aren&#39;t due to laziness or ill intentions but rather stem from differences in how information is processed.</p><p></p><p> Consider posting guidelines of best practices in a visible location to provide a clear framework for action. Similarly, incorporate productivity strategies like digital <a href=" https://chadd.org/adhd-news/adhd-news-adults/could-a-body-double-help-you-increase-your-productivity/">body doubling</a> , in which employees can accomplish tasks that they find frustrating by working alongside others through virtual coworking apps (such as Flown or Focusmate) to help maintain focus on the tasks at hand. <a id="reflink16" class="reflink" href="#ref16">16</a> In addition, encouraging regular physical exercise and calming practices in daily routines is essential to help people replenish the mental resources required for self-control and inhibition of impulses.</p><h4> 5. Attention, Concentration, and Focus</h4><p> Remote work is fraught with <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-managers-can-help-workers-tackle-digital-distractions/">distractions</a> and requires special considerations to enable increased focus. To enhance focus and minimize boredom, consider providing adjustable desks, knee chairs, wobble stools, and active seating. Schedule breaks to help people avoid zoning out, and, when they&#39;re in the office, provide access to quiet spaces to minimize distractions. Consider offering assistive technology to help with task completion, such as dictation tools, audio recording software, and noise-canceling headphones, which can help all employees with productivity in remote and hybrid settings.</p><p></p><p> Our research has uncovered additional strategies that can help reduce distractions in virtual workspaces. <a id="reflink17" class="reflink" href="#ref17">17</a> Having meeting attendees use a uniform or blurred background can help minimize background noise and decrease visual triggers. Giving employees the option to turn off their cameras (for at least some part of the meeting) can be helpful to those who may become overly concerned about or distracted by their own facial expressions. Managers should also be mindful of the flurry of information that is available during online meetings and should be OK with employees asking for clarification in order to refocus after a moment of distraction.</p><p></p><p> ADHD can affect people&#39;s ability to perform in many areas of their lives, including online work settings. Individuals with the diagnosis have different needs, ranging from not requiring any accommodations to needing reasonable personalized accommodations. The gender and racial differences in diagnosis, barriers to accessing care, and stigma have exacerbated ADHD&#39;s costs to individuals&#39; overall well-being in the personal and professional domains. By adopting inclusive work practices, organizations can better support and tap into the talents of a diverse workforce that might otherwise be marginalized and underutilized.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-help-employees-with-adhd-address-the-challenges-of-remote-work/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Focus on Skills to Grow Your Workforce</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/focus-on-skills-to-grow-your-workforce/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/focus-on-skills-to-grow-your-workforce/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 21 Jun 2023 11:00:34 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Aneesh Raman and Elyse Rosenblum. <p>Aneesh Raman is vice president and head of the Opportunity Project at LinkedIn. <a href="https://gradsoflife.org/team-members/elyse-rosenblum/">Elyse Rosenblum</a> is the founder and managing director of Grads of Life.</p> ]]>; </dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Employee Development]]></category><category><![CDATA[Employee Recruitment and Retention]]></category><category><![CDATA[Talent Acquisition and Management]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership]]></category><category><![CDATA[Skills & Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Talent Management]]></category><description><![CDATA[As the threat of an economic downturn looms, we are entering the fourth consecutive year of uncertainty and rapid change.

Three years ago, a global pandemic upended supply chains, and quarantines transformed how we work. Months later, a racial justice reckoning compelled businesses to make unprecedented commitments to <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/inclusive-hiring-to-build-better-teams-period/">building inclusive organizations</a> . Sustained remote work again challenged the status quo in the workplace and, in some cases, became a vehicle for accessibility. The ongoing tight labor market has forced companies to reconsider and adapt their efforts to attract top talent. And now advances in AI are poised to reshape the skill sets required for nearly every job in every sector.</p><p> All of these changes have brought HR to the center of C-suite conversations, with employers thinking differently about how to spot, foster, and grow talent. Rapidly, skills have come to dominate the conversation; the average number of posts mentioning skills-first-related topics on the LinkedIn networking platform roughly doubled from October 2021 to October 2022. And employers are working hard to put skills at the center of their talent strategies — from hiring to advancement — as evidenced by groups like <a href="http://www.oneten.org/">OneTen</a> and the <a href="https://www.businessroundtable.org/workforceskills">Business Roundtable</a> . As talk of a possible recession dominates many business circles, a key question hangs in the balance: How can employers maintain their growing investments in skills-first approaches to maximize a return on investment for their workers and their business?</p><p></p><p> New data from LinkedIn provides a compelling case for doubling down on skills-first efforts. The <a href="https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report">2023 Workplace Learning Report</a> revealed that Gen Z and millennial workers are the most likely to value opportunities for career growth and skill-building, even more than they value work-life balance. Findings also showed that internal mobility has become the second-highest workforce priority among C-suite leaders, with learning and development (L&amp;D) leaders reporting closer collaboration with executives than ever before.</p><p> With the youngest workers demanding skills-driven career paths and executive attention following suit, businesses that fail to maintain their investments in skills-first talent strategies will get left behind. However, there is a tendency during economic slowdowns to hunker down and revert to old, predictable patterns and playbooks. Businesses&#39; survival instincts compel many to, in essence, choose stagnation over innovation. During the Great Recession of 2008, the practice of insisting on a college degree for jobs that formerly required less education — known as <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/managing-the-future-of-work/Documents/dismissed-by-degrees.pdf">degree inflation</a> — accelerated. This backslide directly hurt businesses&#39; bottom lines through increased hiring costs and turnover rates while exacerbating an economic landscape that benefits the few and denies opportunity to many.</p><p></p><h3> Expanding Opportunities for Diverse Talent</h3><p> Today, business leaders have an opportunity to do things differently — and they&#39;re in a stronger position to expand a skills-first strategy — even if the economic outlook remains uncertain. Whether you are still struggling to get talent in the door or your hiring has significantly cooled off, there are ways to embed a skills-first approach in all aspects of your business that can drive stronger long-term outcomes even during an economic slowdown.</p><p> Finding people to fill open roles used to be a tedious, manual process. Without sophisticated ways to find and grow talent based on actual skills, the college degree became one of the few blunt instruments employers had available to verify that a candidate had certain skill sets and abilities — but it was one that <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat07.htm">left out the majority of the US workforce</a> , especially workers of color.</p><p> Today, more data is available than ever before to accurately pinpoint the skills we need and to then find the people — whether internal or external — who have those skills. <a href="https://economicgraph.linkedin.com/research/skills-first-report">LinkedIn&#39;s data</a> shows that organizations that embrace this shift and focus on skills can see an outsize impact: Organizations on LinkedIn who take a skills-first approach can expand their talent pipelines by nearly 10 times. Employers are already starting to pick up on this: Over 45% of businesses on LinkedIn are now <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/skills-new-currency-ryan-roslansky/">explicitly using skills data</a> to fill open roles.</p><p></p><p> To build the diverse, high-functioning teams that the future demands, employers must focus on skills — an approach that also has an outsize impact on diversifying talent pipelines. When employers require a college degree for a role, they automatically exclude 60% of Americans, including 76% of African Americans and 83% of Latino Americans.</p><p> Removing unnecessary degree requirements from job descriptions is foundational to skills-based talent acquisition, but it is not enough. Talent acquisition leaders must also invest in expanding sourcing channels and revising language in recruiting materials to ensure that it is inclusive and inviting. Further, interview questions and hiring processes should be anchored in the fundamental skills needed for a role on day one, not just on credentials or experience, and they should be crafted intentionally and equitably to uncover those skills.</p><h3> Investing in Learning and Internal Mobility</h3><p> While getting new hires with the right skills in the door is one way to invest in skills, there is an opportunity to renew focus on supporting current employees&#39; growth and development, especially in sectors where hiring has cooled off. The latest findings from LinkedIn&#39;s Workplace Learning Report suggest that 2023 could shape up to be a significant year for expanding upskilling and internal mobility programs, given renewed urgency to effectively redeploy talent to priority business areas. In fact, survey findings show that budget forecasts remain strong, with 41% of L&amp;D leaders expecting to have more spending power this year and only 8% expecting their budgets to decrease.</p><p> Investing in skills and skills-based career pathways for your employees now can pay off down the line. Companies have a nearly 7% higher retention rate at the three-year mark among employees who have <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/global-talent-trends">learned skills on the job</a> , according to LinkedIn&#39;s findings. According to the Workplace Learning Report, an employee who has made an internal move by their two-year mark has a 75% likelihood of staying with the company, while an employee whose role hasn&#39;t changed has a 56% likelihood of staying on.</p><p> Similar to skills-first hiring, skills-first talent management requires that companies make a set of complementary changes to existing processes and invest in new ones. A key step to driving skills-first internal mobility is defining which skills are required and preferred for a given role and how skills across roles overlap. From there, leaders can help their teams build robust career paths that empower employees to advance in their careers by building and applying the skills that align with their goals. Finally, communication and transparency across the business — and, importantly, to employees directly — about the career paths available and skills needed to access them is imperative to seeing increased rates of retention and advancement.</p><p> While momentum is building for upskilling and reskilling initiatives, there is a clear need to speed up progress. LinkedIn&#39;s findings show that 40% of companies are still in the early stages, selling their programs to stakeholders and forming their teams; 54% are at the midstage, developing and activating programs; and only 2% say they have completed a program. Four percent have not started at all.</p><p></p><p> Beyond the operational changes, fostering an inclusive, learning-oriented culture is also a core shift companies are making. Through work with leading employer clients, Grads of Life has learned that it takes more than financial investments in L&amp;D to ensure that employees from underrepresented populations stay and grow within a company. The organization&#39;s research reveals <a href="https://gradsoflife.org/equity-career-advancement-insights-from-underrepresented-employees/">disparities in both pay and promotions</a> for Black talent compared with their White counterparts. It is critical that, alongside operational changes, organizations also invest in change management and remove bias from pay and promotion systems to strengthen organizational culture. Taking a skills-based approach to hiring and retention is a significant departure from the status quo for most employers, and the implementation teams faced with putting it into practice will need guidance, training, and support to be successful.</p><p></p><p></p><p> Amid a cloudy economic forecast, CEOs are engaged in a careful balancing act between where to pull back and where to double down. Investing in skills-first approaches to bring on great people and grow the great people they already have will not just help them weather a current storm. Making skills core to your company&#39;s strategy will set your workforce up for long-term resilience in a world where all of our jobs keep changing.</p><p> Data from LinkedIn shows that skill sets for <a href="https://linkedin.github.io/future-of-skills/#explore">jobs have changed</a> by about 25% since 2015, and that percentage is on pace to double by 2027 — which means the core skills required for a job today look very different from the same job just a few years ago. And today, the new era of AI we are about to enter could accelerate this change even further, with 82% of leaders acknowledging that their employees will need new skills for a new way of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/will-ai-fix-work">working with artificial intelligence</a> .</p><p> It&#39;s now, when the seas are choppy, that the corporate leaders set to succeed in this new world of work will show how it can be done. Now is not the time to wait around for better conditions to make a change. There has never been a better time for businesses to update their thinking and rise to the challenge by focusing on a skills-based workforce.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/focus-on-skills-to-grow-your-workforce/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Social Science of AI: Intel&#39;s Elizabeth Anne Watkins</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/the-social-science-of-ai-intels-elizabeth-anne-watkins/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/the-social-science-of-ai-intels-elizabeth-anne-watkins/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 20 Jun 2023 11:00:48 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. <p>Sam Ransbotham ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ransbotham">@ransbotham</a> ) is a professor in the information systems department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College, as well as guest editor for <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> &#39;s Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy Big Ideas initiative.

On today&#39;s episode, find out how one company develops AI tools with end users in mind.</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> I&#39;m Elizabeth Anne Watkins from Intel, and you&#39;re listening to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> .</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Welcome to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> , a podcast on artificial intelligence in business. Each episode, we introduce you to someone innovating with AI. I&#39;m Sam Ransbotham, professor of analytics at Boston College. I&#39;m also the AI and business strategy guest editor at <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> .</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And I&#39;m Shervin Khodabandeh, senior partner with BCG and one of the leaders of our AI business. Together, <cite>MIT SMR</cite> and BCG have been researching and publishing on AI since 2017, interviewing hundreds of practitioners and surveying thousands of companies on what it takes to build and to deploy and scale AI capabilities and really transform the way organizations operate.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Welcome. Today we&#39;ve got a great guest: Elizabeth Anne Watkins, a research scientist at Intel. Elizabeth, thanks for joining us today. Let&#39;s get started.</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Thank you so much for having me today.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> As the world&#39;s largest semiconductor manufacturer, Intel is probably a company that most people already know, but can you tell us about Intel Labs in general and maybe your role specifically?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Just like you said, we&#39;re not always top of mind in the big discussions around AI and the AI industry and the AI field right now, but there is so much fascinating work happening inside Intel, and we have such a unique perspective on the field and a unique way of entering that field that I&#39;m really excited to bring some of that to light today in our conversation.</p><p> I just joined Intel in August of last year, and already it&#39;s been a really incredible experience meeting so many different teams. I joined Intel as a research scientist in the social science of artificial intelligence and work under Lama Nachman in Intel Labs. The group is called Intelligent Systems Research.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Elizabeth, you mentioned Intel Labs is doing some unique things with AI. Do you mind sharing with us some of the things you&#39;re working on?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> A project that I&#39;m particularly excited about is called MARIE, an acronym which stands for Multimodal Activity Recognition in Industrial Environments. So basically, I&#39;m going to start with a metaphor: Imagine that your computer could watch you put together, say, a piece of furniture that you ordered on the internet. When you got to a tough part of the manual, or you&#39;re holding a screwdriver, you&#39;re holding a piece of plywood, and you can&#39;t get back to the manual, imagine that your computer could see what you were doing, knew what the manual was going to tell you to [do], and then help you to connect those two. Imagine that your computer could actually tell you, “Hey, I think you are about to screw shelf A into bracket B,” or something of that nature. And I know that every time I have received that flat pack that they say has an armchair in it, it&#39;s a really tough time for me to get from A to B.</p><p> And it&#39;s processes like these that our people are doing inside of our facilities, where they&#39;re actually building and manufacturing the semiconductor chips. So the folks who work inside of our factories, our technicians, are doing very involved and very delicate work, handling parts and tools for all kinds of manual operations happening on the factory floor. And so all of the work that they&#39;re doing is just as complicated — sometimes even more complicated — than getting that flat pack into an armchair. There&#39;s a lot of tools involved. There are all kinds of different processes, different pieces of equipment, different sizes of equipment. And so we are building computer systems a little bit like the one that I described that said, “Hey, did you mean to put screw A into bracket B?” We&#39;re building systems to help the people inside of our factories do this kind of really careful and really complicated work.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Actually, that&#39;s a fun analogy. I mean, I think we all find flat packs challenging, perhaps, though I have to admit I kind of enjoy them. But I&#39;m sure it&#39;s much more complicated within Intel. And what I liked about that example is, I feel like so often we&#39;re talking about automation: Can we get machines to learn how to do something that humans do? That&#39;s machine learning [ML] at its core. And then we talk about augmentation and, well, how can machines help humans make a decision? This strikes me as a little bit different. This is going the next step.</p><p> So in this case, we&#39;re not trying to get the machine to assemble the flat pack. We&#39;re not trying to get the machine to assemble the semiconductor. It&#39;s still the humans doing it. And so it&#39;s the humans who are needing to learn here. That seems like pushing that a little bit further than we&#39;ve talked [about] before.</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> I&#39;m so glad you picked up on that, Sam. That&#39;s exactly what we talk about inside Intel Labs, is that the human is the expert. The human is the one who knows how to interact with these systems, and they know how to screw the bits together. And they know all of the physical and dynamic intricacies of what it takes to put these tiny and very delicate components together.</p><p> We don&#39;t want to train a computer to do that. A computer <em>cannot</em> do that. The way that this both assembly and cleaning process — because, of course, all of these processes take place within these super-clean rooms, where everyone has to wear hazmat suits and gloves … we want to support the humans who are doing it. There is no computer who could do this. It takes human judgment; it takes human expertise to do these processes in a way that is comprehensive and truly dynamic and can respond to new pressures.</p><p> If a larger piece of a machine bends in a particular way, or if a screw falls into a hole in a particular way — it&#39;s going to be many, many years before computers are able to assess and diagnose and fix these kinds of constant dynamic problems. But you know who&#39;s really good at doing that is humans. And so we&#39;re trying to center humans and center human expertise. And that points to this dual reason that I&#39;m really excited about MARIE, is that there&#39;s both a tech side and there&#39;s a human side. And on the tech side, I think MARIE is really exciting because it&#39;s multimodal. It combines a lot of different kinds of AI systems through ambient sensing. It combines computer vision, which uses activity recognition, with audio sensing, combined with natural language processing [NLP] in a way that can help build an ambient environment around the technician, ultimately to help them [with] what they do.</p><p> But before the system can help them [with] what they do, the system has to actually learn, and it&#39;s the human experts that are teaching the system how to learn and teaching the system what it needs to know. And so this is, as far as I know, a brand-new way to deploy AI systems into new domains and apply them to new problems. … We are confronting and tackling one of the big challenges of AI development, which is data collection.</p><p> You need a lot of data to get into a new domain. You need a lot of data that&#39;s labeled the appropriate way, labeled according to the kinds of problems that you&#39;re trying to solve. And so we&#39;ve kind of flipped the script: Instead of trying to get all the data we can <em>before</em> a system is deployed, we go ahead and deploy a system that then works in partnership with the experts on the ground, and they teach the system — through speaking aloud and through dynamic data labeling — they teach the system what it needs to know. And so, hopefully, the data that is going to be used to help people to do these tasks down the line is going to be produced by the very first batches of people who are using the tool.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That seems like a great analogy because as you&#39;re saying that, it reminded me of what you would do if it was a new human partner joining the project. You&#39;d go through those same steps.</p><p> Shervin and I have some research where we find that <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/achieving-individual-and-organizational-value-with-ai/">60% of the people out there are thinking of AI as a coworker</a> , and that&#39;s exactly the sort of relationship that you&#39;re describing. But it made me think of a little danger here. Let&#39;s say that when you put that system out there, it doesn&#39;t know much, and you&#39;ve got the human training them. All right; I&#39;m a human. I feel like I&#39;m a little bit annoyed. I&#39;m like, “Why am I having to work so hard to train this coworker?” How do you keep that dynamic? You mentioned there being a technical side of this project, but the social side as well. That strikes me as maybe harder on the social side than on the technical side.</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> That&#39;s precisely what I want to talk about next because that&#39;s precisely what I get to do. I get to talk to the people about what they actually think about these systems — and you are right on the money. Sometimes they do perceive it to be annoying, where they&#39;re asking, “Wait — so I&#39;m putting together this really complex instrument, and the system asks me what I&#39;m doing, and it&#39;s <em>wrong</em> ? So how am I supposed to spend time not only doing my job but also teaching this machine how to do my job?”</p><p> And so I am really gratified that I get to be the social scientist who is there right on the ground. We&#39;re still deep in development, and it&#39;s common for companies to do as much testing as they can, of course, before something is deployed and then, when the actual tenets of deployment come — things such as user experience and user interface designs — those typically come closer to the end of a development process. But here, the social science and the understanding of what people need and what people might find annoying and what they need to trust a machine that is a coworker with them is right in the DNA of the development. And so I get to consistently speak with the technicians that we are building the system for and ask them questions just like the one that you described, asking them, “Do you think this is annoying? How might this be more helpful? What are some other affordances that we can build into the system to make it more helpful for you?”</p><p> And also asking deeper questions, not just about their dyadic relationship with the system but also about their larger sociotechnical context of work. Asking about, like, “What does your schedule look like?” and, “What have your bosses said about the system?” and, “Is there a way that we could try to facilitate more productive relationships, not just with your bosses but also with your other coworkers, through this system?” And so our goal is to build a very deep understanding, not just of one task but an entire space of work, and ask how our system can help in the best way it can to amplify human potential by being a coworker for humans within this space, but also [asking], “How can it be built with an understanding of their work context in order to facilitate a long-term relationship?”</p><p> Because one of these things that&#39;s demanded by the fact that we&#39;re leaning on people to provide data and leaning on people to help us actually do the data labeling is that we need them to be engaged, and we need them to like interacting with the system, and we need them to find it trustworthy and reliable and useful. And understanding how all those goals can be achieved requires a deep understanding of social context and social habits and work habits and task flows. And so that&#39;s precisely what we&#39;re working on now.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I think it&#39;s really interesting how you seem to be thinking beyond just this project. There&#39;s the element of “OK, how do I get this particular project in place,” but underlying a lot of things you&#39;re talking about are things like, “How do we figure out the best way to introduce, essentially, a new system? How do we figure out the best way for how to transform and get to our overall vision?” And that transcends just a single project. How are you trying to pick up on those lessons?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> That is a really great question. I am really proud of our labs and some of the big bets that we&#39;re making on human-AI collaboration and how much the input and contributions and insights drawn from social science are being picked up, and have been picked up historically at Intel, throughout their research projects. As we&#39;re doing research projects and building products across verticals like education and manufacturing and accessibility, there&#39;s deep investment across the teams that facilitates and encourages conversations with folks like me — with the social scientists.</p><p> We often get these really fantastic teams in a room where we have engineers and data scientists and policy makers and social scientists, including not just me but a wonderful team — headed up by Dawn Nafus — of anthropologists, as well as another team of social scientists that has psychologists. And we all work together really closely to ensure that the products we build are not just designs to answer one problem but that they&#39;re properly engineered around what the best solution is, that we take advantage of all the different kinds of multimodal affordances that our tools can provide, and that we&#39;re deeply understanding of the social and organizational context that all of our products are going to be deployed into.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I think so often there&#39;s a transition that seems to be happening between when we were first talking about these models and tools and using data: Things were very heavily data- and tool-oriented and very heavily science-oriented. And that made a lot of sense because we didn&#39;t know how to do some of these things. And now, as a society, we&#39;re learning how to do many of these tools and model buildings. But a lot of the team you mentioned there — anthropology, psychology — these are not traditional things that we might have thought of [as] being integral to producing an AI application, but those are the ones you happened to mention. Why did you pick those? I guess that&#39;s some of your background in social science, right?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Yeah, throughout my graduate studies and postdoc work, I was always really invested in the users and in people. And I was always really fascinated by just how weird people can be and how creative and how innovative, and how folks often use technologies in ways that their developers did not anticipate and did not foresee.</p><p> And while there are some dangerous elements to that, as we&#39;ve seen in various misuse and dual-use applications, there are also a lot of really fantastic and wonderful ways that people have figured out for technology to be more suited to them in their context or to work a little bit more smoothly for them. And so seeing how Intel was different because of their history of being a semiconductor manufacturer and being deeply invested in hardware and having an ecosystem approach to the way that AI tools are deployed really showed me that they were a company that cared, just like I did, about the people who were going to be using these tools and the social structures in which these people were embedded, and building tools that could match not just the people who bought or used the tools but also the lives and the communities into which these technologies were going to be interjected.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Elizabeth, clearly a lot of your background has been coming through as we&#39;ve been talking, but could we step back for a second and ask you about how you ended up in this role at Intel Labs?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> I guess my road to this role started way back, probably at the beginning of my graduate career. After I graduated MIT and started my Ph.D. at Columbia, there was an opening for someone to contribute to a project on security and privacy behaviors among journalists. And my adviser said, “Hey, I got you an interview for this project.” And I said, “I don&#39;t know anything about security and privacy.” And she said, “Just go to the interview. I got you the interview. Just go.” And so the night before the interview, I thought, “Oh, I&#39;d better have something to talk about. PGP — Pretty Good Privacy — everyone&#39;s talking about PGP. I better download PGP so I can act like I know what PGP is.” And I tried to figure it out, and it was hard. I couldn&#39;t figure out … I went to the website and I was like, “The website doesn&#39;t really explain what&#39;s happening here. Where&#39;s the key? I download the key, but the key&#39;s also kept in a database, but I write the key on my emails? Oh, I&#39;m so … I can&#39;t do this. I&#39;m so bad at this. This is not for me.”</p><p> And I went into the interview the next day with the wonderful project lead, Susan McGregor, and I said, “You know what? This job&#39;s not for me. I tried to do PGP; it&#39;s weirdly hard. There&#39;s something about it that I just … I can&#39;t quite grok the language.” And she said, “I think that makes you perfect for this job because we are trying to figure out why security and privacy are so hard for people at work, especially journalists who are high-value targets for attack from a lot of different actors, and we are trying to figure out how we can make security and privacy protocols better for them, so it sounds like you&#39;re frustrated with how security is designed.” And I said, “Yeah, that was frustrating.” And she said, “OK, let&#39;s do some work.”</p><p> So we ended up working together for several years studying journalists. We had one particularly harrowing project studying the journalists who published the Panama Papers. And for that, they had terabytes of data. There were journalists working all over the world; none of them were colocated, and they didn&#39;t have a single breach. Never once did they have a breach and in all of that data. And so we saw that as a success story. And we said, “OK. We&#39;re always hearing the bad stories about breaches and attacks; we never hear the success stories.” And so we got to interview the journalists who contributed to the Panama Papers and talked to them about their organizational culture and how making protocols uniform across all journalists helped to instill a sense of teamwork and a sense that they were protecting each other. And seeing the power of culture and shared mission on behaviors around something as difficult as PGP and security protocols … it was really inspirational.</p><p> And around that time, I started paying attention to facial recognition, and from there it was a short bridge over to looking at AI and asking similar questions around “Why is this hard to understand? How can we communicate it to people in a more strategic way that is more understanding of the work that they&#39;re doing and the work that they need to do? And how can we bring some transparency to these systems in a way that is meaningful and understandable for real people?”</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> One of the things interesting about that is, security&#39;s always like that. If it&#39;s a little bit hard to do, then we all tend to not do it, because it&#39;s tomorrow&#39;s problem versus today&#39;s problem. … That&#39;s something we as humans are terrible about. And you know, I think what we&#39;ve failed [at] in many ways here is not building that into the infrastructure so it&#39;s a default. And there&#39;s a lot of analogies for artificial intelligence: We&#39;re building things, and if we don&#39;t make the defaults easy to use or easy to do the right thing, then people will do the wrong thing — or people will do the easy thing or the short-term thing. And you mentioned facial recognition: What are the kinds of things that we should be building into our infrastructure so we don&#39;t propagate AI-based mistakes?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> That&#39;s a great question. Something that drives my research, both throughout my graduate career and here at Intel, is a recognition that people are the experts in their own lives and that we really need to engage with the people and with the users throughout the development pipeline in order to build not just systems but solutions, and solutions for the real problems that are happening on the ground. And as close as a company can get to including the expertise of social science and what social scientists can bring about rigorous and robust tools to study how people live and the kinds of languages they use and the kinds of values they have and what&#39;s truly important to them and what they want to protect and what they want to keep safe, as well as building in different kinds of options and different kinds of pathways into the same technology that might be used differently by people of different levels of accessibility, are all things that I would love to see the entire field take up.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That <em>sounds</em> good. I mean … much like buying low and selling high sounds great. How do companies actually do this? What steps do they need to take to make progress on these?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> That&#39;s a great question. The way that we&#39;re doing it at Intel is that we are facilitating conversations between our technical teams — people who are building really amazing systems around robotics and accessibility tools and educational tools — and embedding social scientists across all these teams so that we can ask some questions around “Hey, what are the presumptions of this system? Have you talked to teachers? Have you talked to the folks who are going to be using this robot on the ground? What are your conversations like with the people who are going to be served by these solutions?”</p><p> And I&#39;m really lucky that I get to be in a place where we&#39;re embedding this expertise way back into the problem-formulation stage and into the project-formulation stage, all throughout the development pipeline. I&#39;ve also been really gratified that Intel established the ethical impact assessment process along with the Responsible AI [Advisory] Council. And so this is a process for robustly and rigorously building into the development pipeline that teams all across Intel and across all business units [use]. This is a way to inject the expertise, not just of social scientists but everyone who sits on the Responsible AI [Advisory] Council, including engineers and policy makers and folks from legal and folks from standards, and facilitate conversations with this multidisciplinary Responsible AI [Advisory] Council with development teams through their submission of the ethical impact assessment.</p><p> And the ethical impact assessment is a way for us to put values into practice and ensure that values around human oversights and human rights and privacy and safety and security and diversity and inclusion — these are ways for us to make sure that those values are built into the tools that Intel BUs [business units] are putting together across the organization.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> OK, we have a segment where we ask our guests a series of five rapid-fire questions. Just answer the first thing that comes to your mind. First: What is your proudest AI moment?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Oh, goodness. That&#39;s a great question. I am really proud of being able to represent the voices of the technicians who we have on the floor to these teams of engineers and data scientists who are building these systems. And because of the process that Intel has built, where I get to sit with the engineering teams who are building the computer vision and the action recognition and the NLP and choosing the phrases in the semantic frames around tasks and about how tasks are built and how they can be recognized, being able to do the interviews that I do with technicians to ask them about their concerns when this technology is introduced, what we can do to make sure that their concerns are addressed, asking what they need to know around transparency, what they need in order to trust the system, all in the service of enhancing the work that people are doing.</p><p> The fact that I get to grab that information and deliver it consistently to the engineers and to see how quickly they respond. Like, “Oh, well, we can build this and we can build that. And what if we built this into the UI? And what if we built this into the dialog?” It&#39;s such an incredibly compelling process, especially after coming from academia, where I would write a paper and then it would take a year to get published. And then …</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Oh, a year sounds fast.</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Right. If I were lucky, it would take a year. I think my longest record was maybe 3½ years it took to get published.我不知道。 What&#39;s your record?</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Uh, 10. So …</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Ten!</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Yeah. Let&#39;s don&#39;t talk about it though, because I&#39;ll get all sad.</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Oh, no.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So you mentioned concerns that people have. What worries you about artificial intelligence?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Well, one of their biggest concerns, when I started talking to the technicians, was that they were going to get replaced.</p><p> I said, “OK, let&#39;s have a conversation. What do you think this is for?” And they said, “I&#39;ve seen the news. I know you&#39;re trying to build a robot just to do exactly what I do, so I figure I&#39;m training my replacement.” And I thought, “Oh, no! That&#39;s terrible.” And I got to have a lot of conversations with our technicians where I got to say, “That&#39;s <em>not</em> what we&#39;re doing. We are not trying to replace you. You are the expert. We need you. In fact, we need you to teach the system so that the system can go and help other people like you. So by you training the system, you&#39;re actually helping a lot of other folks in Intel fabs [semiconductor manufacturing plants] across the planet, and you are ensuring that they get help in the way that you would like to get help.”</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Some research that Shervin and I were involved in a couple years ago focused entirely on this <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/expanding-ais-impact-with-organizational-learning">organizational learning</a> aspect that you were alluding to — that this is a way for everyone to learn more quickly and to spread knowledge.</p><p> What&#39;s your favorite activity that does not involve technology? What&#39;s <em>not</em> AI going on in your world?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Well, there&#39;s so much happening recently, it seems tough sometimes to figure out what&#39;s AI and what&#39;s not.</p><p> [In] my personal life, I do a lot of baking. It&#39;s been a while since I made a loaf of bread. I do a lot of cooking. I am very lucky to live with my husband in the city of New York, and so we do a lot of exploring — in fact, just getting outside. That&#39;s probably the biggest non-AI activity, is walking outside on our own two feet and looking around with our own eyes. And that always feels very refreshing.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What&#39;s the first career you wanted when you were young? What did you want to be when you grew up?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> I wanted to be an artist, and it has been a topsy-turvy winding road. I did my undergrad at UC Irvine, and I studied video art.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What&#39;s your greatest wish for AI in the future?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> There&#39;s so much that AI can do that humans cannot, but there&#39;s also so much that humans can do that AI cannot. And I think a big challenge, at least for me, and I hope the people with whom I work going forward for the next few years, is going to be figuring out exactly what that balance is and how can we systematize “What do people really need help with that AI systems can do?” but with a really thorough understanding of what it is that people do and how they do it.</p><p> Now that the AI systems are becoming so advanced, but oftentimes in a lab or in a vacuum, as they mature into the real world, I think it&#39;s really exciting what they can do, but we&#39;re facing a lot of work in getting them there. And I think it&#39;s going to be other social scientists and multidisciplinary teams like the ones that we have at Intel all working together to make sure that these systems can really be deployed as solutions.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That&#39;s a good cap for the episode. Thanks for talking to us. I think one of the things that has come through [is], you&#39;re talking about projects and things you&#39;re working on, but you&#39;re also giving us a hint about what&#39;s going to happen in the future as we move off of the, let&#39;s say, tool-focused “Can we get the ML right? Can we get the model right? Can we get the data right?” You&#39;re talking a lot about what happens next, what happens once we check off some of those check marks — what are those checks? And I think a lot of people can learn from that. Thanks for taking the time to talk with us today.</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Oh my gosh, it&#39;s been such a pleasure.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Thanks for listening. Next time, Shervin and I speak with David Hardoon from Aboitiz Data Innovation. We&#39;re once again talking about chemical engineering, so you won&#39;t want to miss this one.</p><p> <strong>Allison Ryder:</strong> Thanks for listening to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> .

It&#39;s an obvious concern because generative AI can create the types of outputs that the industry uses — text (in the form of stories, scripts, ad copy, and reviews), marketing campaigns, and moving and static images. Segments of the industry are facing economic pressures, which increases the demand for productivity and less-expensive “product.” And a high percentage of current entertainment is derivative of past content, which makes it well suited for generative technologies that are trained on … past content.</p><p> It&#39;s still early days for generative AI-created entertainment, but it&#39;s clear that something big is happening. A recent <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-chatgpt-hollywood-intellectual-property-spongebob-81fd5d15"><cite>Wall Street Journal</cite> article</a> noted that widely available AI tools can suggest storylines, character arcs, and dialogue; it even includes an interactive module that lets readers see for themselves how easily ChatGPT can write a basic script when given a few prompts. The article also raises questions about image intellectual property: “If a user prompts an AI tool to build a new character influenced by say, SpongeBob, should the original creators have to grant permission? Who owns it? Can the new work itself be copyrighted?”</p><p></p><p> Generative AI was used in <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/05/05/runway-generative-ai-chatgpt-video">making the 2022 film <cite>Everything Everywhere All at Once</cite></a> , and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oscars-2023-everything-everywhere-all-at-once-most-awards/">we know how that turned out</a> . Tom recently wrote about the use of generative AI to create <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomdavenport/2023/03/13/cuebric-generative-ai-comes-to-hollywood/">movie and TV backdrop images</a> . There are already generative AI systems that can create videos, although they are short and relatively primitive. AI is being used to provide data-driven predictions about <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/democratizing-data-in-hollywood-jumpcuts-kartik-hosanagar/">how unusual storylines will land with viewers</a> .</p><p> So, what does this mean for the industry? There are many different components to this question, as a new <a href="https://variety.com/vip-special-reports/generative-ai-entertainment-a-special-report-1235564989/">report from Variety Intelligence Platform</a> suggests. In May, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) went on strike, primarily over film and TV writers&#39; <a href="https://time.com/6277158/writers-strike-ai-wga-screenwriting/">income from streaming services programming</a> , but it also demanded that production companies “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/29/business/media/writers-guild-hollywood-ai-chatgpt.html">regulate use of material produced using artificial intelligence</a> or similar technologies.” Because there are so many uncertainties about what will happen when and how with the technology, we spoke with two experts on the topic. Both are based in — not surprisingly — Los Angeles, and both are involved with centers at the University of Southern California (USC). However, they don&#39;t work together, and they have very different approaches to the technology.</p><p></p><h3> Resolutely Against Generative AI</h3><p> Jonathan Taplin is director emeritus at the <a href="https://www.annenberglab.com/">Annenberg Innovation Lab</a> at USC. He&#39;s had a long career in the entertainment industry and was previously a tour manager for musicians, including Bob Dylan and The Band. In addition, he&#39;s been a film producer, a banker, and a writer. His latest book, <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jonathan-taplin/the-end-of-reality/9781541703155/?lens=publicaffairs"><cite>The End of Reality: How Four Billionaires Are Selling a Fantasy Future of the Metaverse, Mars, and Crypto</cite></a> , will be released in September. As you might infer from the title, he&#39;s not a fan of how big tech firms&#39; generative AI tools are being developed or promulgated.</p><p> “The way they train their models is by ingesting everything on the internet, with no concern for copyright,” Taplin told us. “Google has a music-generation AI trained on every audio file on YouTube. You can issue a prompt like &#39;Write me a song that sounds like Taylor Swift, sad ending, up-tempo,&#39; and the resulting song sounds somewhat like her. Someone could include it in a video game or a bar scene in a movie for free.” Generative AI could do the same kind of repurposing with video content owned by the studios, he added.</p><p> Taplin&#39;s primary concern is that generative AI will replace some of the work done by human writers, artists, photographers, and other creative professionals in the arts and entertainment industry. He also believes that it will exacerbate problems that are already bringing the film and TV industry down. “The biggest problem in the movies is too many formulas. There is a lack of originality, and that&#39;s why the industry isn&#39;t performing,” he said. Generative AI, he added, is only capable of producing even more formulaic content and will make the predictability worse. “Entertainment relies on new ideas, and this technology can&#39;t produce them,” Taplin added.</p><p> He said he&#39;s concerned that generative AI will continue to reduce the number of performers who can make a living in their fields. The majority of entertainment revenue already goes to a very small percentage of artists. This is the <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2014/03/05/toponepercent/">reality for musicians</a> , especially on <a href="https://themusicnetwork.com/few-artists-generate-most-streams/">streaming services</a> , and is echoed in Hollywood in the huge <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/655480/all-time-top-grossing-actors-box-office/">box office revenues</a> generated by a handful of leading actors in blockbuster films. When you get an “algorithmic economy,” Taplin said, “the algorithms narrow the funnel, with outsize paychecks for a few.” He&#39;s hopeful that a collective licensing regime — similar to what&#39;s in place for music sampling — will emerge to protect artists when their content is used to train generative AI.</p><h3> Embracing Generative AI, With Some Concerns</h3><p> Yves Bergquist is director of the AI &amp; Neuroscience in Media Project at USC&#39;s <a href="https://www.etcenter.org/">Entertainment Technology Center</a> , which is funded by Hollywood studios. You can guess that his opinion of generative AI is probably much more favorable than Taplin&#39;s. It is, although he said he does have some concerns about AI&#39;s potential effects on the media and entertainment industry: “It&#39;s a completely revolutionary technology” characterized by misinformation and “some insanity.”</p><p> We asked Bergquist whether movie studios would embrace generative AI. Parts of them are already doing so, he said. “Some groups within the studios are highly technologically savvy, such as the chief technology officers and all of the visual effects artists and technicians. They are very sophisticated and are already working with generative AI companies. The studios do a lot of the postproduction work in films — particularly in animation — and there is a lot of pressure to bring costs down. The postproduction companies have a software development culture, so they will embrace generative AI.”</p><p> He also believes that many production companies will embrace the technology because they are already shooting on large LED-based screens and will need generative images for them. Bergquist said he expects that tools offering virtual actors and voice synthesis will be most aggressively adopted by short-form creators who distribute their work on TikTok or YouTube and by video game producers. “Streaming channels, digital ads, games — that&#39;s what kids watch these days,” he noted. “The media industry no longer has a monopoly on entertainment.” Makers of hardware (such as cameras) are experimenting with generative in-camera visual effects as well.</p><p></p><p> The business side of traditional movie studios is sometimes more reluctant to embrace AI, Bergquist observed, simply because they don&#39;t have the same kind of culture of data or software. “It&#39;s being bolted onto organizations and people who aren&#39;t ready,” he said. Even the new streaming studios, like Netflix and Prime Video, have experienced a lot of growing pains in their AI journeys.</p><p> Bergquist said that before the WGA strike started in May, many screenwriters told him that they view the likes of ChatGPT as a “great creative assistant tool” but not something that will replace human writers. “It&#39;s good at brainstorming ideas, but it will output only average content,” Bergquist asserted. “It&#39;s nowhere near capable of the symbolic abstraction necessary for script development, and it can&#39;t output a script with narrative structure and character arcs.” At least not now. Future language models with higher levels of intelligence and new paradigms for AI might be able to do so.</p><p></p><p> Bergquist thinks generative AI will have enormous effects not only on entertainment but also on education. He believes that schools, including the School of Cinematic Arts at USC, need to quickly ramp up their teaching to keep pace with the frenzy of new generative AI tools that are released nearly every week. Bergquist is preparing courses himself on the technology for the Society of Motion Pictures and Television Engineers, an organization that represents technologists in media.</p><h3> Are Both Experts Right?</h3><p> Although Taplin and Bergquist seem to have very different views on generative AI, they might both be right about its impacts. Economic pressures may entice the industry — at least some sectors of it — to embrace these new tools. Generative AI will lead to dramatic changes in production and postproduction, distribution, and intellectual property ownership. The technology may not be good for traditional artists and the companies that employ them, but it is likely to lead to significant changes in the industry over the next few years — hopefully some for the better along with some for the worse. Perhaps the only purely good news is that neither expert expects that humans will be entirely replaced anytime soon.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-impact-of-generative-ai-on-hollywood-and-entertainment/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Recapping Work/23: The Big Shift</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/recapping-work-23-the-big-shift/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/recapping-work-23-the-big-shift/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 15 Jun 2023 11:09:56 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[MIT SMR Editors. ]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Career Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Employee Development]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video]]></category><category><![CDATA[Webinars & Videos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Workplace Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Diversity & Inclusion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Organizational Behavior]]></category><category><![CDATA[Remote Work]]></category><category><![CDATA[Skills & Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Workplace, Teams, & Culture]]></category><description><![CDATA[Download the Event Summary Download (PDF) The pandemic irrevocably changed the how, why, and where of work.

Nalbantian outlined ways companies are tackling the obstacles women and people of color continue to face — obstacles that are often due to situational factors, such as the roles people are in or whom they report to.</p><h6 class="work23-timestamp"> Section time stamp: 1:02</h6><hr /><h4 class="work23-title" id="berwick"> The Why, What, and How of Skills-Based Talent Practices</h4><h5 class="work23-speaker"> Beth Berwick, Grads of Life</h5><p> More jobs than ever now require a four-year college degree, including many that never did in the past. But that criterion excludes 64% of the population — including 76% of Black Americans and 80% of Latinos. Berwick is among those calling for a retreat on the degree requirement. She explained how organizations can instead hire effectively based on the skills they need.</p><h6 class="work23-timestamp"> Section time stamp: 33:24</h6><hr /><h4 class="work23-title" id="smith"> The New World of Accessing Talent</h4><h5 class="work23-speaker"> Mike Smith, Randstad Enterprise; David Kiron, <cite>MIT SMR</cite></h5><p> Companies are changing how they approach and apply technology to find the people they need. <cite>MIT SMR</cite> &#39;s Kiron and our presenting partner&#39;s chief executive discussed the ways that innovative organizations are designing their own talent pools, building their talent brands, and expanding DEI initiatives beyond their own boundaries.</p><h6 class="work23-timestamp"> Section time stamp: 54:44</h6><hr /><h4 class="work23-title" id="dervin"> Flexible <em>and</em> Effective: Leadership Strategies for the Hybrid Workplace</h4><h5 class="work23-speaker"> Julie Dervin, Atlassian; Brian Elliott, Future Forum; N.

Tools that can help us solve complex and vexing problems can also be put to work by cybercriminals or give authoritarian governments unprecedented power to spy on and direct the lives of their citizens. We can build models that lead to the development of new, more sustainable materials or important new drugs — and we can build models that embed biased decision-making into systems and processes and then grind individuals up in their gears.</p><p></p><p> In other words, AI already gives us plenty to worry about. We shouldn&#39;t be distracted by dystopian fever dreams that misdirect our attention from present-day risk.</p><p> The recent emergence of ChatGPT and similar large language models into broader public awareness has heightened general interest in both the potential benefits and the dangers of AI. A few days before I wrote this, Geoffrey Hinton, a giant of the AI field whose work underlies much of the current technology, resigned from his position at Google, telling <cite>The New York Times</cite> that he wanted to speak freely about the risks of generative AI. “It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,” he told the newspaper.</p><p> And there, indeed, is where we should put our attention. Throughout human history, new technologies have been put to work to advance civilization, but they have also been weaponized by bad actors. The difference this time is that not only is the technology extremely complex and difficult for most people to understand — so too are the potential outcomes.</p><p> There&#39;s a steep learning curve that all of us must be prepared to climb if we want AI to do more good than harm. The excitement about possible uses for these tools must be tempered by good questions about how automated decisions are made, how AI systems are trained, and what assumptions and biases are thus baked in. Business leaders, especially, need to be as aware of reputational and material risks, and the potential for value destruction, as they are of opportunities to leverage AI.</p><p></p><p> And while AI development is likely to continue to proceed at a breakneck pace that no open letter can arrest, the rest of us ought to proceed deliberately and with caution. In “<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/dont-get-distracted-by-the-hype-around-generative-ai/">Don&#39;t Get Distracted by the Hype Around Generative AI</a> ,” Lee Vinsel reminds us that tech bubbles are accompanied by a lot of noise. We need to let go of the fear of missing out (FOMO) and take a measured, rational approach to evaluating emerging technologies.</p><p> Here at <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> , we will continue to support business leaders with the research and intelligence required for clear-headed decision-making and judicious experimentation. Our ongoing <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/big-ideas/responsible-ai/">focus on responsible AI practices</a> , led by guest editor Elizabeth Renieris of the University of Oxford, is a critical part of that commitment.</p><p> We&#39;re all stakeholders in the AI revolution. Let&#39;s embrace that responsibility and strive to ensure that the good actors outweigh the bad.</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/what-me-worry/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Our Guide to the Summer 2023 Issue</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/our-guide-to-the-summer-2023-issue/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/our-guide-to-the-summer-2023-issue/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 13 Jun 2023 12:34:02 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[MIT Sloan Management Review. ]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Algorithms]]></category><category><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ecosystems]]></category><category><![CDATA[Equity]]></category><category><![CDATA[Financial Strategy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Growth Strategy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Risk Management]]></category><category><![CDATA[Disruption]]></category><category><![CDATA[Financial Management & Risk]]></category><category><![CDATA[Innovation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Innovation Strategy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Strategy]]></category><description><![CDATA[Predictive Models Can Lose the Plot.

Here&#39;s How to Keep Them on Track.</a></h4><h6> Vern L. Glaser, Omid Omidvar, and Mehdi Safavi</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> When algorithms aren&#39;t updated to account for changes in the environment, they deliver poor-quality predictions.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> AI models designed to dynamically account for new circumstances don&#39;t always do so effectively. This scenario, called <em>algorithmic inertia</em> , can result in poor guidance and flawed decisions. The authors explored the causes and consequences of algorithmic inertia by investigating credit-ratings agency Moody&#39;s and its use of algorithmic models to rate mortgage-backed securities in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. They found that the most significant contributing factors to algorithmic inertia are buried assumptions, superficial remodeling, simulation of the unknown future, and specialized compartmentalization. Exposing data and assumptions, and periodically redesigning algorithmic routines, are two key practices for heading off such inertia.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/predictive-models-can-lose-the-plot-heres-how-to-keep-them-on-track/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/risk-intelligence-and-the-resilient-company/" class="no-underline">Risk Intelligence and the Resilient Company</a></h4><h6> Ananya Sheth and Joseph V. Sinfield</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Taking a more logical approach to risk management can help leaders sustain value generation amid disruption and uncertainty.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> Building the resilience of large, complex enterprises is critical in today&#39;s interconnected world. Risk intelligence — the honed ability to rigorously interpret risks and the consequences or opportunities they pose for a company — supports organizational resilience by helping leaders identify and manage a broad array of potential threats to their company&#39;s value exchange system, both over time and across changing business contexts. To strengthen their organization&#39;s risk intelligence, leaders should systematically categorize and interpret risk events, compartmentalize uncertainty and reduce its impact, and construct and contextualize an enterprise risk network.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/risk-intelligence-and-the-resilient-company/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-professional-services-firms-dodged-disruption/" class="no-underline">How Professional Services Firms Dodged Disruption</a></h4><h6> Julian Birkinshaw and David Lancefield</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Professional services firms with longevity hold lessons for other businesses trying to survive disruptions in turbulent markets.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> Big professional services firms appeared to be in the crosshairs of new, technology-fueled competitors a decade ago, but many have maintained or even bolstered their positions. These consulting giants, top-tier law firms, and others have found resilience in their capacity to diagnose the different causes of potential disruption and respond accordingly. They have doubled down on their traditional strengths of tackling clients&#39; most challenging problems and providing advice and compliance in high-impact, large-scale, high-risk situations — and charging a premium to do so. And they have learned to live with a pragmatic acknowledgment that their fundamentals are sound, tempered with a touch of paranoid suspicion of emerging technologies and competitors.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-professional-services-firms-dodged-disruption/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-missing-discipline-behind-failure-to-scale/" class="no-underline">The Missing Discipline Behind Failure to Scale</a></h4><h6> Andy Binns and Christine Griffin</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Developing a scaling path for new ventures is both an art and a science, but it&#39;s one that leaders can use to learn and iterate as they go.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> Companies make significant investments in developing new business initiatives, but too few follow a rigorous path to broadly implementing them. While 80% of companies claim to ideate and incubate new ventures, only 16% of companies successfully scale them. Scaling paths require a clarity of ambition equal to the scale of opportunity; a set of plausible strategic options for what assets will be needed to achieve that ambition; smart brainstorming about how to acquire those assets; an openness to bringing in new leaders to support the expanding scope of activities; and preparation for the inevitable high-stakes moments when decisions entail commitments that will be difficult, if not impossible, to reverse.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-missing-discipline-behind-failure-to-scale/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/helping-neurodivergent-employees-succeed/" class="no-underline">Helping Neurodivergent Employees Succeed</a></h4><h6> Emily R. Russo, Dana L. Ott, and Miriam Moeller</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Companies can expand their talent pools by developing a neuroinclusive hiring strategy and work environment.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> When it comes to hiring, management, and retention in the workplace, individuals with neurological differences, especially those on the autism spectrum, are often discounted by employers, to everyone&#39;s detriment. Bringing neurodiversity into the larger conversation about workplace diversity, equity, and inclusion is important not only because it&#39;s the fair thing to do but because neurodivergent individuals can make valuable contributions. Creating a neuroinclusive organization calls for specific training and development efforts that benefit neurodivergent employees and the wider workforce. Managers are key to the success of these programs and need to be educated about how to support their neurodivergent employees.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/helping-neurodivergent-employees-succeed/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-digitally-mature-is-your-finance-office" class="no-underline">How Digitally Mature Is Your Finance Office?</a></h4><h6> Kristof Stouthuysen</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Many finance offices are stuck in traditional operational roles and aren&#39;t benefiting from advanced analytics.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> Finance leaders in a wide range of industries are trying to integrate data and analytics to improve operations, but not all CFOs have cracked the code. In particular, many are not capitalizing on the promise of new machine learning applications. CFOs who are able to challenge an often conservative, cautious culture and manage to successfully deploy advanced analytics can deliver more real-time insights, reduce human error and bias, and speed up processes and decision-making. What&#39;s more, while more traditional finance leaders often guard the data they possess, those who embrace advanced analytics — what the author calls <em>digital finance leaders</em> — become strong advocates for democratizing data across a company&#39;s silos.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-digitally-mature-is-your-finance-office" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/cashing-out-excellence/" class="no-underline">Cashing Out Excellence</a></h4><h6> Robert D. Austin, Robert H. Hayes, and Richard L. Nolan</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Too many leaders engage in <em>performance hacking</em> — delivering on particular metrics to give the appearance of effective leadership without producing real performance.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> Recent disruptive events like the pandemic and war in Europe have exposed businesses weakened by short-sighted leadership decisions. An analysis of Southwest Airlines, Boeing, and GE looks at why successful companies sacrifice the business excellence they spent years building — including values and relationships that have served as their foundation — for near-term financial gains such as cost reductions and stock price improvements that ultimately harm stakeholders.

Nalbantian</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Understanding what factors drive employee promotion can help managers more equitably position women and people of color for advancement.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> New research shows that factors unrelated to employees&#39; knowledge, capabilities, or behavior have an outsize effect on career advancement. Circumstances such as reporting to a high performer, holding a career-accelerator role such as being a supervisor, and not taking advantage of flexible work options all play a leading role in promotions and pay increases. Disparities in performance ratings also have a cascading effect that adversely affects people of color: In the author&#39;s study, people of color in the majority of companies were up to 50% less likely to receive high performance ratings. Because ratings tend to persist, with a high rating one year predicting the likelihood of a high rating the next, getting shut out from the start can significantly impede career progression.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/opening-access-to-the-fast-track-for-career-equity/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-unequal-rewards-of-peer-support-at-work/" class="no-underline">The Unequal Rewards of Peer Support at Work</a></h4><h6> Nancy Baym and Constance Noonan Hadley</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Job satisfaction comes in part from how well people feel their organization recognizes and values the social support they provide to colleagues.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> Employees&#39; supportive behaviors with one another boost engagement and productivity, but research shows that men gain more benefits from such efforts than women do. Social support includes emotional assistance, esteem reinforcement, social companionship, information or advice, and instrumental help. In the authors&#39; study, more women than men focused their efforts on listening, showing personal interest, and complimenting a coworker, while men reported offering career advice more frequently. Although men said they provided less-frequent social support than women overall, they received higher levels of organizational encouragement, rewards, and job satisfaction. Managers can encourage a more equitable peer culture by making the invisible visible and valuable — providing clarity about which behaviors count while also revising performance management systems.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-unequal-rewards-of-peer-support-at-work/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/moving-beyond-islands-of-experimentation-to-ai-everywhere/" class="no-underline">Moving Beyond Islands of Experimentation to AI Everywhere</a></h4><h6> Amit Joshi, Ivy Buche, and Miguel Paredes Sadler</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> It may make sense to start AI efforts with isolated experiments, but new, companywide structures are needed to scale them and reap broader benefits.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> Artificial intelligence often takes root in isolated experiments within an organization, and many companies stall out on their AI journeys because of difficulty moving beyond these pilots. Scaling technology requires different types of formal structures: The authors found that AI projects generally begin as islands of experimentation before coming together around a corporate <em>center of excellence</em> . A small number then move to a sophisticated <em>federation of expertise</em> model built on a centralized base of knowledge, systems, processes, and tools, and on decentralized embedded capabilities. Enterprises with AI ambitions need to be prepared to make two structural leaps away from the startup stage if they are intent on delivering on the technology&#39;s potential.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/moving-beyond-islands-of-experimentation-to-ai-everywhere/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/manage-your-workforce-ecosystem-not-just-your-employees/" class="no-underline">Manage Your Workforce Ecosystem, Not Just Your Employees</a></h4><h6> Elizabeth J. Altman, David Kiron, Jeff Schwartz, and Robin Jones</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> New organizational structures are needed to coordinate workforce ecosystems that include a wide array of external workers and partners.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> A majority of executives agree that the idea of “the workforce” is being redefined. They say it&#39;s broader than an organization&#39;s full-time employees, instead encompassing ecosystems of contractors, gig workers, service providers, and even technologies. These networks require innovative management practices, given that hierarchical, command-and-control leadership is ill suited for workforces that span internal and external boundaries. In developing new practices, leaders must address three types of issues: structural design (pertaining to the division of labor, goals, and incentives), politics (relating to resources, power, and status), and culture (affecting individuals&#39; search for identity and meaning). Intentionally orchestrating a perspective that considers all players leads to a more nuanced view of how organizations and their partners cooperate to meet their strategic goals.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/manage-your-workforce-ecosystem-not-just-your-employees/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/our-guide-to-the-summer-2023-issue/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
