class="callout-info"><h4>这个调查</h4><p>我们分析了从大流行开始到 2023 年 6 月美国护士撰写的 150,000 条评论的自由文本。对于每条评论，我们分析了它是否提到了 200 个主题之一，并评估了护士对该主题的评价是积极还是消极。这些主题源自对员工体验的各个要素的研究，包括文化、薪酬和福利、工作时间表以及感知的组织支持。我们将相关主题聚集成两打更广泛的主题。</p><p>我们将这些主题用作 XGBoost 模型中的特征，该模型以 5 分制预测每位护士对其现任或前任雇主的总体评分。然后，我们计算 SHAP 值（为模型中的每个特征分配一个重要性值），以直接比较不同主题在预测工作满意度方面的相对重要性（通过每个护士给雇主的总体评分来衡量）。我们还使用文本分析来比较旅行护士与医疗保健系统工作人员的护士谈论话题的积极程度。</p><p>使用护士提到的主题以及他们对每个主题的情绪作为预测变量，我们的模型解释了护士之间 29% 到 39% 的评分差异——几乎比我们使用所有权、组织类型和位置所能解释的要高一个数量级作为预测因子。<a id="reflinki" class="reflink" href="#refi">我</a></p></aside><p>医疗保健领导者面临着一系列艰巨的挑战——成本上升、向数字医疗的过渡以及支付模式的转变等等。但根据美国医疗保健高管学院最近的一项调查，医院首席执行官面临的第一大问题是员工短缺和倦怠。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> 90% 的受访首席执行官将护士短缺视为一个特别严重的痛点。</p><p> 2021年，在美国工作的注册护士总数出现40年来最大降幅，其中年轻护士的流失率最高。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a>到 2025 年，美国医疗保健系统可能会短缺多达 45 万名护士，比患者护理所需的护理人员数量少 20%。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p></p><p>高度的工作不满和倦怠正在驱使护士离开这个行业。 COVID-19大流行给所有医护人员带来了巨大压力，但自大流行结束以来，护士的不满和倦怠并没有改善。从某些角度来看，情况可能会变得更糟：2021年，近三分之二的注册护士会鼓励其他人成为一名护士，但只有一半的人表示他们会在两年后推荐护理作为职业。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p>了解护士不满情绪的最丰富来源之一是他们在 Indeed 和 Glassdoor 等招聘网站上如何用自己的话描述自己的工作。这些信息数量庞大，但难以综合，因为其中大部分采用非结构化自由文本的形式。为了了解护士面临的挑战，我们分析了自疫情爆发以来，其中 15 万名护士在 Glassdoor 评论中如何描述其雇主。 （参见“研究”。）在本文中，我们分享了该分析的重要见解，并就如何解决护士最紧迫的问题向医疗保健领导者提供建议。</p><h3>医疗保健领导者脱节</h3><p>护士认为他们的经理与患者护理的日常现实脱节。我们将他们对管理者的评价分为近 50 种领导特质。第二个最常被提及的特征是，管理者没有意识到护士在工作场所面临的挑战。当护士们讨论管理者如何理解床边生活时，十分之九的评论都是负面的。</p><p></p><p>护士们尤其批评高级管理团队成员的脱节。高层团队因脱节而受到批评的可能性是一线主管和中层管理人员的 10 倍。我们的结果证实了另一项调查，其中近一半的医院护士表示，他们认为管理层没有倾听他们的担忧。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a></p><p>为了解决不满和倦怠问题，医疗保健领导者必须首先了解床边发生的情况。这可能具有挑战性，特别是在拥有数千名护士跨多个地点和专业工作的大型医疗保健系统中。</p><p>从历史上看，领导者一直在努力系统地分析护士挫败感的金矿，这些见解可以从员工调查或外部审查中的评论中收集到。阅读、理解和分析大量非结构化文本数据根本不切实际。然而，人工智能的最新进展使得识别大量文本中的深层模式并大规模理解反馈成为可能。领导者现在可以挖掘自由文本，以深入了解导致护士不满和倦怠的问题，并利用这种洞察力改善护理人员的工作生活。 （请参阅“文本分析入门”。）</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>文本分析入门</h4><p>我们的研究分析了来自数百个组织和数十万名护士的数据，但您也可以更深入地研究自己员工的反馈。无论您是在内部、通过劳动力分析功能还是与外部合作伙伴一起开发人工智能文本分析功能，您都应该牢记这些原则，以最大限度地提高文化衡量的有效性。</p><p><strong>精确度很重要，但记忆力也很重要。</strong>精确度（被正确分类为讨论某个主题的文本实例的百分比）是自由文本分析的关键要素。召回率也是如此——文本分析平台捕获的文本正文中主题提及总数的百分比。如果您仅通过精度来衡量成功，那么您最终会得到一个高度准确的分析平台，但会忽略员工实际所说的大部分内容。复杂的人工智能工具将识别俚语、习语、首字母缩略词、文化参考和组织特定的语言，以捕获很少提及但信息丰富的术语的长尾。</p><div class="callout-toggle"><p><strong>让主题专家了解情况。</strong>文本分析的核心是将自然语言分类为有意义的主题。理想情况下，衡量文化的人在开发分析主题时应聘请主题专家。主题专家可以确保所选择的文化和工作场所主题得到明确定义、与现有研究相关联并得到适当衡量。</p><p><strong>李克特问题有严重的缺点，但适度使用会非常有帮助。</strong>太多的李克特量表问题可能会导致调查者进入自动驾驶模式。但李克特的问题不应该被完全抛弃。有效的文化衡量将广泛主题（例如参与度、流失意图和其他重要衡量标准）的李克特规模结果与自由文本数据相结合，以确定在数百个自由文本主题中哪些对结果具有最强大的影响。</p><p><strong>透明度很重要，而且未来可能会更加重要。</strong>虽然人工智能将如何受到监管还有待观察，但立法者或法院可能不会善待黑盒模型做出的重要决策，而不解释这些模型如何得出结论。领导者经常依靠文化衡量来做出重要决策，例如薪酬政策、人事变动以及如何优先考虑资源。他们应该警惕完全依赖做出人类无法理解的决策的模型。</p><p><strong>员工们讨厌你监视他们——而且你不会学到太多关于文化的知识。</strong>领导者应该抵制诱惑，将文本分析工作扩展到电子邮件、Slack 渠道、电话消息和其他并非旨在提供员工反馈的沟通形式的内容。许多员工认为监听他们的工作谈话是窃听或更糟的行为。此外，工作电子邮件和 Slack 消息所包含的文化信息往往比明确邀请员工讨论组织中有效和无效的问题提示少得多。让员工倾听双方同意的意见，并让老大哥远离工作场所。</p></div></article></aside></div><h3>通过基准测试确定相对优势和机会</h3><p>不同雇主的护理满意度差异很大。我们确定了美国 200 家最大的医疗保健雇主，包括医院和医疗保健系统、家庭医疗保健提供者、老年生活设施运营商以及人才中介机构。对于每位雇主，我们计算了从 COVID-19 大流行开始到 2023 年 6 月，护士在 Glassdoor 上对组织和高级领导层的评价<a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">。6</a></p><p>在大型雇主中，护士的 Glassdoor 评分范围从很差（2.6）到近乎完美（4.9）（满分 5 分）。护士对大流行期间和之后高级领导表现的评估更加多样化，在相同的 5 分制中，从 2.1 到 4.9 不等。 Glassdoor 评级的巨大差异与另一项调查一致，该调查显示美国 60 家医院中护士不满意的比例从 2% 到 48% 不等。 <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p> 200 家大型医疗保健组织的员工可以使用我们的<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/nursing-satisfaction-index/">交互式工具</a>来查看他们的组织相对于其他组织的排名。该指数根据护士的总体评分、对最高领导层的评估以及护士满意度的四个最有力的预测因素进行排序：薪酬、工作量、组织支持和有毒文化。 </p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sull_Nursing_Interactive_512.jpg" class="launchscreen no-mobile"></p><h4>护士如何评价他们的雇主？</h4><p class="caption">使用护理满意度指数来比较护士如何评估 200 家大型医疗保健组织的员工体验。</p><p></p></article></aside></div><p>平均而言，在人事代理机构工作的护士（有时被称为旅行护士）比其他护士更满意。我们样本中排名最高的五家雇主（前十名中的六家）是人才中介机构。</p><p>当然，较高的薪酬是造成这种差异的部分原因，但不是全部。我们比较了在人才中介机构工作的护士与医院和医疗保健系统雇用的护士谈论 200 个话题的积极程度。 （参见“人事机构在许多关键因素上的评分更高”。）虽然机构护士对薪酬的看法更有利，但围绕解决护士问题和开放、诚实的沟通问题，两组之间的情绪差距更大。通过将护士视为客户，人才中介机构擅长提高满意度，而不仅仅是支付更高的工资。其他医疗保健领导者可以从他们的例子中学习，我们将在下面提出一些具体建议。</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>人才中介机构在许多关键因素上的评分更高</h4><p class="caption">我们分析了从大流行开始到 2023 年 6 月期间美国 Glassdoor 护士评论的自由文本，以了解他们对各种话题的积极评价。然后，我们将在人才中介机构工作的护士的积极情绪与在医院和医疗保健系统工作的护士的积极情绪进行了比较。虽然人事代理机构在许多关键主题上的评分较高，包括诚实沟通、有效解决问题和建立信任，但医院和医疗保健系统在学习和发展、福利、同事和晋升机会方面表现更强。 </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sull_Nursing_Fig1.png" alt="人才中介机构在许多关键因素上的评分更高" /><br /></article></aside></div><h3>优先考虑工作满意度的驱动因素</h3><p>为了了解护士工作满意度的驱动因素，我们分析了样本中护士自 COVID-19 大流行开始以来撰写的所有评论的自由文本，并将文本分为近 200 个主题。 <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a>然后，我们将主题分为两打更广泛的主题，并使用这些主题来预测护士对其雇主的总体评分。然后我们比较了每个主题在预测收视率方面的相对重要性。 （参见“护士工作满意度的最高和最低预测因素。”）</p><p></p><p>薪酬是护士对当前雇主满意度的首要预测因素，这并不奇怪，因为在我们分析的期间，通货膨胀侵蚀了实得工资的购买力。工作量的重要性是第二重要的驱动因素，这与另一项大规模调查的结果相吻合，该调查发现人员配备不足是护士工作不满、倦怠和辞职意愿的最强预测因素。 <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p>工作量和薪酬是护理危机必须解决的根本原因，但它们并不是影响护士工作满意度的唯一因素。我们的分析揭示了工作环境的其他方面，包括有毒文化、组织支持、工作时间表、沟通、学习和发展机会，领导者可以关注这些方面来改善护士的工作生活。</p><p>该分析还强调了不太可能改善护士工作场所体验的领域。福利固然不错，但无法弥补繁重的工作量或跟不上通货膨胀的工资。强调促进患者健康的企业使命也无济于事。护士们已经知道他们的工作有更高的目标；这就是为什么他们中的大多数人首先成为护士。</p><h3>挖掘自由文本以获得可行的见解</h3><p>许多医疗保健组织依赖年度员工调查，其中有数十个项目按 5 分制评分，并事后添加了一些开放式问题。面对一长串的多项选择题，员工很容易转向自动驾驶仪，并为非常不同的项目分配相似的分数。问题的选择限制了员工可以讨论的内容，而且很少有空间来扩展他们为什么选择特定的数字答案。</p><p>开放式的自由文本反馈提供了丰富的细致入微且可操作的见解来源。当护士可以决定要写哪些主题时，他们会利用自己的自由来讨论对他们来说最重要的事情。开放式问题为护士提供了用自己的语言阐述他们的担忧、提供关键背景并针对他们面临的问题提出具体和可行的解决方案的空间。个人自由文本回复可以汇总为更广泛的主题，以确定领导者可以集中注意力和有限资源的优先顺序，以最大程度地提高护士满意度。</p><p>虽然组织平均值很有用，但重要的是要记住，不同的亚文化可以在同一组织内共存。对于通过并购发展起来的大型医疗保健系统来说尤其如此。例如，一家全国性连锁医院在近 50 个地点的评级范围为 1.9 到 3.9。医疗保健领导者不能仅仅依赖组织平均水平，而必须衡量和分析地点、部门、职能、团队和个人领导者之间的差异。</p><p>女性、代表性不足的少数族裔和年长员工也会体验到与其他员工截然不同的组织文化。 <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a>了解不同员工群体工作满意度和倦怠的驱动因素至关重要。</p><p></p><p>领导者可以挖掘免费文本，详细了解特定群体最关键的痛点，并相应地调整干预措施。例如，日程安排对护士的工作满意度有重大影响，但日程安排的哪些方面最重要将取决于具体职位。轮班安排的灵活性和不间断工作休息的能力对于医院和初级保健机构的护士来说非常重要，而家庭保健护士则非常看重可预测的时间表。 <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a></p><p>护士的意见为改善工作场所和患者护理提供了宝贵的实用建议。例如，我们研究的 Glassdoor 评论包括数十条关于雇主如何改进日程安排的可行建议。有些是易于实施的行动，例如使用应用程序更容易接班或调换班次，或者向最后一刻接班的护士支付 20 至 50 美元的奖金。其他则是更为系统性的改变，比如让护士加入一个制定时间表的委员会，或者确保接受学费援助的员工能够安排他们的课程的工作。</p><h3>倾听离开您组织的护士的心声</h3><p>大多数组织将调查范围限制在现任员工。离职面谈如果有的话，也是随意进行的，而前员工的反馈往往被视为不满者的咆哮。但忽视前员工的反馈是一个很大的错误。 </p><div class="post_video_player fit-video"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KJE4DW0Lbuk?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>对前员工进行访谈或调查可以揭示他们离职的原因，并找出留住人才的最有效行动。由于没有报复的威胁，即将离开（或已经离开）组织的护士更有可能提供坦诚的反馈，甚至是当前员工不愿讨论的禁忌问题。通过收集离职者的反馈，组织可以发现潜在的盲点。</p><p>在我们的样本中，超过三分之一的 Glassdoor 评论是由前员工撰写的，这些评论提供了对用脚投票的护士最重要的见解。 <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a>图左侧的条形图“护士工作满意度的最高和最低预测因素”对预测离职护士如何评价其前雇主的因素进行了排名，它揭示了护士可能离职的一个关键原因。</p><p>在 <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/why-every-leader-needs-to-worry-about-toxic-culture/">之前的一篇文章</a>中，我们认为五种行为属性——不尊重、不包容、不道德、残酷和虐待——将组织文化标记为有毒。 <a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a>在辞职的护士中，有毒文化对他们总体满意度的预测作用是薪酬或工作量的两倍多。有毒工作场所对辞职护士的重要性与早期的研究一致，该研究发现毒性是大辞职的前六个月内行业调整后人员流失的最强预测因素。 <a id="reflink14" class="reflink" href="#ref14">14</a></p><p>在大流行后时代，有毒文化对于护士来说变得更加重要。当我们比较哪些因素最能预测护士在大流行前后对雇主的评价时，发现在 COVID-19 之后，有毒文化的相对重要性获得了最大的提升（其次是工作量、幸福感和薪酬）。如果您的组织遭受文化毒性，我们的另一篇文章“<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-fix-a-toxic-culture/">如何修复有毒文化</a>”提出了几种基于证据的干预措施，医疗保健领导者可以用来为自己的组织排毒。</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside

class="attribution"></article></aside></div><h3>学习人才中介机构的做法</h3><p>正如“人事机构在许多关键因素上评分较高”这一数字所示，护士对人事机构为快速有效地解决问题而制定的流程非常积极。在提及人事代理机构流程效率的护士中，75% 的护士持积极态度，而只有 23% 的护士对医疗保健系统表示积极看法。对于旅行护士来说，常见的流程问题包括入职、获得所需的证书和执照、合同谈判和报销。最好的人才中介机构会听取反馈，深入了解旅行护士面临的典型问题，并优化工作流程来解决这些问题。</p><p>专职护士遇到的许多痛点与机构护士所遇到的痛点有所不同。然而，医疗保健系统、家庭保健机构和长期护理提供者可以采用类似的方法来捕获和分析护士的反馈，优先考虑他们面临的最常见和令人沮丧的挑战，并与工作人员合作解决这些问题。</p><p>持续倾听反馈并采取行动也可以与护理人员建立信任。与在医院和医疗保健系统工作的护士相比，人事机构的护士更积极地认为拥有心理安全感，可以说出困难的问题并让别人听到。</p><p>然而，如果管理层对护士提出的问题反应迟缓，心理安全的好处就会减弱。护士们高度评价人才中介机构对她们的问题和疑虑的快速反应。相比之下，护士经常抱怨其他类型的雇主即使得到回复，也对提出问题的电子邮件回复缓慢。护士还非常重视与主管的多种沟通渠道，包括短信、电子邮件、Facebook、Jabber 和 24/7 热线。</p><p>我们研究的另一个见解是护士重视诚实和透明度。他们和任何人一样了解医疗保健面临的挑战，并且希望就组织中正在发生的事情、它如何影响他们以及做出决定的原因进行诚实的沟通。 Triage 是一家人才中介机构，也是我们研究的第四高评价的大型雇主，它将诚实的沟通置于其价值主张的中心：“我们按事实说话，这样你就不会对其进展感到惊讶。” <a id="reflink15" class="reflink" href="#ref15">15</a></p><p>医疗保健系统可以向人才中介机构学习，但也可以利用自己的独特优势来吸引和留住护士。全职护士在组织生活的三个重要方面对医院和医疗保健系统的评价高于人才中介机构：学习和发展（包括晋升机会和培训报销）、福利和同事。这三个因素是护士评价雇主的十大预测因素之一。医疗保健系统应投资于其比较优势，并在向潜在和现有员工传达其价值主张时强调这些优势。</p><p></p><h3>将反馈转化为行动以建立信任</h3><p>收集员工反馈是一回事，但持续根据这些见解采取行动则是另一回事。如果员工认为管理者不会采取行动，他们就不太可能提出问题或提出潜在的解决方案。 <a id="reflink16" class="reflink" href="#ref16">16</a>更糟糕的是，如果员工认为管理层缺乏权力、资源或兴趣根据他们的建议进行变革，他们更有可能辞职。 <a id="reflink17" class="reflink" href="#ref17">17</a>近一半的护士认为管理层不会解决临床工作人员提请他们注意的问题。 <a id="reflink18" class="reflink" href="#ref18">18</a></p><p>组织需要建立适当的结构，以一致地根据员工的反馈采取行动。一个著名的例子是 Kaiser Permanente 的单位团队 (UBT)，该团队由经常在特定单位或部门一起工作的临床工作人员和管理人员组成。 <a id="reflink19" class="reflink" href="#ref19">19</a>这些团队每月至少召开一次会议，对其部门的绩效负责，并由一名经理、一名劳工代表以及通常还有一名临床工作人员共同领导。</p><p> UBT 确定了四个方面的改进机会：质量（包括患者治疗结果）、患者服务、负担能力和员工体验。团队利用员工反馈来识别改进机会并确定其优先顺序。接下来，团队使用最佳实践和基于证据的方法开发和测试解决方案。一旦解决方案被认为有效，就会在整个单位、部门，或者在某些情况下整个组织中实施。然后，UBT 监控这些变化对患者治疗结果、员工满意度和成本降低的影响。</p><p></p><p>自 COVID-19 爆发以来，我们对美国护士撰写的 150,000 条评论进行了研究，结果显示，护士对雇主的整体评价存在很大差异，特别是在薪酬、工作量、有毒文化和组织支持方面——这四个因素对雇主的影响最大。塑造护士的工作满意度。我们认为，这种变化传达了希望的信息。尽管所有医疗保健组织都面临结构性挑战，但<em>仍有</em>可能提供一个让护士每天都期待上班的环境。</p><p>许多组织，包括一些最大的护士雇主，都有很大的改进空间。这些排名的目的不是为了“点名羞辱”，而是为了让医疗保健领导者意识到他们的组织绩效与为护士提供健康工作场所的可能性之间存在巨大差距。我们还希望有关医疗保健组织如何在对护士最重要的因素上排名的客观数据可以为他们的领导者提供改进的动力，并提供证据让所有利益相关者相信变革的迫切需要。</p><p></p><p>领导者不应该做的是要求护士更加努力地工作，承受更多的挫折和压力，却不能理解和解决使许多人的生活变得悲惨的组织因素。当工作人员辞职、工人成立工会以及州和联邦立法者制定保护护士利益的法规时，继续照常营业的领导者不应感到惊讶。</p><p>为了改善护士乃至所有卫生保健工作者的工作生活，领导者必须收集他们的反馈并根据他们的反馈采取行动，认识到组织的不同部门和不同人群将面临独特的挑战和问题。倾听护士的心声表明，医疗保健领导者可以采取一些有意义的措施来解决护理危机。最重要的一步是首先倾听他们的意见。</p><p></p>

|盖蒂图片社</p></figcaption></figure><p>无论求职者的渠道有多么多样化，如果我们没有适当地准备我们的组织环境，那么我们努力寻找、招募和欢迎有才华的专业人士的可能性就会很大。许多组织已制定措施来监控和增加其多元化招聘；然而，很少有人关注雇佣后发生的事情。只有当我们有效地创造一个更加公平的环境并支持女性和有色人种驾驭它时，我们才能从全体员工的充分参与和贡献中受益，并避免他们因人员流动或脱离而流失。</p><p>职业少数群体——那些因性别或性身份、种族、年龄或其他因素而在其职业中<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/unleash-the-superpowers-of-your-one-and-only-employees/">相对稀有的</a>人——已经实现了无数人梦寐以求的事情：他们突破了玻璃天花板，驾驭了通常不友善的环境 <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90920778/navigating-the-jungle-beyond-the-glass-cliff-part-i">企业丛林里</a>，往往能成功渡过<a href=" https://www.businessinsider.com/women-and-people-of-color-face-glass-cliff-us-2020-7?op=1">玻璃悬崖</a>。尽管代表组织中不同群体的高管已经成功克服了这些挑战，但仍然有一项重要任务：为其他人开辟一条可以遵循的道路。这是一项艰巨、艰苦的工作，需要许多不同的工具和能力，但如果其他人想要安全地航行，这是必要的。</p><p></p><h3>维持多样性的步骤</h3><p>尽管各种资源为来自代表性不足人群的专业人士如何驾驭和克服组织挑战提供了建议，但组织识别<a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/stop-telling-women-they-have-imposter-syndrome">持续存在的系统性偏见和种族主义的</a>根源并采取具体行动解决这些问题同样重要。组织可以采取以下五个步骤来开始创建更具包容性的环境，让所有员工都有平等的机会在职业生涯中茁壮成长和进步。</p><h4>步骤 1：通过赞助建立领导层对多元化的承诺。</h4><p>整个组织的领导层必须表现出对多样性和包容性的坚定承诺。当领导者树立这些行为榜样时，整个组织的员工自然会效仿他们的榜样。然而，这一承诺不能仅限于一次性的努力或企业价值观的声明。</p><p>领导者必须通过帮助培养和装备这些候选人以获得晋升，有意识地表现出他们对聘用代表性不足的人群的承诺。具体来说，每位领导者，无论组织级别如何，都应该至少确定一名这样的候选人来有意赞助。在了解候选人的背景、职业目标和支持需求后，领导者应该 (1) 在组织中为他们提供咨询，(2) 支持他们发展职业发展所需的能力，并且最重要的是，(3 ）帮助他们获得进步的领导地位。</p><p></p><p>尽管正式的指导、赞助和伙伴计划可能对这一努力有所帮助，但非正式发展的关系往往同样（如果不是更多的话）有回报和有益，并且在一个人或两个人晋升或离开组织后往往会持续很长时间。</p><h4>第二步：通过解决系统性因素来消除玻璃天花板。</h4><p>玻璃天花板的比喻描述了阻碍某些群体（通常是女性和有色人种）获得职业发展和晋升的高水平机会的歧视制度。表明您的组织内存在玻璃天花板的线索包括，与整体员工队伍相比，高层管理人员和高管人员缺乏多样性；具有相似角色和资格的个人之间的薪酬差异；对某些人群的指导、赞助、发展或晋升有限；对于哪些群体比其他群体更适合领导角色存在明显或隐含的偏见；代表性不足的群体中的人员流失率超过了其他群体。</p><p>要识别并消除组织中的玻璃天花板，请仔细审查员工体验的各个方面。例如，使用盲目招聘技术解决有偏见的招聘和晋升做法；审查薪资范围和晋升标准，确保同工同酬；为所有员工提供清晰的职业道路和发展机会。多元化目标、包容性举措以及关于识别和避免无意识偏见的员工教育也可以支持有利于多元化的氛围。支持灵活的工作安排和工作与生活的平衡可以鼓励员工的充分参与，否则他们可能会因为平衡个人和职业责任的需要而被忽视。</p><p></p><h4>第三步：通过尽职调查减少玻璃悬崖。</h4><p> <em>“玻璃悬崖”</em>一词描述了一种现象，即在危机时期优先选择女性和其他少数群体担任领导职务，从而使她们面临更大的失败风险。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a>这种现象跨行业、跨地区、女性和少数民族都有发生。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a>仅在危机时期为代表性不足的人群提供领导机会的问题在于，那些在动荡时期担任领导的人往往被视为问题的一部分，这使陈规定型观念长期存在，并减少了此类候选人未来的机会。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p>为了避免这种结果，在指派领导者解决问题之前，必须注意认识并充分检查情况。虽然一头扎进去并采取措施“止血”的诱惑是巨大的，但花适当的时间首先充分理解问题只是为了大大提高成功机会而付出的很小的代价。诊断过程应包括从所有利益相关者的角度确定项目参数（例如绩效目标、截止日期和预算）、项目利益相关者、过去采取的行动、当前情况和期望的结果。我关于<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/from-glass-ceilings-to-glass-cliffs-a-guide-to-jumping-not-falling/">玻璃悬崖现象的</a>文章提供了有关尽职调查过程以及可用于诊断这些情况的问题的更多详细信息。只有诊断出问题后，才有可能选择最合适的候选人来领导这项工作。</p><h4>第四步：通过改变对话来拓宽途径。</h4><p>对于女性和有色人种来说，企业环境可能充满挑战。许多挑战都是系统性的，例如使<a href="https://hbr.org/2022/03/women-face-a-double-disadvantage-in-the-hybrid-workplace">某些群体相对于其他群体处于不利地位的</a>组织文化，或者需要长时间在办公室工作和全天候响应的工作量和行为期望。这些系统性挑战可能会使企业环境显得陌生和敌对。反过来，职业少数群体可能会通过护理认知偏差来弥补，这些偏差会导致信心过高或过低。将他们的社交网络限制在类似的同伴身上，而不是培养与赞助商、导师和职业指南的<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90932520/navigating-the-jungle-beyond-the-glass-cliff-part-ii">重要联系</a>；未能实现适当的工作与生活平衡。</p><p>尽管领导者必须刻意支持职业少数群体（步骤 1），但整个组织中的导师、支持者和盟友在引导候选人走向成功方面也发挥着重要作用，因为他们也已经成功地领导了组织。支持新兴领导者意味着改变典型的指导对话。典型的对话包括确定受训者的短期和长期目标，并寻求导师的情境建议、技能发展指导和绩效反馈。支持多样性、公平性、包容性和归属感的指导应包括一个清晰的职业发展框架、对各种机会和职位如何有助于候选人职业目标的解释，以及如何驾驭组织文化的讨论——所有这些鉴于他们作为职业少数群体所面临的玻璃天花板、玻璃悬崖和系统性挑战。</p><p>认知偏见也应该成为谈话的一部分，这样候选人就可以避免陷入过度自信和过度补偿所察觉到的缺点的陷阱。对认知偏差的评估和调整最好的方法是收集受训者在关键任务上的表现的 360 度反馈，并让受训者描述他们与执行这些任务相关的感受、想法和一般经验。当受训者的任务绩效处于或低于平均水平，而他们自己对该任务的体验反映了强烈的热情、满足感和成就感时，可能会出现过度自信。相反，当受训者的任务绩效被评估为或高于平均水平时，可能会发生过度补偿，但他们所描述的经历表明他们在任务上花费了太多时间，或者他们对自己的绩效心怀担忧。</p><h4>第 5 步：衡量并跟踪进度。</h4><p>流行的商业格言是，我们必须检查我们的期望。这一不言而喻的道理同样适用于任何多元化努力。该过程首先根据关键的多样性指标（例如不同员工群体的招聘、保留和晋升）来定义成功是什么样子。也许你会忍不住想就此打住。然而，确定目标仅仅是开始。此外，有必要衡量组织当前在这些 KPI 上的绩效，然后检查为什么会出现这种当前状态。了解组织当前的绩效需要进行以下评估：</p><p> <strong>1. 衡量买入。</strong>组织领导者和成员在多大程度上理解并同意定义的 KPI 是正确的指标和绩效目标？</p><p> <strong>2. 衡量可行性。</strong>哪些组织结构、流程和其他功能有助于实现 KPI？哪些特征威胁或阻碍成就？</p><p> <strong>3. 衡量支持需求。</strong>领导者被教导要根据每个下属的技能水平来适应每个下属的需求。同样，整个组织的领导者需要调整他们提供的监督、鼓励和指导的程度，因为不同技能水平的部门和员工都致力于实现多元化目标。例如，招聘部门在从代表性不足的群体中招聘专业人员方面相对缺乏经验，需要强有力的、循序渐进的指导和频繁的反馈，直到他们的能力得到提高，而在培养和吸纳此类专业人员方面技能娴熟的经理通常应该允许他们自主地充分发挥自己的才能。</p><p></p><p>随着计划的实施，继续定期评估这些指标，以衡量您的进展并调整您的努力。俗话说：“凡事经过衡量，才能完成”。只有经过精心定义并定期评估，您的多元化目标才会实现。</p><p></p><p></p><p>我经常是我工作过的组织中为数不多的黑人领导人之一。在我职业生涯的某个时刻，我曾在两次按级别分开的会议上担任市政厅发言人——一次由普通员工参加，另一次由管理层参加。尽管黑人客户服务代表很惊喜地看到一个看起来像他们的人担任行政职务，但我感到震惊和沮丧地意识到我们几乎整个客户服务代表队伍都是黑人，而我们所有的主管和经理都是白人。这令人费解，因为从招聘的角度来看，领导团队似乎很关心多样性，但显而易见的是，系统性障碍正在阻碍来自代表性不足群体的专业人士的保留和晋升。</p><p>通常，只有当高管、董事会成员或人力资源团队注意到组织高层缺乏多样性时，人才管理系统中的问题才会被注意到——但通常人们对此知之甚少，也很少得到解决。这种晋升上的差异至少可以部分解释为不友善的组织环境以及需要拓宽这些专业人员从代表性不足的群体中获得成功的途径。</p><p>组织领导者、教练、导师、赞助商和其他潜在的职业推动者都可以在消除不平等根源和帮助职业少数群体在企业环境中生存和发展方面发挥作用。随着越来越多的多元化专业人士群体走上职业成功之路，这条道路将变得更加顺畅和广泛，从而导致持续和累积的组织转型。</p><p></p>

class="attribution">安娜丽莎·格拉萨诺</p></figcaption></figure><p>薪酬透明度法被誉为解决性别工资差距的一种补救措施，美国各地州和地方各级越来越多地推出<a href="https://www.adp.com/spark/articles/2023/03/pay-transparency-what-it-is-and-laws-by-state.aspx">薪酬透明度法</a>。截至 9 月份，包括纽约在内的九个州目前正在规范薪酬披露的某些方面。国家妇女法律中心报告称，总共有超过四分之一的美国雇员居住在<a href="https://nwlc.org/resource/pay-range-transparency-laws-benefit/">薪酬信息受到监管的</a>地区。</p><p>总的来说，薪酬透明度法规强调披露广告职位的薪酬范围和内部晋升机会。这些法律旨在确保同工同酬，有效缩小性别工资差距。逻辑很简单：如果工资过低的员工，包括女性和少数族裔，不知道他们的同事的工资是多少，那么他们在通过诉讼和谈判创造公平竞争环境时就会处于明显的劣势。当不平等现象仍然蒙在鼓里时，如何解决不平等问题呢？如果没有薪酬透明度，现有法律（例如<a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/equal-pay-act-1963">1963 年《同工同酬法案》）</a>的执行就会变得困难。根据<a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/fact-sheet-notable-eeoc-litigation-involving-pay-discrimination">最近的案例</a>和已暴露的显着差异（有些跨越多年的少付），更大的透明度似乎可以发挥重要作用。</p><p></p><h3>对不断变化的监管环境的组织反应</h3><p>尽管薪酬透明度法规得到越来越广泛的采用，但许多组织的反应却是抵制、抵制和最低限度的合规性。科罗拉多州于 2021 年成为第一个要求组织披露广告职位薪资范围的州后，在全国范围内招募求职者的组织开始<a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/state-and-local-updates/pages/some-employers-are-excluding-colorado-applicants-for-remote-work.aspx">明确将科罗拉多州居民排除</a>在考虑范围之外，以规避新法律，促使该州劳工部发出 <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/coloradans-excluded-job-listings-department-labor/">警告和罚款</a>。另一种组织策略是遵守薪资信息要求，薪资范围过大，以至于申请人无法有意义地预测他们可能会得到的薪资。在一个著名的例子中，Netflix 发布了一份薪资范围<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/90000-to-900000-pay-transparency-laws-usher-in-baffling-pay-ranges-in-job-postings-200857290.html">为 90,000 美元到 900,000 美元的</a>职位。</p><p>虽然组织层面遵守透明度法律的方法有多种形式，但领导者对薪酬透明度对其业务运营和文化的潜在负面影响表达了一些共同的担忧：</p><ul><li><strong>每个人都会要求更多的钱吗？</strong>更多的薪酬信息可能会引发更多关于薪酬的讨论（以及为什么有人会得到他们的工资）。经理们担心，他们会陷入困境，试图兼顾预算和员工满意度方面的相互竞争的目标。</li><li><strong>如果一些员工发现他们的工资低于其他人，会发生什么？</strong>向老员工解释为什么他们的薪酬与新员工相同可能会让人感到不舒服，并会引发对雇主的严厉批评。</li><li><strong>薪酬透明度会影响我们的合作能力吗？</strong>当个人认为自己得到不公平的回报时，薪酬透明度可能会引起嫉妒和适得其反的竞争。经理们担心，当差异暴露出来时，员工可能会互相争斗并破坏彼此的利益。</li></ul><p></p><h3>管理薪酬透明度的新见解</h3><p>我们的工作为解决组织在透明度方面的一些主要问题提供了新的见解。大多数新法律只专注于通过要求组织披露空缺职位的薪酬范围来创造薪酬透明度。在学术研究中，这种形式的透明度被称为<em>分配透明度</em>，因为它仅披露有关员工工资<em>金额</em>的信息。</p><p>然而，在我们的研究中，我们描述了几种使薪酬信息透明的方法。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a><em>程序透明</em>，重点是共享有关如何制定薪酬<em>决策的</em>信息；在最透明的层面上，这将包括计算薪酬的公式（例如基本工资或基于绩效的加薪）。</p><p>区分分配透明度和程序透明度至关重要，因为正如我们的研究表明，程序透明度可以减轻与分配透明度相关的许多风险和缺点。</p><p>薪酬透明度法规隐含的理念是，工资过低的员工将自行协商<a href="https://qz.com/how-women-can-use-pay-transparency-to-negotiate-1850228867">争取更公平的工资</a>。事实上，过去二十年对超过 100,000 名学者进行的一项大规模研究发现，薪酬透明度的变化与男女之间的工资平等程度显着提高有关。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a>然而，研究还表明，透明度并不等于<em>每个人都</em>要求更多。</p><p>为了进一步探索这一点，我们进行了一系列四项实验，以更好地了解薪酬透明度<em>如何</em>以及<em>何时</em>可以鼓励员工（尤其是女性）更有效地谈判公平工资。在我们的第一项研究中，实验室参与者在四轮流行的单词搜索游戏后根据他们的表现获得报酬，并有机会谈判以获得更好的报酬。在研究 2、3 和 4 中，在线参与者准备好进行绩效评估，并掌握有关绩效和薪酬的不同程度的信息，以便可能就更好的年度加薪进行谈判。他们被告知预计加薪 3%，但加薪幅度可能在 3% 到 10% 之间。在这些研究中，我们改变了参与者可以获得的信息量，包括其他人的报酬金额以及参与者相对于同龄人的表现。</p><p>这些研究得出了关于分配和程序薪酬透明度的四项重要发现：</p><p> <strong>1.人们进行了更清晰的比较。</strong>我们发现，判断某人是否试图通过谈判争取更高薪酬的最佳预测因素是他们相对于同事的表现。与平均绩效者相比，当高绩效者知道自己相对于其他人的排名时，他们要求更高薪酬的可能性大约高出 50%。值得注意的是，在我们的研究中，参与者看到了其团队成员上一年的绩效和薪酬数据，很明显，绩效的提高与薪酬的提高直接相关。尽管没有一个明确的公式表明基于绩效的薪酬，但这一信息向参与者提供了一个明确的信号：加薪很大程度上取决于绩效。</p><p> <strong>2. 人们公平地进行谈判。</strong>表现一般的员工更有可能接受向他们提供的最低加薪，通常认为根据他们的表现加薪是公平的。正如一位人士所说，“考虑到我这一年只达到了预期，而不是超出预期，要求更高的加薪似乎是徒劳的，也是不劳而获的。”一般来说，表现一般的员工很少要求最高加薪，部分原因是他们考虑到自己的表现低于某些同事。不过，只有当他们掌握了所有信息时，这才是真的。当他们不知道自己的表现时，85％的人要求最高工资金额。由于缺乏绩效信息，表现一般的员工要求薪资范围内的最高加薪。</p><p> <strong>3.女性<em>确实</em>要求更高的工资。</strong>与普遍的假设相反，女性似乎不需要太多鼓励来进行谈判。事实上，当考虑参加谈判的参与者的百分比时，女性往往比男性更有可能进行谈判（尽管这在统计上并不存在显着差异）。这些发现对以下观点提出了一些质疑：性别工资差距的原因之一是女性谈判的频率低于男性。最近的研究结合了数十项谈判研究的信息得出了相同的结论：近年来，男性和女性之间的许多谈判差距已基本消失。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a>虽然这是个好消息，但它对于缩小目前的性别工资差距几乎没有作用。</p><p> <strong>4.人们有动力去表现得更好。</strong>表现一般的员工表达了更加努力工作、表现更好的动机，以便在下一个审核周期中获得更高的加薪。当被问及为什么不通过谈判争取更多的钱时，一位参与者表示：“我的数据并没有表明我应该得到更高的加薪。如果第二年的数字更好，就有理由提高加薪。”另一位则表示，“我知道自己的工作表现一般，所以我希望未来能做得更好，并希望明年能得到更好的加薪。”</p><p>我们的研究结果复制并扩展了管理研究中一个古老但强大的概念：<em>公平过程效应</em>。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a>如果员工相信不利的结果是由公平的系统产生的，他们就会接受这些结果。换句话说，如果人们知道<em>为什么</em>他们的工资较低（换句话说，程序透明），他们就不会做出消极反应，甚至可能会更加努力地工作。</p><h3>让薪酬透明度为您的组织带来双赢</h3><p>薪酬透明度可以是双赢的机会，而不是合规障碍。但仅仅在招聘启事中列出薪资数据而没有任何符合法规的背景可能是一个很大的错误。这些做法不仅无视法律的精神，而且付出了沉重的代价并丧失了重要的机会。领导者的思考应该超越合规性，并考虑如何战略性地利用组织的薪酬透明度，以提高申请人的吸引力和员工的保留率。我们的研究为如何做到这一点提供了一些见解。</p><p><strong>让薪酬只是透明度等式的<em>一部分</em>。</strong>人们普遍担心透明度会增加劳动力成本、引起嫉妒并引发冲突，但事实是，薪酬保密本身也会带来问题。 Payscale 的研究人员发现，大多数员工<a href="https://www.payscale.com/content/whitepaper/Fair-pay-perception-and-pay-transparency-combat-turnover.pdf">不确定自己的薪酬是否公平</a>，许多人认为自己的薪酬过低，而事实并非如此，这导致更大的人员流动和不满。我们的研究表明，如果没有绩效参考点，员工几乎没有基础来判断薪酬是否公平，因此更有可能提出不合理的要求。绩效<em>和</em>薪酬的透明度可以让员工更好地评估其薪酬的公平性并提出更合理的要求。</p><p></p><p><strong>关注薪酬决策过程。</strong>程序透明度有助于管理人员更清楚地与员工沟通薪酬问题，因为工资/奖金是基于绩效而不是基于看似无形的因素，或者更糟糕的是充满偏见的因素。提供有关如何确定薪酬的信息可以帮助现任员工了解为什么他们的薪酬高于或低于同事，更重要的是，了解如何晋升。当薪酬直接由绩效决定时，管理者就不能被指责有偏袒和偏见，这使得他们在薪酬谈判中处于协作角色。这些对话以绩效为重点，可以关注发展并研究员工如何才能表现得更好并获得更高的加薪。</p><p><strong>认识到（分配）薪酬透明度本身并不能解决不平等问题。</strong>有一种假设认为，薪酬分配透明度将缩小薪酬差距；然而，有证据表明，仅靠这一点不足以创造一个公平的工作场所。研究表明，女性和男性<em>要求</em>加薪的<a href="https://hbr.org/2018/06/research-women-ask-for-raises-as-often-as-men-but-are-less-likely-to-get-them">比例相对相等</a>，但女性在实现自己的要求方面仍然不太成功。分配薪酬透明度有助于减少一些模糊性，但绩效和薪酬透明度（程序透明度）共同为员工提供了要求他们应得的东西所需的工具。当人们知道谈判会带来什么（即谈判范围是什么以及合理的要求）时，性别差异就会最小化。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a>例如，<a href="https://hbr.org/2022/01/negotiating-as-a-woman-of-color">有色人种女性</a>通常不会利用机会协商角色、责任或灵活的工作安排，从而造成长期不平等，从而解释了起薪以外的薪酬差距。更广泛的透明度有助于减少模糊性，这种模糊性常常使妇女和其他少数群体成员在谈判时犹豫不决，即使她们知道自己可以。</p><p><strong>考虑对现有员工<em>和</em>申请人的好处。</strong>简单地公布薪资范围只是问题的一小部分。申请人对过大的薪酬范围有负面反应，因为他们没有提供有用的信息。在这种情况下，薪酬本质上仍然是秘密的。正如我们在研究中发现的那样，如果没有有意义的信息，人们倾向于要求最大金额，看看有什么可能。这给招聘经理带来了另一个头痛的问题。更好的方法是利用程序透明度来清楚地概述确定薪资报价时使用的因素，甚至可能包括这些因素的权重。例如，营销公司 Buffer 在创建一个<a href="https://buffer.com/salaries?ref=buffer.com">薪酬系统方面</a>做得非常出色，该系统通过使用制定薪酬决策的标准公式来平衡简单性（为了更好地理解）和复杂性（为了捕捉细微差别）：薪水 = 工作类型 x 资历x 经验 + 地点 + 10,000 美元或股权。</p><p></p><p></p><p>尽管组织对实施有关薪酬透明度的政府法规存在担忧和犹豫，但此类政策继续受到关注，并且只是对薪酬披露的期望不断提高的推动力之一。在人力资源技术公司 Visier 2022 年的一份报告中，79% 的受访员工表示他们希望<a href="https://www.visier.com/company/news/visier-report-pay-transparency/">薪酬透明</a>； Z 世代员工是最强烈的支持者。</p><p>我们的研究强调了程序透明度的潜力，可以战略性地减轻感知的组织风险，同时满足法律要求和社会期望。虽然变化显然正在发生，但我们希望企业领导者能够更深入、更具创造性地思考<em>如何</em>以既支持组织目标又满足员工需求的方式实现薪酬透明。</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss>

Choosing the right moment can make the difference between a concern being genuinely considered or hastily dismissed. Before even considering challenging a superior, it&#39;s crucial to pause and assess the situation from a holistic viewpoint. Is your concern so immediate that it demands to be addressed immediately? Alternatively, would it be better to earmark it for a detailed, private discussion later? It&#39;s wise to avoid confronting superiors during high-pressure situations or public forums because it can be misconstrued as an attempt at disruption or showmanship. By choosing the optimal time, you create a smoother path for constructive dialogue.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Prioritize private discussions.</strong> The environment in which you choose to voice your concerns plays a pivotal role in how those concerns are received. Engaging in public disagreements or conflicts can lead to multiple unforeseen complications, including being perceived as aggressive or confrontational. By choosing a private setting for these discussions, you provide both yourself and your superior with an atmosphere conducive to open and genuine dialogue. This approach not only minimizes distractions and potential biases but also reinforces the idea that the intent is constructive feedback, not public criticism.</p><p> <strong>Master the art of “I” statements.</strong> Effective communication is as much about content as it is about delivery. The words we choose and the manner in which we frame our concerns can significantly influence the reception of our message. Instead of adopting a potentially confrontational tone, use “I” statements to express observations, feelings, and suggestions. For instance, instead of bluntly stating, “You&#39;ve overlooked this crucial aspect,” a more collaborative approach would be, “I feel that this particular aspect could benefit from further attention.” This approach ensures that the focus remains on the issue at hand and not on personal biases or confrontations.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Embrace the feedback process.</strong> The journey of challenging a superior or expressing concerns is inherently bilateral. It&#39;s not just an avenue for you to voice your thoughts but also an opportunity to understand the other person&#39;s perspective. Demonstrating a genuine openness to feedback, even if it&#39;s contradictory to your viewpoint, is vital. This approach not only paves the way for mutual respect but also fosters a culture of continuous learning and collaboration within the organization.</p><p> <strong>Align with like-minded peers, but tactfully.</strong> While individual concerns have their merit, there&#39;s undeniable strength in numbers. Finding allies or colleagues who share your perspective can provide additional weight to your concerns. However, it&#39;s imperative that this alignment is not perceived as cliquey or divisive. The primary focus should always remain on the collective benefit of the organization rather than on forming factions within the team.</p><p> <strong>Keep the organization&#39;s goals at the forefront.</strong> Any concerns or challenges you raise should inherently resonate with the broader objectives and goals of the organization. By consistently aligning your feedback and suggestions with the company&#39;s mission and values, you reassure your superiors of your commitment to the collective success of the organization over your individual aspirations.</p><p> <strong>Brace for a spectrum of outcomes.</strong> While we all hope for positive and constructive outcomes from our disagreements, it&#39;s essential to be prepared for a variety of reactions. Your superior might be receptive, indifferent, or even defensive. By anticipating these potential responses and planning your strategies accordingly, you ensure that you remain balanced, constructive, and professional, irrespective of the immediate feedback.</p><h3> The Aftermath: Reflect, Adapt, and Evolve</h3><p></p><p> Every professional interaction, especially those involving challenges or confrontations, provides a rich opportunity for personal and professional growth. After the discussion, take the time to evaluate the effectiveness of the conversation, the strategies employed, and the outcomes achieved. These reflections will bring invaluable lessons to light and help you to continuously refine and enhance your communication skills for future challenges.</p><p> Ultimately, while the task of challenging a superior might seem steeped in potential pitfalls, with the right strategies and a focus on mutual growth and respect, it can be navigated with tact and professionalism. Encouraging open dialogue and a culture of feedback is the bedrock of innovative and forward-thinking organizations.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-delicate-dynamics-of-challenging-a-superior/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> How Ghost Scenarios Haunt Strategy Execution</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-ghost-scenarios-haunt-strategy-execution/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-ghost-scenarios-haunt-strategy-execution/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 11:00:13 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Trudi Lang and Rafael Ramírez. <p>Trudi Lang is a senior fellow in management practice at the University of Oxford&#39;s Saïd Business School and director of the Oxford Collaborative Strategy Lab.

They focus almost exclusively on possible courses of action and pay little attention to the future socioeconomic and environmental context in which those actions will play out. During our combined 70 years of research, practice, and teaching, we, as well as others, have observed that business leaders are inclined, and their organizations configured, to work with only a single implicit view of the future. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> That view is typically deeply embedded within their strategies as a set of unquestioned assumptions about the future context. We call these sets of unexamined assumptions <em>ghost scenarios</em> because they are invisible — and because they may come back to haunt executives and companies in unanticipated and unwelcome ways.</p><p></p><p> Underpinning every ghost scenario is a small set of implicit trends that leaders project into the future without questioning whether they might change. Consider the ways in which dramatic changes in climate have come to haunt rail services in Britain. In July 2022, temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) were recorded in the country for the first time. These high temperatures heated the rails to slightly over 62 C (143 F), causing them to bend. As a result, many train trips were canceled and service on other routes slowed to 60 mph. The rail tracks had been engineered for a future in which the air temperature did not exceed 27 C (80 F). In short, the British rail network was designed and built to work not in the scenario in which it found itself in 2022 but in a scenario that made the implicit assumption that historical climate trends would continue unchanged.</p><h3> Assumptions Hide in Plain Sight</h3><p> Research on human perception has demonstrated that people differentiate the object of their visual focus from its background by bringing that object to the forefront of their attention while everything else recedes. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> Humans can focus on either the figure or the background but never both at the same time.</p><p> The <a href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Rubin_vase">Rubin vase illusion</a> is a well-known example of this figure-ground (or background) perception challenge. Depending on how you look at the picture, you will see either a vase or two faces in profile. Importantly, however, you cannot see both at the same time: One or the other perceptually recedes to become the background of the figure you see. To see both figures, you must alternate between them.</p><p> It&#39;s important that executives are able to recognize how people&#39;s ability to focus can also blind them to important contextual information, since leaders often fail to see the background upon which their strategies will play out — and on which their strategies depend. They may consider hard infrastructure — such as rail tracks — to be a relatively static background issue and focus their attention on trends that seem more salient to business planning, such as changes in customer preferences and habits. But that can lead executives to implement a strategy that may be unexpectedly disrupted by the unexamined assumptions about its context that are woven through its background issues.</p><p></p><p> Particularly today, given the fast pace of change, soaring uncertainty, and high levels of turbulence, failing to surface the assumptions built into strategic planning is risky, as is a failure to consider multiple possible alternative futures through <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/using-scenario-planning-to-reshape-strategy/">scenario planning</a> . <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> Scenario planning exercises can help executives explore how their strategies might play out in different business contexts and conditions, with an eye toward honing those strategies to be more effective.</p><p> To understand how scenario planning can keep executives from being haunted by a ghost scenario, let&#39;s look at two global organizations we recently worked with in the Oxford Scenarios Programme. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><h3> AXA Examines Its ESG Assumptions</h3><p> Insurance company <a href="https://www.axa.com/en">AXA</a> serves 95 million clients in over 50 countries with products and services in the areas of property-casualty insurance, life insurance and savings, and asset management. One of the company&#39;s key strategic goals is to sustain its climate leadership position. Wisely, executives from AXA decided to make the future context of that goal the focus of their attention for a limited period of time so that they could explore how it might change and how they might need to adapt if it did.</p><p> The company was particularly interested in understanding how future environmental, social, and governance (ESG) trends might affect its stated goal. For example, what might be the impact of some US states&#39; proposed legislation that would penalize financial institutions pursuing ESG investment strategies? Or, how might the public react if companies are seen as greenwashing or misrepresenting their ESG credentials? Thus, instead of letting ESG requirements, as currently understood, be the ghost scenario, the company asked questions about the future of ESG and, more broadly, about the emerging sustainability context for corporations.</p><p> Participants and facilitators in the scenario-planning exercise worked in teams to look at the future environment. One scenario imagined that stand-alone insurance companies had been swallowed up by dominant tech platforms whose own ESG priorities superseded those of the insurers. In another scenario, governments set stringent regulations regarding ESG issues, with compliance implications for companies&#39; strategic choices. In yet another imagined future, climate change accelerated more than expected, causing businesses to shift their priorities to urgently address climate-related crises — or to focus exclusively on reducing CO2 emissions, abandoning social and governance agendas.</p><p> By explicitly engaging with the ghost scenario and its equally plausible alternatives, AXA came to understand that continuing to strive to deliver superior ESG performance as it is currently understood might not be the only future it should be preparing for. Within AXA, these insights have been used to inform a conversation about future ESG challenges and their implications for possible announcements and commitments to be made, including when and with whom. They&#39;ve prompted AXA to start preparing alternative strategies in the event that delivering great performance against current ESG expectations becomes irrelevant.</p><p></p><h3> Swift Anticipates Digital Currencies</h3><p> Swift (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is a member-owned cooperative that enables financial messaging and related services for cross-border payments around the world. It currently delivers over 30 million messages a day for more than 11,000 institutions in over 200 countries and territories. It was created in the early 1970s by 239 banks in 15 countries to solve the growing problem of clunky, slow, and costly cross-border payments communications via a new technology platform. With disruption as part of its origin story, Swift is proactive about potential changes in its context.</p><p> In 2021, Swift executives were interested in understanding how digital currencies, including those issued by central banks, might evolve in the years ahead. The category more than doubled in 2021, to more than 9,000 cryptocurrencies.</p><p> Rather than assuming this unfolding and rapid growth in digital currencies to be the only possible scenario, executives at Swift paused to better understand what other developments might occur, how they might shape the future digital currency ecosystem, and how Swift might be affected. For example, economists and other experts have pointed to the lack of intrinsic value of many digital currencies, as well as concerns about <a href="https://concerned.tech/">the security and reliability of their underlying technologies</a> .</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Where the Ghosts Hide in Common Strategic Planning Processes</h4><p> <strong>In a SWOT analysis,</strong> leaders consider their organization&#39;s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in relation to only the current scenario and to known competitors, suppliers, customers, regulatory rules, and the like. When identifying and analyzing risks, executives implicitly assume that there is only one scenario. However, in another context (a different scenario), risks might evaporate and new opportunities might arise.</p><p> <strong>In stakeholder mapping,</strong> leaders make an assessment about the attention and power of stakeholders now and in one expected future. An implicit scenario is the background to this assessment. But the importance of stakeholders could change significantly if the context unexpectedly changes.</p><p> <strong>In game theory and war-gaming,</strong> competitors&#39; moves are considered within the context of a ghost scenario, and war games are typically conducted with no consideration of a different future other than the one that is underway. However, changing scenarios could require new tactics and surface unforeseen future combatants.<br /></article></aside></div><p> Swift&#39;s own stance on digital currencies was open and neutral. It would potentially support them if they were properly regulated and added value to the economies, businesses, and communities it served.</p><p> The scenarios developed for Swift&#39;s executives explored different ways in which trust in the technology might evolve. In some of them, trust associated with digital currencies would disappear as the opaque technology and algorithms upon which they are based became suspect. In other scenarios, digital currencies could be manipulated, and thus the authenticity of what was being exchanged could no longer be guaranteed. And in another scenario, a more generalized lack of trust in for-profit financial institutions would spread to providers of digital currencies, leading some segments of society to hesitate to engage with either, with related consequences.</p><p> For the Oxford participants envisioning these scenarios, it was not clear that the values held by those promoting the technology, or the values that the technology supposedly enabled, would be accepted by governmental regulators or by those in society at large in all imaginable future contexts. Swift&#39;s executives have since explored those sets of scenarios, which provided rich and divergent insights about the ways digital currencies might pan out. Those insights have helped them avoid relying on overly simplistic views of the future — and being swayed by hype.</p><h3> How to See a Ghost Before It Haunts You</h3><p> Based on our experience leading scenario planning exercises for AXA, Swift, and many other organizations, we have developed the following suggestions for executives who want to bring their ghost scenarios into view and make the figure-ground reversal a key part of their strategy practice.</p><p> <strong>Use scenario planning to acknowledge implicit assumptions.</strong> Recognize that every organization&#39;s strategy presumes a future scenario that often remains unquestioned. That is, every executive engages in a form of implicit scenario planning, whether they are conscious of it or not. Making scenario planning a regular part of the strategy-making process achieves two important goals: It alerts leaders to how turbulent conditions could change the context within which they work and compete, and it acknowledges the reality that current conditions themselves present a hypothetical future scenario, not a fixed reality.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Recognize the figure-ground dilemma.</strong> Acknowledge that the figure that is attended to (most often, the organization&#39;s strategy) and the background that is so often ignored (the unexamined ghost scenario) cannot successfully be the focus of attention at the same time. Instead, executives need to flexibly and sequentially shift between the two to investigate each fully and avoid the trap of making implicit assumptions about the other. AXA took the time to deliberately explore the future of ESG rather than assuming there would be no changes to how it is currently used and understood. Swift purposefully focused on understanding the potential future contexts of digital currencies rather than just implicitly assuming subsequent options from the existing trends.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Dedicate executive time and resources to the problem.</strong> Organizations must intentionally create a time and space for leaders to explore how relevant economic, political, technological, social, and environmental factors might be changing. Contrast a small set of future scenarios with the ghost scenario to pinpoint where current strategy might need to be adapted to be well positioned for the range of ways the context might develop. Some organizations even have dedicated units, such as the <a href="https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/what-are-scenarios/meet-the-shell-scenarios-team.html#vanity-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2hlbGwuY29tL2VuZXJneS1hbmQtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi90aGUtZW5lcmd5LWZ1dHVyZS9zY2VuYXJpb3MvbWVldC10aGUtc2hlbGwtc2NlbmFyaW9zLXRlYW0uaHRtbA">Global Business Environment scenarios team</a> at Shell International. <a href="https://horizons.gc.ca/en/home/">Policy Horizons Canada</a> plays this role for the Canadian government.</p><p></p><p> For all of these efforts to be truly useful, scenario planning outputs must be fed back into strategic decision-making rather than written up in a report and placed on a shelf. They should also be disseminated more widely in an organization so that people at all levels and functions can consider possible implications from their own perspective — implications that might not occur to leadership. For a strategy to be successful when the context changes, executives need to have a balanced approach — recognizing both figure and ground as important areas for discernment. That is, they must recognize the importance of the background or ground upon which their actions will play out, even as they plan their next move. Savvy executives know that they must both envision and embrace change. The trick is learning to adeptly shift one&#39;s attention between the figure and the ground to see how the context might unfold, so it doesn&#39;t leave your strategy ungrounded.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-ghost-scenarios-haunt-strategy-execution/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Fueling Interdisciplinary Innovation With AI: Volvo&#39;s Anders Sjögren</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/fueling-interdisciplinary-innovation-with-ai-volvos-anders-sjogren/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/fueling-interdisciplinary-innovation-with-ai-volvos-anders-sjogren/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 11:00:37 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. <p>Sam Ransbotham ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ransbotham">@ransbotham</a> ) is a professor in the information systems department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College, as well as guest editor for <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> &#39;s Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy Big Ideas initiative.

I&#39;m also the AI and business strategy guest editor at <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> .</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And I&#39;m Shervin Khodabandeh, senior partner with BCG and one of the leaders of our AI business. Together, <cite>MIT SMR</cite> and BCG have been researching and publishing on AI since 2017, interviewing hundreds of practitioners and surveying thousands of companies on what it takes to build and to deploy and scale AI capabilities and really transform the way organizations operate.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Today, Sam and I are delighted to be joined by Anders Sjögren, senior technical leader, data, analytics, and AI-enabled engineering, at Volvo Cars. Let&#39;s get started. Anders, welcome to the show.</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Thank you.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> So tell us a little bit about your role at Volvo Cars.</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> I&#39;m a technical leader in data, analytics, and AI in the engineering part [of the organization], so that&#39;s the R&amp;D. So, essentially, what comes in is a wish for a car, and what comes out is drawings and code. In that area, there are, of course, a lot of possibilities for data analytics and AI, both during the development process and also as part of the actual functions in the car — so intelligent functions and personalized functions and so on.</p><p> So my purpose here is really to make sure that we get the value that we can through data, analytics, and AI.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Is [your focus] the AI and data analytics that go into the car — like the sensors and all kinds of intelligent devices in the car that make driving safer and more interactive, and things like that? Or is it also customer acquisition and dealer networks and all kinds of data analytics to run a business of making and selling cars?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Yes. So, I mean, all of those apply to Volvo Cars, but the part I&#39;m really active in is more in the part of the making of the car.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I think that&#39;s a great point because when most people think about cars and artificial intelligence, I think they immediately jump to this idea of fully self-driving cars. And what you&#39;re pointing out is how much other stuff that there is going on, even in the production of cars, that can benefit from artificial intelligence. You know, I think perhaps everyone&#39;s frustrated that we don&#39;t have fully automated cars now, but there&#39;s so much going on behind the scenes that people don&#39;t get a chance to see. What are some of the examples of the ways that you&#39;re using artificial intelligence in the production process?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> If we take a little bit of a step back, the goal of Volvo Cars is really to give people the freedom to move in a personal and sustainable and a safe way.</p><p> If we start with “personal,” then it&#39;s really critical that we understand you and make you feel special as a customer or as someone in the car. And there, of course, it has to do with starting with the sensors and then really interpreting those values. That can be cameras, different types of steering input …</p><p> Another area is definitely sustainability. AI is being used there to make sure that we have as many lightweight parts as possible. So using AI, one can, for example, get mechanical parts with the same strength and those kind of properties, but with much lower weight and less material that&#39;s being used.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> In the design process, you&#39;re talking about, right? As engineers consider all the different permutations of parts, yeah?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> In the design process — yes, exactly. That&#39;s really the essence of AI, I think, in lots of engineering activities, is that we go from manually deciding first what we want to do, but then actually performing all the different steps. That&#39;s the current way of doing it, while in the AI era, it&#39;s much more about deciding and describing what are the aspects I want to reach to? What are things I want optimized, and what are maybe the boundary conditions? And then the AI helps you get there.</p><p> So in the context of the mechanical parts, you might say, “These are the attachment points. These are the strength and stiffness properties I want. Give me the part with those properties but [make it] as light as possible and also, of course, possible to produce.”</p><p> That could be one area. And also, it is super important for sustainability that we use as little material as possible and also have as low a rate as possible.</p><p> And then, of course, the third point was about [safety]. And, of course, we have autonomous cars, but also, even before that, there are other types of functionality being used. For example, understanding the driver: Is the driver aware or not? Should we maybe nudge him to take a cup of coffee or something if he seems to be tired?</p><p> In the later versions of our cars, we understand if there are some pets or children left in the car, maybe on a hot day, and then preventing them [from getting] hurt in such a situation and so on.</p><p> I&#39;d say that those are some of the areas where AI can really be a core technology in bringing us toward our purpose.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That&#39;s really interesting because lots of times organizations tell us they start with a problem they&#39;re trying to solve and then find a technology to solve it, and that makes sense, because otherwise you&#39;re trying to find a problem to fit a solution, which seems backward. You mentioned that your cars can sense … if a person or a pet is accidentally left in the car. How did Volvo make the decision to focus on that particular problem to solve?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> A lot of what we do is really created by real-world safety in that we actually see what are the actual causes of people getting injured. I mean, if we take the analogy with crashes and that type of safety, we have teams that go out to sites when there has been a crash to really see what actually happened in reality and not just on certification [from] that type of crash test and so on.</p><p> And, going back to this example, if we look here, pets and kids do get hurt — hopefully not in a Volvo car, but that&#39;s reality, right?</p><p> But what you mentioned there is really super interesting because then it also goes the other way around: Like, now that we have these sensors, what are the other really valuable functionalities that we can provide our customers with through this, of course, taking privacy into account and so on?</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> This is quite intriguing because Volvo … I remember as a child that my uncle used to say, “You want a safe car, you get a Volvo.” And it&#39;s always been synonymous with safety, and it&#39;s really amazing to step back and think about ... for a company who has put one of its main goals for safe experience, now, with the availability of this amount of data and all of this massive amount of processing, I could imagine there are so many use cases that, to Sam&#39;s point, are being thought about. So that&#39;s really, really encouraging.</p><p> What [does] the road map here look like? I mean, is this a constant sort of innovation ideation approach going on to say, “What else could we do in these three pillars of personal, safe, and sustainable?” What is the process for coming up with these ideas and picking up the good ones and pursuing them or not?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> I think that those ideas can either come from the technology side and be really inspired by that, or it could come from the analytics side. And often it&#39;s when the new technology and the really customer-centric needs … where they meet, and also, of course, where we have the agility in the organization to execute on it. That&#39;s really where we have something that&#39;s really fruitful. It&#39;s typically a mix of different sources of this: innovations and new directions, I would say.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And there&#39;s a mechanism to create this interdisciplinary inspiration in the company?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Yeah, I would say so. I would say that there are both formal mechanisms but also informal mechanisms. [As] a car company, Volvo Cars is not super big. Of course there are also smaller ones, but I think it&#39;s also an advantage that, I mean, pretty much all the different steps, from product strategy, design, the R&amp;D, engineering, and then the later stages …</p><p> The headquarters is in Gothenburg [in Sweden], within walking distance. The US department is literally 50 meters from where I&#39;m sitting right now, while 50 meters in the other direction, there are the crash test facilities and the safety center.</p><p> So, what I want to say with that is that it&#39;s more easy to get connections and to create this kind of — how should I put it? — informal innovation activities.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> This is where relatively smaller size and colocation really, really helps. To have teams that close to each other.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> It&#39;s funny to talk about it being small, because it&#39;s certainly not a small company.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Everything&#39;s relative, yeah.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Everything&#39;s relative, I guess. As we&#39;re chatting, I&#39;m thinking about some of the people we&#39;ve talked to before, and one of the recurring themes that people have mentioned is, oh, this idea [of] starting with a business problem: “You don&#39;t have AI and find a place to use it. You start with a business problem and then solve it.” But this is kind of a nice mix on that — that it sounds like there&#39;s a lot that starts with a business problem, but then, interestingly, once these processes are in place, and once these technologies are in place, then there becomes a grassroots innovation to say, “All right; how can we use that?” And that&#39;s an interesting perspective that, I think, hasn&#39;t come through strongly — or maybe I&#39;m forgetting something — but it seems like that hasn&#39;t come through as strongly. This is a nice mix of that, that maybe works in this size organization … this colocated organization.</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Yeah, and not least in the prototyping and ideation stages. But, then, of course, before it actually goes into the product, it needs to go through a more thorough review and so on.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> There&#39;s been quite a few investments and acquisitions of smaller AI startups and firms by Volvo. Tell us a bit about the overall ecosystem of internal and vendor and partner companies that come together to bring to life some of these AI-enabled ideas that you&#39;re talking about. Is it internal? Is it external? Is it a mix? How do you think about the ecosystem?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> I would definitely say that it&#39;s a mix. Some of the things … we need to do it ourselves to get the full understanding or where we really want to be in the forefront, and [in] some other areas, we definitely want to partner with other companies that are strong in those areas. Traditionally speaking, a car is a super complex product. It has hundreds or thousands of different parts that all need to come together. And, of course, it is a space where there is traditionally a lot of suppliers supplying different parts.</p><p> Lately, we are moving more toward bringing software implementation in-house to increase the speed and agility in the development process.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That seems particularly complicated in auto manufacturing because if I think about how cars got started, they were independent systems. There was a braking system, and a power train system, and an air conditioner, and an infotainment system, and all these were separate. And that&#39;s kind of nice because then we have a certain, different standard than we would have for the infotainment system than we would have for the braking system — or at least I hope that there would be. But what you&#39;re pointing out is, each one of these may be using sensors that come from a different area, and how the whole car has become more complicated independently, but it&#39;s also become more complicated cohesively, trying to connect all these parts and have them work together.</p><p> And that seems, on the one hand, an opportunity for artificial intelligence but, at the same time, a challenge.</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Yeah. It&#39;s 100% true. It&#39;s both a really big opportunity, but that also means that&#39;s really one of the core challenges — I mean, how to build the cohesive understanding of both the inside and the outside of the car.</p><p> We speak about the customer digital twin and vehicle digital twin and so on, and in some sense, those aspects can mean a lot of different things. But, of course, these different systems that you speak about, they are traditionally in different parts of the company, so that also means that there is a lot of cross-functional collaboration that is needed. But we really need to bridge those kind of organizational borders.</p><p> I think that that&#39;s really one of the key points — that is, in order to get successful adoption of the analytics and AI, it really means that different parts of the company need to work together to make it happen. Because otherwise, it will just become a silo. Some people will not really have the benefits of it.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> You know, it&#39;s very true. It&#39;s a common theme, and in our work at BCG, we have this rule of thumb — the 10:20:70 — where we say 10% is the data and algorithms, and 20% is the technology and the digital platform, but 70% of it is the business integration and implementation and bringing different parts of the organization together. This, perhaps, is nowhere more true than at a car company, where you have, as you said, Sam, seemingly disparate systems that are coming together to create a bigger system, but each one of these units has been perfected individually, and now you want the collective perfection as well.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Anders, we talked a lot about Volvo. How did you personally get interested in artificial intelligence, in data, in technology and analytics? What&#39;s your origin story?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> I think I&#39;ve always been interested in computers. My father was really an addict, so I kind of grew up with that.</p><p> I started out as an engineering student [and got a] master&#39;s in computer science. And then I started off as a research engineer in the medical area, at the university hospital in Gothenburg, then found out fairly quickly that in order to really make use of data — conclusions and so on come from data … so I then went into the area of mathematical statistics.</p><p> So I did a Ph.D. in that, then went back to software product development. After some time, I went back to academia for a couple of years, did a postdoc, and then was offered a good opportunity at Volvo Cars. So I&#39;ve essentially been here for seven years now. That&#39;s a bit of my history.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Quite inspiring.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Anders, we also want to ask you a few rapid-fire questions, and the idea is just to answer it as quickly as you can. These are not particularly Volvo questions.</p><p> What have you been proudest of that you&#39;ve done with artificial intelligence?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> The problem is that most of the things, I can&#39;t speak about.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That&#39;s a great answer too.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> You have to wait and see. OK, well, what worries you about artificial intelligence?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> The worries?</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Oh, I think, of course, one is the longer term — the kind of singularity things. But I think a bit closer to now, so to speak, we definitely see that this super-fast progression of large language [models] and what they can do, and also the kind of systems that don&#39;t just take one problem and give one answer but can really produce a series of steps, in sequence. And that is a super-powerful technology, but a super-powerful technology can be used both for good and for bad.</p><p> That&#39;s both something that makes me super excited but also a little bit worried. What will the world look like in 20 years?</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your favorite activity that does not involve technology?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Motorcycling, but obviously using technology. But it&#39;s more of a … yeah.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Technology&#39;s involved. Everything&#39;s involved in technology in some way.</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Yeah, pretty much.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s the first career you wanted when you were a kid? What did you want to be when you grew up?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Medical doctor.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Well, that ties with your first career in working in the medical company, then.</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Yeah, I think so, but then I found mathematics and those things to be super exciting, so I went into that area.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your greatest wish for artificial intelligence in the future? What do you hope that we can gain from the advent of these technologies?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> If we say the greatest wish, I think it is that we find a way to use it in a way for our common good. We need to find a way to integrate it into society, and I think that that is really my biggest wish for it.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> In a relatively short time, we learned so much about various uses of data, AI, and technology, in just what it takes to build a car in new ways, and all the different ways that AI and tech are helping and serving the people who are driving them. It&#39;s been really enlightening, Anders. Thank you for joining.</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Thanks for having me.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Thanks for listening.

Such resistance to an organizational policy, directive, or decision can take many forms, ranging from voicing concerns and raising questions to active opposition and sabotage. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p> Effective leaders think of pushback as an opportunity to boost their team&#39;s learning while moving their organization forward. The objective should be to increase people&#39;s understanding and build support by tempering both advocate enthusiasm and contrarian pessimism. This deeper level of understanding, while not necessarily satisfying to all in the moment, fosters a climate of candor, humility, adaptation, and trust, thereby subtly steering pushback away from latent disruptive tendencies.</p><p></p><p> Drawing on decades of research, C-suite observations, and interviews, we&#39;ve identified the major mistakes leaders make when encountering pushback and offer five guidelines to help them better respond.</p><h3> What Doesn&#39;t Work</h3><p> Leaders make three primary mistakes when facing ambivalence, disagreement, or resistance:</p><p> <strong>Suppressing uncertainty.</strong> Pushback increases uncertainty when questions are raised that might not have immediate answers or perspectives are introduced that might have recently emerged or been sidelined or overlooked. Some leaders respond to uncertainty-induced pushback by marginalizing concerns, offering placating assurances, or invoking authoritarian voices. Such practices offer false certainty that undermines trust in the long term.</p><p> According to our research, even employees who seek more certainty in their work lives want their organizations to embrace uncertainty. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> Effective leaders avoid the temptation to paper over uncertainty, even when they face demands for a level of certainty that simply doesn&#39;t exist. Even if they don&#39;t know the answers now, they can provide an operating level of certainty by discussing how they will find those answers.</p><p> <strong>Ignoring power dynamics.</strong> Leaders with positional or acquired status directly or subtly influence the nature of the pushback. Highly authoritarian power structures tend to drive pushback underground. Likewise, more subtle power signals can suppress open discussion of legitimate concerns. Leaders might then wrongly equate silence with agreement. Some people will feign acceptance while others sow dissent in the “meeting after the meeting,” thereby revealing and often amplifying people&#39;s fears.</p><p></p><p> We had an opportunity to observe one seasoned executive group&#39;s reaction — which consisted of tepid and token feedback — when their CEO proposed a new initiative. The CEO, sensing a lack of candor, probed for more input. One frustrated executive eventually blurted out, “We don&#39;t share our thoughts on this issue because you are going to do what you are going to do, regardless of what we say.” This remarkably candid comment suggested a deeper challenge: How do powerful people with strong views on particular issues encourage candor? Effective leaders take active steps to mitigate disruptive dialogue — discussed below — because they recognize that inherent power dynamics greatly influence the quality of any discussion.</p><p> <strong>Assuming that the loudest voices represent a consensus.</strong> Pushback takes many forms: Some of them are obvious, like complaints or employee petitions, while others are more subtle, like queries in meetings or a lack of engagement. Leaders are often tempted to pay more attention to the most vocal employees, assuming the people with the biggest megaphones represent majority opinion. They may or may not.</p><p> When the loudest or most politically powerful voices dominate the discussion, such dynamics often create an inaccurate impression of the level of support or divisiveness. Effective leaders recognize the peril at either extreme: the enthusiasts glossing over concerning issues or the contrarians undermining potential support.</p><p></p><h3> Recommendations for Engaging With Pushback</h3><p> Effective leaders not only avoid suppressing uncertainty, ignoring power dynamics, and assuming that the most vocal represent consensus opinion — they also take active countermeasures that reflect the following guidelines.</p><p> <strong>1. Set ground rules for the conversation.</strong> Ground rules like the following drive expectations, temper disrespectful advocacy, and increase the value of pushback opportunities for everyone:</p><ul><li> <strong>Seek to understand viewpoints you don&#39;t agree with.</strong> When discussing contentious issues, many people&#39;s first instinct is to offer an instant rebuttal or counterpoint. Resist that temptation by demonstrating a willingness to engage with a differing point of view. Simple tactics like asking questions or rephrasing someone else&#39;s argument — particularly those with which you disagree — can temper the rebuttal and almost magically enhance the conversational tone. Likewise, statements like “Tell me how my idea might be wrong” or “I may have missed something; please say more” signal openness to new ideas.</li><li> <strong>Respectfully disagree with others.</strong> Respectfully framing the disagreements with language such as “Let me offer another perspective” sets the right discussion tone while also encouraging those who are more hesitant to speak up. Reluctance to share differing points of view often signals an underlying trust deficit. Sometimes leaders need to encourage others to share their concerns despite the inherent power differences in the room.</li><li> <strong>Avoid polarizing, stake-in-the-ground assertions.</strong> Advocating with too much certainty may well trigger power-dynamic issues. Indicating probability levels, such as “I&#39;m 95% certain on this fact,” often stimulates more robust debate.</li><li> <strong>Depersonalize pushback.</strong> If a decision is labeled as “the CEO&#39;s program,” many people will self-censor and avoid raising concerns out of fear of offending the person in power. Depersonalizing pushback by recording concerns on a whiteboard, without attribution, mitigates this power dynamic while tempering strong emotions.</li><li> <strong>Shift your opinions and reactions as the discussion evolves.</strong> Employees often need to be reminded that changing their opinion after considering new evidence or gaining a fresh perspective is not a sign of weakness. No one should fear a loss of face for shifting their opinion. In fact, effective leaders highlight when their opinions shift by making a statement such as “I see an issue that wasn&#39;t on my radar screen.” As the dialogue emerges, reframe key issues to underscore new perspectives.</li></ul><p> <strong>2. Orient the team about pushback opportunities.</strong> Many meetings or initiative rollouts conclude with question-and-answer periods without first offering attendees an orientation on expectations around pushback. Absent clarity, people often make a variety of untested and unspoken assumptions that might not be accurate.</p><p> Some employees become disenfranchised by pushback opportunities because they think all of their ideas should be accepted in totality. They don&#39;t expect reasoned debate or pushback to <em>their</em> pushback. That&#39;s why wise leaders carefully orient employees about possible outcomes other than the accept/reject polarized extremes. They introduce other alternatives, such as tweaking the plan, introducing a test period, delaying implementation, modifying a decision, or rethinking the proposal.</p><p></p><p> <strong>3. Select the right forums and settings.</strong> Some settings, like town hall gatherings or online forums, tend to embolden more emotive expressions of opinions, posturing, and venting. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> Such situations might discourage useful inquiry and questions from those less inclined to engage in emotive scrums. The right venues and forums maximize the opportunities for insightful queries, deliberative discourse, and respectful debate. Typically, smaller groups of people who are equipped with the proper discussion parameters work best. Likewise, properly monitored online forums for smaller groups can encourage better pushback dynamics.</p><p> Leaders also need to be mindful that some people are reluctant to share concerns in front of others because they fear being viewed as poor team players or they lack confidence in how to express concerns or defend their views. To encourage people who are more reluctant to speak up, it&#39;s often helpful to provide them with the meeting&#39;s discussion points in advance and encourage them to write down their concerns and queries.</p><p> <strong>4. Focus on educating before advocating.</strong> Skilled educators soon learn to jettison the idea that a single good explanation will suffice to build understanding. Typically, they discuss their methods for arriving at their conclusions, including the opposing viewpoints and extant questions. This approach bakes uncertainty into conclusions, making room for further discussion and contrary views.</p><p> In contrast, advocates rarely discuss evidence or approaches that might contradict their firmly held viewpoints. They often trivialize or deride opposing views when they do entertain them. Advocates might short-circuit any criticism, downplaying uncertainty and reasoning that a brief explanation will enlighten others. Even smart executives often fall into this trap, overestimating the degree and depth of their educational efforts.</p><p> Advocating might play a role at some point after educating, but ultimately, effective leaders assume that allowing people to voice concerns reaps benefits. Short term, the pushback might result in tweaks that will increase long-term acceptance and smooth implementation.</p><p> <strong>5. Signpost inflection points.</strong> As decisions, initiatives, and policies evolve, a leader&#39;s level of certainty and openness to pushback shifts. In the absence of leadership clarity about these inflection points, employees apply unspoken rules regarding pushback, such as the following:</p><ul><li> Rule A: If the leader has not made a final decision, then I can speak up and candidly share my perspectives.</li><li> Rule B: If the leader has a strong position or has made a final decision, then I support it or shut up.</li><li> Rule C: If I agitate on an issue long enough, leaders will yield.</li></ul><p> If unspoken rules A and B undergird the pushback dynamics, then leaders might overestimate the degree of support for an initiative or decision.为什么？ Because employees operating under rule B assume that requests for feedback are for theater or designed to manufacture buy-in; they self-censor or offer only token opposition. Consequently, dissenting and potentially valuable voices go silent.</p><p></p><p> Rule C animates pushback dynamics in precisely the opposite direction, with endless debate; this fosters a culture of complaint after decisions have been tweaked, modified, or finalized. Effective leaders know that openness does not provide a license for never-ending discussion; after all, pushback to the pushback can go on forever.</p><p> The best way to inhibit these silent rules from taking root is to clearly signpost inflection points during pushback. Leaders who camouflage their sentiments in the name of openness undermine the candor of the entire conversation. Instead, effective leaders share their level of openness to tweaking proposed plans, proclaiming when their sentiments have shifted, and clearly signaling when the time for pushback has ended.</p><h3> A Pushback Success Story</h3><p> Laurie Butz, the CEO of Capital Credit Union, routinely uses these guidelines to lean into pushback to fully understand what employees believe they are losing as new initiatives roll out. For example, as the COVID-19 threat faded, she sought to restart face-to-face all-employee meetings to enhance inclusiveness and engage in more robust, thoughtful discussions about pending initiatives. She believes that the educational process goes in both directions, which requires more face-to-face forums that encourage adherence to more productive discussion ground rules than screen-enabled venting.</p><p> Yet that announcement was greeted with considerable pushback by employees who faced a long commute to the twice-a-year gatherings. Some used online surveys to voice concerns about the expense and time, while others expressed their discontent directly to their immediate supervisor, arguing that “Zoom meetings worked pretty well during COVID.”</p><p> Butz acknowledged these concerns while respectfully justifying the in-person gathering because, after all, “you could have a Zoom wedding, but something important would be missing.” Similar messaging was echoed in more personal channels by her “ambassadors” (opinion leaders).</p><p></p><p> Over time, the in-person meetings (1) increased employee engagement, (2) renewed employee interest in being a part of the process, and (3) spawned more thoughtful discussions of key issues. Quantitative evidence backed up these observations. For example, participation in all-employee surveys increased from 60% to 91% after the in-person meetings resumed, and 83% of survey respondents reported that they were “highly engaged in their work.” Anecdotal evidence also emerged: Employees often left the in-person meetings inquiring, “When will we have another opportunity to meet like this?”</p><p></p><p> Suppressing pushback by repressing uncertainty, invoking power dynamics, and paying too much attention to the most vocal employees may well induce short-term conformity and compliance at the expense of <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/decision-downloading/">undermining long-term trust</a> . Adroitly and respectfully managing pushback involves an upfront time commitment that engages employees while supplying forward momentum. The bonus: Leaders learn to more subtly influence how employees interpret trends, events, and decisions and develop greater insight into emerging issues.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/five-ways-leaders-can-turn-pushback-into-progress/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> How ChatGPT Can and Can&#39;t Help Managers Design Better Job Roles</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-chatgpt-can-and-cant-help-managers-design-better-job-roles/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-chatgpt-can-and-cant-help-managers-design-better-job-roles/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 11:00:54 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Fangfang Zhang and Sharon K.

To fight it, managers need to offer employees more healthy and meaningful work. In surveys conducted in the United States by Gallup in 2022, 40% of employees reported that their job had a negative impact on their mental health, and around 30% said they frequently experience burnout. Moreover, US employee engagement hit a seven-year low, with only 32% of workers polled by Gallup saying they were engaged and 17% saying they were actively disengaged in 2022. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> Globally, employees&#39; lack of engagement has been estimated to cost employers $7.8 trillion — equivalent to 11% of the global gross domestic product. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a></p><p> The root causes of disengagement and work stress often lie in how an organization has designed people&#39;s jobs. Decades of extensive research consistently link poor work design with negative employee outcomes, including mental strain, high turnover, job dissatisfaction, decreased productivity, and impaired learning. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> Many companies are now striving to do better.</p><p></p><p> Unfortunately, our research indicates that many managers lack the necessary understanding to design high-quality jobs. This is where artificial intelligence technologies such as ChatGPT could play a key role, by bridging the manager knowledge gap and helping design high-quality work that benefits both employees and organizations. However, it is important for managers to first understand the pros and cons of using ChatGPT for work design. Let&#39;s explore some takeaways for managers that our research has revealed.</p><h3> Managerial Challenges: Mundane and Unfulfilling Jobs</h3><p> What factors determine whether a job is high quality? The <a href="https://www.futureofworkinstitute.com.au/smart-workdesign">SMART work design model</a> , a framework created by Sharon K. Parker, defines high-quality work as work that is <em>stimulating</em> (jobs with task variety and a chance to develop new skills), incorporates <em>mastery</em> (such as role clarity and job feedback), is <em>agentic</em> (such as job autonomy and change participation), is <em>relational</em> (where social support and positive teamwork are available), and is <em>tolerable</em> (with manageable work hours and reasonable levels of time pressure). <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p> Despite the benefits of well-designed jobs, poorly designed ones are still prevalent. According to the Gallup 2019 Great Jobs Survey, only 40% of employed Americans are engaged in jobs that possess SMART characteristics. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> On the other hand, 16% find themselves in jobs that lack essential SMART characteristics, and 44% have jobs that possess only some satisfactory SMART attributes. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p> A lack of knowledge among today&#39;s managers about job design might explain such findings. A study we recently conducted explored how people design jobs for others. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> Participants in an online simulation (Simulation 1) were asked to design an administrative job role. The half-time job was made up entirely of four photocopying and filing tasks. Participants were asked to make the job full time by selecting four additional tasks from a list of 11, including five repetitive photocopying and filing tasks and six more-meaningful and interesting tasks, such as greeting visitors or helping colleagues arrange meetings.</p><p></p><p> Participants were scored on a 0 to 4 range, with a higher score indicating the creation of a more stimulating work design. Almost half (45%) of university-level management students and professionals/managers working in human services industries tended to incorporate repetitive and monotonous work, demonstrating a knowledge gap when it comes to quality work design.</p><p> In a second simulation (Simulation 2), participants were asked to act like a manager and solve workforce problems in four scenarios. In each scenario, the job role design was clearly poor. To fix the problems, participants rated how likely they were to adopt strategies from a list that included both “fixing the worker” approaches, which attributed problems to the employee, and “fixing the poor work design” approaches, which acknowledged the poor-quality job design.</p><p> For example, in one scenario, a warehouse worker consistently failed to meet 50% of the timed deadlines in gathering products and delivering them to dispatch — despite frequently running to pick up goods. While the majority of participants focused on choices that improved the work design (for example, “Involve the employee and their colleagues in a review to identify ways in which their work could be organized better” or “Reorganize the work so that tasks do not need to be timed”), a surprising number of participants (40%) still chose strategies aimed at fixing the worker (such as “Discreetly observe the person&#39;s behavior to see how fast they are moving”). These findings validate our finding that there is a lack of knowledge of work design among managers and staff members.</p><h3> Generative AI Can Suggest Strong Work Design</h3><p> In the study&#39;s next phase, we researched whether an AI-powered tool such as ChatGPT could help managers do better. The short answer: ChatGPT has the potential to enhance decision-making in work design. However, it is important for managers to understand what ChatGPT can and cannot do well.</p><p> We used ChatGPT to make hypothetical work design decisions for the administrative work design simulation (Simulation 1). We ran the simulation task 20 times, using a new, independent chat session with the same prompt each time in ChatGPT. The generative AI model consistently chose enrichment tasks out of the provided list, outperforming both students and professionals/managers in creating interesting and meaningful work. ChatGPT&#39;s performance was similar to that of work design experts. </p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand-column"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Work Design Decision Scores in Different Groups</h4><p class="caption"> When participants in Simulation 1 were asked to design an administrative job role, 45% mostly chose to assign the worker repetitive and monotonous tasks (scored from 0 to 4 indicating the number of enriched tasks selected by the participants). When participants in Simulation 2 were asked to address problems in four poorly designed job roles, 40% chose strategies aimed at fixing the worker rather than the poor design (scored from 1 to 5 indicating the extent to which participants will adopt the strategies, 1=extremely unlikely, 5=extremely likely). </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023_1005_Parker_Fig1-1.png" alt="Work Design Decision Scores in Different Groups"></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p> We then tasked ChatGPT to tackle Simulation 2, addressing the four managerial workforce scenarios (including the theoretical warehouse worker mentioned above), choosing strategies from a list. In each scenario, ChatGPT consistently chose strategies aimed at fixing the work design (good strategies for employee well-being, motivation, and performance) over those focused on fixing the worker. As in Simulation 1, ChatGPT outperformed students, managers, and professionals in its focus on work design to solve the workforce problems.</p><p> However, ChatGPT did not score as well as the work design experts in Simulation 2, suggesting that some caution is warranted. For example, in one session addressing the warehouse worker who was missing deadlines, ChatGPT scored 4 overall but chose the strategy “I would give the employee and her colleagues a bonus when they meet the allocated times,” which ignores the role&#39;s unreasonable time allocation.</p><p></p><h3> One Big Lesson: Specific Prompts Are Key</h3><p> To further assess ChatGPT&#39;s ability to generate suggestions independently, we ran the Simulation 2 work design tasks without providing a multiple-choice solution list. We ran each test in a new account with the chat history function turned off and in independent new chats so that the output of ChatGPT would not be affected by previous inputs.</p><p> To begin with, the outcome was worrying. When we simply instructed the AI model to “provide effective strategies to address the problem” in the missed-deadlines scenario, ChatGPT tended to address problems by trying to fix the worker and creating old-fashioned <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-progressive-roots-of-management-science/">Taylorist approaches to work systems</a> , such as conducting time and motion studies. For example, ChatGPT suggested solutions such as time management skills and additional training to help the warehouse employee, who we named Karen, improve her performance (for example, “Focus on improving Karen&#39;s speed and accuracy in locating and gathering items from the warehouse”). It also recommended providing performance feedback and incentives to motivate Karen to move faster (for instance, “By linking performance with rewards, Karen will be encouraged to focus on improving her speed and efficiency”). Each of these solutions implicitly assumes that the worker&#39;s motivation or ability is the problem rather than the work design.</p><p> After learning that such an open-ended approach was not optimal, we next instructed ChatGPT to address this same scenario using specific prompts: “Consider designing a good-quality job for Karen”; “Consider Karen&#39;s health, well-being, motivation, satisfaction, and work meaningfulness”; and “Consider Karen&#39;s work design.” The AI model then provided solutions related to improving Karen&#39;s work design, including the following:</p><ul><li> Reviewing time allocation and workload to set realistic time goals.</li><li> Involving Karen in the decision-making process and seeking her input on ways to improve her job.</li><li> Offering supportive feedback and recognition to enhance employee satisfaction and motivation.</li><li> Providing adequate training and skill development opportunities to boost confidence and engagement.</li></ul><p> These strategies would boost Karen&#39;s SMART work design characteristics, increasing the tolerability of demands, enhancing agency, boosting mastery, and making the work more stimulating.</p><p> ChatGPT also suggested solutions such as fostering a supportive work environment, encouraging team support and collaboration, offering career advancement opportunities, and promoting work-life balance. These solutions all align well with extensive research on work design and well-being and would make the job “SMART-er” and hence result in a healthier and more productive employee.</p><p> We learned from this particular experiment with ChatGPT that generative AI can make valuable work design decisions, but managers need to provide clear instructions that prioritize outcomes for the worker. For example, asking ChatGPT to “design a high-quality job” rather than simply requesting “good work design” can generate more relevant and effective strategies. Therefore, to enhance the quality of strategy suggestions generated by ChatGPT, managers need to mention specific, desirable goals in their question prompts, such as high-quality jobs; employees&#39; health, well-being, and motivation; and work meaningfulness.</p><p></p><p> One piece of good news: Managers who do not frequently use ChatGPT can learn how to write effective prompts via the ChatGPT tool itself. For example, when asked, “How can one craft a well-structured and clear prompt to effectively address work design challenges?” ChatGPT provided a step-by-step guide on how to write effective prompts. ChatGPT advised us to identify the core issue and be specific — suggestions that could be applied to work design by using prompts such as “Design high-quality work that enhances positive team interaction and collaboration for the sales team” or “Design work that is meaningful to facilitate employee acceptance of technological changes in their work.”</p><p> The experiment also showed that effective prompts need to be reviewed and tested. Managers who struggle to write effective ChatGPT prompts can improve their skills by using a prompt such as “The following is a prompt aimed at asking ChatGPT for advice from a work design expert&#39;s perspective. Please analyze and suggest improvements to get actionable and practical advice from ChatGPT.” In this case, ChatGPT will provide more specific suggestions that drive better-quality outputs.</p><h3> Five Lessons for Managers</h3><p> To address the pervasive issue of poor work role design and its detrimental effects, embracing innovative solutions is crucial. Based on our research, ChatGPT has emerged as a promising AI-powered tool to help managers design healthier and more productive jobs. But it&#39;s not a panacea and needs to be used wisely. Our advice for managers:</p><p> <strong>ChatGPT cannot replace training.</strong> Managers need to be <em>aware</em> that worker problems can emerge from poor work design and that work design, in turn, can affect worker well-being, motivation, and work meaningfulness. This means that before using ChatGPT to design better jobs, managers still need basic training on work design concepts. To get started on this topic, see the related article “ <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-well-designed-work-makes-us-smarter/">How Well-Designed Work Makes Us Smarter</a> ” and the <a href="https://www.smartworkdesign.com.au/">SMART Work Design site</a> .</p><p> <strong>Managers need to be supported in their goal to create well-designed work.</strong> Managers need to be <em>motivated</em> to create better jobs for their staffs. This means managers themselves need roles in which the creation of healthy employee work roles is seen as a legitimate and important responsibility, versus having their sole focus be the bottom line. For example, if managers get promoted purely on the basis of productivity achievements, they will not have much motivation to design SMART work for their teams.</p><p> <strong>Managers need healthy jobs themselves.</strong> Managers need sufficient time to be able to pay attention to how well their staff members&#39; jobs are designed. This means managers&#39; own jobs need to be <em>tolerable</em> and not excessively time-pressured.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Managers need to learn ChatGPT prompting skills.</strong> Managers should be encouraged to use generative AI to help with work design challenges, but they need clear and comprehensive instructions as to how to use it effectively. For example, managers need to be specific and to mention goals such as employee well-being and motivation when seeking work design recommendations from ChatGPT.</p><p> <strong>ChatGPT will augment, not replace, people in designing better jobs.</strong> Unlike simulations, real-life job design situations are often characterized by their ambiguity and complexity, with numerous variables that can influence outcomes. Real situations require a deep understanding of context, human emotions, social dynamics, and political and ethical considerations, all of which can be challenging for an AI tool like ChatGPT to fully grasp. We recommend using ChatGPT as a <em>complement</em> to human managers rather than as a <em>replacement</em> for them.</p><p> By incorporating ChatGPT&#39;s suggestions alongside human expertise, organizations can foster higher staff engagement, job satisfaction, and overall performance. Achieving such a synergy between managers and AI can pave the way for a better future for work design and employee experience.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-chatgpt-can-and-cant-help-managers-design-better-job-roles/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
