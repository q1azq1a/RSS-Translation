Jerry&#39;s)，长期以来一直注重企业社会责任和环境可持续发展。最近，该公司已将人工智能作为一种显着改善其全球业务运营和决策的手段。联合利华的企业数据执行官（一个治理委员会）认识到，公司可以通过将人工智能的负责任和合乎道德的使用嵌入到公司的数据战略中，建立强大的隐私、安全和治理控制。目标是利用人工智能驱动的数字创新，最大限度地发挥公司的能力，并促进社会更加公平和公正。成立了一个多功能团队，其任务是探索这在实践中意味着什么，并制定行动计划来实现该目标。</p><p>联合利华现在已经实施了上述所有五个阶段，但回顾过去，其第一步是制定一套政策。例如，一项政策规定，任何会对个人生活产生重大影响的决定不应完全自动化，而应最终由人类做出。其他采用的特定于人工智能的原则包括“我们永远不会责怪系统；我们永远不会责怪系统”的法令。必须有联合利华所有者负责”并且“我们将尽最大努力系统地监控模型和人工智能的性能，以确保其保持其有效性。”</p><p>委员会成员很快意识到，仅制定广泛的政策不足以确保人工智能的负责任发展。为了建立对人工智能采用的信心并真正释放其全部潜力，他们需要开发一个强大的工具、服务和人力资源生态系统，以确保人工智能系统能够按预期工作。</p><p></p><p>委员会成员还知道，联合利华的许多人工智能和分析系统是与外部软件和服务供应商合作开发的。例如，该公司的广告代理商经常使用程序化购买软件，该软件使用人工智能来决定在网络和移动网站上放置哪些数字广告。该团队的结论是，其人工智能道德方法需要包括对外部来源能力的关注。</p><p></p><h3>开发强大的人工智能保障流程</h3><p>在联合利华使用人工智能的早期，该公司的数据和人工智能领导者注意到，该技术的一些问题根本不涉及道德——它们涉及的系统在完成预期任务时效率低下。联合利华全球数据科学总监 Giles Pavey 主要负责人工智能道德规范，他知道这是人工智能用例的重要组成部分。 “例如，预测现金流的系统可能不涉及公平或偏见风险，但可能存在一些无效的风险，”他说。 “我们决定将功效风险与我们评估的道德风险一起纳入其中。”该公司开始使用<em>“人工智能保证”</em>一词来广泛涵盖其对工具有效性和道德规范的概述。</p><p>联合利华人工智能保证合规流程背后的基本理念是检查每个新的人工智能应用程序，以确定其在有效性和道德方面的内在风险有多大。该公司已经制定了明确的信息安全和数据隐私方法，目标是采用类似的方法，确保人工智能应用程序在未经审查和批准的情况下不会投入生产。将合规流程整合到联合利华已有的合规领域（例如隐私风险评估、信息安全和采购政策）将是成功的最终标志。</p><p> Debbie Cartledge 担任公司数据和人工智能道德战略负责人，她解释了团队采用的流程：</p><blockquote><p>当规划新的人工智能解决方案时，联合利华员工或供应商会在开发之前提出概述的用例和方法。这是内部审查的，更复杂的案例则由外部专家手动评估。然后，提议者被告知潜在的道德和功效风险以及需要考虑的缓解措施。人工智能应用程序开发完成后，联合利华或外部方会进行统计测试，以确定是否存在偏见或公平问题，并检查系统实现其目标的有效性。随着时间的推移，我们预计大多数案例都可以根据项目提案人提供的项目信息进行全面自动评估。</p></blockquote><p>根据系统在公司内部的使用位置，系统还可能需要遵守当地法规。例如，所有简历检查现在都是由人工审核员完成。如果简历检查完全自动化，审查可能会得出这样的结论：系统需要有人参与其中，以做出是否让候选人参加面试的最终决定。如果存在无法缓解的严重风险，人工智能保证流程将拒绝该申请，理由是联合利华的价值观禁止这样做。人工智能用例的最终决定由高级执行委员会做出，其中包括来自法律、人力资源、数据和技术部门的代表。</p><p>举个例子：该公司在百货商店设有销售其化妆品品牌的区域。开发了一个项目，利用计算机视觉人工智能通过日常自拍照自动记录销售代理的出勤情况，其延伸目标是查看代理的外表是否合适。由于人工智能保证流程，项目团队拓宽了他们的思维范围，超越了法规、合法性和有效性，还考虑了全自动系统的潜在影响。他们认为需要人工监督来检查标记为不合规的照片，并对任何后续行动负责。</p><h3>与外部合作伙伴合作，整体人工智能</h3><p>联合利华在人工智能保证流程中的外部合作伙伴是总部位于伦敦的 Holistic AI 公司。创始人 Emre Kazim 和 Adriano Koshiyama 自 2020 年以来一直与联合利华 AI 团队合作，Holistic AI 于 2021 年成为 AI 风险评估的正式合作伙伴。</p><p> Holistic AI 创建了一个平台来管理 AI 保证审查流程。在这种情况下，“人工智能”是一个广泛的类别，涵盖任何类型的预测或自动化；甚至用于对人力资源候选人进行评分的 Excel 电子表格也将包含在该流程中。联合利华的数据道德团队使用该平台审查人工智能项目的状态，并可以查看哪些新用例已提交；信息是否完整；以及他们收到的风险级别评估，编码为红色、黄色（在英国称为“琥珀色”）或绿色。</p><p>交通信号灯状态在三个点进行评估：分类时、进一步分析后以及最终缓解和保证后。最后一点，评级有以下解释： 红色评级表示人工智能系统不符合联合利华标准，不应部署；黄色表示人工智能系统存在一些可接受的风险，企业主有责任了解并承担责任；绿色意味着人工智能系统不会给流程带来任何风险。迄今为止，联合利华的数百个用例中只有少数获得了红色评级，包括上述化妆品。所有提交者都能够解决其用例的问题并将其提升到黄色评级。</p><p>对于人工智能项目的领导者来说，该平台是开始审核流程的地方。他们提交了一份拟议的用例，其中包含详细信息，包括其目的、业务案例、项目在联合利华内部的所有权、团队组成、使用的数据、采用的人工智能技术的类型、是否是内部开发的还是由外部供应商开发的、自治程度等。该平台使用这些信息对应用程序的潜在风险进行评分。风险领域包括可解释性、稳健性、有效性、偏见和隐私。机器学习算法会被自动分析，以确定它们是否对任何特定群体存在偏见。</p><p></p><p>整体人工智能平台中越来越多的评估是基于欧盟拟议的人工智能法案，该法案还将人工智能用例分为三类风险（不可接受、高和不足以监管）。欧盟国家正在就该法案进行谈判，希望在 2023 年底之前达成协议。Kazim 和 Koshiyama 表示，尽管该法案仅适用于欧洲企业，但联合利华和其他公司可能会在全球范围内采用该法案，就像他们在欧盟的通用数据保护条例。</p><p></p><p> Kazim 和 Koshiyama 预计整体人工智能未来能够汇总各公司的数据并进行基准测试。该软件可以评估收益与成本、同一用例的不同外部提供商的效率以及最有效的人工智能采购方法。 Kazim 和 Koshiyama 还考虑在某些情况下公开风险评级，并与保险公司合作，确保人工智能用例免受某些类型的风险。</p><p>我们仍处于<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/big-ideas/responsible-ai/">确保公司对人工智能采取道德方法</a>的早期阶段，但这并不意味着仅仅发布声明和政策就足够了。人工智能是否符合道德将取决于用例。联合利华的人工智能保证流程及其与 Holistic AI 的合作来评估每个用例的道德风险水平，是确保人工智能系统符合人类利益和福祉的当前唯一方法。</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ai-ethics-at-unilever-from-policy-to-process/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>中国出境禁令和劫持人质事件的兴起</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-rise-of-exit-bans-and-hostage-takeing-in-china/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-rise-of-exit-bans-and-hostage-takeing-in-china/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 12:00:18 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Jack Wroldsen and Chris Carr. <p>杰克·沃尔德森 (Jack Wroldsen) 是加州圣路易斯奥比斯波加州理工学院奥法利商学院商业法和公共政策助理教授。他是智利的NSEP学者，也曾在阿根廷和墨西哥学习和工作。克里斯·卡尔 (Chris Carr) 是圣路易斯奥比斯波加州理工学院奥法利亚商学院的商业法和公共政策教授。他还是四次富布赖特奖获得者（意大利、突尼斯、巴基斯坦和蒙古）。</p> ]]>;

class="attribution">迈克尔·奥斯汀/theispot.com</p></figcaption></figure><p>外资企业在华经营面临的风险日益严峻。除了需要考虑的高级别地缘政治和经济风险之外，越来越多的出境禁令（如果公司卷入纠纷，外国高管就无法离开中国）也带来了非常个人化的风险。尽管媒体对一些案例进行了广泛报道——美国调查公司Mintz Group的一名新加坡高管被禁止出境，并<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-65061116">拘留了该公司的五名中国员工</a>； <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/huawei-s-meng-wanzhou-2-michaels-what-next-china-u-n1280229">两名加拿大商人被针锋相对地拘留，</a>以报复美国对一名在加拿大被捕的华为高管提出的欺诈指控——许多在国际上开展业务的公司都相对默默无闻地面临着出境禁令和商业劫持的现实。</p><p>这种风险正在增加，而且不太可能很快减弱。在正常的业务过程中，没有什么比公司高管或员工被拘留在国外更具破坏性和波动性的了。在中国运营的公司应该提前为这些潜在情况做好准备。</p><p></p><p>出境禁令可能源于民事商业纠纷以及更严重的法律纠纷。 <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-chinese-law-raises-risks-for-american-firms-in-china-u-s-officials-say-cf62c1a0">中国最近对反间谍法的修订</a>，包括对拥有“与国家安全有关的文件、数据、材料或物品”的模糊、开放式禁令，很容易涵盖任何行业的日常商业活动，使外国高管面临更大的被捕风险。 <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/china-travel-advisory.html">美国国务院最近警告说</a>，中国政府“任意执行当地法律，包括对美国公民和其他国家公民发布出境禁令，没有根据法律规定公平和透明的程序。”</p><p>因商业原因而受到出境禁令的人在被阻止在机场登机之前通常不会收到提前通知。该人通常会受到讯问，但不会被告知有关出境禁令的原因或如何提出异议的信息。</p><p>发生商业纠纷时，出境禁令通常只有在外国人同意中国对方的要求后才会解除——中国对方通过限制个人自由，在纠纷中获得了巨大的影响力。即使外国人愿意在被困在中国的情况下花费必要的时间和金钱在法庭上追诉案件，中国法院也不太可能做出有利于外国当事人的裁决。</p><p></p><p>以亨利·蔡（Henry Cai）为例，他是土生土长的中国人，在 20 世纪 80 年代与妻子搬到加利福尼亚州，并成为美国公民。 2012年，蔡投资了一家中国科技初创公司，持股8%，并担任该公司董事。几年后，当这家初创公司面临现金流问题并拖欠贷款时，蔡多次前往中国处理这种情况。 2017年，蔡在机场被拦截并被拒绝出境，此时他意识到自己卷入了该公司债权人提起的诉讼。六年后，他仍然<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-us-exit-ban-diplomacy-11668357015">滞留在中国</a>，无法支付解除出境禁令所需的数百万美元。对于在中国的他以及在加州的妻子和两个孩子来说，人员、情感和经济损失都很高。</p><p></p><p>另一个例子是加州商人布莱恩·霍洛维茨(Brian Horowitz)，他从一家中国制造商那里购买了燃气搅拌机。由于搅拌机不符合加州空气质量标准而引发合同纠纷后，霍洛维茨前往中国与供应商会面。当他试图回国时， <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2011-jan-28-la-fi-china-horowitz-20110128-story.html">在上海机场被拘留</a>；供应商对其公司提出了合同索赔，法院在霍洛维茨不知情的情况下实施了退出禁令。两周后，他的妻子向中国供应商电汇了 25 万美元，让她的丈夫回家。</p><p>尽管因商业纠纷而实施的出境禁令在中国是合法的，但外国高管也面临着成为非法商业劫持事件受害者的风险。在这种情况下，他们可能会被限制在酒店房间或公司设施（例如办公室或工厂）内。劫持商业人质最高可判处三年监禁。然而，在实践中，除非发生暴力，否则中国<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/08/chinas-police-think-hostages-arent-their-problem/">执法部门往往拒绝</a>干预这些情况。</p><p>在一个案例中，一家美国珠宝公司的高管前往中国与一家制造商讨论产品订单和<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3692138">65 万美元付款的</a>纠纷。该高管进入制造商工厂后，她的钱包和护照被没收。随后她被带回酒店，并由制造商的员工看守了五天。她在一名精通中文的美国律师的帮助下逃脱，该律师前往中国，帮助她躲避警卫，并将她带到大使馆。</p><p>另一个案例是，一家美国公司派两名中层管理人员参观为其生产产品的中国工厂。这家美国公司已经向制造商支付了货款，但其高管了解到，工厂工人拒绝发货，因为他们的工资已经几个月没有支付了。工人们将这些高管锁在工厂内，并要求支付赎金才能释放他们。为了释放人质并获得货物，美国公司必须向制造公司和工人支付费用。</p><p>商业劫持人质事件通常会在几天或几周内得到解决，而出境禁令可能需要数月或数年才能解除。这两种情况都没有得到官方追踪，商界人士往往对他们的困境保密。尽管如此，根据六个国家（美国、加拿大、英国、德国、荷兰和澳大利亚）政府的数据和媒体报道，我们记录了大约过去<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/tie.22261">100 多起企业出境禁令和商业人质事件</a>十年。鉴于政府关于这一现象的文件并不全面，而且并非每个案例都会受到媒体关注，这可能是一个严重的低估。</p><h3>采取多方面的方法，为最坏的情况做好准备</h3><p>这些情况的尖锐的个人性质和地缘政治动态使得规划和解决它们特别具有挑战性。您应该支付多少钱才能使您的同事（或您自己）免于被扣为人质？您如何与员工的配偶谈论其伴侣被拘留的原因以及您计划就其返回进行谈判？与媒体接触以施加政治压力以释放员工是您工作的一部分吗？</p><p>为了应对这种情况，企业领导者必须承认前往中国的员工发生这种情况的风险，并进一步了解情况，例如与经历过这种情况的其他人建立对话，这一点至关重要。他们还应与美国驻外领事官员、公司所在城市的中国官员和警察局长、美国联邦和州政府领导人、地方和国家媒体成员以及适用的行业团体（例如美中贸易全国委员会。</p><p>企业应预先组建危机处理小组并制定行动计划，为中国及其母国的关键员工和顾问分配具体职责。该计划应包括外部沟通，例如利用社交媒体引起人们对被困员工困境的关注。公司应咨询其商业保险公司，了解是否有相关保险可减轻出境禁令或商业人质事件的财务影响。</p><p>在中国有商业利益的高管还应密切关注应付账款、合同义务和业务关系的基调，以识别潜在的冲突或分歧来源。他们应该尽力在问题出现之前预见到问题，并且应该特别警惕任何未偿债务或产品已交付但由于任何原因尚未完全付款的情况。</p><p></p><p>如果已经或疑似已经提起诉讼，或者欠中国实体任何债务，公司应避免让员工前往中国。如果此类旅行不可避免，员工应保持经常沟通，以便其他人了解他们的行踪和日程安排，并应避免单独旅行。如果争议已经发生但尚未具体化为诉讼，并且员工必须前往中国，请考虑在美国先行提起诉讼，假设美国法院对中国企业拥有管辖权。例如，如果美国公司在美国法院指控违反合同，那么员工在国外时应携带翻译成中文的美国诉讼文件。</p><p></p><p>领导者还必须准备好支持和帮助员工及其家人。提前成立的危机小组应该有一个计划，与被困海外的员工及其家人以及整个公司的员工进行诚实和敏感的沟通。表现出你的关心。保持透明和诚实。这些情况会让人精神疲惫、迷失方向、令人恐惧；它们也是建立信任、团结和关爱文化的机会。与金钱相比，更重要的是人。</p><p>当然，重要的是继续致力于以切实的方式帮助受影响的员工及其家人。安排向受影响的家庭提供个性化的护理包；拜访他们的家，并与他们面对面交流。在可能的情况下，还向被困在国外的员工寄送爱心包，并方便与家人通话。</p><p>出境禁令和商业人质事件等情况是人权和地缘政治问题，也是对个人商业的强烈挑战。商业领袖明智地通过制定全面的战略方法来应对此类挑战。</p><p></p>

的多元化负责人为例，他举办了一场名为“别叫我凯伦”的工作场所活动，以强调“美国白人女性的经历范围”，并促进“关于种族的公开和诚实的对话”。由于有色人种员工的强烈反对，她被安排休假。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink"

“问题是，婚姻是什么？我认为婚姻本质上是……一男一女的结合。” <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p>尽管这听起来很外交，但这种回应并没有意识到，从许多同性恋者的角度来看，安德森反对同性婚姻在逻辑上意味着他认为奥曼是二等公民。然而，在我们关于这个话题的无数次对话中，我们可以用一只手数出对方认识到我们可能会认为他们的观点是对我们基本人性的攻击的次数。这种方法并不要求他们改变观点。它只是要求他们承认这种观点可能会如何传播到另一方。</p><p>部分由于这种挫败感，我们开发了一个争议量表，将分歧的主题沿直线绘制出来。左边是最安全的话题，在这些话题中存在分歧是可以预料的，甚至是值得庆祝的。右边是最有争议的话题，对话最有可能变得丑陋。</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>如何表达不同意见</h4><p class="caption">在这种争议规模上定位对话主题可以帮助您在更有可能进行尊重性讨论的层面上构建一个困难的主题。 </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAG_Yoshino_Essay_Winter_2024_Figure-1.png" alt="如何表达不同意见" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p>关于个人品味的分歧通常是温暖而善意的。当朋友嘲笑我们喜欢垃圾电视节目时，这些分歧会加强而不是削弱我们的关系。对事实的分歧也相对舒服，只要这确实是关于事实的辩论（例如谁、什么、何时、何地或如何），而不是关于价值观的几乎不加掩饰的辩论（被定义为“另类事实”或“假新闻”） ）。当话题在争议规模上进一步向右漂移时，真正的危险就来了。最激烈的对话是其中一方或双方都感到他们的平等人性受到质疑的对话。</p><p>想象一下，您是工作场所多元化和包容性倡议的拉丁裔支持者，而您正在与反对该计划的非拉丁裔同事进行辩论。我们认为，讨论该倡议是否成功地提高了拉丁裔在工作场所的代表性（事实），您会觉得不舒服，但可以控制。您会发现很难争论是否应在晋升决策（政策）中考虑多样性因素。你会发现争论心理学家理查德·赫恩斯坦和政治学家查尔斯·默里臭名昭著的假设，即智商在种族和族裔群体之间存在差异（人性平等）是令人痛苦的。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a></p><p>身份分歧的问题在于，特权较高的对话伙伴几乎总是将问题定位在争议规模上的不同位置，而不是特权较少的对话伙伴。如果您认为您的公司过于关注反种族主义，您可能会将这场争议视为关于组织应如何优先考虑其使命的不同方面的政策辩论。你的谈话对象是一位亚裔美国同事，她可能会认为你轻视了她对公司的归属感。毕竟，她是那个必须与工作场所的反亚裔偏见作斗争的人。您将该问题定位在“政策”争议范围的中间位置。她将其定位于“人性平等”的右极端。</p><p></p><p>您可能会发现，在认识到对方在争议范围内的位置后，您会重新评估分歧的性质，使问题更接近他们所定位的位置。但你可能不会，我们也不会强迫你这样做。我们所要求的只是您明确承认对方的立场。在谈话开始时，你可能会这样说：“对我来说，这是一场政策辩论，但我知道这对你来说可能是非常个人化的，在分享我的观点时，我会尽力尊重这一现实。 ”有时，在谈话期间或之后，您可能会意识到自己将这个话题视为纯粹的智力练习，并且需要认识到讨论可能对对方产生的影响：“我一直在将政策论点摆到桌面上，但我能问一下，作为一个生活可能更直接受到这个问题影响的人，你对这次讨论有何感受？”</p><p>我们认为，您会惊讶地发现，承认自己的相对主题立场可以在多大程度上消除分歧带来的伤害或激烈情绪。即使这些立场对双方来说都是显而易见的，这一点仍然成立。通常，我们需要的不是更多的知识，而是对共享知识的更多认可。</p><p></p><h3>发现不常见的共同点</h3><p>在 1987 年的电影<cite>《铁血战士》</cite>中，达奇（阿诺·施瓦辛格饰演）和狄龙（卡尔·韦瑟斯饰演）以史诗般的握手方式互相打招呼。 “狄龙，你个王八蛋。”达奇说道，他们走到对方面前，双手紧握在一起，粗壮的手臂摆成V字形，就像要扳手腕一样。他们拒绝放开彼此的手。然后握手就变成了一场真正的扳手腕比赛。这几乎是对过度阳刚之气的模仿。</p><p>如果不是病毒式传播的模因，这个场景可能已经被遗忘了。当社交媒体用户想向两个看似无关的人，群体或具有令人惊讶的共同点的概念展示时，他们就会发布荷兰语和狄龙握手的照片。他们在荷兰的手臂上放了一个标签，另一个标签在狄龙的手臂上，以及中间的共同点。在一个例子中，复仇和冰淇淋握手在“最好的冷”一词上。史诗般的握手还催生了其他尝试使用Venn图突出显示不可预测的重叠的尝试。我们了解到，银行抢劫犯，DJ和传教士分享“举手”。这些图像帮助我们看到了每场手臂摔跤比赛中隐藏的握手。</p><p>这种能力至关重要，培养它比看起来要难。传统的智慧是，在与某人不同意时，提供共识点是一种有效的策略。但是，正如哲学家丹尼尔·丹内特（Daniel Dennett）指出的那样，找到“一般或普遍同意的问题”的观点特别有用。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a>这个想法是找到罕见的共同点，使您摆脱默认值。人们常常会为那些感觉像是空虚的手势的平淡无奇的人安顿下来。这就像发布银行抢劫犯，DJ和传教士模因，并使共性“职业”。</p><p>取而代之的是，尝试找到可以解放您以及您的对话伙伴的罕见共同点，并有助于使最容易讨论的主题的发炎。近年来，成群的有关父母通常涌入通常困倦的市政厅会议，以表达有关在孩子们教室中举行的种族的对话的愤怒。这样的父母是巴特·格拉斯哥（Bart Glasgow）（与佐治亚州坎顿的保守派福音派的基督教白人戴维（David）无关），他在学校董事会会议上讲话，反对在当地地区雇用DEI管理员。</p><p></p><p>巴特和他的妻子科利决定就种族主题与四名专家交谈。其中一位是埃默里大学（Emory University）的非裔美国人研究教授兼主席卡罗尔·安德森（Carol Anderson），还有几本书的作者，包括<cite>怀特·愤怒（White Rage）</cite> 。从表面上看，安德森和格拉斯因几乎没有共同点。然而，在他们长达一个小时的对话中，双方都付出了巨大的努力来找到联系点。 <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a>巴特·格拉斯哥（Bart Glasgow）指出，他写了关于公民抗命话题的高级学院论文，研究了亨利·戴维·梭罗（Henry David Thoreau），圣雄甘地（Mahatma Gandhi）和小马丁·路德·金（Martin Luther King Jr.）等人物。 “要采取圣经的原则，即当仇恨向您展示时，转过另一个脸颊并表现出爱。”安德森（Anderson）指出，她的父亲是“职业军事”，并描述在教堂和“敬畏上帝”社区中长大。他们都在与世界上<cite>的《百科全书》以及将他们带到伍兹德的父母中的经验，他们与世界书籍百科全书</cite>成长的经验保持联系。他们继续分享在教育环境中在少数群体中的经验。黑人的安德森（Anderson）谈到要乘坐大多数白人高中。白人的科利·格拉斯哥（Coley Glasgow）分享说，她在两所历史悠久的黑人大学完成了高等教育。</p><p>探索共同基础有偿股息。随着谈话的继续，他们播出了分歧。巴特·格拉斯哥（Bart Glasgow）反对着重于系统性种族主义。安德森不同意。后来，巴特倡导学校凭证，这将使父母能够将孩子搬出表现不佳的当地学校，安德森再次不同意。然而，这些分歧是非常民事的。谈话结束时，巴特对安德森说：“我可以和你说话了几个小时。我真的可以。”安德森回答说：“非常感谢您在这里，问了这些精彩的问题并参与了这次精彩的对话。谢谢。我喜欢它。”</p><p>下次您面对分歧时，请尝试问自己与对话伙伴有什么共同点，这可能会让他们感到惊讶。如果您正在辩论同性婚姻，您可能会指出，许多人（直率和同性恋）认为婚姻是一个过时的机构。因此，尽管有所不同，但你们俩都相信婚姻作为机构的重要性。发现这些不常见的共同点需要一些独创性，有时可能会感到纳税。但是回报很大：找到他们可以使你们俩都摆脱反思性和无意识的感觉，即您是对话中的对手。</p><h3>展示你的作品</h3><p>在我们启动梅尔策多样性，包容和归属中心后不久，我们收到了一位受人尊敬的同事的令人不安的电子邮件。她要求我们将我们的平台用作多样性和包容性学者，以倡导那些不完全接种自己或孩子的人。在她看来，将违反疫苗授权的人排除在学校和工作场所中，对多样性，包容性和归属感的价值观具有“令人不安的”影响。她邀请我们与她讨论这个问题，因此可以在大学范围内解决。</p><p>在Covid-19-19大流行将疫苗变成白热问题之前，我们收到了这一要求。即便如此，我们知道这次对话可能很困难。我们热情地不同意她的观点，但我们担心既不承认她在争议量表上的立场，也不是提供史诗般的握手就足够了。</p><p>因此，我们深入分享了我们的推理。我们礼貌地说，我们不相信反对疫苗适合我们中心工作范围的反对。我们解释说，该中心的主要功能是解决对有色人种或女性等边缘化社会群体的偏见。我们承认，某些群体，例如宗教少数群体，由于他们的信仰而不是由于其身体特征而受到虐待。但是，特别是作为一个新成立的中心，我们并不渴望将边缘化群体的定义扩展到由他们对单个问题的看法所定义的人们。我们还指出，疫苗犹豫的话题在我们的专业知识之外提出了复杂的医疗，道德和公共卫生问题。</p><p>我们没有幻想这种方法会改变同事的想法。但这表明我们对她的观点进行了真正的考虑，这也为她提供了一个机会，可以指出我们可能错的地方。她感谢我们的回应的周到，指出她完全了解我们的立场，并邀请我们参加一个单独的主题的活动。</p><p>我们对同事的询问的方法就是展示您的作品的一个例子 - 也就是说，在尽可能详细地解释了分歧，以向其他人仔细思考这个主题。强调分歧要点的建议似乎与我们以前的重点是寻找共同基础的一步不一致。但是，您可以并且应该同时做 - 寻找一致性和详细分歧点的份额。描绘了您基于分歧的事实和价值观的完整图片，任何已经告知您当前思维的研究和对话以及您持有的任何剩余疑问或不确定性。在您的对话伙伴的一生中，他们可能遇到了许多基于伪劣或不完整的工作反对自己的观点的人。展示您所做的努力将使您与这些对手区分开。这将帮助他们回应您，而不是对过去的所有声音。</p><p>注意：在展示您的作品时，请勿在立即驳回反对论点之前提供对反对论点的摘要。作家莫伊拉·韦格尔（Moira Weigel）将这个错误比作高中文章的“最后一段的第一句话”：“我已经想到了另一边。不要指责我没有想到另一方！” <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a>与其采取粗略的方法，花时间研究和理解相反的观点，然后在解释为什么继续以不同的方式看待问题之前慷慨解囊。展示您的工作以表示尊重。</p><h3>管理期望</h3><p>总体而言，许多人对分歧的容忍度较低。如果会议室桌上出现了有争议的身份问题，他们会立即改变主题。如果他们与某人有争议，他们会在数周内重播对话。不幸的是，大卫就是这样的人。他会逃避表达分歧以避免冲突的声音，然后沮丧地努力，因为另一个人不同意他。无论出于何种原因，他似乎都有一个不切实际的期望，即身份对话应该始终以团体拥抱结束。</p><p>人们有时会问我们沿着这些路线的问题：“我是无神论者和坚定的自由主义者，但是我在工作中的一位同事是一位保守的福音派基督徒。尽管存在分歧，我们如何一起工作？”我们的答案：降低您的期望。我们承认，这一建议可能不会进入励志海报。但是我们认为，扩展您将激情的强度扩展到与关系强度的分歧中是完全合适的。</p><p></p><p>兰德尔·蒙罗（Randall Munroe）的卡通片显示了一个棍子的身影，猛烈地敲击了电脑键盘，而另一个房间的声音呼唤：“你要上床睡觉吗？”棍子数字回答：“我不能。这个很重要。互联网上有人<em>错了</em>。” <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a>大多数人都有足够的观点，不要严厉关心随机的互联网巨魔分歧。但是，在其他情况下也值得培养健康的本能。如果我们与配偶对身份问题有重大分歧，我们每个人都会挣扎。然而，我们既监督又提高了与我们不同意的学生的职业，因为教师的关系不如婚姻关系。同事，邻居和熟人也是如此。当关系不那么亲密时，对协议的需求应降低。</p><p>您还可以管理对单个对话中可以实现的目标的期望。与关于沉重主题的任何争议一样，身份冲突在一次遭遇中通常不会完全解决。第一次对话可能会很糟糕，但是第二次对话可能会好转，第三次对话也更好。在取得进步之前，您可能需要进行多个越野和越野越野对话。</p><p></p><p>当人们与有反对意见的人进行有关身份，多样性和正义的对话时，我们鼓励他们练习我们描述的四种策略：</p><ul><li>在争议范围内找到对话。对您来说，谈话可能是事实或政策辩论，但是对另一个人来说，这可能是关于他们平等人性的辩论。</li><li>找到不常见的共同点 - 同意无关的协议点。</li><li>展示您关于其余分歧的工作，以证明您已经仔细考虑了这个主题。</li><li>管理您的期望。扩展您关心与关系强度的分歧的强度。</li></ul><p>尽管我们分享了示例，但您可能会认为我们对通过实践这些策略对身份方面不同意的身份问题不同意的能力是不现实的。的确，他们无法确保所有对话中的积极成果。但是，我们有信心，如果您遵循这些准则，您会看到对话质量的立即提高。</p><p></p><p>有时，当然，您和另一个人之间的裂痕太宽了。有时，尝试对话将在没有解决方案的情况下结束。有时关系本身将结束。尽管结果可能会感到可怕，但有时是必要的。我们并不是要保证每一个分歧都会幸福地结束。相反，我们希望帮助您确保在您摆脱它之前确实无法造成鸿沟。</p><p>当然，其他时候，您可能会以积极的方式感到惊讶。很少有有意义的关系没有冲突。当处理良好时，紧张时刻可以加深纽带。分享周到的意见差异可以表明您对他们的重视程度足以对他们诚实，而不是向其他人分享，而不是不诚实或发表虚假的意见。此外，通过建模如何有效地不同意，您可以为整个组织中的其他人如何进行当今最棘手的对话设定基调。</p><p></p>

也就是说，您希望人们离开谈话后要采取的措施 - 这有助于了解您的听众。在研究数百场有力的演讲（甚至可以追溯到1950年代，从斯坦福大学图书馆签出商业演讲）时，我发现他们的大多数<a href="https://www.duarte.com/how-to-write-a-call-to-action-in-a-persuasive-speech/#:~:text=Who's%20in%20Your%20Audience%2C%20and,they%20bring%20to%20the%20table.">呼吁都</a>针对四种受众类型之一：<em>行动者</em>，他们可以启发活动，他们可以促进活动和让事情进入组织；<em>供应商</em>可以提供实现理想目标所需的资源和其他类型的支持；<em>有影响力的人</em>，他们可以动员他人采用新的想法或方法；或<em>创新者</em>，他们可以产生新的想法并运用自己的智能来解决问题或抓住机会。</p><p>您在演讲中会讨论哪种类型的受众？一旦您解决了关键的“谁”，您就可以分析“什么”和“如何”让人们采用和实施您的想法。具体来说，您可以采用以下方法之一。</p><p><strong>深入研究观众的思想和感受。</strong>问问自己您想联系的人：他们现在<em>如何</em>看待您的想法？如果还没有在他们的雷达上，当他们听到您要说的话时，他们会<em>如何</em>看待它？您如何希望他们的思想和感受因您的谈话而<em>改变</em>？</p><p></p><p>这不仅仅是一个假设的踩踏事业练习。<em>事先</em>收集这些信息，并阐明您要<em>转移</em>人们的观点 - 将确定您构架问题和可能对此的响应的方式。这可能意味着进行一些研究或调查受众，以评估人们当前对您的主题的了解以及对此的感觉。例如，您可以采访与您的客户或文化最接近的人。他们对您的想法感到兴奋，还是对此持怀疑态度？他们对此有什么问题？您不仅会弄清楚您从哪种基线开始 - 您还可能会获得有关受众的见解，这将有助于您<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/four-storytelling-techniques-to-bring-your-data-to-life/">制作信息</a>。您还可以确定稍后在演讲之后的基准测试，例如您组织的KPI或重要的人才招募指标。</p><p><strong>预期情绪上的粘性点。</strong>您想在观众中触发的转变越大，量化的困难越困难，尤其是在这是情感上的转变时。当您研究观众的头脑中当前发生的事情时，也考虑他们的心。无论论证多么合乎逻辑或扎实的证据，您的信息中最困难的部分是什么？您可以识别哪些潜在抵抗来源？如果您确实赢得了人们的脑海，那么当您也赢得了他们的心时，您将如何知道？</p><p>情绪改变通常不会在仪表板上出现。即使允许组织<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/employee-emotions-arent-noise-theyre-data/">跟踪客户或员工情绪的</a>技术也不会收集有关您需要了解的一切的数据。有时，您只有在以后在新行为中看到这种阻力时，您就会知道自己已经克服了情绪阻力 - 例如，当员工停止推迟重要的计划时，或者当客户改变主意并购买产品的新版本时。</p><h3>在您的谈话中</h3><p>您可以在发生时衡量谈话的成功可能性。为此，您将以几种方式衡量受众反应。</p><p><strong>观察房间或在线的观众行为。</strong>最直接的度量形式是观察人们如何实时对演示文稿的反应。当每个人都拿出手机拍摄幻灯片的照片时，您就会知道有些东西引起了他们的注意。当人们笑，喘息或鼓掌时，也请注意，这些基本的行为提示信号<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/make-your-data-insights-visually-consumable/">是您谈话中的时刻引起共鸣的</a>。技术在这里非常方便。如果您的谈话（无论是亲自交付还是远程），则可以轻松地回去寻找观众明显或听觉地做出反应的地方。</p><p><strong>看看与会者的人数。</strong>如果您在一个大型活动（例如行业聚会）中向人群讲话，另一个有用的指标是，当他们可以参加其他会议时，他们会听到您讲话的人数。如果您打包了物理或虚拟房间，则意味着您甚至在张开嘴之前就可以有效地提高谈话。当我今年在Salesforce会议的Dreamforce上发表讲话时，我的大多数听众偏向年轻，对我的作品不熟悉，但是谈话仍然超额订阅，溢出的参与者聚集在门口。我的名字不是吸引人 - 而是，这是我标题和构图的信息，这是神经的影响。当与会者对演讲进行评分时，数据表明它已经符合标题和计划描述中的承诺。</p><p><strong>火花和跟踪社交参与。</strong>如果您的谈话正在引起每个人的嗡嗡声，尤其是在大型活动中，他们可能会在社交渠道上实时分享您的演讲中的报价或图像。请务必将您的社交手柄和特定于事件的主题标签添加到幻灯片中，以便您的观众更容易标记您，并可以跟踪他们与大多数人互动的想法。 （这些帖子，评论，喜欢，重视和其他瞬间的社会反应稍后可以在事后报告中捕获。）您还可以通过以易于共享的格式提供重新包装的演示内容来加速和衡量想法的传播像信息图表或<a href="https://www.duarte.com/resources/books/slidedocs/">slideocs</a>一样（幻灯片具有更多文本，因为它们本来是由观众阅读的，而不是简单地由演讲者介绍）。我们的一位技术客户使我们通过脚本和幻灯片视觉效果以及指向其他材料的可跟踪链接构建了他们的主题演讲。</p><h3>谈话之后</h3><p>您的谈话指标可以跟踪对演示文稿的满意度，并且受众成员已经采取了一些步骤来实施这些想法。</p><p><strong>使用调查评估受众满意度。</strong>许多演讲者在演讲后使用调查来衡量受众情绪。如果您在讲话之前对人们进行了调查，您将可以看到您的谈话是否已移动了行动者，供应商，有影响力的人或观众的创新者，任何更接近您的观点。我们与之合作的一家《财富》 100技术公司还使用受众评分作为管理工具来激励扬声器表现良好。每个人都希望获得最高的分数，而那些不好的人可能会在下次讲话时努力提高得分，或者不邀请他们回来。</p><p><strong>检查说话者自己的满意。</strong>在没有强大衡量文化的公司中，有时成功的迹象之一是说话者本身如何看待他们的演讲。这似乎是凝视肚脐，但比大多数人想象的要大。如果一位始终如一地从事沟通者的技能和表现的领导者对听众的提示很敏感，他们会感到有效的演讲，那么实际上很有可能他们拥有的很不错。而且，嘿，当您的首席执行官想感觉像摇滚明星时，他们走出舞台就像一个人时，我称之为胜利。</p><p></p><p><strong>量化采取的动作。</strong>在这里，您可以回到定义的基线结果 - 开发演示文稿时想要引起或改变的受众行为。尽管满意度和买入问题等反应，但行动更重要。给出演讲的重点是说服人们采用和实施您的想法。因此，请查看您的倡议因谈话而获得的牵引力。您的员工是否填写了您的人力资源团队在福利演示中提到的入学表格？您的销售团队是否下载了您在开球时推出的新公司概述甲板？结果有多少交易？我将QR码嵌入幻灯片甲板中 - 大多数人都知道如何使用它们 - 并分享我的幻灯片。这使参加者可以对概念进行更深入的“双击”。我的营销团队可以跟踪所有活动以进行交谈后分析。</p><p></p><p>如果您试图防止某些行动，那么衡量这些行动也很重要。一年，一家公司雇用了我的团队来帮助他们提供计划中的重组消息，这是最困难的演讲之一。高管特别担心两种后果：高度有价值的员工感到沮丧，生产力下降。因此，他们决定在宣布公告后跟踪两个数据点：未来几个月的辞职数量，以及在接下来的几周内反映在客户关系管理数据中的任何生产力下降。有了这些报告，他们感到放心，发现这两个数字都比公司领导人预期的要好得多。在这种情况下，衡量成功意味着在传递灵敏的信息后跟踪<em>缺乏</em>（即负面的）动作。</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-real-measure-fersentation-success/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>化学披露的迫在眉睫的挑战</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-looming-challenge-of-phemical-disclosures/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-looming-challenge-of-chemical-disclosures/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 12:00:11 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Lori Bestervelt, Colleen McLoughlin, and Jillian Stacy. <p>Lori Bestervelt博士是前全球运营负责人，Colleen McLoughlin博士，Dabt，ERT，是Enhesa可持续化学毒理学主任。 Jillian Stacy是Enhesa可持续化学的业务经理。</p> ]]>; </dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Manufacturing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Product Life Cycle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Supply Chain Management]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sustainable Business Practices]]></category><category><![CDATA[Operations]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social Responsibility]]></category><category><![CDATA[Supply Chains & Logistics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sustainability]]></category><category><![CDATA[Frontiers]]></category><description><![CDATA[Sam Falconer/theispot.com New and emerging rules in the U.S. and Europe that make companies responsible for the environmental impacts of products through their entire life cycles are forcing brands to confront a striking knowledge gap: their often inadequate understanding of the chemicals found in their supply chains.

Brands don&#39;t necessarily know what to ask for from their suppliers. They also don&#39;t know how to assess the impact of chemicals when they do get the information. Brands might also have to manage multiple internal chemical inventory systems and harmonize data from suppliers across different platforms.</p><p> To get to a place where all parties are on the same page, brands need to standardize a process for determining what questions to ask, whom to ask, and how to manage the information gathered. Brands also need to explain to suppliers why this information is important to the business and how they will use it, to allay privacy concerns.</p><h3> Evaluating Chemical Risk by the Numbers</h3><p> As we&#39;ve noted, we expect more brands to produce their own hard evidence of the chemical composition of their products when they are unable to get reliable information from their supply chain partners.</p><p> The only way to deliver objective certainty on the chemical risk of products is by performing chemical hazard assessments, which identify the specific chemical components used in the production of a product and screen them against comprehensive lists of known toxins to provide a hazard score. They are not cheap, though. Companies can expect to spend anywhere from $3,000 to $10,000 per substance for each assessment; the cost is at the higher end of that range for substances on which there is a great deal of scientific literature that must be carefully reviewed. Because even the most basic apparel, cosmetics, toys, and consumer products contain dozens of individual chemicals, the costs can mount quickly.</p><p> Add to those costs the challenges of retooling and replacing toxic substances in the production process once they&#39;re found, and it starts to become clear how looming deadlines like the European Green Deal&#39;s Net Zero by 2050 target are much closer than they appear.</p><p></p><p> The critical first step in the process of removing toxic substances from a supply chain is systematically identifying them. For example, we recently worked on a project with a global footwear brand that had a companywide mission to make its rubber supply chain more environmentally sustainable. It began by building a comprehensive database of its current chemical inventory and checking all entries against a list of known toxins and regulated chemicals in each jurisdiction in which it operates. Only then could it start the process of transitioning to safer chemicals.</p><p> As they make progress, brands need to build this institutional knowledge into their sourcing and product development processes to mitigate or eliminate the harmful chemical impacts of future products throughout their life cycles.</p><p> In the long run, these initiatives will result in safer, more sustainable consumer products. In the near term, however, expect to see a great deal of disruption and reshuffling of supply chains as more brands start to recognize that the tried-and-true methods of manufacturing and distribution are no longer sufficient in today&#39;s sustainability-oriented economy.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-looming-challenge-of-chemical-disclosures/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> How to Engage People on Reskilling: A Language Lesson</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-engage-people-on-reskilling-a-language-lesson/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-engage-people-on-reskilling-a-language-lesson/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 18:00:49 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Carl Clarke, Zsófia Belovai, Michelle Davies, Nicha Surawattananon, and James Elfer. <p>Carl Clarke is the director of talent, learning, leadership, skills, and people performance at Vodafone.

Technology advancements like <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_890740/lang--en/index.htm">generative AI</a> have led the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/05/future-of-jobs-2023-skills/">World Economic Forum to project</a> that 44% of employees will experience skill disruptions in 2023. On the surface, organizations seem to be rising to this challenge: Thirty-four percent of Fortune 50 companies have made reskilling and upskilling top strategic priorities and have designated a hefty 1.5% of their annual budgets to support them, according to research from Boston Consulting Group.</p><p> However, despite the level of investment in reskilling infrastructure, such as learning programs and talent technology platforms, we find that organizations are undervaluing the need to <em>change employee behavior</em> through effective engagement strategies. Having a well-designed reskilling program doesn&#39;t help an organization if people don&#39;t sign on to participate in it. To achieve a shift, leaders must understand how to connect people with reskilling initiatives in ways that encourage them to take up learning.</p><p></p><p> In an experiment conducted by a team of behavioral scientists from consultancy MoreThanNow and global telecommunications company Vodafone, we found that while most leaders talk about reskilling as an opportunity for <em>individual</em> progress and/or a means to achieving company strategy, a more frank, assertive message about keeping their skills relevant in a digital future drove more people to act. We present this evidence on how to change behaviors to help leaders connect their employees with the vast organizational investments being made in reskilling and upskilling.</p><p></p><h3> Career Relevancy Resonates</h3><p> Our randomized, controlled experiment, which included a global sample of 800 Vodafone employees, aimed to identify the language and motives that would best engage people to explore Vodafone&#39;s case for change. We compared four different message types that introduced the company&#39;s learning offering and why employees should sign up for it:</p><p> <strong>1. Individual progression:</strong> You&#39;ll invest in your career path and thrive in a digital future.<br /> <strong>2. Company strategy:</strong> You&#39;ll help transform Vodafone into a technology company for a digital future.<br /> <strong>3. Learning enjoyment:</strong> You&#39;ll put the joy of learning into your work as you discover new skills and capabilities every day.<br /> <strong>4. Career relevancy and security:</strong> You&#39;ll develop skills and competencies for the digital future.</p><p> While most leaders and organizations tend to use messages 1 and 2 when talking about reskilling, we found that No. 4&#39;s more direct “career relevancy and security” message had the highest positive impact on attitudes toward reskilling into technology-focused roles. The employees who received that message were, on average, 4.7% more open to broader career options and 4.9% more likely to consider reskilling compared with employees who had received the other messages — despite the time and effort the program would require. While these numbers might seem small in magnitude, they are statistically significant, come from a cost-free change in language, and are scalable.</p><p> Perhaps more notably, the experiment showed that people who received the “career relevancy” message were more likely — by 14.7% — to explore reskilling opportunities on Vodafone&#39;s internal site, which provides a tangible way to measure how Vodafone&#39;s employees actually invest their time in developing their skills.</p><h3> Three Reskilling Communication Tips for Leaders</h3><p> Message 4 made more of an impact with the open, honest, and clear message about the necessity to reskill.</p><p> Decades of research show why losses loom larger than gains and how this can be used as an effective language tool to change minds and behaviors. For example, when people are asked to rate the emotional effect of losing or gaining money, they systematically <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=e89e139fc94470c62f0904b69c229816bba4c2ba">rate losses as having a greater impact</a> . Similarly, in a <a href="https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/28311/ssoar-jebo-2009-3-gachter_et_al-are_experimental_economists_prone_to.pdf?sequence=1">field experiment</a> conducted with economists, a message telling participants that they would be fined for late conference registrations was significantly more effective than a message offering a discount for early registration.</p><p> That body of research and our own study yielded the following three tips to help managers talk more effectively with their employees about reskilling amid the rise of disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence and generative AI.</p><p> <strong>Set the context: Be reassuring but transparent about emerging technologies&#39; potential impact on employees&#39; careers.</strong> Be honest about the uncertainties around the possible effects of AI and other technologies on job roles rather than communicating only the upsides. Employees often fear that AI will steal their jobs, but it is more likely to change and augment their jobs. Talk about staying proactive to these changes and engaging with upskilling and reskilling opportunities in order to ride the wave of change. This can lead to more active attempts by employees to explore the benefits of increasing their technical knowledge and evolving their roles accordingly.</p><p> <strong>Make it relevant: Give personal, specific examples.</strong> Talk about the impact of new technologies on the person&#39;s specific work area and outline what might change for the team. Perhaps the way your team develops presentations, processes data, or takes action on customer feedback will change. Identifying specific scenarios will help both you and your employees think about the skills necessary in the evolving tech landscape and create a tangible plan of action.</p><p> <strong>Make it real: Offer the best options for the future.</strong> Be well informed and open. Talk about training programs employees need to consider as skills for the future rather than as a nice-to-have benefit. It&#39;s easy for employees to get lost in a sea of reskilling program information, and as a manager, you have a responsibility to guide them toward the best future career options that your company has to offer. For example, instead of saying, “I want you to consider a training program to grow your career,” say, “I want you to consider a training program; there&#39;s a possibility that some parts of your role will be automated in the future, so we need to make sure your skills keep evolving.&quot;</p><p></p><p></p><p> Vodafone&#39;s experiment resulted in successful action: Company leaders changed their language from communicating “individual progression” benefits to a more candid “career relevancy and security” message. When Vodafone launched the first cohort of its reskilling program, it successfully engaged 4,000 employees in Italy using this upfront communication style. Some 300 people have now been successfully reskilled and redeployed from contact centers to other internal functions. In total, one million learning hours have been completed by Vodafone employees.</p><p> We encourage leaders to follow Vodafone&#39;s lead and talk about reskilling with their employees in a more open and direct manner. Your digital future — and the ability of your employees to successfully navigate a changed world — might depend on it.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-engage-people-on-reskilling-a-language-lesson/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Marketing With Generative AI: Harvard Business School&#39;s Ayelet Israeli</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/marketing-with-generative-ai-harvard-business-schools-ayelet-israeli/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/marketing-with-generative-ai-harvard-business-schools-ayelet-israeli/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 12:00:48 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. <p>Sam Ransbotham ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ransbotham">@ransbotham</a> ) is a professor in the information systems department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College, as well as guest editor for <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> &#39;s Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy Big Ideas initiative.

Today, Shervin and I are thrilled to be joined by Ayelet Israeli. She&#39;s associate professor and cofounder of the Customer Intelligence Lab at the Digital Data Design Institute at Harvard Business School. Ayelet, thanks for taking the time to talk with us.让我们开始吧。</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Thank you so much for having me.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Often, we begin by asking guests their professions. But what&#39;s nice about being a professor is that people kind of have an idea of what that means. But I still think it&#39;d be nice to hear a little bit about your background and bio. So can you take a minute and introduce yourself and tell us what you&#39;re interested in?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> All right. I&#39;m a marketing professor at Harvard Business School. I&#39;m really interested in how we can better leverage data and AI for better outcomes, if it&#39;s outcomes for the firms, for customers, for society at large. Some of the work I&#39;m working on is around gen AI and how firms can use that to gain better access to consumer information and preferences. In other work I do, I think about how we can eliminate algorithmic bias in our decision-making.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I saw your talk a few months ago about using generative AI, and it really struck me as interesting because lots of people are talking about generative AI, but we don&#39;t have a lot of evidence yet.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> The evidence … is not saying it&#39;s not there, but it&#39;s just forthcoming. But you&#39;re starting to get some evidence through this research that you&#39;re doing. What can we do with GPT and generative in market research?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Me and two of my colleagues that are at Microsoft, Donald Ngwe and James Brand, started thinking around, can we actually use GPT for market research? The idea was, some people have shown that you can replicate very well-known experiments, including the famous Milgram experiment, using GPT by just asking it questions. And we were thinking, “We work so much as researchers and as practitioners to better understand customer preferences; maybe we can use GPT to actually extract these kinds of preferences.”</p><p> For large language models, the idea is that they will give you the most likely next word. That&#39;s how language is produced. And we were thinking, “Maybe if we ask GPT or induce it to make a choice between two things, maybe the response, which is kind of the most likely next word, will actually reflect the most likely responses in the population. And in that sense, we will essentially query GPT but get kind of the underlying distribution of preferences that we see in the population.” And we started playing around with that idea. We focused on consumer products — because we assumed that the data that GPT is aware of is mostly around consumer products, maybe from review websites or things like that — to see, can this idea actually work?</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And does it?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Kind of!</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That&#39;s wonderful. So tell us more.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Our first rush was like, “OK, let&#39;s see if it can generate very basic things we expect from economics. Like, when the price is higher, does it know to reject an offer? Does it know to make this trade-off between price and choice?” And we do see kind of a downward-sloping demand curve, which is what you would expect to see when we query GPT thousands of times to get answers. We also see things like, “Oh, we can tell it something about its income, and it reacts to that.” When it has higher income, it&#39;s less price-sensitive, which makes sense — it&#39;s what we expect from people as well.</p><p> We also see that it can react to information about itself: “Oh, last time you bought in this category, you bought this particular brand” makes it much more likely to pick up this brand in the future. So those are kind of our tests of “Does it actually react in a way that humans would in surveys?” And then we took it one step further, and we were trying to get willingness to pay for products or for certain attributes. And then we basically compared the distribution of prices to distribution of prices we see in the marketplace, which is pretty consistent.</p><p> And a really interesting and exciting thing for us was the ability to look at willingness to pay for attributes, because it&#39;s something that we all, as marketers, want to find. In our example, it&#39;s toothpaste, and we&#39;re trying to figure out how much people are willing to pay for fluoride, which is something that is difficult for us to think about. If someone would ask you that — “I don&#39;t know.” I do know that I prefer to buy this toothpaste, but I don&#39;t know what is the number. So it made us more curious to see if GPT can provide us this number in the same way that we ask consumers. And the way that the researchers have shown over years, the best way to ask these questions is through conjoint studies. Essentially, you provide people with 10 to 15 choices, and through their different choices, you are able to understand the trade-offs that they&#39;re making and actually quantify the difference that they&#39;re willing to pay.</p><p> We essentially did that. We did a conjoint-type analysis with GPT, and we compared the outcomes to human studies that a forthcoming paper just ran and got pretty similar results, so we were very excited about that. Of course, the results are not identical. We need to do a lot more to figure out where some of the issues are and how much does this generalize, but just the fact that we were able to get it is incredibly exciting.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So it seems exciting for firms because I&#39;m guessing that the cost of doing a market study on a lot of people is much more than doing it just through a bunch of API calls with ChatGPT. That has to be the appeal. Are there other appeals?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Basically, these types of studies are time-consuming, costly, and complex. Ideally, you would like to ask people to make a lot of trade-offs, but you&#39;re limited by the human ability to do that. With GPT, you can query it a lot of times. But at this point, I&#39;m not going to tell anyone, “Replace all your human studies with GPT or with another LLM,” because there is a lot more work to be done to figure out how to do that right.</p><p> One of the things around GPT is that it&#39;s pretrained. It will give me preferences, but these preferences are relevant for the time period in which it was pretrained. And a firm wants to know, “What are the customers interested in right now?” So that&#39;s kind of a limitation.</p><p> What we&#39;re testing now is, maybe we still have to query people, but less people than you would normally have to. So usually when you run these studies, you need thousands of users to get something that would be robust and statistically significant from an academic or statistical standpoint. We&#39;re trying to look at, maybe I can collect information from much fewer humans and combine it with LLM through fine-tuning and generate something useful. But really, a big advantage would be cost savings and time savings.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> The time was a big one.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Yeah. And we&#39;re talking so far about consumer products, but you can think about business-to-business type surveys, which are way more expensive and harder to do. So perhaps there is potential there as well. We haven&#39;t tested that yet.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I love the idea. I mean, when you think about most use cases for generative AI, there&#39;s a lot about taking drudgery out of the work or creating images and content and summarizing text. And then there&#39;s more-advanced ones around planning and inventory management. But the one you&#39;re talking about is literally replacing humans with this, right? I mean, that&#39;s basically what it is.</p><p> And it&#39;s a beginning of something that could be quite interesting, because you&#39;ve proven, at least, that it&#39;s sort of rational, right? I mean, you&#39;re asking it all these questions, and it is economically, I guess, rational. But then, as a marketer [like] you are yourself, not all marketing strategies are based on rationality. In fact, many of them are based on completely irrational desires.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Right.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What are your thoughts on the nonrational choices that many people make that create these big brands and $20,000 handbags and all kinds of stuff like that? How do you tap into that?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Before I answer your question, the first thing I was nervous about as an academic is when you used the word <em>proven</em> .</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Prove — I heard it!</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I see Sam is ...</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I smiled when I said it.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I would say we showed evidence consistent with that. And we also know that these models are still evolving, and maybe something we showed a month ago will not be relevant in a month from now, which is also a reason why you shouldn&#39;t just go and implement it without testing. So I want to be careful about that.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yes.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> So you know there is the more rational view of what is a product, but brands have value that is created that is kind of not measurable to us and hard to quantify. But that&#39;s almost like the example I gave with fluoride. Like, we don&#39;t know how to quantify fluoride. We might find it difficult if I would ask you, “Oh, how much are you willing to pay for a brand name like Colgate versus a toothpaste that I just made up?”</p><p> Actually, the same model of conjoint study will be able to infer those differences. And we see preferences, for example, for Mac over a different computer type. So it&#39;s already embedded in there, in a way.</p><p> Now how accurate it is — it&#39;s an empirical question.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah, no, you&#39;re so right because as I heard you respond to this question, I also realized that my assumption that what you showed some evidence for, vis-à-vis proven, isn&#39;t necessarily rationality. It&#39;s that it&#39;s got an ability to sort of encapsulate what most people do — or what many people do — which is embedded in stuff that it was trained on. So then my second question is, how do you get this to be more segmented or more specific or more nuanced? Because when you do focus groups, you&#39;re looking maybe for a particular flavor/particular nuance mix.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Yes, and also, a lot of the uses that we have seen when GPT and other LLMs were just introduced, a lot of the excitement was, “I&#39;m an engineer. I can just ask it a question. It gives me the most common thing. That&#39;s exactly what I want.” And actually, what we are doing is the other side of that. We don&#39;t want the most common thing. We want to understand the distribution.</p><p> That&#39;s why when we query GPT, we ask it every question many, many times — because we want to get many, many different consumers. In our analysis, we only varied income and what you bought before. But we can, in the same way, vary gender, race, anything else that you want … age. And I&#39;ve seen other researchers do that. ……</p><p> There is a really interesting paper by colleagues at Columbia and Berkeley that used GPT to create perceptual maps — how close two brands are to each other. And they also showed differences by gender and age and things like that around cars, which is a market where we expect to see these differences. So you can definitely do that, too, in a similar way. And it was also shown in political science for politics. I can give someone an ideology, and their voting behavior makes sense, their text generation on different topics makes sense. That&#39;s also very exciting as a marketer who cares about heterogeneity and understanding the differences between different consumers.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah. If only we could use this for clinical trials.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I saw some paper on better bedside manner of LLMs relative to doctors, so maybe there&#39;s still something there. [Laughs.]</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That&#39;s GPT-5, maybe.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Yeah.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> As you&#39;re saying that, though, I think about the way these work is a probabilistic estimate of the most likely next word, the most likely next ... and you&#39;ve segmented out “Given that you are low income, high income, given that you are this attribute, that attribute …” That&#39;s interesting, but where do we come up with the weirdness, then? If everything is based off the “most probables,” particularly from predefined [parameters] — not that you&#39;re not brilliant about coming up with a nice search space, but how are we going to find the things we don&#39;t know, then ？ Isn&#39;t that something that comes out of market research and focus groups?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Certainly, and that&#39;s part of the challenge. Obviously, GPT learns some kind of distribution, but there are people that, you know … let&#39;s say all that it learns is from reviews. There might be a lot of very extreme consumers that don&#39;t write reviews online or don&#39;t have access to the internet but have these interesting extreme ideas. And even if I tell GPT, “I want [as much] randomness as possible, very high variation,” I will not get to those people. So that will definitely be a problem.</p><p> I know already of some startups that are trying to solve this issue and identify these extreme consumers and then take them to the next level by using LLMs to maybe predict what they will do in another case. But at the same time, there has been some work on [the] creativity of GPT and that it creates very creative ideas, which, you know, is not exactly what you&#39;re asking for.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Some of those creative ideas are unconstrained by reality. I think we&#39;ve all seen some of it, [like] the way that it plays chess and decides that that rule is a little bit too confining.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Right. So that&#39;s also the problem of hallucinations, which should be tested in different contexts. But I think the way that we induce it to make a choice is less prone to hallucination problems because it provides a choice and you&#39;re not asking for facts or something like that. I&#39;m not trying to say that GPT will outperform any customer survey or anything like this. All I want to see is if it is as good as humans.</p><p> And even with human customers that we talk to, we have to work really hard to find people to do these surveys, and sometimes we miss them. We might be able to get the distribution of some people but still have to work hard on the extremes without AI but with just human conversation.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What I find really interesting here is, you said something like, “It&#39;s not as good as a consumer survey,” and now I want to challenge that. Because what I find interesting in this idea that you have is that when you think about other AI or gen AI use cases, there is a sort of burden of proof that you say, “OK, so I&#39;m a human.我是个工程师。 I have a task. Let&#39;s ask GPT,” or any generative AI system, whether it&#39;s, let&#39;s say, knowledge kind of work, whether it could do it as well as a human does.太好了。 Or can it code better than a human does? Or can it create a video or a document or something that you would read and you&#39;d say, “Wow, this is nice. So then <em>you</em> could do it. I don&#39;t need to do it.”正确的？ So that sort of a burden of proof is very clear.</p><p> On this one, I&#39;m not so sure that you even <em>have to</em> have a burden of proof, because in many ways we&#39;re assuming that a focus group of 500 or a thousand people, or any survey — I mean, there&#39;s no focus group that big that I know of — but a survey of that kind is somehow gospel or, like, that&#39;s like what GPT or whoever, whatever —</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Can you talk to the reviewers of our paper? [Laughs.]</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Because the reality of it is, if you think about it, it&#39;s that if the only way to know ... so go back. Because, look: Your premise here is like, “We are going to save so much money on all this market research by augmenting this with that,” which is a true premise, and for sure it is. But I also find the burden is lower. And even if you don&#39;t stop a single human-based market research or survey, you&#39;ve still added a ton of value by broadening the universe of responses and options.</p><p> Because I would argue, how do you know 1,000 people or 2,000 people are representative <em>at all</em> or that they have all those nuances? And so this thing is actually bringing in signals that for a fact exist because otherwise you wouldn&#39;t be there. And I find that actually quite inspiring to a marketer. I&#39;m happy to talk to your reviewers.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I think as academics, we are used to a certain level of rigor and robustness and ability to say, like, oh, to actually prove things, and the fact that this tool can provide a simulation of something is nice, but “Can it actually replace humans?” is a higher burden because of this question of, is it actually giving me meaningful, updated responses? Will it match something? And you&#39;re saying, “Well, maybe humans aren&#39;t that great in the first place, so why do we try to … ?”</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> No, I&#39;m actually making a different point. I was trained as a scientist, and I get the burden of proof is much higher in science and in academia. And I wasn&#39;t trying to argue that you&#39;ve proven that this replaces humans. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s replacing humans. But what I was trying to say is, the value of this is that it dramatically augments the signals and insights and ideas available to a marketer and because there is no survey or focus group that by definition isn&#39;t limited, and this isn&#39;t limited because it&#39;s got everything that&#39;s there. So my point simply is not that the burden of proof has been met but that I don&#39;t even know if there should be that kind of a burden of proof, because it is addressing a limitation of focus groups and traditional research. So it doesn&#39;t necessarily need to replace it. They&#39;re not perfect to begin with. Nobody would argue with that.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Yeah. I think, at the very least, I feel comfortable saying that we showed that it could be very informative about preferences and what is going on, at least within the data it&#39;s trained on. And that could already change a lot for a lot of firms, given the type of research and the problems with market research and access to humans and all of that.一定。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So there&#39;s multiple different signals coming in here, and I think we&#39;ve addressed this first from the idea of, does this signal replace the other signal from a focus group? But the dependent variable here might be, do people actually buy a product? Do people buy the fluoride? Do they buy the [fake] product?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Right.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> And if this signal adds some information to that prediction, then we&#39;ve got a new information source. If it completely supplants it, then we have a different thing.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Right. And now we&#39;re going to the problem of these surveys of stated preferences versus revealed preferences that are actually based on what people do. Now, I would argue that GPT might have less [of a] problem than humans because it&#39;s not subject to things like experimenter bias or trying to appease me. So it&#39;s probably giving me something closer, but it&#39;s still giving me something likely closer to stated preferences if it brings the data from review sites or market research and not necessarily [giving me] what people would actually buy. But that is also true about the focus groups and the surveys.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So we think about this as a new source of signal — that there are lots of different signals out there, and it has some overlap, perhaps, with one signal. And I think that itself is fascinating, but it may also have a new signal.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Yeah.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> The other thing that I find fascinating here is that AI solutions have been trained on data, and then, when they&#39;re put in production, they are then trained on data or they get feedback from data in production, and they get更好的。 With generative AI, so much of that feedback also needs to be human-driven versus data-driven, right? Like, this is what it tells you to do. Does it resonate with you? Yes, no, etc. So it also feels like this kind of a technology, where generative AI can be a user of another generative AI&#39;s output.</p><p> So let&#39;s go to the paradigm of, look, it&#39;s replacing a human in the focus group, or we can also replace a human in a company that&#39;s a marketer dealing with a response from generative AI on, like, “How do you design a campaign为了这？”</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And so this idea of maybe multiple generative AI agents going at each other to improve the overall quality — what do you think about that?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I think it&#39;s an interesting idea. But I also think that the <a href="http://john-joseph-horton.com/papers/llm_ask.pdf">evidence so far</a> suggests that you still need, at some point, at least one human in the loop …</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> For sure.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> ... because of all of these hallucinations, unrealistic things that come out. But certainly, if these models are getting better and better, more efficient, higher quality, then why not? As we implement these type of things in our organizations, we also need to think about how do we — I don&#39;t know if the word is exactly <em>validate</em> , but how do we ensure that the process still makes sense and that we&#39;re not just wasting everyone&#39;s time with these agents talking to each other?</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> No, for sure. You&#39;re 100% right. You need humans in the loop and probably for many decades at least. But you may not need so many of them. You know, if you have some kind of an output that is supposed to be helping, let&#39;s say, a group of 20,000 customer service reps, and it&#39;s going to get better based on the feedback, based on their usage in a pilot of, let&#39;s say, three months, maybe you don&#39;t need to pilot this to 5,000 people. Maybe you could pilot it to a hundred people plus two or three different gen AI agents so that you dramatically accelerate the adoption time.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Yeah, that&#39;s cool.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Although I have to say, when I heard you saying that, Shervin, what it made me think of is when people hold a microphone too close to a speaker and we get these feedback loops — amplifying feedback loops. I do worry that if the two sources of data are too, co-aligned, we&#39;ll get squelched.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That&#39;s true.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> We won&#39;t get craziness. Skip to the back of the chapter here: Give us the answers. People are listening to this, and they&#39;re working in companies, and they have these tools available right now, not 20 years from now, like we&#39;re thinking as an academic. What should people be doing right now with these tools?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Play around with them. Figure out … what do you want to know about your customers? We provide in our paper a whole list of prompts of exactly how to prompt for these types of things and start getting this information. And like Shervin said earlier, what is it exactly? We&#39;re not sure, but it&#39;s a signal. There is information there that we can start finding out, right?</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> And so by playing with it, that helps people discover what information is there?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I think testing and discovering. But starting with a concrete question is really helpful because you will just get down so many rabbit holes. You can have these conversations forever.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Ayelet Israeli, you&#39;re the only guest we&#39;ve had that has the “AI” initials, which nicely fits into <em>Me, Myself, and Ayelet Israeli</em> , which is <em>Me, Myself, and Myself</em> .</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> [Laughs.]</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> But tell us more about yourself and your background and how you ended up where you are and what got you interested in all this stuff.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Sure. I&#39;m originally — as my last name might indicate — I&#39;m originally from Israel. Israel is known to be “ <a href="https://www.cfr.org/book/start-nation">Startup Nation</a> .” And when I came through to think about what I want to study in university, there was a special program that was geared toward improving Startup Nation by giving people kind of managerial tools. So it was a bachelor&#39;s in computer science and an MBA combined program in five years.</p><p> And I started doing that, and I like computer science. I actually majored in finance and marketing, but I especially was interested in marketing and, particularly, making sense of a lot of data in this context that is so kind of fun and applied. And then I decided to get a Ph.D. in marketing.</p><p> Over the years, I figured that consumer products or things around customers and transactions are interesting to me. It&#39;s just a fascinating world. You have a lot of data around that because as we move more to online and digital, we can see more and more data. And then the question is, “How can we actually leverage that data more efficiently and also in a responsible manner?” which a part of my research is about as well.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So we have a segment where we&#39;ll ask you a series of rapid-fire questions to put you on the spot. Just answer the first thing that comes to your mind.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> OK.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s the biggest opportunity for artificial intelligence right now?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Biggest opportunity. This is not rapid.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Next question.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Yeah, next question.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Oh, OK.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I&#39;ll think about it.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Pass.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Pass. What&#39;s the biggest misconception that you think people have about artificial intelligence right now?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I tend to be around people that work in this and understand this, that it is just a model, but a lot of people still don&#39;t and still envision robots and this magical thing that happens. And that&#39;s why I like to explain very clearly, “Oh, it&#39;s predicting the likelihood of the next word and choosing them on distribution, and that&#39;s all that is happening.” So I think we&#39;re still maybe not as bad as it used to be 10 years ago, but it&#39;s still this magical, artificial thing that happens, and it&#39;s not. It&#39;s still magical, I guess.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> It&#39;s pretty amazing — or can be. What was the first career that you wanted?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I don&#39;t know. In Israel, you go into the military. I was in the military; I was a lieutenant in intelligence. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a career I necessarily wanted. It&#39;s something I did.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> There&#39;s a lot of discussion and excitement about artificial intelligence. Where are people overusing it? Where are people using it where it doesn&#39;t apply?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I think one of the challenges I&#39;ve seen is actually using it to ask it factual questions, because that&#39;s not what it&#39;s about. It&#39;s not a truth-finding mechanism, and that&#39;s just a wrong usage.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> OK. Is there something that you wish that artificial intelligence could do right now that it can&#39;t do? What&#39;s the next exciting thing? What announcement tomorrow would make you happy?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I&#39;ll take that question slightly differently. I think what excites me about AI in terms of my research on responsible use of data and algorithmic bias is that, yes, a lot of people have shown that AI can generate biased outcomes. We also have known for many years that humans generate biased outcomes. And what excites me about AI is that it&#39;s much easier to fix biased outcomes by a machine and to generate processes that will eliminate bias, and it&#39;s so much more difficult with humans. And that&#39;s something that I&#39;m really excited about.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I love that point because we&#39;ve got all this bias and misogyny in our world, not by the machines. The machines are not the people who put us in this situation in the first place. And the fact that they maybe do a little bit of that at the beginning, before we&#39;ve trained them, we shouldn&#39;t just throw them out for starting down that path, because we can adjust the weights in models. We can give feedback to models to improve those in a way that we can&#39;t with bazillions of people.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Right.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So I think that&#39;s a huge point.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> And we&#39;ve seen the first models of gen AI images. If you say “doctor,” we&#39;re only [seeing] photos of men or things like that. And over time, this has improved a lot. So that&#39;s really exciting, right? We can try to think about how we fix some societal problems using these things because, yes, machines can be manipulated more easily than humans. Of course, that&#39;s a risk, but that&#39;s for some sci-fi podcast, not for this one.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> The example of the doctor in the image is spot-on because I think so many people were fascinated by how accurate these models are because they felt right. They confirmed our stereotypes. You ask for this image, and it gives you exactly what you think of as that image, but that&#39;s just feeding into the problem again. And that&#39;s going to perpetuate it if we don&#39;t [stop it]. But, like you say, there has been improvement there.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Ayelet, thank you so much.

In spring 2023, we fielded a global survey and subsequently analyzed records from 3,043 respondents representing more than 25 industries and 100 countries. We also interviewed 17 executives leading AI initiatives in a broad range of companies and industries, including financial services, media and entertainment, retail, travel and transportation, and life sciences.</p><p> Our research examines how managers and leaders use AI to enhance strategic measurement to advance strategic outcomes. It explores how organizations have adapted — and even generated new — KPIs with AI to define and deliver measurably better performance.</p></aside><p> Without adaptation and refinement, static business metrics create two types of strategic risk. One is encouraging performance on the wrong measures. The 2008 global economic crisis, for example, was triggered in part by banks&#39; dependence on a then widely used metric: value at risk, which measures potential portfolio losses in normal market conditions at a single point in time. Financial institutions did not adjust this measure as riskier subprime mortgages and securitized default swaps became a larger part of their portfolios. Guided by a metric that severely underestimated potential losses — in some cases, by orders of magnitude — many financial institutions went bankrupt or suffered significant losses.</p><p></p><p> Opportunity costs represent another risk from static key performance metrics. Our research persuasively demonstrates that companies deliberately using artificial intelligence to design and create more dynamic KPIs enjoy greater situational awareness, stronger ties between operations and strategic outcomes, and improved results overall. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> These <em>smart</em> KPIs reflect deeper understandings of performance drivers and produce more reliable predictions about future outcomes than comparable KPIs not informed by AI. (See “Three Types of Smart KPIs.”) A “set them and forget them” approach to key metrics is neither desirable nor sustainable in volatile and fast-changing markets.</p><div class="callout-highlight callout-simple"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Three Types of Smart KPIs</h4><p class="caption"><table id="chart1" class="chart-grouped-rows no-mobile"><thead><tr><th> Type of KPI</th><th>描述</th><th>好处</th><th>例子</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><p><strong>Smart Descriptive KPIs</strong></ul></p></td><td><ul><p> Synthesize historical and current data to deliver insights on <em>what happened</em> or <em>what is happening</em> .</ul></p></td><td><ul><p> Provide a deeper understanding of performance gaps and their causes.</ul></p></td><td><ul><p> Sanofi&#39;s “snackable AI” tool boosts situational awareness by revealing critical interdependencies among different KPIs.</ul></p></td></tr><tr><td><ul><p> <strong>Smart Predictive KPIs</strong></ul></p></td><td><ul><p> Anticipate future performance, producing reliable leading indicators.

As AI-infused workflows and processes colonize and expand business capabilities, leaders need to update and upgrade their key performance indicators to keep up. From Schneider Electric to Walmart to Maersk, we see strategists, technologists, and business leaders working together to refine and enhance KPIs to ensure their alignment with evolving organizational goals.</p><p> Among these companies, responsibility for making KPIs more predictive, dynamic, and insightful extends beyond strategists and business leaders. They encourage technologists to make a material contribution to the formulation, organization, and prioritization of KPIs. That&#39;s a big change from the way companies have traditionally established and updated KPIs.</p><p> As Schneider Electric chief governance officer and secretary general Hervé Coureil observes, “When processes are digitized, they start to produce &#39;exhaust data&#39; that can be turned into relevant telemetry metrics, providing insights on process behaviors, defects, etc. Secondly, digital transformation triggers significant decisions and investments — portfolio and investment choices, business model implementation, new systems and infrastructure — and therefore, there is a need to measure the impact of those decisions as well as the effectiveness of the various programs that comprise the transformation.”</p><p></p><p> Developing such measures depends on more than executive judgment, intuition, and experience. Transforming static, legacy performance metrics into smarter, more dynamic KPIs demands a greater role for data, analytics, and AI. We suggest that leaders adopt a three-pronged approach to governing the development and use of AI-driven KPIs and, more broadly, their strategic measurement systems. This governance approach rests on three factors:</p><ol><li> A solid data foundation with responsible data and analytics practices.</li><li> Organizational structures with responsibility and accountability for evolving KPIs.</li><li> Trust in KPIs trained to adapt to and learn from changes in circumstances.</li></ol><h3> Governance of Smart KPI Development: Get Your Data in Order</h3><p> Effective KPI governance requires effective data governance. Every organization participating in our research emphasized data quality and discipline as the technical enabler for its AI-driven KPI initiatives. Most legacy IT and database systems, however, aren&#39;t configured to generate or make accessible the quality data necessary for measuring or defining smart KPIs.</p><p> Pierre-Yves Calloc&#39;h, the chief digital officer at Pernod Ricard, recalls that the spirits giant realized it needed three years&#39; worth of weekly consumer sales data to enable meaningful AI interventions. A preliminary review revealed huge gaps. “When we started, we had almost no data governance,” says Calloc&#39;h. “Almost 80% of the data we needed wasn&#39;t there because it was mainly external data. Our statistical experience is that you need weekly data; if you have monthly data, it doesn&#39;t work, so you need to source the information manually. We even called it &#39;archeology&#39; because of the level of effort needed, even going into old PowerPoint and Excel files in mailboxes. In addition, you need a strong business case for the project, because without clear benefits in mind, people will not invest the time.” Essentially, the business case for AI-powered KPIs could not be made without technically reliable and robust governance that transformed data <em>archaeology</em> into data <em>architecture</em> .</p><p> Jon Francis, General Motors&#39; chief data and analytics officer, who previously oversaw Starbucks&#39;s digital transformation, echoed Calloc&#39;h&#39;s observations. “It&#39;s actually really hard to just create a KPI because of the underlying data challenges,” he says. “It takes all of your effort, usually, to create the KPI and report on it.” Poor data and metadata governance undermines an organization&#39;s ability to develop the right metrics. Francis notes that technology systems are often just “spooling data that&#39;s not defined or useable” and, as a result, “you end up with these data dumping grounds.” He candidly observes that for most organizations, the generation of data from production systems is an afterthought.</p><p> Effective KPI governance remains contingent upon a company&#39;s technological capabilities to harness data: It demands diligent data governance, a structured approach to analytics management, and a path for technologists and business unit leaders to collaborate on developing optimal KPIs on an ongoing basis.</p><p></p><h3> Embedding Governance in Teams or Functions</h3><p> Our research finds top management rethinking how to develop and continuously improve their key performance measures and metrics. While approaches vary, a common theme among interviewed executives is choosing to locate responsibility for transforming KPIs in a specific team or group of teams.</p><p> At Schneider Electric, leadership came to recognize that the company&#39;s legacy metrics could become incompatible with its aspirations to strategically collaborate and innovate with its global customers. Coureil helped sponsor the creation of a Performance Management Office within the company&#39;s data team to oversee performance measurement. The office was deliberately positioned in the governance team to ensure a neutral cross-functional perspective.</p><p> The Performance Management Office helped top management transform their portfolio of KPIs and align them with operations. It also pushed the businesses to become far more data-driven and aware of the links between improvement against a given performance metric and enhanced outcomes. “Measurement has been very core for us,” adds Coureil. “We actually tried to make metrics a complete, integral part of our digital transformation, as opposed to an afterthought.”</p><p> What&#39;s the desired outcome of a given KPI? “It&#39;s an ontology or taxonomy question at some point: What behaviors are you looking for?” asks Coureil. “I think people put a lot of things in the KPI basket, and we&#39;ve spent a lot of time trying to be extremely clear about what we&#39;re looking at: What is the desired outcome? It looks very simple, but it is not that simple, actually … being extremely sharp on what the desired outcome of a given KPI is.” That&#39;s why having a performance management office is proving to be essential to strategically coherent and consistent KPI governance, Coureil says.</p><p> Instead of using a performance management office, DBS Bank governs KPI development through cross-functional teams that create value maps linking customer journeys to desired outcomes. The Singapore-based financial services leader revisited its operating model to reflect the fact that using smarter KPIs could measurably improve outcomes for both the business and its customers. “Over the past three years, we moved to something we call a data-driven operating model,” says group chief analytics officer and managing director Sameer Gupta.</p><p> At the heart of the model are cross-functional squads. Representatives from various functions, such as product, risk, data, marketing, call center, and human resources, form a squad, Gupta explains. Every squad member is then aligned on the same set of outcomes mapped to four categories: customer experience, employee experience, profitability, and risk.</p><p> The factors driving performance on each outcome are represented in a value map that connects performance metrics with the four types of outcomes. Each squad is responsible for identifying and optimizing these factors. “The squads look at optimizing those drivers,” says Gupta. “We look at many things to optimize those drivers: experimentation, data, customer immersion, AI, machine learning — all kinds of tools to try and continuously optimize in coordination and consultation with control towers and management dashboards.”</p><p> The result, Gupta notes, is not just greater data-driven operational efficiencies and effectiveness but KPIs that expand the boundaries of the DBS client and customer experience. Revisiting processes for KPI governance have led to both better KPIs and better KPI outcomes.</p><p> While the specific approaches vary, most leaders we spoke with are in the early stages of building governance structures to help make their KPIs more intelligent, detailed, and predictive.</p><h3> Effective KPI Governance Is Based on Trust</h3><p> While these technological and organizational investments in KPI governance are crucial to enhancing KPIs, our research suggests that their practical value to teams is contingent upon people&#39;s willingness to trust them. During Schneider Electric&#39;s digital transformation efforts, Coureil recognized that “one of the changes, versus a more traditional way of doing business, is that you don&#39;t build your dashboard anymore. Somebody else does it for you. So you have to trust those metrics.”</p><p> Anecdotal evidence indicates that establishing trust in AI-sourced metrics can be challenging.</p><p> At Maersk, for instance, the long-held assumption was that getting a vessel out of port and on its way to the next one as quickly as possible was ideal. A digital twin simulation, however, showed that being on time was better than being early: With an end-to-end connected schedule, as is also the situation for commercial airlines, the port that a vessel is heading to next can&#39;t adjust its schedule to immediately accommodate earlier arrivals. In other words, “faster isn&#39;t better” was a counterintuitive assertion from the data team, and it was only after the on-time approach was put into practice that the front-line operators — and even those at the most senior levels managing the entire terminal — were finally convinced.</p><p> Cultivating the trust necessary to develop and use dynamic, AI-enhanced KPIs is a critical leadership and governance challenge. Developing data-savvy managers who are receptive to developing and embracing AI-driven KPIs is a significant part of that challenge. At one media organization, an executive interviewee noted that she&#39;d had a hard time persuading her superiors to look at KPIs and make decisions based on data. Their usual retort was that executives are “paid millions for their gut instincts” — in other words, experience and intuition were valued over data-driven insight.</p><p></p><p> Building a data-oriented management community is one way to create trust among the leaders using enhanced KPIs. At Sanofi, the most senior 150 leaders, representing various functions and businesses, are being trained in boot camps to become more data-centric and to seek out more information before making decisions. As chief digital officer Emmanuel Frenehard says, “Our goal as part of our cultural change is that these 150 people, when they leave the boot camp, are far more inclined to adopt that data-centric view and better understand the potential of AI for us 。 We are making sure that the core of our leadership is trained on how to use the next generation of AI-driven KPIs.”</p><h3>进一步的考虑</h3><p>To ensure that their AI-enabled smart KPIs are setting them up for strategic success, leaders must prioritize the technological, organizational, and cultural dimensions of KPI governance discussed above. As they begin to do so, these related considerations should be top of mind.</p><p> <strong>Establish a steering committee to guide continuous improvement.</strong> Transforming legacy KPIs into enhanced KPIs demands regular experimentation to ensure that key performance is focused on the right outcomes. Determining where this experimentation happens, who does it, and how often are critical leadership and governance decision points. Is it in a central team, like a performance office, or is it more widely distributed? Should certain KPIs be revisited and reviewed more frequently than others? Who has decision rights when changing KPIs changes accountability? There are no one-size-fits-all answers to these questions. Leaders need flexible processes to effectively govern KPIs that might be siloed or cross-functional. We suggest establishing a cross-functional KPI steering committee with business and technical expertise to elicit necessary input and buy-in from relevant stakeholders.</p><p> <strong>Oversee investment in capabilities to optimize groups of KPIs.</strong> Does your company have the capability to assess whether its KPIs are good enough or fully optimized? Our research suggests that AI can play a valuable role in assessing KPI quality, prioritizing KPIs, and addressing trade-offs among them. AI can help determine, for example, under what conditions customer-centricity imperatives should take priority over improving operational efficiencies, or when to prioritize revenue considerations over market share investments. Integrating AI into the process for developing, setting, and prioritizing KPIs can be a disruptive change for managers who are accustomed to making these decisions themselves. To preempt or address such disruptions requires organizational, technological, and cultural investments.</p><p> <strong>Govern KPIs like assets, not tracking tools.</strong> Enhanced KPIs can redefine key performance, not just track it: That makes KPIs, and the capability to enhance them, valuable assets. As with other assets, KPIs can depreciate with time or inattention. Governing KPIs like assets, not tracking tools, ensures that they become more valuable, insightful, and predictive over time. Given a wide variety of asset management frameworks, effective governance means choosing the appropriate asset management framework for KPI assets, including relevant, underlying data assets. Some companies are already beginning to explore using KPIs for KPIs to ensure that the value of their KPI assets consistently improves.</p><p> <strong>Elevate KPI oversight.</strong> As KPIs become more intelligent and more effective proxies for corporate strategy, it becomes more important for boards to be involved with governing KPI development and use. To be sure, developing and using KPIs are management functions. However, boards sign off on strategies that KPIs both embody and inform. Signing off on strategy but not the company&#39;s approach to developing KPIs is short-sighted and can undermine strategic aspirations. Engage the board directly in efforts to develop organizational capabilities for enhancing KPIs. Investing in enhanced KPIs is just as strategically relevant as investing in improving performance itself.</p><p></p><h3>结论</h3><p>Our three-pronged approach to governing the development and use of KPIs expands on the idea that AI can transform KPIs into strategic assets that do more than track performance. They serve as a GPS for the organization, delivering greater foresight and a deeper understanding of interdependencies among key performance drivers.</p><p> Making the transition to AI-enhanced KPIs is not an incremental shift. It is a dramatic change from exclusively human, top-down approaches to setting and refining KPIs. Organizations that have made this transition are putting technology in the (KPI development) loop.</p><p> In the future, KPIs will no longer be passive tools for measurement but active agents for empowering decision makers. Ongoing innovation using generative AI promises to expand the purpose, power, and potential of smart KPIs. Holding conversations with chat-enabled smart KPIs, for instance, is already a goal for several of the executives we interviewed. With proper governance, empowering smart KPIs will empower strategists and managers alike.</p><p> <em>Editor&#39;s note: The authors would like to thank Gaurav Jha, David Zuluaga Martínez, Allison Ryder, and Barbara Spindel for their contributions to this article.</em></p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/governance-for-smarter-kpis/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> How to Make Data Monetization Everybody&#39;s Business</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/how-to-make-data-monetization-everybodys-business/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/how-to-make-data-monetization-everybodys-business/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 13:01:42 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Barbara H.

A confluence of factors is driving this trend: Amid supply chain bottlenecks, rising labor and transportation costs, US tariffs on China, and geopolitical tensions, companies recognize the value of reshoring production. US industrial policies favoring domestic manufacturing are also informing these decisions, including new laws seeking to address national security threats, economic disruptions, and dwindling access to key technological components. The result is an early-stage US reshoring renaissance.</p><p> The question for executives is whether their companies should follow this trend. But first, it&#39;s important to understand the trend&#39;s scope and what&#39;s driving it.</p><p></p><p> There have been calls for reshoring since manufacturing began sharply declining in the late 1970s, but COVID-19 marked a turning point for the C-suite. Between the first quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of 2023, executives started talking about onshoring, reshoring, and nearshoring during earnings calls and conferences much more frequently than they had previously, according to an analysis by The Conference Board.</p><p> Such talk started significantly increasing in the second quarter of 2020, as the pandemic set in globally. In the second quarter of 2022, as supply chain pressures again surged, Russia invaded Ukraine, and new federal industrial policies were enacted. Overall, instances of executives mentioning these ideas increased nearly 3,000% in just three years.</p><p> New laws also helped drive this onshoring resurgence, including the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Each contains stipulations regarding the production and procurement of US-made products and components that benefit companies that manufacture domestically.</p><p> Reshoring is now driving a dramatic rise in manufacturing construction activity. Companies are constructing US manufacturing facilities at a higher rate than any other property type. Such spending rose to an annual rate of $114.7 billion in 2022, according to the US Census Bureau — a 40% increase year over year and a 62% increase over the past five years.</p><p> This made manufacturing the fastest-growing asset category in 2022, as the average growth rate for <em>all</em> nonresidential buildings and infrastructure increased just 7.4% compared with 2021. And the building continues: Manufacturing spending was 74% higher in July 2023 than in the same month前一年。</p><p></p><p> The reshoring renaissance does not apply universally. Sectors requiring large amounts of manual labor, including shoes and apparel, furniture, and home decorative items, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/business/economy/supply-chain-reshoring-us-manufacturing.html">less likely to reshore</a> . Industries with more complex and expensive products, and those that can use automation and robotics in manufacturing, are leading the US resurgence. The <a href="https://reshorenow.org/content/pdf/2022_Data_Report.pdf">five industries</a> experiencing the greatest US employment growth as a result of reshoring and direct investment are electrical equipment, appliances, and components; computer and electronic products; chemicals; transportation equipment; and medical equipment and supplies.</p><p> Our analysis shows that North America (the US, Canada, and Mexico) has the existing supplier base to support more manufacturing activity than it currently has. In fact, for electrical equipment, North America has 15% of the global supplier base and 7% of global output. Twenty-one percent of the pharmaceutical industry&#39;s global supplier base is in North America, but its share of global output is just 18%, according to <a href="https://www.conference-board.org/publications/TCB-Global-Supplier-Index">The Conference Board Global Supplier Index</a> .</p><p></p><h3> Is Reshoring Right for Your Company?</h3><p> Reshoring results from executives and senior managers reorienting from a “low cost” to a “best cost” supply chain strategy by prioritizing factors such as supply chain resiliency, sustainability, and geopolitical stability over cheap foreign labor. Although onshoring can entail higher costs from building new facilities and paying higher wages, the benefits of minimizing external risks and creating long-term efficiencies might outweigh keeping near-term costs low.</p><p> Business leaders should consider six key factors in deciding whether to adopt this model.</p><p> <strong>1. Labor costs.</strong> Global labor shortages and cost increases — including in China, where wages are rising — make it relatively more affordable to locate manufacturing in the US than it once was. China outpaced G20 countries in real wage growth from 2008 to 2022, according to the International Labour Organization&#39;s “ <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---travail/documents/publication/wcms_862569.pdf">Global Wage Report 2022-2023</a> .” China&#39;s real monthly wages in 2022 were equivalent to about 2.6 times their real 2008 value.</p><p> <strong>2. Advanced manufacturing.</strong> New automated “smart factories,” which require more engineers and skilled technicians but often far fewer workers overall, including traditional assembly-line workers, make the US labor pool attractive due to its well-educated workforce. Demand for robotics and the advanced technology that supports smart facilities is also surging. <a href="https://www.automate.org/news/robot-sales-in-north-america-have-strongest-year-ever-in-2021">North American robot sales set a record in 2021</a> , with 39,708 units sold, for $2 billion — a 14% increase over the previous high in 2017, and 28% more than the number sold in 2020, according to the Association for Advancing Automation. Plex&#39;s “ <a href="https://www.plex.com/sites/default/files/2022-05/10292_7th_State-of-Smart-Manufacturing_Supply-Chain.pdf">7th Annual State of Smart Manufacturing Report</a> ” notes that smart-manufacturing adoption rates increased 50% in 2022 year-over-year and 83% of manufacturers reported that smart factories are key to their future success.</p><p> <strong>3. Risk mitigation.</strong> The longer and more complex the supply chain, the greater the risks it faces, especially in terms of potential geopolitical instability. There is also renewed scrutiny by the federal government of its own reliance on other economies for critical public health and national defense supplies and components, such as personal protective equipment and semiconductors used in military vehicles and weaponry.</p><p> <strong>4. Sustainability</strong> With companies increasingly needing to meet sustainability goals and reduce their carbon footprints, localizing manufacturing offers several benefits. Constructing new, green facilities domestically can greatly reduce Scope 1 operating emissions from company-owned facilities and vehicles. The US has the world&#39;s largest sustainable-building market, with more than 511 million square feet <a href="https://www.usgbc.org/articles/top-10-countries-leed-demonstrate-green-building-truly-global-movement">certified under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design</a> rating system, compared with 180 million square feet in China. Plus, manufacturing a product closer to its end customer reduces emissions from transportation.</p><p> <strong>5. Stakeholder sentiment.</strong> Many companies&#39; stakeholders — including employees, corporate boards, industry organizations, government officials, and other companies connected within a supply chain — want executives to consider <a href="https://www.kearney.com/industry/consumer-retail/article/-/insights/the-2021-reshoring-index-the-tides-are-turning">localizing manufacturing operations</a> . Walmart — the largest retailer in the United States — vowed in 2021 to spend an additional $350 billion through 2030 on items made, grown, or assembled in the US, for example.</p><p> <strong>6. Transportation costs.</strong> When deciding whether to onshore manufacturing operations, executives should weigh the benefits of lower international labor and operating costs against the greater cost of ocean freight shipping. Trans-Pacific shipping costs increased fifteenfold in 2021 from January 2020 levels, and while transportation costs have declined as the economy has slowed, the supply chain volatility of the last few years is front of mind for managers.</p><p> The growth in US manufacturing-facility construction will continue as businesses see value in focusing on aspects of risk mitigation, using automation to offset labor challenges, and even building new facilities that emit less carbon. This reshoring renaissance is just beginning; it takes a few years to plan, permit, and acquire property for new-facility construction.</p><p></p><p> Now is the time for manufacturing executives to understand how their businesses fit into this renaissance and determine whether reshoring is right for them. Using the factors above as a framework, executives should consider these five key questions:</p><ol><li> Can a new facility for my products that uses advanced automation offset higher labor costs?</li><li> Does my current supply chain involve countries that present uncertainty due to geopolitics?</li><li> Will the carbon emissions from my company&#39;s current supply chain improve significantly if we build a new facility powered by renewable energy and localize production?</li><li> Are my stakeholders, especially customers, asking for domestically manufactured products?</li><li> Is the cost savings that comes with eliminating transoceanic shipping enough to balance out a likely increase in labor and new-facility construction costs?</li></ol><p> By seeking answers to questions such as these, the C-suite can better navigate their company&#39;s operations through a changing global production landscape.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/a-reshoring-renaissance-is-underway/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
