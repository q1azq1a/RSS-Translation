One doesn’t need to look any further than T-Mobile’s signature magenta hue (226 red, 0 green, 116 blue) to realize how fiercely this castle is [&#8230;]]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><figure class="article-inline"><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Gvirtz-1290x860-1.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption><p class="attribution">卡洛琳·吉森-贝塞尔/麻省理工学院 SMR |盖蒂图片社</p></figcaption></figure><p>在营销领域，品牌形象是保卫公司声誉的城堡，是阻止竞争的护城河。只需看一下 T-Mobile 标志性的洋红色调（226 红、0 绿、116 蓝），人们就能意识到这座城堡受到了多么严格的保护。使用类似的色调，您可能会在邮箱中发现一封停止信。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p>但如果保护品牌的壁垒可能会阻碍它们在生成人工智能时代的未来呢？</p><p>在一项著名的广告活动中，Heinz 使用 OpenAI 的 DALL-E 生成器来创建受番茄酱启发的图像。这些图像在尺寸或颜色方面并不完美，但无可否认它们是亨氏的。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a>这表明，即使人工智能模型也认识到亨氏品牌具有首要意识。一个老派的品牌纯粹主义者可能会对品牌的表现方式感到惊讶，但该活动<a href=" https://www.oneclub.org/awards/theoneshow/-award/49451/ketchup-ai">无可否认地引起了轰动</a>，在全球赢得了 8.5 亿次展示。</p><p></p><p>我们在自己的课堂上体验到了生成式人工智能对品牌塑造的变革潜力。作为学校百年庆典的一部分，生成式人工智能为伦敦国王学院的吉祥物——一只 <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/ioppn-welcomes-new-students-and-kings-mascot-reggie-the-lion">名叫雷吉的火红狮子</a>——注入了生命。借助人工智能工具，吉祥物不再只是一个静态的品牌符号：在课堂教学中，雷吉变得生动活泼，引导了一些讨论，甚至在我们讨论商品管理时整理衣服并调整价格。结果是：乏味的库存图片被一个深受学生喜爱的吉祥物所取代，它与我们的学生产生了共鸣，并引起了压倒性的积极反应。但这只是这些工具对品牌潜力的开始。</p><h3>创造力与控制：明智地选择</h3><p>准备摆脱旧的保护心态的品牌会发现生成式人工智能为共同创造打开了新的大门。文本到图像的人工智能模型，例如 OpenAI 的 DALL-E，消除了日常消费者生成视觉设计的障碍，实现了前所未有的个人联系和定制水平。</p><p>在可口可乐的开创性举措“创造真正的魔法”中，消费者被邀请通过使用 ChatGPT 和 DALL-E 设计广告来释放他们的创造力。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a>获奖作品不仅会受到赞扬，还会受到赞扬。他们很快就会点亮世界上一些最具标志性的广告舞台的广告牌，包括纽约时代广场和伦敦皮卡迪利广场。</p><p>我们以及其他人的研究表明，这些丰富的联系不仅会影响直接参与的人，还会影响相关人员。它们向外扩散，加强了整个市场的关系并增强了购买意向。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p></p><p>尽管前景令人兴奋，但许多品牌不愿袖手旁观，可能是因为担心失去控制。严格保护品牌标识和符号的古老方法可能会使它们落后于文本到图像模型的采用者。</p><p>今天的现实是，对人工智能技术的绝对控制仍然是一个白日梦。虽然生成式人工智能会更好地呈现一致的风格，但它无法遵守当今许多品牌所要求的严格准则。正如亨氏的活动中所见，虽然该技术复制了熟悉的瓶子形状和颜色，但它未能复制确切的徽标或品牌名称。依赖该技术“现成”版本的品牌可能需要等待很长时间。也许更重要的是，对控制的短视关注可能会阻止品牌完全打开生成人工智能提供的消费者参与的大门。</p><p></p><h3>品牌经理需要成为推动者</h3><p>前进的道路需要转变心态：品牌经理必须从执行者和守护者转变为推动者。它是关于关注更广泛的创新和联系机会，而不是痴迷于精确的颜色值等细节。</p><p> <a href="https://www.akqa.com/work/gofundme/help-changes-everything/">GoFundMe 的“帮助改变一切”活动</a>通过使用文本到图像模型以尽可能个性化的方式与捐助者互动，建立了新的消费者联系。 GoFundMe 没有制作典型的年终内容，而是使用 DALL-E 和 Stable Diffusion 等工具制作了一系列由人工智能生成的街头壁画风格的图像，展示了过去一年的所有筹款活动和捐助者。这些单独的作品随后被汇编成一段引人入胜的视频，引起了观众的强烈共鸣并获得了广泛好评。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a></p><p>对此类机会持开放态度的品牌经理可以利用文本到图像模型来超越传统的沟通界限，实现以前无法达到的个性化和真实性水平。</p><p>当然，风险偏好不同。对于像 Monster Energy 这样大胆的品牌有效的方法可能不适用于保守的机构。但即使在高度监管和保守的环境中，也可以以限制风险和成本的方式进行试验。一次性活动或小规模项目的风险和潜在负面后果是有限的，因此是品牌探索的理想机会。我们为大学吉祥物制作动画的努力就是一个很好的例子。</p><h3>安全实验：可口可乐的教训</h3><p>这并不是呼吁无政府状态。品牌可以探索生成人工智能的可能性，同时保持在自己的舒适区和既定界限内。可口可乐的保护措施包括使用自己的平台、<a href="https://www.createrealmagic.com/">对其网站上显示的内容</a>进行监督以及为参与者提供可口可乐主题模板，所有这些都是为了保留对品牌形象的一定程度的控制。</p><p>可口可乐的这一举措是与贝恩和 OpenAI 组成的文本到图像服务联盟合作完成的，这帮助其从被动的立场转变为主动的立场。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a>提供可口可乐等品牌安全和保障措施的提供商可能会成为首选合作伙伴。</p><p></p><p>当然，品牌经理必须防范潜在的滥用，并在创意自由和控制之间走钢丝。但我们不要忘记：品牌认知一直是与消费者共同创造的，并且取决于品牌行为和消费者反应之间错综复杂的双向关系。事实上，消费者长期以来一直在塑造品牌认知方面发挥着重要作用，无论是通过口碑认可还是严厉的评论。生成式人工智能只会强化这种动力，让消费者能够扮演各种角色：他们可以扮演设计师、电影摄影师甚至软件开发人员的角色。在生成式人工智能时代，积极倾听、持续监控消费者情绪以及根据实时反馈和新兴趋势灵活地重新调整策略变得更加重要。</p><p>虽然品牌无法控制每一个叙事转折，但它们可以更主动地引导对话。一种有效的方法是营造一种环境，使消费者能够相互联系并与品牌建立联系，并在透明的规则、激励和认可的框架内为品牌故事做出贡献。例如，可口可乐的生成式人工智能活动明确传达了其对消费者投入的重视——通过高度可见的广告投放来奖励杰出贡献，以及被选中前往可口可乐总部参加活动的机会内容创作研讨会。该品牌投资了一个专门的数字平台，旨在促进创新和加深消费者关系，同时降低风险并保持与其核心价值观和身份的一致性。</p><h3>解决道德和法律问题</h3><p>品牌经理还需要对围绕文本到图像模型的道德和法律问题保持警惕。随着主要人工智能工具公司卷入诉讼，及时了解所有权和知识产权 (IP) 的发展变得至关重要。 <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a>品牌有理由担心法律影响，但只要出现挑战，创新就会随之而来。</p><p> Adobe 提供了一个创新示例，说明如何缓解客户对知识产权问题的担忧。 Adobe 的 Firefly 生成式 AI 工具可以让人们使用简单的提示创建或增强图像，因此 Adob​​e 在不受版权限制的库存图像、公开许可内容和公共领域材料上训练了 AI 模型。这是一种旨在解决客户担忧的前瞻性方法。</p><p></p><p>另一种有前景的方法是协作知识产权创作协议，重点关注人工智能开发者、创作者和品牌之间的互利关系。一个典型的例子是 Shutterstock 的贡献者基金，当创作者的图像被用于训练生成人工智能模型时，该基金会向创作者提供补偿。 <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a></p><p>品牌管理者应选择与能够有效降低知识产权风险的平台合作。品牌经理还可以考虑在合同中添加具体的保护措施，平台确认他们拥有适当许可的培训数据，并为针对该品牌的任何潜在知识产权侵权案件提供保证。对于生成式人工智能开发人员来说，这是开发尊重创作者版权并将他们定位为品牌理想合作者的模型的强大动力。</p><p>总而言之，文本到图像生成人工智能模型正在拆除传统品牌城堡的围墙，创造一个充满机遇、风险和挑战的新现实。当我们应对这一转型时，每个品牌经理都必须面对一个至关重要的问题：您的品牌会在这个新时代成为桥梁还是路障的建造者？</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/why-text-to-image-ai-requires-a-new-branding-mindset/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>团队里其实有一个“我”</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/there-actually-is-an-i-in-team/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/there-actually-is-an-i-in-team/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 11:00:43 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Elad N.

事实上，它们会受益。</p><p>以 LG 为例，全球有 85,000 多名工人在工厂环境中工作。今天每个人都明白，从一线工人的角度来看，工厂中的劳动力存在缺口。企业内部不断提出与生产力相关的要求，以确保满足整个……产能。这些都是企业内部人工智能研究尚未解决的现实问题。</p><p>您询问了上市时间。我的任务是在六个月内确定一家企业是否可以上市。我认为在企业方面，即使不是更长，也需要几年，对吗？两到五年之间的任何时间。</p><p>这一直是人们谈论的话题：“企业发展缓慢；启动速度很快。”所以我本质上是在公司内部建立一家初创公司。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>所以，我所听到的是，摆脱了许多传统规模的束缚——随之而来的是惯性——并且像新企业一样，速度要快得多。当然，其中一些创新可以帮助一些现有的企业人工智能，对吗？</p><p><strong>希尔帕·普拉萨德：</strong>是的。绝对地。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·科达班德：</strong>太棒了。您谈到了技能提升、再培训，以及可能重新想象人类在与人工智能的整个组合中的角色——在您谈到的组合中。请告诉我们有关生成式人工智能的信息以及您认为它在其中发挥的作用。</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad：</strong>我认为可能性是巨大的，就像人工智能领域的任何其他机会一样。例如，增强现实技术与人工智能交叉的一个方面意味着我们不仅关注人工智能方面的语音和文本，而且还关注正在捕获和处理的计算机视觉相关数据流，以便进行技能转移尽可能有效地发生。</p><p>因此，考虑一下护士培训环境。我们不是在真正的病人身上练习，而是在假人身上练习。如果您必须教见习护士如何将患者放在床上以执行特定的程序，那么从首席培训护士那里捕获数据流以了解如何做到这一点具有很大的价值，并且，当你真正练习的时候，得到实时反馈，对吗？</p><p>所以我们在这里研究多个数据流。因此，不仅仅是 NLP [自然语言处理]，我们还会研究基于计算机视觉的技术，并引入人工智能来几乎增强该过程以及双方的受训者和培训经验，对吗？这就是我们如何以不同方式做事的一个例子。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>通常情况下，我对我们谈论的人工智能的应用感到非常兴奋，但我在这里受到了一点威胁。我的意思是我是这里的一名教育家，我听到你谈论各种不同的重新技能和再培训方式。我要去哪？您之前提到过护士的一个模型，经验丰富的护士会教经验不足的护士。也许其中很多都被替换了。在这种新模式中，经验丰富的护士现在扮演什么角色？</p><p><strong>希尔帕·普拉萨德：</strong>是的。好吧，实际上，山姆，我认为你的恐惧可能在这里是错误的，让我解释一下。我们并不是想更换教练。我们正在做的实际上是让培训师有更多机会去做他们应该做的事情。因此，在护士培训的例子中，护士长必须实际上站在实习护士旁边，可能在一天中多次，并教他们如何完成特定的任务。现在想象一个场景，在首席培训师真正参与进来并了解发生了什么之前，我们已经消除了至少两个级别的反馈、审查和评估。</p><p>所以我认为认证还是非常非常重要的，对吧？无论是制造业，还是医疗保健——我们正在谈论的两个例子——认证仍然很重要，而该认证来自培训师，他是专家。所以我们不会删除专家。它实际上使专家能够有效地进行培训，而不必监视正在工作的实习护士的 100 个屏幕。所以你希望看到差异。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·霍达班德：</strong>是的。萨姆是一位终身教授，所以我认为他不会去任何地方。但是，山姆，这有点像正教授，即你自己，不会陷入研究生可以处理的事情中，而你只做困难的事情和那些真正考验你大脑的事情。</p><p><strong>希尔帕·普拉萨德：</strong>是的。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>这对我来说听起来很光荣。</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad：</strong>我认为这是一名助理，对吧？你会有一个人工智能助手，它实际上可以完成很多繁重的工作，否则你必须坐下来做。所以我认为它是有价值的。至少我们看到了我们能够在早期的对话中产生的一些有价值的推论。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·科达班德：</strong>太棒了。 Shilpa，请告诉我们一些您的背景，以及您如何最终担任这个角色。</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad：</strong>我的职业生涯是一条曲折线，Shervin；这与我今天所做的事情并不是一条直线。多年来，我认为从头开始创造一些东西总是能找到很多价值和乐趣。从无到有、创造出新东西所需的能量、动力和严谨性一直是我所做的一切的核心。</p><p>因此，在我职业生涯的早期，我有机会与某人合作创办一家平面设计工作室。在那里，我了解了实际创建企业所需的机制。它教会了我很多其中的内容。</p><p>从那时起，我一直让自己担任实际上具有创业性质或为创业生态系统服务的角色。我想提一下我第一次来硅谷时曾在这里工作过的一家名为 YouNoodle Inc. 的公司。在那里，我了解到选择合适的初创公司或创新公司进行合作以推动创新向前发展的力量，无论是在企业、政府、大学甚至大型加速器项目的背景下。</p><p>这让我在新冠疫情期间再次踏上自己的创业之旅。真的很难。我创办了一家名为 LongPlay 的初创公司，并组建了一个大约 10 人的团队。它的重点是改变企业创新的方式。我认为有一件事是，当你在公司之外时，你根本没有办法理解正在发生的所有不同的活动部分。因此，我们无法证明产品与市场的契合度，而这正是 Nova 发挥作用的地方。我再次有机会尝试在一个与我习惯的有点不同的行业和环境中进行产品市场适应，但我认为具体细节是相同的。这只是我的简单背景介绍。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>这非常令人兴奋——非常跨学科。这让我想到了下一个问题：人工智能没有一刀切，当然它是一个由工程师、软件工程师、提示工程师、人工智能工程师和数据科学家等组成的完整生态系统。但是我注意到过去的技能逐渐演变，我想说，10年、12年、15年左右，从仅限于核心技术到更加多学科，并且“多学科”可以是多种形式的区域。它可以是社会科学，也可以是人机交互，也可以是哲学或其他领域。但您是否也有同样的看法？您对人工智能领域未来人才有何看法？</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad：</strong>这是一个有趣的问题。我不得不说我没有看到同样的事情。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·科达班德：</strong>好的。</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad：</strong>我看到的不是宽度，而是深度。我认为，在跨学科能力方面，劳动力仍然存在巨大差距。就您而言，有很多深入的技术工作正在发生，特别是围绕人工智能。</p><p>我认为，在接下来的几年里，许多像我这样负责这项技术如何发展的人将不得不随身携带。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>这也涉及到测量。我的意思是——谢尔文，我知道这<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/big-ideas/artificial-intelligence-business-strategy/">对你来说是一个热门话题</a>——但是当你谈论影响力时，你必须弄清楚如何衡量它。必须采取某种措施来衡量“这有效吗？这不行吗？”这些看起来像是一些难题，特别是考虑到技术的新颖性和你所谈论的时间表的新鲜度。似乎很难弄清楚这对你的角色是否有效。</p><p><strong>希尔帕·普拉萨德：</strong>是的。我的意思是，我可以给出一点个人看法。我的构建项目风格总是提到尽可能多地与有问题的客户一起进行测试。</p><p>这就是产品焦点对我来说非常重要和中心的地方，这就是为什么风险投资令人兴奋。当我们谈论衡量时，肯定有不同的方法可以衡量我们正在创造的东西或我们试图创造的东西的影响。这里有一个市场验证方面，对吗？肯定有一个投资者验证方面，这意味着我们的投资者......这不仅仅是关于我的项目，对吧？这不仅仅是关于我正在创建或构建的项目。实际上更多的是钱的去向。当然，其中有一点是炒作，但也有一点是抓住了下一件可能改变人工智能在日常环境或环境中使用方式的机会。 。</p><p>我认为这里的第三部分也是关于最终为用户提供我们正在创建的任何解决方案和我们正在构建的任何解决方案的授权，以便获得商业机会......最终[它]必须为人类增加价值 - 也就是说，你和我，实际上将使用这项技术来改善我们的生活。今天，我们正在以与我们被教导的或我们习惯的或我们已经学会的方式完全相同的方式做工作，我们将不得不改变它或适应它并转向一种新的方式做事。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>人工智能是否能让您获得更好的数据和信息？人工智能是否能让你了解 20 年前可能需要更长时间才能了解的事情？</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad：</strong>当然，但我认为“人工智能能够帮助我吗？我认为，只有<em>它</em>才能做到这一点，这可能对人工智能有很大的影响，而与过去 10、15 年在特定行业所做的事情不太相关。我认为人工智能也有它的另一面，那就是，有时它把太多的东西摆在你面前，然后你必须真正浏览顶层才能真正弄清楚这些数据可以在哪里使用以及如何使用这些数据被应用。所以人工智能也有优点和缺点。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>你提到了缺点。您从与您合作的这些初创公司中看到了哪些缺点？这里的人们在挣扎什么？</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad：</strong>我认为尤其是初创公司仍在寻找可以应用他们所开发的内容的方法。人工智能的有效应用方式仍有待确定。因此，初创公司正在创建所有这些与项目相关的 LLM（大型语言模型），但他们不知道它将<em>如何</em>实际翻译。</p><p>所以我想说，初创公司要想理解它，还有一段路要走。例如，就我今天所担任的角色而言，我还使初创公司能够了解他们如何使用他们创建的技术并将其转化为有意义的问题，但是……这就是为什么我说之前咨询。它还为初创公司提供咨询：为他们提供一些真实的场景，您可以应用我们共同构建的东西，然后看看它如何转化为价值。所以我认为初创公司肯定仍在学习，萨姆。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>所以这些事情实际上可能与谢尔文关于知识广度和多学科的评论有关，因为你没有具体提到他们正在与技术作斗争。我在那里听到了很多并不是特别以技术为导向的事情。</p><p>让我们在这里过渡一下。我们在本集结束时做的一件事是问您五个问题。我们要尽快询问他们。我们只想了解您对他们的第一反应。您认为目前人工智能最大的机会是什么？</p><p><strong>希尔帕·普拉萨德：</strong>医疗保健。</p><p><strong>萨姆·兰斯博瑟姆：</strong>好的。人们对人工智能最大的误解是什么？</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad：</strong>它将取代它们。它将取代我们作为人类。我想这不会发生。我们离这个还有很长的路要走。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>很远。好的。你想要的第一个职业是什么？</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad：</strong>成为一名企业家。我认为它一直存在于我的 DNA 中。</p><p><strong>萨姆·兰斯博瑟姆：</strong>很好。你小时候有过柠檬水摊吗？</p><p>什么时候人工智能太多了？我们要在哪里将方钉插入圆孔？</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad：</strong> Sam，我想我没有给你一个具体的答案。所以，如果你要换一个问题……</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>这样问：会不会太多？</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>你能在产品中投入太多人工智能吗？</p><p><strong>希尔帕·普拉萨德：</strong>是的，绝对如此。我认为我想到的一个领域是协作机器人——协作机器人。它可能有效，也可能无效，而且它很大程度上是由人工智能驱动的。因此，自动化是关键，但我认为其中有多少相关性对我个人来说是值得怀疑的。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>如果你在幻想的话，你希望人工智能现在能做但目前还不能做的一件事是什么？</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad：</strong>让我听起来尽可能好。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong> Shilpa，非常感谢你。这很有启发性，也很精彩。感谢您参加节目。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>感谢您加入我们。</p><p><strong>希尔帕·普拉萨德：</strong>谢谢。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>感谢您今天的收听。在我们的下一集中，我们将听到哈佛商学院教授 Ayelet Israel 如何建议通过生成人工智能来增强企业市场研究。请加入我们。</p><p><strong>艾莉森·莱德：</strong>感谢您聆听<cite>我、我自己和人工智能的演讲</cite>。和您一样，我们相信关于人工智能实施的对话不会从这个播客开始和结束。这就是为什么我们在 LinkedIn 上专门为像您这样的听众创建了一个群组。它被称为 AI for Leaders，如果您加入我们，您可以与节目创作者和主持人聊天，提出您自己的问题，分享您的见解，并获得来自<cite>MIT SMR</cite>和 BCG 的有关 AI 实施的宝贵资源。您可以通过访问<a href="https://mitsmr.com/AIforLeaders">mitsmr.com/AIforLeaders</a>来访问它。我们会将该链接放在演出笔记中，希望在那里见到您。</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/entrepreneurial-ai-in-the-enterprise-lg-novas-shilpa-prasad/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>摩擦可以改善客户体验吗？</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/can-friction-improve-your-customers-experiences/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/can-friction-improve-your-customers-experiences/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 11:00:55 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Marco Bertini, Diego Aparicio, and Aylin Aydinli. <p>Marco Bertini 是巴塞罗那 Esade 和 Ramon Llull 大学的营销学教授，也是 Globalpraxis 的高级顾问。迭戈·阿帕里西奥 (Diego Aparicio) 是巴塞罗那 IESE 商学院营销学助理教授。艾林·艾丁利 (Aylin Aydinli) 是阿姆斯特丹自由大学市场营销学副教授。</p> ]]>; </dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Customer Engagement]]></category><category><![CDATA[Customer Experience]]></category><category><![CDATA[Customer Journey]]></category><category><![CDATA[E-commerce]]></category><category><![CDATA[Pricing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Customers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Strategy]]></category><description><![CDATA[Otto Dettmer/Ikon Images Companies are on a mission to design purchase journeys that are as free of frustration and inconvenience as possible. “Friction kills the customer experience!” has become the conventional wisdom.

The simple logic behind these tactics is that only the customers who are most interested in the company&#39;s products or most invested in the brand will find working through these inconveniences and complications acceptable in the shopping journey.</p><p></p><p> <strong>2. When friction enables better decisions, customer satisfaction improves.</strong> Using friction to give consumers a moment to pause and consider the implications of their purchases can forestall buyer&#39;s remorse and encourage shoppers to choose the most appropriate option among the available alternatives.</p><p> Making the trade-off between what the potential buyer will pay and what they will receive sufficiently obvious can help prevent mindless purchasing decisions made in the heat of the moment. For example, social media may pitch “buy now, pay later” financing as a savvy way to buy on a budget, but the ease and convenience of such services, now available in many e-commerce sites&#39; checkout processes, can encourage households to overspend, leading to financial strain and debt accumulation. One survey found that 42% of Americans who took out such a loan made at least one late payment on it. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a> In addition, research shows that payments made either long before or long after the natural moment of consumption can reduce people&#39;s attention to cost. Proponents of buy now, pay later assert that this “separates the fun experience of buying from the tedious process of paying,” when in fact such “transaction decoupling” has been shown to reduce the likelihood that the consumer will use the item purchased. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p> The advantage of avoiding bad decisions is relatively clear from a public policy perspective: Most people would agree that overspending and chronic underutilization of purchased goods are not desirable qualities in a society. But encouraging more thoughtful engagement by customers via friction in the purchase process can pay off for businesses, too.</p><p> One immediate benefit is a drop in return rates. In many sectors, online returns are a considerable drag on financial performance — adding up to as much as 15 to 30 cents per dollar of the price of returned merchandise. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> According to a study by Appriss Retail and the National Retail Federation, close to $220 billion worth of merchandise was returned to US digital retailers in 2021, or approximately 21% of total online sales. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a> And this drag, of course, is not just financial — it&#39;s also environmental. Returned products might not be resalable due to wear and tear or other issues and thus end up being sent to landfills or destroyed. According to one report, online returns in the US alone create 5 billion pounds of landfill waste and 15 million tons of carbon emissions annually. <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a> Adding friction also provides customers with time to consider the purchase and become more invested in it. Brands such as Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and Balenciaga delay the communication of prices in a variety of ways — for example, by introducing personalized experiences with salespeople — not only to select better customers, as discussed above, but to put the product center stage and help customers internalize its quality and meaning. Research at the intersection of marketing and neuroscience reports that revealing prices after product information focuses evaluations on attractiveness and desirability (people ask themselves, “Do I like this?”), while doing the opposite focuses evaluations on monetary worth (people ask themselves, “Is it worth it?”). <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a> In a Gartner study, B2B and B2C customers agreed that if they “realized something new about their needs or their own goals,” they were 1.73 times more likely to buy more. <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a></p><p> Using friction to stimulate thinking that results in a decision to purchase can foster a sense of ownership of the product. This can trigger a stronger bond between company and customers and increase customers&#39; willingness to invest additional resources in the relationship. <a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a> As customers put more thought into the purchase decision, they tend to feel more emotionally attached to the product they ultimately choose. And there&#39;s evidence that connecting with customers at the emotional level is a valid route to maximizing customer value. <a id="reflink14" class="reflink" href="#ref14">14</a></p><p> Finally, research also shows that people tend to value products more when they are obtained through effort — the aptly named “Ikea effect,” in reference to the retailer&#39;s policy of outsourcing the assembly of its furniture to customers. <a id="reflink15" class="reflink" href="#ref15">15</a> The experience of effort can influence how people perceive the value and quality of a product or service, and adding effort to the online purchase process can trigger this effect.</p><p></p><p> Overall, we see that friction is successful at triggering engagement, and we know that engaged customers are generally more satisfied with their interactions and experiences with brands and retailers. Engaged customers become advocates, increasing visibility and credibility for companies. They are likely to engage in positive word of mouth, which can lead to new-customer acquisition and elevated brand reputation. They are also likely to have better customer service experiences, feel valued by the company, and provide meaningful feedback and suggestions. Such feedback is valuable for understanding evolving customer needs and making the right improvements to products or services over time.</p><p> <strong>3. Friction creates space for companies to communicate with customers.</strong> Retaining some friction exactly when people face prices and payment, especially when this friction is unexpected, gains attention. This is an opportunity for companies to advertise what they stand for and the merits of their offerings.</p><p> There are several ways to use friction for promotion. First, companies can involve customers in the payment process to evoke positive emotions. For example, one common practice is to give customers the option to round up the transaction amount to the next highest dollar, with the difference being donated to charity. Another possibility is to introduce pay-what-you-want campaigns, where customers choose the price they will pay for the product. While these initiatives do not expedite payment (it is surprisingly effortful to consider how much one wants to pay for something), they can lead to greater emotional connections.</p><p> Companies can also express prices in ways that are intentionally unconventional to force customers to think harder about the underlying message. <a id="reflink16" class="reflink" href="#ref16">16</a> For instance, an advertisement from Ikea uses cans of soda to playfully quantify the prices of its products. Of course, the retailer won&#39;t accept soda as payment for furniture. And although it takes a moment of cognitive effort to understand the “exchange rate,” the message that the furniture is as affordable as a number of small-ticket purchases, such as soda, is conveyed to customers.</p><p> Another example is Stella Artois&#39;s award-winning “reassuringly expensive” campaign. The brand attempted to signal the high quality of its beer by introducing the dependency between price and quality into its price communication. Stella upended consumer expectations by playfully offering a coupon that increased the price of the product (“Bring this coupon and pay an extra $1.25 on your next Stella Artois”). By presenting a seemingly confusing and illogical “deal,” it nudged customers to conclude that the product is far superior to that of its competitors (and worth the cost).</p><p> Friction in the payment process can also be used to communicate the brand&#39;s values. For example, in 2014, the relief organization Misereor increased donation rates by deploying interactive screens in locations such as airports that asked passersby to donate 2 euros by swiping their credit cards over the screen. The swipe activated an engaging interactive sequence, such as depicting the credit card slicing a piece of bread to feed the hungry or freeing an imprisoned child.</p><p> Finally, in a bold example of extreme friction, outdoor retailer REI closed its physical stores and stopped processing online payments on Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year in the US Its goal was to take a stand against consumerism and encourage would-be shoppers to spend time outdoors instead — a message that underscores the company&#39;s dedication to accessible exploration. <a id="reflink17" class="reflink" href="#ref17">17</a></p><h3> The Friction Sweet Spot</h3><p> Better customer selection, consumer decisions, and promotion are three good reasons to abandon the simplistic goal of zero friction. Given the drawbacks of encouraging customers to purchase on autopilot, business leaders should seek to determine the right degree of friction for their companies&#39; purchase processes. In our experience, there are at least five factors to consider. We&#39;ll review them and introduce a scorecard that brings them together and helps to guide decision-making. (See “What&#39;s the Right Amount of Friction for Your Online Customer Experience?”)</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> What&#39;s the Right Amount of Friction for Your Online Customer Experience?</h4><p class="caption"> Use this scorecard to help you determine the optimal amount of friction to help you<br /> cultivate enduring customer relationships.</p><p></p></article></aside></div><p> The first step for every company is to adopt a more accurate definition of what friction is. At the moment, all friction is viewed negatively, which reduces organizations&#39; sense of needing to specify what it actually is. By most accounts, friction is operationalized in terms of time saved. But not all time is created equal. In fact, companies should view negative friction as anything that blocks or distracts customers from the purchase decision, and positive friction as anything that optimizes deliberation.</p><p> The second step is to understand what contexts benefit from positive friction — because this need is not universal. What&#39;s at stake in a particular purchase decision, and does it typically require high or low customer involvement? The two often go together, such that high-stakes decisions also require high involvement, but this is not necessarily the case. For instance, a consumer who is financially secure might not engage more with a purchase decision simply because the item is expensive. And it is exactly when this relation breaks down that you want to step in to proactively manage friction. High-stakes decisions might be such because of the significance of the product or service in question, the scale of the financial outlay, or the personal or social consequences of the purchase. In this spirit, using a technology like Amazon&#39;s Just Walk Out in stadiums might not be good for people who are no longer dissuaded from buying unhealthy snacks by excessively long lines at the concession stand.</p><p> Third, think about your commercial objective. If you care about highlighting cost savings relative to competitors&#39; prices, then, yes — reducing friction by posting your almost-too-good-to-be-true price upfront is worthwhile. However, if you compete on the basis of innovation, quality, or customer service, then perhaps retaining a little friction by delaying when the price is presented is best, because this gets customers to think about and crystallize their preferences. Some friction allows businesses to shift the conversation from “Is it worth it?” to “Do I like it?” And if the goal is to strengthen one&#39;s brand, then adding friction is the right way to go.</p><p> Fourth, consider the makeup of your customer base and the relative closeness of customer relationships. Different customer demographics might require more or less friction, depending on expectations around their understanding of a product or service or their ability to pay. Likewise, relationship stage is important. You might want to include more friction in transactions with new customers versus returning customers, in particular those who might be less familiar with your products or product category. You might want to make it harder for a prospective customer to make a purchase, add a bit of friction for a returning customer, and present a frictionless experience to a loyal customer who fully understands the product or service. A company should maximize enduring relationships with clients — because that is the only path to increase customer value.</p><p> Fifth, think about your choice of route to market. All retail environments could potentially benefit from some friction, but their application will be different. In a brick-and-mortar store, adding pain points that incentivize interaction between a salesperson and the customer might be the right type of friction. In an online store, however, adding steps to foster deliberation can reduce returns and increase subsequent satisfaction with the company. On social media, a company could look to balance content that engages customer interaction and not just click-through rates, thereby helping to dissuade users from mindlessly or impulsively shopping.</p><p></p><p> In fact, for a business selling the same product in brick-and-mortar stores and online, more (positive) friction might be needed in the online or mobile channel, given that product returns tend to be greatest in those channels. One interesting technique that some fashion brands have recently introduced is imposing a fee for online returns. Companies like Anthropologie, H&amp;M, and Zara are charging for returning items online (but not for making in-store returns). <a id="reflink18" class="reflink" href="#ref18">18</a> Yes, charging for returns can antagonize some customers. But, again, this point can be key to retaining the most relevant customers and strengthening relationships with those who persist and make a purchase.</p><p></p><p> “How can we make our prices a little less conspicuous and easier to pay?” is among the most common questions asked of user experience teams and experts. But business leaders should embrace the customer moment of truth rather than work to eliminate it. They should not buy into the popular idea that friction is the ultimate conversion killer.</p><p> Without a doubt, when used poorly, friction can derail the customer experience. But a frictionless world is just as dangerous. This is a lesson most of us learned years ago from our high school physics teacher: Too much friction prevents progress toward a goal, but too little friction can throw everything into chaos.</p><p> Indeed, many business leaders are already telling us that they want customers to spend more productive time on their purchase decisions. This sounds like the perfect job for friction. If thinking leads shoppers to make safer, better choices, and in turn these choices impact companies through lower product returns, more sustainable consumer behavior, higher customer satisfaction, and higher loyalty, then let&#39;s all accept and embrace some hassles and hurdles as yet another — albeit surprising — tool at the disposal of customer centricity.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/can-friction-improve-your-customers-experiences/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Is Your Organization Investing Enough in Responsible AI? &#39;Probably Not,&#39; Says Our Data</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/is-your-organization-investing-enough-in-responsible-ai-probably-not-says-our-data/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/is-your-organization-investing-enough-in-responsible-ai-probably-not-says-our-data/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 11:00:53 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[David Kiron and Steven Mills. ]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business Priorities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Risk Management]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology Investment]]></category><category><![CDATA[AI & Machine Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Data, AI, & Machine Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Financial Management & Risk]]></category><category><![CDATA[Managing Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Responsible AI]]></category><description><![CDATA[For the second year in a row, MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group have assembled an international panel of AI experts to help us understand how responsible artificial intelligence (RAI) is being implemented across organizations worldwide.

For our final question in this year&#39;s research cycle, we asked our academic and practitioner panelists to respond to this provocation: <em>As the business community becomes more aware of AI&#39;s risks, companies are making adequate investments in RAI.</em></p><p> While their reasons vary, most panelists recognize that RAI investments are falling short of what&#39;s needed: Eleven out of 13 were reluctant to agree that organizations&#39; investments in responsible AI are “adequate.” The panelists largely affirmed findings from our <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/building-robust-rai-programs-as-third-party-ai-tools-proliferate/">2023 RAI global survey</a> , in which less than half of respondents said they believe their company is prepared to make adequate investments in RAI. This is a pressing leadership challenge for companies that are prioritizing AI and must manage AI-related risks.</p><p> The need to expand investments in RAI marks a significant shift now that “AI-related risks are impossible to ignore,” observes Linda Leopold, head of responsible AI and data at H&amp;M Group. While making adequate investments in RAI used to be an important but not particularly urgent issue, Leopold suggests that recent advances in generative AI and the proliferation of third-party tools have made the urgency of such investments clear.</p><p> Making adequate investments in RAI is complicated by measurement challenges. There are no industry standards that offer guidance, so how do you know when or if your investments are sufficient? What&#39;s more, rational executives can have different opinions about what constitutes an adequate investment. What&#39;s clear is that epistemic questions should not be a barrier to action, especially when AI risks pose real business threats.</p><div class="callout-chart"><div class="callout-chart__bg"><div class="callout-chart__container"><div class="callout-chart__info"><h3> The Panelists Respond</p></h3><h2> It is unclear if organizations are making appropriate investments in RAI.</p></h2><p> Most panelists are reluctant to agree that organizations are making “adequate” investments in RAI.</p><p> <a href="#sf-inter-app" class="callout-chart__info__anchor link-offset">Jump to panelists&#39; detailed responses below.</a> </div><div class="callout-chart__bars"><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RAI2023_Article4-Chart.jpg" alt="Chart: 0 strongly agree; 15% agree, 46% neither agree nor disagree; 39% disagree; 0% strongly disagree"></div></p></div><p class="callout-chart__source"> Source: Responsible AI panel of 13 experts in artificial intelligence strategy. </p></p></div><p><path id="Path" d="M0,0,14.067,15.065,28.941,0" transform="translate(1.096 1.054)" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="3" /> <a href="" class="callout-chart-add__button"><span class="callout-chart-add__button-text"><strong>Show</strong> Global Survey Results</span></a> </p><div class="callout-chart-add"><div class="callout-chart-add__container"><div class="callout-chart-add__info"><h4></h4><h3> Responses from the 2023 Global Executive Survey<br /></h3><p> “To what extent do you believe that your organization is prepared to invest (reduce revenue, increase costs) to comply with responsible AI initiatives?” </p></p></div><div class="callout-chart-add__chart"><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RAI2023_Article4-survey.jpg" alt="Bar chart: To a moderate or great extent: 48%; To some extent: 29%; To a minor extent: 8%; Not at all: 3%; Don't know: 12%" class="mt0"></p><p class="callout-chart-add__source"> Source: Survey data of 1,240 respondents representing organizations reporting at least $100 million in annual revenues.

Several panelists suggested that profit motives are a factor. Tshilidzi Marwala, rector of the United Nations University and UN undersecretary general, contends that only “20% of the companies aware of AI risks are investing in RAI programs. The rest are more concerned about how they can use AI to maximize their profits.” Simon Chesterman, the David Marshall Professor and vice provost at the National University of Singapore, adds, “The gold rush around generative AI has led to a downsizing of safety and security teams in tech companies, and a shortened path to market for new products. … Fear of missing out is triumphing — in many organizations, if not all — over risk management.”</p><p> Another reason behind underinvestment is that greater use of AI throughout an enterprise expands the scope of RAI and increases required investments. As Philip Dawson, head of AI policy at Armilla AI, observes, “Investment in AI capabilities continues to vastly outstrip investment in AI safety and tools to operationalize AI risk management. Enterprises are playing catch-up in an uphill battle that is only getting steeper.” Leopold adds that generative AI and an increasing number of possible applications “significantly increases the size of the audience that responsible AI programs have to reach.”</p><p></p><p> A third reason is that growing awareness of AI risks does not always translate into accurate assessments of those risks. Oarabile Mudongo, a policy specialist at the African Observatory on Responsible AI, suggests that some companies might not be investing enough in their RAI programs because they “underestimate the extent of AI risks.”</p><h3> How Do You Know Whether You&#39;re Investing Enough?</h3><p> Other panelists pointed out that although making adequate investments in RAI is important, it&#39;s hard to gauge whether the investment is large enough or effective. How should companies calculate a return on RAI investments? What counts as an “adequate” return? What even counts as an investment? David R. Hardoon, CEO of Aboitiz Data Innovation and chief data and AI officer of Union Bank of the Philippines, asks, “How can the investments in RAI be broadly, and generally, considered adequate if (1) all companies are not subjected to the same levels of standards, (2) we have yet to agree on what is &#39;sufficient&#39; or &#39;acceptable,&#39; or (3) we don&#39;t have a mechanism to verify third parties?”</p><p> Triveni Gandhi, responsible AI lead at Dataiku, agrees: “Among those companies that have taken the time to invest in RAI programs, there is wide variation in how these programs are actually designed and implemented. The lack of cohesive or clear expectations on how to implement or operationalize RAI values makes it difficult for organizations to start investing efficiently.”</p><p> “It is difficult to determine the extent to which companies are making adequate investments in responsible AI programs, as there is a large spectrum of awareness and relevance,” asserts Giuseppe Manai, cofounder, chief operating officer, and chief scientist at Stemly. Aisha Naseer, director of research at Huawei Technologies (UK), adds, “It is not evident whether these investments are adequate or enough, as these range from trivial to huge funds being allocated for the control of AI and associated risk mitigation.”</p><p></p><h3> Recommendations</h3><p> For organizations seeking to adequately invest in RAI, we recommend the following:</p><p> <strong>1. Build leadership awareness of AI risks.</strong> Leaders need to be aware that using AI is a double-edged sword that introduces risks as well as benefits. Focusing on investments that increase the benefits of AI without a commensurate focus on managing its risks undermines value creation in two ways. One is that without appropriate guardrails, the benefits from AI might be underwhelming: Our research has found that innovation with AI increases when RAI practices are in place. Second, risks from AI are proliferating as quickly as the tools they are embedded in. A robust awareness of AI&#39;s risks and benefits supports leadership efforts to manage risks and grow the company. Building management awareness can take many forms, including executive education, discussion forums, and RAI programs that have a variety of stakeholders with different types of exposure to (and experience with) AI risks.</p><p> <strong>2. Accept that investing in RAI will be an ongoing process.</strong> As AI development and use increase — with no foreseeable end — RAI practices and implementations need to adapt as well. That requires ongoing RAI investment to continually evolve an RAI program. With the regulatory landscape poised for change in the European Union, the US, and Asia, leaders will face growing pressure to evolve their AI-focused risk management systems. Waiting to invest (or halting investment) in these systems — technologically, culturally, and financially — can undermine business growth. When new regulations and industry standards take effect, rapidly overhauling processes to meet compliance requirements can interfere with AI-related innovation. It&#39;s better to co-evolve RAI programs with AI development so they complement each other rather than create this unnecessary interference. As companies scale their AI investments, so, too, will their RAI investments need to grow. But those companies that are already behind will need to move quickly and invest aggressively in RAI to avoid always lagging behind.</p><p> <strong>3. Develop RAI investment metrics.</strong> Investing in RAI is complex — and what does a return on such an investment even look like? Much like with cybersecurity investments, the best RAI returns might be the sound of silence when AI-related issues are discovered before they create damage to brand reputation, regulatory issues, and increased costs. That said, silence should not be mistaken for adequate investment. As our survey results show, companies making minimal investment might not find issues simply because they aren&#39;t looking for them. Leaders should align on what constitutes an RAI investment, the appropriate metrics to evaluate these investments, and who will decide on investment levels. Metrics that gauge RAI program success are necessary to support RAI programs over time, but they can be a lagging indicator. Metrics should also evaluate forward-looking dimensions such as leadership commitment, program adoption, training and workforce needs, and culture change. Leaders must also determine how RAI funding is related to funding for AI projects. Should every large AI project have a budget set aside for RAI? Or should RAI funding be independent of specific projects or some combination of project-based (decentralized) and institutional (centralized) investments?</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/is-your-organization-investing-enough-in-responsible-ai-probably-not-says-our-data/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Real Issues Driving the Nursing Crisis</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-solve-nursing-crisis/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-solve-nursing-crisis/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 11:02:56 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Donald Sull and Charles Sull. <p>Donald Sull ( <a href="https://twitter.com/culturexinsight">@culturexinsight</a> ) is a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management and a cofounder of CultureX.

For each review, we analyzed whether it mentioned one of 200 topics and assessed whether the nurse spoke about that topic positively or negatively. The topics were derived from research on various elements of employees&#39; experiences, including culture, compensation and benefits, work schedules, and perceived organizational support. We clustered related topics together into two dozen broader themes.</p><p> We used the topics as features in an XGBoost model that predicted each nurse&#39;s overall rating of their current or former employer on a 5-point scale. We then calculated SHAP values (which assign an importance value to each feature in a model) to directly compare the relative importance of different topics in predicting job satisfaction (measured by the overall rating each nurse gave their employer). We also used textual analysis to compare how favorably travel nurses spoke about topics compared with nurses on staff at health care systems.</p><p> Using the topics nurses mentioned and their sentiment toward each topic as predictors, our models explain between 29% and 39% of the variance in ratings across nurses — nearly an order of magnitude more than we could account for using ownership, organizational type, and location as predictors. <a id="reflinki" class="reflink" href="#refi">i</a></p></aside><p> Health care leaders face a daunting set of challenges — rising costs, the transition to digital health, and shifting payment models, to name just a few. But according to a recent survey from the American College of Healthcare Executives, the No. 1 problem hospital CEOs face is staff shortages and burnout. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> Ninety percent of the CEOs surveyed cited nursing shortages as a particularly acute pain point.</p><p> In 2021, the total number of registered nurses working in the US dropped by the largest amount in 40 years, with younger nurses leading the exodus. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> By 2025, the US health care system could suffer a shortfall of up to 450,000 nurses, or 20% fewer than the nursing workforce required for patient care. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p></p><p> High levels of job dissatisfaction and burnout are driving nurses from the profession. The COVID-19 pandemic placed tremendous pressure on all health care workers, but dissatisfaction and burnout among nurses have not improved since the pandemic ended. And by some measures, it might be getting worse: In 2021, nearly two-thirds of registered nurses would have encouraged others to become a nurse, but only half said they would recommend nursing as a profession two years later. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p> One of the richest sources of insight on dissatisfaction among nurses is how they describe their job, in their own words, on employment sites like Indeed and Glassdoor. This information is voluminous but difficult to synthesize because most of it takes the form of unstructured free text. To understand the challenges nurses face, we analyzed how 150,000 of them had described their employers in Glassdoor reviews since the beginning of the pandemic. (See “The Research.”) In this article, we share key insights from that analysis and offer advice to health care leaders about how they can address nurses&#39; most pressing issues.</p><h3> Health Care Leaders Are Out of Touch</h3><p> Nurses view their managers as out of touch with the daily realities of patient care. We categorized their comments about managers into nearly 50 leadership traits. The second most frequently cited trait described managers as being unaware of the challenges that nurses struggle with in the workplace. When nurses discussed how managers understood life at the bedside, their comments were negative 9 times out of 10.</p><p></p><p> Nurses are particularly critical of members of the senior executive team for their disconnectedness. The top team was 10 times more likely than front-line supervisors and middle managers to be criticized for being out of touch. Our results reinforce a separate survey in which nearly half of hospital nurses said they believe management does not listen to their concerns. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a></p><p> To address dissatisfaction and burnout, health care leaders must first understand what&#39;s happening at the bedside. This can be challenging, particularly in large health care systems with thousands of nurses working across multiple sites and specialties.</p><p> Historically, leaders have struggled to systematically analyze the gold mine of insights into nurses&#39; frustrations that can be gleaned from their comments in employee surveys or external reviews. Reading, understanding, and analyzing huge volumes of unstructured textual data has simply not been practical. However, recent advances in artificial intelligence make it possible to identify deep patterns in large bodies of text and understand feedback at scale. Leaders can now mine free text to gain a nuanced understanding of the issues driving dissatisfaction and burnout among nurses and use that insight to improve life at work for their nursing staffs. (See “Getting Started With Text Analytics.”)</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Getting Started With Text Analytics</h4><p> Our research analyzes data from hundreds of organizations and hundreds of thousands of nurses, but you can delve more deeply into your own employees&#39; feedback as well. Regardless of whether you develop AI text analytics capabilities internally, through a workforce analytics function, or with an external partner, you should keep these principles in mind to maximize the effectiveness of the cultural measurement.</p><p> <strong>Precision matters, but so does recall.</strong> Precision — the percentage of text instances that are correctly classified as discussing a topic — is a critical element of free text analysis. So is recall — the percentage of total mentions of the topic in a body of text that are captured by your text analytics platform. If you gauge success solely through precision, you will end up with an analytical platform that is highly accurate but misses most of what employees actually say. A sophisticated AI tool will pick up on slang, idioms, acronyms, cultural references, and organization-specific language to capture the long tail of seldom-mentioned but information-rich terms.</p><div class="callout-toggle"><p> <strong>Keep subject matter experts in the loop.</strong> The heart of text analytics is classifying natural language into meaningful topics. Ideally, the people measuring culture will engage subject matter experts when developing topics for analysis. Subject matter experts can ensure that the cultural and workplace topics selected are clearly defined, linked to existing research, and properly measured.</p><p> <strong>Likert questions have severe drawbacks but, used in moderation, can be very helpful.</strong> Too many Likert-scale questions can lead survey takers to shift into autopilot mode. But Likert questions should not be thrown out altogether. Effective cultural measurement combines Likert-scale outcomes on broad topics (such as engagement, attrition intent, and other important measures) with free-text data to identify which, out of hundreds of free-text topics, have the most powerful impact on outcomes.</p><p> <strong>Transparency matters and will probably matter more going forward.</strong> While it remains to be seen how AI will be regulated, it is likely that legislators or courts will not look kindly on important decisions being made by black-box models with no explanation of how the models are reaching their conclusions. Leaders often rely on culture measurement to make important decisions such as compensation policies, personnel changes, and how to prioritize resources. They should be wary of relying exclusively on models that make decisions that humans cannot understand.</p><p> <strong>Employees hate it when you spy on them — and you won&#39;t learn much about culture.</strong> Leaders should resist the temptation to expand their text analytics efforts to the content of emails, Slack channels, phone messages, and other forms of communication that were not designed to provide employee feedback. Many employees consider listening to their work conversations eavesdropping or worse. Moreover, work emails and Slack messages tend to contain far less cultural information than question prompts that explicitly invite employees to discuss what is working and not working in their organization. Keep employee listening consensual, and keep Big Brother out of the workplace.</p></div></article></aside></div><h3> Identify Relative Strengths and Opportunities Through Benchmarking</h3><p> Nursing satisfaction varies widely across employers. We identified 200 of the largest health care employers in the United States, including hospitals and health care systems, home health care providers, operators of senior living facilities, and staffing agencies. For each employer, we calculated how highly nurses rated the organization and senior leadership on Glassdoor from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic through June 2023. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p> Among large employers, nurses&#39; Glassdoor ratings ran the gamut from poor (2.6) to nearly perfect (4.9) on a 5-point scale. Nurses&#39; assessments of how well senior leadership has performed during and after the pandemic were even more varied, ranging from 2.1 to 4.9 on the same 5-point scale. The wide variance in Glassdoor ratings is consistent with a separate survey in which the percentage of dissatisfied nurses ranged from 2% to 48% across 60 US hospitals. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p> Employees of the 200 large health care organizations can use our <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/nursing-satisfaction-index/">interactive tool</a> to see how their organization ranks against others. The index is sortable by nurses&#39; overall ratings, their assessments of the top leadership, and the four most powerful predictors of nurses&#39; satisfaction: compensation, workload, organizational support, and toxic culture. </p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sull_Nursing_Interactive_512.jpg" class="launchscreen no-mobile"></p><h4> How Do Nurses Rate Their Employers?</h4><p class="caption"> Use the Nursing Satisfaction Index to compare how nurses evaluated the employee experience at 200 large health care organizations.</p><p></p></article></aside></div><p> Nurses who work for staffing agencies (who are sometimes referred to as travel nurses) are, on average, much more satisfied than other nurses. The five highest-ranked employers in our sample (and six of the top 10) are staffing agencies.</p><p> Higher compensation, of course, accounts for part of this difference, but not all of it. We compared how positively nurses working with staffing agencies spoke about 200 topics compared with their counterparts employed by hospitals and health care systems. (See “Staffing Agencies Rate Better on Many Key Factors.”) While compensation was viewed more favorably by agency nurses, issues around solving nurses&#39; problems and open, honest communication had a larger sentiment gap between the two groups. By focusing on nurses as clients, staffing agencies excel at practices that improve satisfaction beyond simply paying higher wages. Other health care leaders can learn from their example, and we&#39;ll make some concrete recommendations below.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Staffing Agencies Rate Better on Many Key Factors</h4><p class="caption"> We analyzed the free text of US Glassdoor reviews by nurses from the start of the pandemic to June 2023 to see how positively they spoke about a variety of topics. We then compared the positive sentiments of nurses working with staffing agencies to those of nurses working in hospitals and health care systems. While staffing agencies rate higher on many key topics — including honest communication, resolving issues efficiently, and building trust — hospitals and health care systems are stronger when it comes to learning and development, benefits, colleagues, and opportunities for promotion. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sull_Nursing_Fig1.png" alt="Staffing Agencies Rate Better on Many Key Factors" /><br /></article></aside></div><h3> Prioritize Drivers of Job Satisfaction</h3><p> To understand the drivers of job satisfaction among nurses, we analyzed the free text of all reviews that had been written by the nurses in our sample since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and classified the text into nearly 200 topics. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> We then clustered topics into two dozen broader themes and used those themes to predict nurses&#39; overall ratings of their employers. We then compared each theme&#39;s relative importance in predicting ratings. (See “Top and Bottom Predictors of Nurses&#39; Job Satisfaction.”)</p><p></p><p> Compensation was the top predictor of satisfaction among nurses reviewing their current employer, which is not surprising, given that inflation eroded the purchasing power of take-home pay during the period we analyzed. The importance of workload, the second-most-important driver, jibes with findings from a separate large-scale survey that found insufficient staffing was the strongest predictor of nurses&#39; job dissatisfaction, burnout, and intent to quit. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p> Workload and compensation are root causes of the nursing crisis that must be addressed, but they are not the only factors influencing nurses&#39; job satisfaction. Our analysis surfaced other aspects of the work environment, including toxic culture, organizational support, work schedules, communication, and learning and development opportunities, that leaders can focus on to improve nurses&#39; work lives.</p><p> This analysis also highlights areas that are unlikely to move the needle in improving the workplace experience for nurses. Perks are nice, but they will not compensate for a punishing workload or wages that fail to keep pace with inflation. Highlighting the corporate mission to promote patient health won&#39;t help much either. Nurses already know that their job serves a higher purpose; that&#39;s why most of them became nurses in the first place.</p><h3> Mine Free Text for Actionable Insights</h3><p> Many health care organizations rely on annual employee surveys, with dozens of items rated on a 5-point scale and a few open-ended questions tacked on as an afterthought. Faced with a long list of multiple-choice questions, employees are prone to switching to autopilot and assigning similar scores to very different items. The choice of questions constrains what employees can discuss, and there is seldom room to expand on why they chose a particular numeric response.</p><p> Open-ended, free-text feedback provides a rich source of nuanced and actionable insights. When nurses can decide which topics to write about, they use their freedom to discuss what matters most to them. Open-ended questions provide nurses with the space to expand on their concerns in their own words, offer crucial context, and propose concrete and actionable fixes to the problems they face. Individual free-text responses can be aggregated into broader themes to prioritize where leaders could focus their attention and limited resources to achieve the largest improvements in nurses&#39; satisfaction.</p><p> While organizational averages are useful, it is important to remember that distinctive subcultures can coexist within the same organization. This is particularly true among large health care systems that have grown through mergers and acquisitions. One national hospital chain, for example, has ratings that range from 1.9 to 3.9 across nearly 50 sites. Rather than relying on organizational averages alone, health care leaders must measure and analyze differences across locations, departments, functions, teams, and individual leaders.</p><p> Women, underrepresented minorities, and older employees can also experience organizational culture very differently from other employees. <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a> It&#39;s crucial to understand the drivers of job satisfaction and burnout across diverse employee populations.</p><p></p><p> Leaders can mine the free text for detailed insights about the most critical pain points for specific groups and tailor their interventions accordingly. Schedules, for example, have a significant impact on nurses&#39; job satisfaction, but which aspects of scheduling matter most will depend on the specific position. Flexibility in scheduling shifts and the ability to take uninterrupted work breaks is very important for nurses in hospitals and primary care practices, while home health care nurses place a premium on predictable schedules. <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a></p><p> Nurses&#39; comments provide a treasure trove of practical suggestions to improve the workplace and patient care. The Glassdoor reviews we studied, for example, include dozens of actionable suggestions for how employers can improve scheduling. Some are easy-to-implement actions, such as using an app to make it easier to pick up or swap shifts, or paying a $20 to $50 bonus to nurses who pick up shifts at the last minute. Others are more systemic changes, like including nurses on a committee established to set schedules or ensuring that employees who receive tuition assistance are able to schedule work around their classes.</p><h3> Listen to Nurses Who Leave Your Organization</h3><p> Most organizations limit their surveys to current employees. Exit interviews are administered haphazardly, if at all, and the feedback from former employees is too often dismissed as the rantings of malcontents. But ignoring feedback from former employees is a big mistake. </p><div class="post_video_player fit-video"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KJE4DW0Lbuk?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> Interviewing or surveying former employees can surface the reasons for their departure and pinpoint the most effective actions to retain talent. Free of the threat of retaliation, nurses who are leaving (or have left) an organization are more likely to provide candid feedback, even about taboo issues that current employees are reluctant to discuss. By collecting feedback from those who have left, organizations can uncover potential blind spots.</p><p> More than one-third of the Glassdoor reviews in our sample were written by former employees and provide insights on what mattered most to nurses who voted with their feet. <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a> The bars on the left side of the figure “Top and Bottom Predictors of Nurses&#39; Job Satisfaction” rank the factors that predict how nurses who quit rank their former employers, and it sheds light on a critical reason nurses might head for the exits.</p><p> In an <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/why-every-leader-needs-to-worry-about-toxic-culture/">earlier article</a> , we argued that five behavioral attributes — disrespectful, noninclusive, unethical, cutthroat, and abusive — mark an organizational culture as toxic. <a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a> Among nurses who quit, toxic culture is more than twice as predictive of their overall satisfaction than compensation or workload. The importance of toxic workplaces among nurses who quit is consistent with earlier research that found toxicity to be the strongest predictor of industry-adjusted attrition during the first six months of the Great Resignation. <a id="reflink14" class="reflink" href="#ref14">14</a></p><p> Toxic culture has become more important for nurses in the post-pandemic era. When we compared which factors best predict how nurses rated their employer before and after the pandemic, toxic culture experienced the largest gain in relative importance post-COVID-19 (followed by workload, well-being, and compensation). If your organization suffers from cultural toxicity, another article of ours, “ <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-fix-a-toxic-culture/">How to Fix a Toxic Culture</a> ,” presents several evidence-based interventions health care leaders can use to detox their own organization.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Top and Bottom Predictors of Nurses&#39; Job Satisfaction</h4><p class="caption"> We classified the text of over 150,000 nurses&#39; Glassdoor reviews into two dozen themes that affect the employee experience, and we then analyzed which themes best predict how nurses rate their employer. The chart ranks the importance of each theme in predicting these ratings by showing how much each theme contributes to the overall prediction. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sull_Nursing_Fig2.png" alt="Top and Bottom Predictors of Nurses’ Job Satisfaction" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><h3> Learn From Staffing Agency Practices</h3><p> As the figure “Staffing Agencies Rate Better on Many Key Factors” shows, nurses are very positive about the processes staffing agencies have in place to resolve problems quickly and efficiently. Of nurses who mentioned the efficiency of staffing agencies&#39; processes, 75% were positive, compared with 23% expressing positive sentiment for health care systems. For travel nurses, common process issues include onboarding, obtaining required credentials and licenses, contract negotiation, and reimbursement. The best staffing agencies listen to feedback, develop a deep understanding of the typical problems travel nurses face, and optimize their work processes to address these issues.</p><p> Many of the pain points encountered by staff nurses will differ from those of agency nurses. Health care systems, home health agencies, and long-term care providers could, however, adopt a similar approach to capture and analyze nurses&#39; feedback, prioritize the most common and frustrating challenges they face, and work with staff members to address these issues.</p><p> Consistently listening to and acting on feedback can also build trust with the nursing staff. Staffing agency nurses are more positive about having the psychological safety to speak up about difficult issues and be heard than are nurses working in hospitals and health care systems.</p><p> The benefits of psychological safety are blunted, however, if management is slow to respond to issues that nurses raise. Nurses speak highly of how quickly staffing agencies respond to their questions and concerns. In contrast, nurses frequently complain that other types of employers are slow to respond to emails raising issues, if they get a reply at all. Nurses also place a high value on having multiple channels of communication with their supervisors, including text, email, Facebook, Jabber, and a 24/7 hotline.</p><p> Another insight from our research is that nurses value honesty and transparency. They understand the challenges health care faces as well as anyone, and they expect honest communication about what is happening in the organization, how it affects them, and why decisions were made. Triage, a staffing agency and the fourth most highly rated large employer we studied, places honest communication at the center of its value proposition: “We tell it like it is so you won&#39;t be surprised by how it goes.” <a id="reflink15" class="reflink" href="#ref15">15</a></p><p> Health care systems can learn from staffing agencies, but they can also leverage their own distinctive advantages to attract and retain nurses. Nurses in full-time staff positions rate hospitals and health care systems higher than staffing agencies on three important aspects of organizational life: learning and development (including promotion opportunities and reimbursement for training), benefits, and colleagues. Those three factors are among the top 10 predictors of how nurses rate their employers. Health care systems should invest in their comparative advantages and emphasize them when communicating their value proposition to potential and current employees.</p><p></p><h3> Translate Feedback Into Action to Build Trust</h3><p> It&#39;s one thing to collect employee feedback, but it&#39;s another to consistently act on those insights. Employees are less likely to surface issues or propose potential solutions if they believe that managers will not act. <a id="reflink16" class="reflink" href="#ref16">16</a> Worse yet, employees are more likely to quit if they believe that management lacks the power, resources, or interest to make changes based on their suggestions. <a id="reflink17" class="reflink" href="#ref17">17</a> Nearly half of nurses believe that management will not fix problems that clinical staff members bring to their attention. <a id="reflink18" class="reflink" href="#ref18">18</a></p><p> Organizations need to put in place structures to consistently act on employee feedback. One well-known example is Kaiser Permanente&#39;s unit-based teams (UBTs), which consist of clinical staff members and managers who regularly work together in a specific unit or department. <a id="reflink19" class="reflink" href="#ref19">19</a> The teams, which meet at least once per month, are responsible for their unit&#39;s performance and are co-led by a manager, a labor representative, and, typically, a clinical staff member.</p><p> The UBTs identify opportunities to improve along four dimensions: quality (including patient outcomes), patient service, affordability, and employee experience. The teams use employee feedback to identify and prioritize improvement opportunities. Next, the teams develop and test solutions using best practices and evidence-based methods. Once a solution has been deemed effective, it is implemented across the unit, department, or, in some cases, the entire organization. The UBTs then monitor the impact of these changes in terms of patient outcomes, employee satisfaction, and cost reduction.</p><p></p><p> Our study of 150,000 reviews written by US nurses since the onset of COVID-19 reveals wide variation in how nurses rate their employers as a whole, and specifically in terms of compensation, workload, toxic culture, and organizational support — the four factors that most shape nurses&#39; job satisfaction. In our view, this variation offers a message of hope. Despite the structural challenges that all health care organizations face, it <em>is</em> possible to provide an environment where nurses look forward to going to work every day.</p><p> Many organizations, including some of the largest employers of nurses, have significant room for improvement. These rankings are not designed to “name and shame” but rather to make health care leaders aware of the magnitude of the gap between their organization&#39;s performance and what is possible when it comes to providing a healthy workplace for nurses. We also hope that the objective data on how health care organizations rank on factors that matter most to nurses can provide their leaders with the impetus to make improvements and the evidence to convince all stakeholders of the urgent need for change.</p><p></p><p> What leaders should not do is ask nurses to work harder and endure more frustration and stress while failing to understand and address the organizational factors that make life miserable for many of them. Leaders who continue business as usual should not be surprised when staff members quit, workers unionize, and state and federal legislators dictate regulations to protect the interests of nurses.</p><p> To improve the work lives of nurses, and indeed all health care workers, leaders must collect and act on their feedback, recognizing that different parts of the organization and different populations will face distinctive challenges and issues. Listening to nurses demonstrates that there are meaningful steps health care leaders can take to fix the nursing crisis. The single most important step is to listen to them in the first place.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-solve-nursing-crisis/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Explore How Nurses Rate Their Employers</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/nursing-satisfaction-index/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/nursing-satisfaction-index/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 11:01:03 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Donald Sull and Charles Sull. <p>Donald Sull ( <a href="https://twitter.com/culturexinsight">@culturexinsight</a> ) is a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management and a cofounder of CultureX.

Many organizations have instituted measures to monitor and increase their diversity hires; however, less attention is paid to what happens after the hire. Only when we effectively create a more equitable landscape and support women and people of color in navigating it can we benefit from the full engagement and contributions of all of our people and avoid losing them to turnover or disengagement.</p><p> Occupational minorities — those individuals who are <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/unleash-the-superpowers-of-your-one-and-only-employees/">relative rarities</a> in their profession due to their gender or sexual identity, ethnicity, age, or other factors — have accomplished what countless more have only dreamed of: They have broken through the glass ceiling, navigated the often inhospitable <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90920778/navigating-the-jungle-beyond-the-glass-cliff-part-i">corporate jungle</a> , and often successfully negotiated the <a href=" https://www.businessinsider.com/women-and-people-of-color-face-glass-cliff-us-2020-7?op=1">glass cliff</a> . Although the executives who represent diverse populations in your organization have successfully overcome these challenges, an important task remains: building a path for others to follow. This is hard, painstaking work that requires many different tools and competencies, yet it is necessary if others are to safely navigate the landscape.</p><p></p><h3> Steps to Sustaining Diversity</h3><p> Although various resources offer suggestions for how professionals from underrepresented populations can navigate and overcome organizational challenges, it is equally essential that organizations identify where <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/stop-telling-women-they-have-imposter-syndrome">persistent systemic bias and racism</a> lurk and take concrete action to address them. Organizations can take the following five steps to begin the process of creating more inclusive environments where all employees have equal opportunities to thrive and advance in their careers.</p><h4> Step 1: Establish leadership commitment to diversity with sponsorship.</h4><p> Leadership throughout the organization must demonstrate a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion. When leaders model these behaviors, employees throughout the organization naturally follow their example. However, this commitment cannot be limited to one-off efforts or statements on corporate values.</p><p> Leaders must consciously exhibit their commitment to hiring people from underrepresented populations by helping to develop and equip these candidates for advancement. Specifically, every leader, regardless of organizational level, should identify at least one such candidate to intentionally sponsor. After getting to know the candidate&#39;s background, career goals, and support needs, the leader should (1) counsel them in navigating the organization, (2) support them in developing the competencies needed to advance in their career, and, critically, (3) help them secure progressive leadership positions.</p><p></p><p> Although formal mentoring, sponsorship, and buddy programs can be helpful in this effort, relationships that develop informally often are equally, if not more, rewarding and beneficial and tend to continue long after one or both individuals have advanced in or moved out of the organization.</p><h4> Step 2: Remove glass ceilings by addressing systemic factors.</h4><p> The metaphor of the glass ceiling depicts the systems of discrimination that prevent certain groups of people (typically women and people of color) from accessing high-level opportunities for career growth and advancement. Clues that glass ceilings exist within your organization include a lack of diversity within the upper-management and executive ranks compared with your overall workforce; pay disparities between individuals with similar roles and qualifications; limited mentorship, sponsorship, development, or advancement for certain groups of people; explicit or implicit biases regarding which groups are a better fit for leadership roles than others; and attrition levels within underrepresented groups that exceed those of other groups.</p><p> To identify and eradicate glass ceilings in your organization, closely scrutinize every aspect of the employee experience. For example, address biased hiring and promotion practices using blind recruitment techniques; review salary ranges and promotion criteria to ensure that equal pay is awarded for equal work; and make clear career paths and development opportunities available to all employees. Diversity goals, inclusion initiatives, and employee education on recognizing and avoiding unconscious biases also can support a diversity-conducive climate. Supporting flexible work arrangements and work-life balance can encourage the full participation of employees who might otherwise be overlooked due to their needs to balance personal and professional responsibilities.</p><p></p><h4> Step 3: Reduce glass cliffs through due diligence.</h4><p> The term <em>glass cliff</em> describes a phenomenon in which women and other minorities are preferentially selected for leadership positions in times of crisis, placing them at increased risk for failure. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> This phenomenon occurs across industries and geographies, and for women and ethnic minorities alike. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> The problem with giving people from underrepresented populations leadership opportunities only in times of crisis is that those who lead during turbulent times tend to be seen as part of the problem, which perpetuates stereotypes and reduces future opportunities for such candidates. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p> To avoid this outcome, care must be taken to recognize and fully examine the situation before assigning a leader to address it. While the temptation to dive in and do something to “stop the bleeding” is overwhelming, taking the appropriate time to first fully understand the problem is a small price to pay for a much-improved chance of success. The diagnosis process should include identifying project parameters (such as performance targets, deadlines, and budget), project stakeholders, past actions taken, the current situation, and desired outcomes — from the perspectives of all stakeholders. My article on the <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/from-glass-ceilings-to-glass-cliffs-a-guide-to-jumping-not-falling/">glass cliff phenomenon</a> provides more details on the process of due diligence and the questions that can be used to diagnose these situations. Only after diagnosing the problem will it be possible to select the most appropriate candidate to lead the effort.</p><h4> Step 4: Broaden the pathway by changing the conversation.</h4><p> Corporate environments can be fraught with challenges for women and people of color. Many challenges are systemic, such as organizational cultures that <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/03/women-face-a-double-disadvantage-in-the-hybrid-workplace">disadvantage certain groups</a> versus others, or workloads and behavioral expectations that require long hours in the office and around-the-clock responsiveness. These systemic challenges can make the corporate landscape seem foreign and antagonistic. In turn, occupational minorities might compensate by nursing cognitive biases that result in too much or too little confidence; limiting their social networks to similar peers rather than nurturing<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90932520/navigating-the-jungle-beyond-the-glass-cliff-part-ii">vital connections</a> to sponsors, mentors, and career guides; and failing to strike an appropriate work-life balance.</p><p> Although leaders must deliberately sponsor occupational minorities (Step 1), mentors, sponsors, and allies throughout the organization also play important roles in guiding candidates toward success because they, too, have already successfully navigated the organization. Supporting emerging leaders means changing the typical mentoring conversation. Typical conversations involve identifying a mentee&#39;s short- and long-term goals and seeking the mentor&#39;s situational advice, guidance on skill development, and feedback on performance. Mentoring that supports diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging should be adapted to include a clear framework for professional development, an explanation of how various opportunities and positions contribute to the candidate&#39;s career goals, and a discussion of how to navigate the organizational culture — all in light of the glass ceilings, glass cliffs, and systemic challenges they face as occupational minorities.</p><p> Cognitive biases also should be part of the conversation so that candidates can avoid the traps of both being overconfident and overcompensating for perceived shortcomings. Evaluation and adjustment of cognitive biases might be best accomplished by gathering 360-degree feedback regarding the mentee&#39;s performance on key tasks and engaging the mentee to describe their feelings, thoughts, and general experiences related to performing those tasks. Overconfidence might be occurring when the mentee&#39;s task performance is at or below average while their own experience of that task reflects strong enthusiasm, satisfaction, and a sense of achievement. In contrast, overcompensation might be occurring when the mentee&#39;s task performance is evaluated as or above average yet their described experiences suggest that they are spending too much time on tasks or that they harbor concerns about their performance.</p><h4> Step 5: Measure and track progress.</h4><p> A popular business adage is that we must inspect what we expect. This truism applies equally to any diversity effort. The process begins with defining what success looks like according to key diversity metrics such as hiring, retention, and advancement for various employee populations. It might be tempting to stop there; however, defining the goal is only the beginning. Additionally, it is necessary to measure the organization&#39;s current performance on these KPIs and then examine why that is the current state. Understanding the organization&#39;s current performance requires the following assessments:</p><p> <strong>1. Gauge buy-in.</strong> To what extent do organizational leaders and members understand and agree that the KPIs defined are the right indicators and performance targets?</p><p> <strong>2. Gauge feasibility.</strong> What organizational structures, processes, and other features facilitate the achievement of the KPI? What features threaten or obstruct achievement?</p><p> <strong>3. Gauge support needs.</strong> Leaders are taught to adapt to the needs of individual subordinates based on each person&#39;s skill level. In the same way, leaders throughout the organization need to adjust the amount of oversight, encouragement, and direction they provide as departments and employees across skill levels work to achieve diversity goals. For example, a recruiting department that is relatively inexperienced at hiring professionals from underrepresented groups will need strong, step-by-step guidance and frequent feedback until their competency grows, while a manager who is highly skilled at developing and including such professionals generally should be allowed the autonomy to exercise their talents to their fullest.</p><p></p><p> As initiatives are implemented, continue to regularly assess these metrics to gauge your progress and fine-tune your efforts. As the saying goes, “What gets measured gets done.” Achievement of your diversity goals will happen only if they are deliberately defined and regularly assessed.</p><p></p><p></p><p> I often have been one of few Black leaders in the organizations where I&#39;ve worked. At one point in my career, I was a town hall presenter at two meetings separated by level — one attended by rank-and-file employees, and the other attended by management. Although the Black customer service representatives were pleasantly surprised to see someone who looked like them in an executive role, I was shocked and dismayed to realize that nearly our entire customer service representative force was Black while all of our supervisors and managers were White. This was puzzling because the leadership team seemed to care about diversity from a recruiting standpoint, but it was glaringly obvious that systemic barriers were obstructing the retention and advancement of professionals from underrepresented groups.</p><p> Often, it is only when executives, board members, or the HR team notices a lack of diversity in their organization&#39;s upper levels that problems in the talent management system are noticed — but typically poorly understood and only rarely solved. Such disparities in advancement might be at least partially explained by inhospitable organizational settings and the need to broaden the pathway for these professionals from underrepresented populations to succeed.</p><p> Organizational leaders, coaches, mentors, sponsors, and other potential career enablers all have a part to play in eliminating sources of inequity and equipping occupational minorities to survive and thrive in corporate environments. As more and more diverse groups of professionals travel the pathway to career success, the pathway will become smoother and broader, resulting in an ongoing and cumulative organizational transformation.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/five-steps-to-build-and-sustain-diversity-in-your-organization/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
