class="callout-info"><h4>这个调查</h4><p>我们分析了从大流行开始到 2023 年 6 月美国护士撰写的 150,000 条评论的自由文本。对于每条评论，我们分析了它是否提到了 200 个主题之一，并评估了护士对该主题的评价是积极还是消极。这些主题源自对员工体验的各个要素的研究，包括文化、薪酬和福利、工作时间表以及感知的组织支持。我们将相关主题聚集成两打更广泛的主题。</p><p>我们将这些主题用作 XGBoost 模型中的特征，该模型以 5 分制预测每位护士对其现任或前任雇主的总体评分。然后，我们计算 SHAP 值（为模型中的每个特征分配一个重要性值），以直接比较不同主题在预测工作满意度方面的相对重要性（通过每个护士给雇主的总体评分来衡量）。我们还使用文本分析来比较旅行护士与医疗保健系统工作人员的护士谈论话题的积极程度。</p><p>使用护士提到的主题以及他们对每个主题的情绪作为预测变量，我们的模型解释了护士之间 29% 到 39% 的评分差异——几乎比我们使用所有权、组织类型和位置所能解释的要高一个数量级作为预测因子。<a id="reflinki" class="reflink" href="#refi">我</a></p></aside><p>医疗保健领导者面临着一系列艰巨的挑战——成本上升、向数字医疗的过渡以及支付模式的转变等等。但根据美国医疗保健高管学院最近的一项调查，医院首席执行官面临的第一大问题是员工短缺和倦怠。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> 90% 的受访首席执行官将护士短缺视为一个特别严重的痛点。</p><p> 2021年，在美国工作的注册护士总数出现40年来最大降幅，其中年轻护士的流失率最高。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a>到 2025 年，美国医疗保健系统可能会短缺多达 45 万名护士，比患者护理所需的护理人员数量少 20%。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p></p><p>高度的工作不满和倦怠正在驱使护士离开这个行业。 COVID-19大流行给所有医护人员带来了巨大压力，但自大流行结束以来，护士的不满和倦怠并没有改善。从某些角度来看，情况可能会变得更糟：2021年，近三分之二的注册护士会鼓励其他人成为一名护士，但只有一半的人表示他们会在两年后推荐护理作为职业。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p>了解护士不满情绪的最丰富来源之一是他们在 Indeed 和 Glassdoor 等招聘网站上如何用自己的话描述自己的工作。这些信息数量庞大，但难以综合，因为其中大部分采用非结构化自由文本的形式。为了了解护士面临的挑战，我们分析了自疫情爆发以来，其中 15 万名护士在 Glassdoor 评论中如何描述其雇主。 （参见“研究”。）在本文中，我们分享了该分析的重要见解，并就如何解决护士最紧迫的问题向医疗保健领导者提供建议。</p><h3>医疗保健领导者脱节</h3><p>护士认为他们的经理与患者护理的日常现实脱节。我们将他们对管理者的评价分为近 50 种领导特质。第二个最常被提及的特征是，管理者没有意识到护士在工作场所面临的挑战。当护士们讨论管理者如何理解床边生活时，十分之九的评论都是负面的。</p><p></p><p>护士们尤其批评高级管理团队成员的脱节。高层团队因脱节而受到批评的可能性是一线主管和中层管理人员的 10 倍。我们的结果证实了另一项调查，其中近一半的医院护士表示，他们认为管理层没有倾听他们的担忧。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a></p><p>为了解决不满和倦怠问题，医疗保健领导者必须首先了解床边发生的情况。这可能具有挑战性，特别是在拥有数千名护士跨多个地点和专业工作的大型医疗保健系统中。</p><p>从历史上看，领导者一直在努力系统地分析护士挫败感的金矿，这些见解可以从员工调查或外部审查中的评论中收集到。阅读、理解和分析大量非结构化文本数据根本不切实际。然而，人工智能的最新进展使得识别大量文本中的深层模式并大规模理解反馈成为可能。领导者现在可以挖掘自由文本，以深入了解导致护士不满和倦怠的问题，并利用这种洞察力改善护理人员的工作生活。 （请参阅“文本分析入门”。）</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>文本分析入门</h4><p>我们的研究分析了来自数百个组织和数十万名护士的数据，但您也可以更深入地研究自己员工的反馈。无论您是在内部、通过劳动力分析功能还是与外部合作伙伴一起开发人工智能文本分析功能，您都应该牢记这些原则，以最大限度地提高文化衡量的有效性。</p><p><strong>精确度很重要，但记忆力也很重要。</strong>精确度（被正确分类为讨论某个主题的文本实例的百分比）是自由文本分析的关键要素。召回率也是如此——文本分析平台捕获的文本正文中主题提及总数的百分比。如果您仅通过精度来衡量成功，那么您最终会得到一个高度准确的分析平台，但会忽略员工实际所说的大部分内容。复杂的人工智能工具将识别俚语、习语、首字母缩略词、文化参考和组织特定的语言，以捕获很少提及但信息丰富的术语的长尾。</p><div class="callout-toggle"><p><strong>让主题专家了解情况。</strong>文本分析的核心是将自然语言分类为有意义的主题。理想情况下，衡量文化的人在开发分析主题时应聘请主题专家。主题专家可以确保所选择的文化和工作场所主题得到明确定义、与现有研究相关联并得到适当衡量。</p><p><strong>李克特问题有严重的缺点，但适度使用会非常有帮助。</strong>太多的李克特量表问题可能会导致调查者进入自动驾驶模式。但李克特的问题不应该被完全抛弃。有效的文化衡量将广泛主题（例如参与度、流失意图和其他重要衡量标准）的李克特规模结果与自由文本数据相结合，以确定在数百个自由文本主题中哪些对结果具有最强大的影响。</p><p><strong>透明度很重要，而且未来可能会更加重要。</strong>虽然人工智能将如何受到监管还有待观察，但立法者或法院可能不会善待黑盒模型做出的重要决策，而不解释这些模型如何得出结论。领导者经常依靠文化衡量来做出重要决策，例如薪酬政策、人事变动以及如何优先考虑资源。他们应该警惕完全依赖做出人类无法理解的决策的模型。</p><p><strong>员工们讨厌你监视他们——而且你不会学到太多关于文化的知识。</strong>领导者应该抵制诱惑，将文本分析工作扩展到电子邮件、Slack 渠道、电话消息和其他并非旨在提供员工反馈的沟通形式的内容。许多员工认为监听他们的工作谈话是窃听或更糟的行为。此外，工作电子邮件和 Slack 消息所包含的文化信息往往比明确邀请员工讨论组织中有效和无效的问题提示少得多。让员工倾听双方同意的意见，并让老大哥远离工作场所。</p></div></article></aside></div><h3>通过基准测试确定相对优势和机会</h3><p>不同雇主的护理满意度差异很大。我们确定了美国 200 家最大的医疗保健雇主，包括医院和医疗保健系统、家庭医疗保健提供者、老年生活设施运营商以及人才中介机构。对于每位雇主，我们计算了从 COVID-19 大流行开始到 2023 年 6 月，护士在 Glassdoor 上对组织和高级领导层的评价<a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">。6</a></p><p>在大型雇主中，护士的 Glassdoor 评分范围从很差（2.6）到近乎完美（4.9）（满分 5 分）。护士对大流行期间和之后高级领导表现的评估更加多样化，在相同的 5 分制中，从 2.1 到 4.9 不等。 Glassdoor 评级的巨大差异与另一项调查一致，该调查显示美国 60 家医院中护士不满意的比例从 2% 到 48% 不等。 <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p> 200 家大型医疗保健组织的员工可以使用我们的<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/nursing-satisfaction-index/">交互式工具</a>来查看他们的组织相对于其他组织的排名。该指数根据护士的总体评分、对最高领导层的评估以及护士满意度的四个最有力的预测因素进行排序：薪酬、工作量、组织支持和有毒文化。 </p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sull_Nursing_Interactive_512.jpg" class="launchscreen no-mobile"></p><h4>护士如何评价他们的雇主？</h4><p class="caption">使用护理满意度指数来比较护士如何评估 200 家大型医疗保健组织的员工体验。</p><p></p></article></aside></div><p>平均而言，在人事代理机构工作的护士（有时被称为旅行护士）比其他护士更满意。我们样本中排名最高的五家雇主（前十名中的六家）是人才中介机构。</p><p>当然，较高的薪酬是造成这种差异的部分原因，但不是全部。我们比较了在人才中介机构工作的护士与医院和医疗保健系统雇用的护士谈论 200 个话题的积极程度。 （参见“人事机构在许多关键因素上的评分更高”。）虽然机构护士对薪酬的看法更有利，但围绕解决护士问题和开放、诚实的沟通问题，两组之间的情绪差距更大。通过将护士视为客户，人才中介机构擅长提高满意度，而不仅仅是支付更高的工资。其他医疗保健领导者可以从他们的例子中学习，我们将在下面提出一些具体建议。</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>人才中介机构在许多关键因素上的评分更高</h4><p class="caption">我们分析了从大流行开始到 2023 年 6 月期间美国 Glassdoor 护士评论的自由文本，以了解他们对各种话题的积极评价。然后，我们将在人才中介机构工作的护士的积极情绪与在医院和医疗保健系统工作的护士的积极情绪进行了比较。虽然人事代理机构在许多关键主题上的评分较高，包括诚实沟通、有效解决问题和建立信任，但医院和医疗保健系统在学习和发展、福利、同事和晋升机会方面表现更强。 </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sull_Nursing_Fig1.png" alt="人才中介机构在许多关键因素上的评分更高" /><br /></article></aside></div><h3>优先考虑工作满意度的驱动因素</h3><p>为了了解护士工作满意度的驱动因素，我们分析了样本中护士自 COVID-19 大流行开始以来撰写的所有评论的自由文本，并将文本分为近 200 个主题。 <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a>然后，我们将主题分为两打更广泛的主题，并使用这些主题来预测护士对其雇主的总体评分。然后我们比较了每个主题在预测收视率方面的相对重要性。 （参见“护士工作满意度的最高和最低预测因素。”）</p><p></p><p>薪酬是护士对当前雇主满意度的首要预测因素，这并不奇怪，因为在我们分析的期间，通货膨胀侵蚀了实得工资的购买力。工作量的重要性是第二重要的驱动因素，这与另一项大规模调查的结果相吻合，该调查发现人员配备不足是护士工作不满、倦怠和辞职意愿的最强预测因素。 <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p>工作量和薪酬是护理危机必须解决的根本原因，但它们并不是影响护士工作满意度的唯一因素。我们的分析揭示了工作环境的其他方面，包括有毒文化、组织支持、工作时间表、沟通、学习和发展机会，领导者可以关注这些方面来改善护士的工作生活。</p><p>该分析还强调了不太可能改善护士工作场所体验的领域。福利固然不错，但无法弥补繁重的工作量或跟不上通货膨胀的工资。强调促进患者健康的企业使命也无济于事。护士们已经知道他们的工作有更高的目标；这就是为什么他们中的大多数人首先成为护士。</p><h3>挖掘自由文本以获得可行的见解</h3><p>许多医疗保健组织依赖年度员工调查，其中有数十个项目按 5 分制评分，并事后添加了一些开放式问题。面对一长串的多项选择题，员工很容易转向自动驾驶仪，并为非常不同的项目分配相似的分数。问题的选择限制了员工可以讨论的内容，而且很少有空间来扩展他们为什么选择特定的数字答案。</p><p>开放式的自由文本反馈提供了丰富的细致入微且可操作的见解来源。当护士可以决定要写哪些主题时，他们会利用自己的自由来讨论对他们来说最重要的事情。开放式问题为护士提供了用自己的语言阐述他们的担忧、提供关键背景并针对他们面临的问题提出具体和可行的解决方案的空间。个人自由文本回复可以汇总为更广泛的主题，以确定领导者可以集中注意力和有限资源的优先顺序，以最大程度地提高护士满意度。</p><p>虽然组织平均值很有用，但重要的是要记住，不同的亚文化可以在同一组织内共存。对于通过并购发展起来的大型医疗保健系统来说尤其如此。例如，一家全国性连锁医院在近 50 个地点的评级范围为 1.9 到 3.9。医疗保健领导者不能仅仅依赖组织平均水平，而必须衡量和分析地点、部门、职能、团队和个人领导者之间的差异。</p><p>女性、代表性不足的少数族裔和年长员工也会体验到与其他员工截然不同的组织文化。 <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a>了解不同员工群体工作满意度和倦怠的驱动因素至关重要。</p><p></p><p>领导者可以挖掘免费文本，详细了解特定群体最关键的痛点，并相应地调整干预措施。例如，日程安排对护士的工作满意度有重大影响，但日程安排的哪些方面最重要将取决于具体职位。轮班安排的灵活性和不间断工作休息的能力对于医院和初级保健机构的护士来说非常重要，而家庭保健护士则非常看重可预测的时间表。 <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a></p><p>护士的意见为改善工作场所和患者护理提供了宝贵的实用建议。例如，我们研究的 Glassdoor 评论包括数十条关于雇主如何改进日程安排的可行建议。有些是易于实施的行动，例如使用应用程序更容易接班或调换班次，或者向最后一刻接班的护士支付 20 至 50 美元的奖金。其他则是更为系统性的改变，比如让护士加入一个制定时间表的委员会，或者确保接受学费援助的员工能够安排他们的课程的工作。</p><h3>倾听离开您组织的护士的心声</h3><p>大多数组织将调查范围限制在现任员工。离职面谈如果有的话，也是随意进行的，而前员工的反馈往往被视为不满者的咆哮。但忽视前员工的反馈是一个很大的错误。 </p><div class="post_video_player fit-video"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KJE4DW0Lbuk?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>对前员工进行访谈或调查可以揭示他们离职的原因，并找出留住人才的最有效行动。由于没有报复的威胁，即将离开（或已经离开）组织的护士更有可能提供坦诚的反馈，甚至是当前员工不愿讨论的禁忌问题。通过收集离职者的反馈，组织可以发现潜在的盲点。</p><p>在我们的样本中，超过三分之一的 Glassdoor 评论是由前员工撰写的，这些评论提供了对用脚投票的护士最重要的见解。 <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a>图左侧的条形图“护士工作满意度的最高和最低预测因素”对预测离职护士如何评价其前雇主的因素进行了排名，它揭示了护士可能离职的一个关键原因。</p><p>在 <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/why-every-leader-needs-to-worry-about-toxic-culture/">之前的一篇文章</a>中，我们认为五种行为属性——不尊重、不包容、不道德、残酷和虐待——将组织文化标记为有毒。 <a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a>在辞职的护士中，有毒文化对他们总体满意度的预测作用是薪酬或工作量的两倍多。有毒工作场所对辞职护士的重要性与早期的研究一致，该研究发现毒性是大辞职的前六个月内行业调整后人员流失的最强预测因素。 <a id="reflink14" class="reflink" href="#ref14">14</a></p><p>在大流行后时代，有毒文化对于护士来说变得更加重要。当我们比较哪些因素最能预测护士在大流行前后对雇主的评价时，发现在 COVID-19 之后，有毒文化的相对重要性获得了最大的提升（其次是工作量、幸福感和薪酬）。如果您的组织遭受文化毒性，我们的另一篇文章“<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-fix-a-toxic-culture/">如何修复有毒文化</a>”提出了几种基于证据的干预措施，医疗保健领导者可以用来为自己的组织排毒。</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside

class="attribution"></article></aside></div><h3>学习人才中介机构的做法</h3><p>正如“人事机构在许多关键因素上评分较高”这一数字所示，护士对人事机构为快速有效地解决问题而制定的流程非常积极。在提及人事代理机构流程效率的护士中，75% 的护士持积极态度，而只有 23% 的护士对医疗保健系统表示积极看法。对于旅行护士来说，常见的流程问题包括入职、获得所需的证书和执照、合同谈判和报销。最好的人才中介机构会听取反馈，深入了解旅行护士面临的典型问题，并优化工作流程来解决这些问题。</p><p>专职护士遇到的许多痛点与机构护士所遇到的痛点有所不同。然而，医疗保健系统、家庭保健机构和长期护理提供者可以采用类似的方法来捕获和分析护士的反馈，优先考虑他们面临的最常见和令人沮丧的挑战，并与工作人员合作解决这些问题。</p><p>持续倾听反馈并采取行动也可以与护理人员建立信任。与在医院和医疗保健系统工作的护士相比，人事机构的护士更积极地认为拥有心理安全感，可以说出困难的问题并让别人听到。</p><p>然而，如果管理层对护士提出的问题反应缓慢，心理安全的好处就会减弱。护士们高度评价人才中介机构对她们的问题和疑虑的快速反应。相比之下，护士经常抱怨其他类型的雇主即使得到回复，也对提出问题的电子邮件回复缓慢。护士还非常重视与主管的多种沟通渠道，包括短信、电子邮件、Facebook、Jabber 和 24/7 热线。</p><p>我们研究的另一个见解是护士重视诚实和透明度。他们和任何人一样了解医疗保健面临的挑战，并且希望就组织中正在发生的事情、它如何影响他们以及做出决定的原因进行诚实的沟通。 Triage 是一家人才中介机构，也是我们研究的第四大评价最高的大型雇主，它将诚实的沟通置于其价值主张的核心：“我们按事实说话，这样你就不会对其进展感到惊讶。” <a id="reflink15" class="reflink" href="#ref15">15</a></p><p>医疗保健系统可以向人才中介机构学习，但也可以利用自己的独特优势来吸引和留住护士。全职护士在组织生活的三个重要方面对医院和医疗保健系统的评价高于人才中介机构：学习和发展（包括晋升机会和培训报销）、福利和同事。这三个因素是护士评价雇主的十大预测因素之一。医疗保健系统应投资于其比较优势，并在向潜在和现有员工传达其价值主张时强调这些优势。</p><p></p><h3>将反馈转化为行动以建立信任</h3><p>收集员工反馈是一回事，但持续根据这些见解采取行动则是另一回事。如果员工认为管理者不会采取行动，他们就不太可能提出问题或提出潜在的解决方案。 <a id="reflink16" class="reflink" href="#ref16">16</a>更糟糕的是，如果员工认为管理层缺乏权力、资源或兴趣根据他们的建议进行变革，他们更有可能辞职。 <a id="reflink17" class="reflink" href="#ref17">17</a>近一半的护士认为管理层不会解决临床工作人员提请他们注意的问题。 <a id="reflink18" class="reflink" href="#ref18">18</a></p><p>组织需要建立适当的结构，以一致地根据员工的反馈采取行动。一个著名的例子是 Kaiser Permanente 的单位团队 (UBT)，该团队由经常在特定单位或部门一起工作的临床工作人员和管理人员组成。 <a id="reflink19" class="reflink" href="#ref19">19</a>这些团队每月至少召开一次会议，对其部门的绩效负责，并由一名经理、一名劳工代表以及通常还有一名临床工作人员共同领导。</p><p> UBT 确定了四个方面的改进机会：质量（包括患者治疗结果）、患者服务、负担能力和员工体验。团队利用员工反馈来识别改进机会并确定其优先顺序。接下来，团队使用最佳实践和基于证据的方法开发和测试解决方案。一旦解决方案被认为有效，就会在整个单位、部门，或者在某些情况下整个组织中实施。然后，UBT 监控这些变化对患者治疗结果、员工满意度和成本降低的影响。</p><p></p><p>自 COVID-19 爆发以来，我们对美国护士撰写的 150,000 条评论进行了研究，结果显示，护士对雇主的整体评价存在很大差异，特别是在薪酬、工作量、有毒文化和组织支持方面——这四个因素对雇主的影响最大。塑造护士的工作满意度。我们认为，这种变化传递了希望的信息。尽管所有医疗保健组织都面临结构性挑战，但<em>仍有</em>可能提供一个让护士每天都期待上班的环境。</p><p>许多组织，包括一些最大的护士雇主，都有很大的改进空间。这些排名的目的不是为了“点名羞辱”，而是为了让医疗保健领导者意识到他们的组织绩效与为护士提供健康工作场所的可能性之间的差距有多大。我们还希望有关医疗保健组织如何在对护士最重要的因素上排名的客观数据可以为其领导者提供改进的动力，并提供证据来说服所有利益相关者迫切需要进行变革。</p><p></p><p>领导者不应该做的是要求护士更加努力地工作，承受更多的挫折和压力，却不能理解和解决使许多人的生活变得悲惨的组织因素。当工作人员辞职、工人成立工会以及州和联邦立法者制定保护护士利益的法规时，继续照常营业的领导者不应感到惊讶。</p><p>为了改善护士乃至所有卫生保健工作者的工作生活，领导者必须收集他们的反馈并根据他们的反馈采取行动，认识到组织的不同部门和不同人群将面临独特的挑战和问题。倾听护士的心声表明，医疗保健领导者可以采取一些有意义的措施来解决护理危机。最重要的一步是首先倾听他们的意见。</p><p></p>

href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/unleash-the-superpowers-of-your-one-and-only-employees/">相对稀有的</a>人——已经实现了无数人梦寐以求的事情：他们突破了玻璃天花板，驾驭了通常不友善的环境 <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90920778/navigating-the-jungle-beyond-the-glass-cliff-part-i">企业丛林里</a>，往往能成功渡过<a href=" https://www.businessinsider.com/women-and-people-of-color-face-glass-cliff-us-2020-7?op=1">玻璃悬崖</a>。尽管代表组织中不同群体的高管已经成功克服了这些挑战，但仍然有一项重要任务：为其他人开辟一条可以遵循的道路。这是一项艰巨、艰苦的工作，需要许多不同的工具和能力，但如果其他人想要安全地航行，这是必要的。</p><p></p><h3>维持多样性的步骤</h3><p>尽管各种资源为来自代表性不足人群的专业人士如何驾驭和克服组织挑战提供了建议，但组织识别<a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/stop-telling-women-they-have-imposter-syndrome">持续存在的系统性偏见和种族主义的</a>根源并采取具体行动解决这些问题同样重要。组织可以采取以下五个步骤来开始创建更具包容性的环境，让所有员工都有平等的机会在职业生涯中茁壮成长和进步。</p><h4>步骤 1：通过赞助建立领导层对多元化的承诺。</h4><p>整个组织的领导层必须表现出对多样性和包容性的坚定承诺。当领导者树立这些行为榜样时，整个组织的员工自然会效仿他们的榜样。然而，这一承诺不能仅限于一次性的努力或企业价值观的声明。</p><p>领导者必须通过帮助培养和装备这些候选人以获得晋升，有意识地表现出他们对聘用代表性不足的人群的承诺。具体来说，每位领导者，无论组织级别如何，都应该至少确定一名这样的候选人来有意赞助。在了解候选人的背景、职业目标和支持需求后，领导者应该 (1) 在组织中为他们提供咨询，(2) 支持他们发展职业发展所需的能力，并且最重要的是，(3 ）帮助他们获得进步的领导地位。</p><p></p><p>尽管正式的指导、赞助和伙伴计划可能对这一努力有所帮助，但非正式发展的关系往往同样（如果不是更多的话）有回报和有益，并且在一个人或两个人晋升或离开组织后往往会持续很长时间。</p><h4>第二步：通过解决系统性因素来消除玻璃天花板。</h4><p>玻璃天花板的比喻描述了阻碍某些群体（通常是女性和有色人种）获得职业发展和晋升的高水平机会的歧视制度。表明您的组织内存在玻璃天花板的线索包括，与整体员工队伍相比，高层管理人员和高管人员缺乏多样性；具有相似角色和资格的个人之间的薪酬差异；对某些人群的指导、赞助、发展或晋升有限；对于哪些群体比其他群体更适合领导角色存在明显或隐含的偏见；代表性不足的群体中的人员流失率超过了其他群体。</p><p>要识别并消除组织中的玻璃天花板，请仔细审查员工体验的各个方面。例如，使用盲目招聘技术解决有偏见的招聘和晋升做法；审查薪资范围和晋升标准，确保同工同酬；为所有员工提供清晰的职业道路和发展机会。多元化目标、包容性举措以及关于识别和避免无意识偏见的员工教育也可以支持有利于多元化的氛围。支持灵活的工作安排和工作与生活的平衡可以鼓励员工的充分参与，否则他们可能会因为平衡个人和职业责任的需要而被忽视。</p><p></p><h4>第三步：通过尽职调查减少玻璃悬崖。</h4><p> <em>“玻璃悬崖”</em>一词描述了一种现象，即在危机时期优先选择女性和其他少数群体担任领导职务，从而使她们面临更大的失败风险。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a>这种现象跨行业、跨地区、女性和少数民族都有发生。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a>仅在危机时期为代表性不足的人群提供领导机会的问题在于，那些在动荡时期担任领导的人往往被视为问题的一部分，这使陈规定型观念长期存在，并减少了此类候选人未来的机会。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p>为了避免这种结果，在指派领导者解决问题之前，必须注意认识并充分检查情况。虽然一头扎进去并采取措施“止血”的诱惑是巨大的，但花适当的时间首先充分理解问题只是为了大大提高成功机会而付出的很小的代价。诊断过程应包括从所有利益相关者的角度确定项目参数（例如绩效目标、截止日期和预算）、项目利益相关者、过去采取的行动、当前情况和期望的结果。我关于<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/from-glass-ceilings-to-glass-cliffs-a-guide-to-jumping-not-falling/">玻璃悬崖现象的</a>文章提供了有关尽职调查过程以及可用于诊断这些情况的问题的更多详细信息。只有诊断出问题后，才有可能选择最合适的候选人来领导这项工作。</p><h4>第四步：通过改变对话来拓宽途径。</h4><p>对于女性和有色人种来说，企业环境可能充满挑战。许多挑战都是系统性的，例如<a href="https://hbr.org/2022/03/women-face-a-double-disadvantage-in-the-hybrid-workplace">使某些群体相对于其他群体处于不利地位的</a>组织文化，或者需要长时间在办公室工作和全天候响应的工作量和行为期望。这些系统性挑战可能会使企业环境显得陌生和敌对。反过来，职业少数群体可能会通过护理认知偏差来弥补，这些偏差会导致信心过高或过低。将他们的社交网络限制在类似的同伴身上，而不是培养与赞助商、导师和职业指南的<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90932520/navigating-the-jungle-beyond-the-glass-cliff-part-ii">重要联系</a>；未能实现适当的工作与生活平衡。</p><p>尽管领导者必须刻意支持职业少数群体（步骤 1），但整个组织中的导师、支持者和盟友在引导候选人走向成功方面也发挥着重要作用，因为他们也已经成功地领导了组织。支持新兴领导者意味着改变典型的指导对话。典型的对话包括确定受训者的短期和长期目标，并寻求导师的情境建议、技能发展指导和绩效反馈。支持多样性、公平性、包容性和归属感的指导应包括一个清晰的职业发展框架、对各种机会和职位如何有助于候选人职业目标的解释，以及如何驾驭组织文化的讨论——所有这些鉴于他们作为职业少数群体所面临的玻璃天花板、玻璃悬崖和系统性挑战。</p><p>认知偏见也应该成为谈话的一部分，这样候选人就可以避免陷入过度自信和过度补偿所察觉到的缺点的陷阱。认知偏差的评估和调整最好通过收集有关受训者在关键任务上的表现的 360 度反馈并让受训者描述他们与执行这些任务相关的感受、想法和一般经验来完成。当受训者的任务绩效处于或低于平均水平，而他们自己对该任务的体验反映了强烈的热情、满足感和成就感时，可能会出现过度自信。相反，当受训者的任务绩效评估为或高于平均水平时，可能会发生过度补偿，但他们所描述的经历表明他们在任务上花费了太多时间，或者他们对自己的绩效心怀担忧。</p><h4>第 5 步：衡量并跟踪进度。</h4><p>流行的商业格言是，我们必须检查我们的期望。这一不言而喻的道理同样适用于任何多元化努力。该过程首先根据关键的多样性指标（例如不同员工群体的招聘、保留和晋升）来定义成功是什么样子。也许你会忍不住想就此打住。然而，确定目标仅仅是开始。此外，有必要衡量组织当前在这些 KPI 上的绩效，然后检查为什么会出现这种当前状态。了解组织当前的绩效需要进行以下评估：</p><p> <strong>1. 衡量买入。</strong>组织领导者和成员在多大程度上理解并同意定义的 KPI 是正确的指标和绩效目标？</p><p> <strong>2. 衡量可行性。</strong>哪些组织结构、流程和其他功能有助于实现 KPI？哪些特征威胁或阻碍成就？</p><p> <strong>3. 衡量支持需求。</strong>领导者被教导要根据每个下属的技能水平来适应每个下属的需求。同样，整个组织的领导者需要调整他们提供的监督、鼓励和指导的程度，因为不同技能水平的部门和员工都致力于实现多元化目标。例如，招聘部门在从代表性不足的群体中招聘专业人员方面相对缺乏经验，需要强有力的、循序渐进的指导和频繁的反馈，直到他们的能力得到提高，而在培养和吸纳此类专业人员方面技能娴熟的经理通常应该允许他们自主地充分发挥自己的才能。</p><p></p><p>随着计划的实施，继续定期评估这些指标，以衡量您的进展并调整您的努力。俗话说：“凡事经过衡量，才能完成”。只有经过精心定义并定期评估，您的多元化目标才会实现。</p><p></p><p></p><p>我经常是我工作过的组织中为数不多的黑人领导人之一。在我职业生涯的某个时刻，我曾在两次按级别分开的会议上担任市政厅发言人——一次由普通员工参加，另一次由管理层参加。尽管黑人客户服务代表很惊喜地看到一个看起来像他们的人担任行政职务，但我感到震惊和沮丧地意识到我们几乎整个客户服务代表队伍都是黑人，而我们所有的主管和经理都是白人。这令人费解，因为从招聘的角度来看，领导团队似乎很关心多样性，但显而易见的是，系统性障碍正在阻碍来自代表性不足群体的专业人士的保留和晋升。</p><p>通常，只有当高管、董事会成员或人力资源团队注意到组织高层缺乏多样性时，人才管理系统中的问题才会被注意到——但通常人们对此知之甚少，也很少得到解决。这种晋升上的差异至少可以部分解释为不友善的组织环境以及需要拓宽这些专业人员从代表性不足的群体中获得成功的途径。</p><p>组织领导者、教练、导师、赞助商和其他潜在的职业推动者都可以在消除不平等根源和帮助职业少数群体在企业环境中生存和发展方面发挥作用。随着越来越多的多元化专业人士群体走上职业成功之路，这条道路将变得更加顺畅和广泛，从而导致持续和累积的组织转型。</p><p></p>

Nine states — including New York, as of September — are currently regulating some aspect of pay disclosure. The National Women&#39;s Law Center reports that altogether, more than one-quarter of US employees live in a location where <a href="https://nwlc.org/resource/pay-range-transparency-laws-benefit/">pay information is regulated</a> .</p><p> By and large, pay transparency regulations have emphasized disclosing a salary range for advertised positions and internal opportunities for advancement. These laws are designed to ensure equal pay for equal work and effectively close the gender wage gap. The logic is simple: If underpaid employees, including women and minorities, aren&#39;t aware of what their coworkers are paid, they are at a significant disadvantage in leveling the playing field through litigation and negotiation. How can inequities be addressed when they remain in the dark? Without pay transparency, enforcement of existing laws, such as the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/equal-pay-act-1963">Equal Pay Act of 1963</a> , becomes difficult. Based on <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/fact-sheet-notable-eeoc-litigation-involving-pay-discrimination">recent cases</a> and notable discrepancies that have been exposed (some spanning years of underpayment), it seems that greater transparency has an important role to play.</p><p></p><h3> Organizational Responses to the Changing Regulatory Landscape</h3><p> Despite the increasingly widespread adoption of pay transparency regulations, many organizations have responded with pushback, resistance, and minimal compliance. After Colorado became the first state to require organizations to disclose pay ranges in advertised positions in 2021, organizations soliciting applicants from across the country began <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/state-and-local-updates/pages/some-employers-are-excluding-colorado-applicants-for-remote-work.aspx">explicitly excluding Colorado residents</a> from consideration to skirt the new laws, prompting the state&#39;s department of labor to issue <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/coloradans-excluded-job-listings-department-labor/">warnings and fines</a> . Another organizational tactic is to comply with pay information requirements with pay ranges that are so wide that applicants cannot meaningfully predict what salary they might be offered. In one notable example, Netflix posted a job with a salary range that <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/90000-to-900000-pay-transparency-laws-usher-in-baffling-pay-ranges-in-job-postings-200857290.html">spanned $90,000 to $900,000</a> .</p><p> While approaches to compliance with transparency laws at the organizational level have taken many forms, leaders have expressed several common concerns regarding the potential negative consequences of pay transparency to their business operations and culture:</p><ul><li> <strong>Will everyone just ask for more money?</strong> More pay information might prompt more conversations about pay (and why someone is receiving what they are). Managers worry that they&#39;ll be caught in the middle trying to juggle competing goals around budgeting and employee satisfaction.</li><li> <strong>What happens if some employees find out that they&#39;re paid less than others?</strong> Explaining to long-standing employees why they are paid the same as a new hire is likely to be uncomfortable and prompt substantial criticism of the employer.</li><li> <strong>Will pay transparency affect our ability to work together?</strong> Pay transparency can elicit jealousy and counterproductive competition when individuals perceive themselves as inequitably rewarded. Managers worry that employees might fight and undermine one another when discrepancies are exposed.</li></ul><p></p><h3> New Insights Into Managing Pay Transparency</h3><p> Our work provides new insights into addressing some of the main questions organizations have about transparency. Most new laws focus exclusively on creating pay transparency by requiring organizations to disclose pay ranges for open positions. In academic research, this form of transparency is referred to as <em>distributive transparency</em> , because it reveals information only regarding the <em>amount</em> of money employees are paid.</p><p> In our research, however, we have delineated several ways in which pay information can be transparent. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> With <em>procedural transparency</em> , the emphasis is on sharing information about how pay <em>decisions</em> are made; at the most transparent level, this would include a formula for calculating compensation (such as base pay or a merit-based raise).</p><p> Distinguishing between distributive versus procedural transparency is crucial because, as our research shows, procedural transparency can mitigate many of the risks and drawbacks associated with distributive transparency.</p><p> Implicit in pay transparency regulations is the idea that underpaid employees will take it upon themselves to <a href="https://qz.com/how-women-can-use-pay-transparency-to-negotiate-1850228867">negotiate for a fairer wage</a> . In fact, a large-scale study of over 100,000 academics over the past two decades found that changes in pay transparency were related to significantly more wage parity between men and women. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> However, the research also showed that transparency doesn&#39;t equate to <em>everyone</em> asking for more.</p><p> To explore this further, we conducted a series of four experiments to better understand <em>how</em> and <em>when</em> pay transparency can encourage employees (especially women) to more effectively negotiate for fair wages. In our first study, lab participants were paid for their performance after four rounds of a popular word search game and were given the opportunity to negotiate for better compensation. In studies 2, 3, and 4, online participants prepared themselves to go into a performance review, armed with varying degrees of information regarding performance and pay, to possibly negotiate for a better annual raise. They were told that they were slated for a 3% raise but that raises could range from 3% to 10%. Across these studies, we varied the amount of information participants could access regarding both the amount other people were paid and participants&#39; performance relative to their peers&#39;.</p><p> These studies yielded four important findings regarding distributive and procedural pay transparency:</p><p> <strong>1. People made clearer comparisons.</strong> We found that the best predictor of whether someone tried to negotiate for higher pay was their performance relative to that of peers. Compared with average performers, high performers were approximately 50% more likely to request higher pay when they knew their ranking relative to others. It&#39;s important to note that in our study, participants saw the previous year&#39;s performance and pay data for their team members, and it was clear that increased performance was directly related to increased pay. Although not an explicit formula indicating performance-based pay, this information provided a clear signal to participants that pay raises were largely determined by performance.</p><p> <strong>2. People negotiated fairly.</strong> Average performers were more likely to accept the minimum raise offered to them, often citing the raise as fair based on their performance. As one person stated, “Considering I only met expectations throughout the year rather than exceeded them, asking for a higher raise seems fruitless and unearned.” Generally, average performers rarely asked for the maximum raise, in part because they considered the fact that they were performing at a lower level than some peers. This was true, though, only when they had all of the information. When they were told nothing about their performance, 85% of people requested the maximum pay amount. Lacking performance information, average performers asked for the highest raises available within the pay range.</p><p> <strong>3. Women <em>do</em> ask for higher pay.</strong> Counter to a pervasive assumption, women didn&#39;t seem to need much encouragement to negotiate. In fact, when the percentage of participants who negotiated is considered, women were often more likely than men to negotiate (though this was not a statistically significant difference). These findings cast some doubt on the idea that one reason for the gender wage gap is that women negotiate less often than their male counterparts. Recent research combining information from dozens of negotiation studies has come to the same conclusion: Many of the negotiation gaps between men and women have largely disappeared in recent years. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> Although this is good news, it does little to close the gender pay gap as it currently stands.</p><p> <strong>4. People were motivated to perform better.</strong> Average performers expressed motivation to work harder and perform better to earn a higher raise during the next review cycle. When asked why they did not negotiate for more money, one participant stated, “My numbers did not show that I deserved a higher raise. With better numbers the following year, a case would be made for a higher raise.” Another stated, “I knew I&#39;d done an average job, so I hope to do better in the future and hope to get a better raise next year.”</p><p> Our findings replicate and extend an old but powerful notion in management research: the <em>fair process effect</em> . <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> Employees will accept unfavorable outcomes if they believe those outcomes were produced by a fair system. Put differently, if people know <em>why</em> they are being paid less (in other words, there is procedural transparency), they will not respond negatively and might even work harder.</p><h3> Make Pay Transparency a Win-Win for Your Organization</h3><p> Pay transparency can be a win-win opportunity rather than a compliance hurdle. But simply listing pay data in job postings without any context in response to regulations might be a big mistake. These practices not only disregard the spirit of the laws but also come at a heavy price and forfeit significant opportunities.领导者的思考应该超越合规性，并考虑如何战略性地利用组织的薪酬透明度，以提高申请人的吸引力和员工的保留率。 Our research offers some insights into how this can be done.</p><p> <strong>Make pay only <em>part</em> of the transparency equation.</strong> Counter to some pervasive fears that transparency will increase labor costs, cause jealousy, and create conflict, the reality is that secrecy around pay creates problems of its own. As researchers at Payscale found, most employees are <a href="https://www.payscale.com/content/whitepaper/Fair-pay-perception-and-pay-transparency-combat-turnover.pdf">unsure whether they are paid fairly</a> , with many believing they are underpaid when they are not, which leads to greater turnover and dissatisfaction. Our research suggests that without a reference point for performance, employees have little to no basis for judging what compensation would be fair and are therefore more likely to make unreasonable requests. Transparency in both performance <em>and</em> pay can enable employees to better assess the fairness of their pay and make more reasonable requests.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Focus on the pay decision-making process.</strong> Procedural transparency helps managers more clearly communicate with employees about pay because salaries/bonuses are based on performance rather than on seemingly intangible or, worse yet, bias-laden factors. Providing information on how pay is determined helps incumbent employees understand why their pay is higher or lower than their peers&#39; and, more importantly, how to move up. Managers can&#39;t be accused of favoritism and bias when pay is directly determined by performance, which puts them in a collaborative role during pay conversations. With a focus on performance, these conversations can focus on development and examine how employees can perform better and earn higher raises.</p><p> <strong>Recognize that (distributive) pay transparency will not fix inequity on its own.</strong> There&#39;s an assumption that distributive pay transparency will close pay gaps; however, evidence suggests that this alone is not enough to create an equitable workplace. Research has shown that women and men are <em>asking</em> for salary increases in <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/06/research-women-ask-for-raises-as-often-as-men-but-are-less-likely-to-get-them">relatively equal proportions</a> , but women are still less successful at getting what they ask for. Distributive pay transparency can help reduce some ambiguity, but both performance and pay transparency (procedural transparency) together equip employees with the tools they need to ask for what they deserve. When people know what to expect from negotiations (that is, what the bargaining zone is and what&#39;s reasonable to ask for), gender differences are minimized. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> For example, <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/01/negotiating-as-a-woman-of-color">women of color</a> don&#39;t often take advantage of opportunities to negotiate roles, responsibilities, or flexible work arrangements, creating long-term inequities that explain pay gaps beyond starting salary. Broader transparency helps reduce the ambiguity that often leaves women and members of other minority populations hesitant to negotiate, even when they know they could.</p><p> <strong>Consider the benefits for current employees <em>and</em> applicants.</strong> Simply posting pay ranges is only one piece of the puzzle. Applicants have negative reactions to excessively wide pay ranges because they don&#39;t offer useful information. In this case, pay is still essentially secret. As we found in our study, without meaningful information, individuals are inclined to ask for the maximum amount to see what is possible. This creates yet another headache for hiring managers. A better approach would be to leverage procedural transparency to clearly outline the factors used when determining a salary offer, and perhaps even how heavily those factors are weighted. For example, Buffer, a marketing company, has done a great job of creating a <a href="https://buffer.com/salaries?ref=buffer.com">pay system</a> that balances simplicity (for better understanding) and complexity (for capturing nuance) by using a standard formula for making pay decisions: salary = job type x seniority x experience + location + $10,000 or equity.</p><p></p><p></p><p> Despite organizational concerns and hesitancy to implement government regulations around pay transparency, such policies continue to gain traction and are just one force behind growing expectations around salary disclosures. In a 2022 report from HR technology firm Visier, 79% of surveyed employees said they want <a href="https://www.visier.com/company/news/visier-report-pay-transparency/">pay transparency</a> ; Gen Z employees were the strongest proponents of it.</p><p> Our research highlights the potential for procedural transparency to strategically mitigate the perceived organizational risks while also meeting legal requirements and social expectations. While changes are clearly happening, we hope business leaders think more deeply and creatively about <em>how</em> to make pay transparent in ways that both support organizational goals and meet employee needs.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/why-pay-transparency-regulations-are-a-strategic-management-opportunity/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Delicate Dynamics of Challenging a Superior</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-delicate-dynamics-of-challenging-a-superior/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-delicate-dynamics-of-challenging-a-superior/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 11:00:45 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Benjamin Laker. <p>Benjamin Laker ( <a href="https://twitter.com/drbenlaker">@drbenlaker</a> ) is a professor of leadership at the University of Reading&#39;s Henley Business School.</p> ]]>;</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Communication]]></category><category><![CDATA[Conflict Resolution]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership Skills]]></category><category><![CDATA[Skills & Learning]]></category><description><![CDATA[Carolyn Geason-Beissel/MIT SMR &#124; Getty Images The act of challenging a superior necessitates more than just raising one’s voice; it involves understanding, navigating, and engaging in the subtle yet complex dance of power dynamics, diplomacy, and mutual respect.

It can be enticing to address every single discrepancy or divergence in opinion that one encounters, but wisdom lies in discerning which battles are worth fighting. Every time a potential disagreement arises, consider: Is this issue so significant that it warrants a confrontation? Minor differences in opinion might be addressed more effectively through passive channels or should even be overlooked. But larger concerns, especially those affecting team dynamics, company culture, or broader business objectives, require a more direct approach.</p><p> <strong>Understand the importance of timing.</strong> In the world of professional communication, timing can be everything. Choosing the right moment can make the difference between a concern being genuinely considered or hastily dismissed. Before even considering challenging a superior, it&#39;s crucial to pause and assess the situation from a holistic viewpoint. Is your concern so immediate that it demands to be addressed immediately? Alternatively, would it be better to earmark it for a detailed, private discussion later? It&#39;s wise to avoid confronting superiors during high-pressure situations or public forums because it can be misconstrued as an attempt at disruption or showmanship. By choosing the optimal time, you create a smoother path for constructive dialogue.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Prioritize private discussions.</strong>您选择表达担忧的环境对于如何接受这些担忧起着关键作用。 Engaging in public disagreements or conflicts can lead to multiple unforeseen complications, including being perceived as aggressive or confrontational. By choosing a private setting for these discussions, you provide both yourself and your superior with an atmosphere conducive to open and genuine dialogue. This approach not only minimizes distractions and potential biases but also reinforces the idea that the intent is constructive feedback, not public criticism.</p><p> <strong>Master the art of “I” statements.</strong> Effective communication is as much about content as it is about delivery. The words we choose and the manner in which we frame our concerns can significantly influence the reception of our message. Instead of adopting a potentially confrontational tone, use “I” statements to express observations, feelings, and suggestions. For instance, instead of bluntly stating, “You&#39;ve overlooked this crucial aspect,” a more collaborative approach would be, “I feel that this particular aspect could benefit from further attention.” This approach ensures that the focus remains on the issue at hand and not on personal biases or confrontations.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Embrace the feedback process.</strong> The journey of challenging a superior or expressing concerns is inherently bilateral. It&#39;s not just an avenue for you to voice your thoughts but also an opportunity to understand the other person&#39;s perspective. Demonstrating a genuine openness to feedback, even if it&#39;s contradictory to your viewpoint, is vital. This approach not only paves the way for mutual respect but also fosters a culture of continuous learning and collaboration within the organization.</p><p> <strong>Align with like-minded peers, but tactfully.</strong> While individual concerns have their merit, there&#39;s undeniable strength in numbers. Finding allies or colleagues who share your perspective can provide additional weight to your concerns. However, it&#39;s imperative that this alignment is not perceived as cliquey or divisive. The primary focus should always remain on the collective benefit of the organization rather than on forming factions within the team.</p><p> <strong>Keep the organization&#39;s goals at the forefront.</strong> Any concerns or challenges you raise should inherently resonate with the broader objectives and goals of the organization. By consistently aligning your feedback and suggestions with the company&#39;s mission and values, you reassure your superiors of your commitment to the collective success of the organization over your individual aspirations.</p><p> <strong>Brace for a spectrum of outcomes.</strong> While we all hope for positive and constructive outcomes from our disagreements, it&#39;s essential to be prepared for a variety of reactions. Your superior might be receptive, indifferent, or even defensive.通过预测这些潜在的反应并相应地规划您的策略，您可以确保无论即时反馈如何，您都保持平衡、建设性和专业。</p><h3> The Aftermath: Reflect, Adapt, and Evolve</h3><p></p><p> Every professional interaction, especially those involving challenges or confrontations, provides a rich opportunity for personal and professional growth. After the discussion, take the time to evaluate the effectiveness of the conversation, the strategies employed, and the outcomes achieved. These reflections will bring invaluable lessons to light and help you to continuously refine and enhance your communication skills for future challenges.</p><p> Ultimately, while the task of challenging a superior might seem steeped in potential pitfalls, with the right strategies and a focus on mutual growth and respect, it can be navigated with tact and professionalism. Encouraging open dialogue and a culture of feedback is the bedrock of innovative and forward-thinking organizations.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-delicate-dynamics-of-challenging-a-superior/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>幽灵情景如何困扰战略执行</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-ghost-scenarios-haunt-strategy-execution/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-ghost-scenarios-haunt-strategy-execution/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 11:00:13 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Trudi Lang and Rafael Ramírez. <p>Trudi Lang is a senior fellow in management practice at the University of Oxford&#39;s Saïd Business School and director of the Oxford Collaborative Strategy Lab.

They focus almost exclusively on possible courses of action and pay little attention to the future socioeconomic and environmental context in which those actions will play out. During our combined 70 years of research, practice, and teaching, we, as well as others, have observed that business leaders are inclined, and their organizations configured, to work with only a single implicit view of the future. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> That view is typically deeply embedded within their strategies as a set of unquestioned assumptions about the future context. We call these sets of unexamined assumptions <em>ghost scenarios</em> because they are invisible — and because they may come back to haunt executives and companies in unanticipated and unwelcome ways.</p><p></p><p> Underpinning every ghost scenario is a small set of implicit trends that leaders project into the future without questioning whether they might change. Consider the ways in which dramatic changes in climate have come to haunt rail services in Britain. In July 2022, temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) were recorded in the country for the first time. These high temperatures heated the rails to slightly over 62 C (143 F), causing them to bend. As a result, many train trips were canceled and service on other routes slowed to 60 mph. The rail tracks had been engineered for a future in which the air temperature did not exceed 27 C (80 F). In short, the British rail network was designed and built to work not in the scenario in which it found itself in 2022 but in a scenario that made the implicit assumption that historical climate trends would continue unchanged.</p><h3> Assumptions Hide in Plain Sight</h3><p> Research on human perception has demonstrated that people differentiate the object of their visual focus from its background by bringing that object to the forefront of their attention while everything else recedes. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> Humans can focus on either the figure or the background but never both at the same time.</p><p> The <a href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Rubin_vase">Rubin vase illusion</a> is a well-known example of this figure-ground (or background) perception challenge. Depending on how you look at the picture, you will see either a vase or two faces in profile. Importantly, however, you cannot see both at the same time: One or the other perceptually recedes to become the background of the figure you see. To see both figures, you must alternate between them.</p><p> It&#39;s important that executives are able to recognize how people&#39;s ability to focus can also blind them to important contextual information, since leaders often fail to see the background upon which their strategies will play out — and on which their strategies depend. They may consider hard infrastructure — such as rail tracks — to be a relatively static background issue and focus their attention on trends that seem more salient to business planning, such as changes in customer preferences and habits. But that can lead executives to implement a strategy that may be unexpectedly disrupted by the unexamined assumptions about its context that are woven through its background issues.</p><p></p><p> Particularly today, given the fast pace of change, soaring uncertainty, and high levels of turbulence, failing to surface the assumptions built into strategic planning is risky, as is a failure to consider multiple possible alternative futures through <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/using-scenario-planning-to-reshape-strategy/">scenario planning</a> . <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> Scenario planning exercises can help executives explore how their strategies might play out in different business contexts and conditions, with an eye toward honing those strategies to be more effective.</p><p> To understand how scenario planning can keep executives from being haunted by a ghost scenario, let&#39;s look at two global organizations we recently worked with in the Oxford Scenarios Programme. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><h3> AXA Examines Its ESG Assumptions</h3><p> Insurance company <a href="https://www.axa.com/en">AXA</a> serves 95 million clients in over 50 countries with products and services in the areas of property-casualty insurance, life insurance and savings, and asset management. One of the company&#39;s key strategic goals is to sustain its climate leadership position. Wisely, executives from AXA decided to make the future context of that goal the focus of their attention for a limited period of time so that they could explore how it might change and how they might need to adapt if it did.</p><p> The company was particularly interested in understanding how future environmental, social, and governance (ESG) trends might affect its stated goal. For example, what might be the impact of some US states&#39; proposed legislation that would penalize financial institutions pursuing ESG investment strategies? Or, how might the public react if companies are seen as greenwashing or misrepresenting their ESG credentials? Thus, instead of letting ESG requirements, as currently understood, be the ghost scenario, the company asked questions about the future of ESG and, more broadly, about the emerging sustainability context for corporations.</p><p> Participants and facilitators in the scenario-planning exercise worked in teams to look at the future environment. One scenario imagined that stand-alone insurance companies had been swallowed up by dominant tech platforms whose own ESG priorities superseded those of the insurers.在另一种情况下，政府制定了有关 ESG 问题的严格法规，这对公司的战略选择具有合规性影响。 In yet another imagined future, climate change accelerated more than expected, causing businesses to shift their priorities to urgently address climate-related crises — or to focus exclusively on reducing CO2 emissions, abandoning social and governance agendas.</p><p> By explicitly engaging with the ghost scenario and its equally plausible alternatives, AXA came to understand that continuing to strive to deliver superior ESG performance as it is currently understood might not be the only future it should be preparing for. Within AXA, these insights have been used to inform a conversation about future ESG challenges and their implications for possible announcements and commitments to be made, including when and with whom. They&#39;ve prompted AXA to start preparing alternative strategies in the event that delivering great performance against current ESG expectations becomes irrelevant.</p><p></p><h3> Swift Anticipates Digital Currencies</h3><p> Swift（全球银行间金融电信协会）是一家会员制合作社，为全球跨境支付提供金融消息传递和相关服务。 It currently delivers over 30 million messages a day for more than 11,000 institutions in over 200 countries and territories. It was created in the early 1970s by 239 banks in 15 countries to solve the growing problem of clunky, slow, and costly cross-border payments communications via a new technology platform. With disruption as part of its origin story, Swift is proactive about potential changes in its context.</p><p> In 2021, Swift executives were interested in understanding how digital currencies, including those issued by central banks, might evolve in the years ahead. The category more than doubled in 2021, to more than 9,000 cryptocurrencies.</p><p> Rather than assuming this unfolding and rapid growth in digital currencies to be the only possible scenario, executives at Swift paused to better understand what other developments might occur, how they might shape the future digital currency ecosystem, and how Swift might be affected. For example, economists and other experts have pointed to the lack of intrinsic value of many digital currencies, as well as concerns about <a href="https://concerned.tech/">the security and reliability of their underlying technologies</a> .</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Where the Ghosts Hide in Common Strategic Planning Processes</h4><p> <strong>In a SWOT analysis,</strong> leaders consider their organization&#39;s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in relation to only the current scenario and to known competitors, suppliers, customers, regulatory rules, and the like. When identifying and analyzing risks, executives implicitly assume that there is only one scenario. However, in another context (a different scenario), risks might evaporate and new opportunities might arise.</p><p> <strong>In stakeholder mapping,</strong> leaders make an assessment about the attention and power of stakeholders now and in one expected future. An implicit scenario is the background to this assessment. But the importance of stakeholders could change significantly if the context unexpectedly changes.</p><p> <strong>In game theory and war-gaming,</strong> competitors&#39; moves are considered within the context of a ghost scenario, and war games are typically conducted with no consideration of a different future other than the one that is underway. However, changing scenarios could require new tactics and surface unforeseen future combatants.<br /></article></aside></div><p> Swift&#39;s own stance on digital currencies was open and neutral. It would potentially support them if they were properly regulated and added value to the economies, businesses, and communities it served.</p><p> The scenarios developed for Swift&#39;s executives explored different ways in which trust in the technology might evolve. In some of them, trust associated with digital currencies would disappear as the opaque technology and algorithms upon which they are based became suspect. In other scenarios, digital currencies could be manipulated, and thus the authenticity of what was being exchanged could no longer be guaranteed. And in another scenario, a more generalized lack of trust in for-profit financial institutions would spread to providers of digital currencies, leading some segments of society to hesitate to engage with either, with related consequences.</p><p> For the Oxford participants envisioning these scenarios, it was not clear that the values held by those promoting the technology, or the values that the technology supposedly enabled, would be accepted by governmental regulators or by those in society at large in all imaginable future contexts. Swift&#39;s executives have since explored those sets of scenarios, which provided rich and divergent insights about the ways digital currencies might pan out. Those insights have helped them avoid relying on overly simplistic views of the future — and being swayed by hype.</p><h3> How to See a Ghost Before It Haunts You</h3><p> Based on our experience leading scenario planning exercises for AXA, Swift, and many other organizations, we have developed the following suggestions for executives who want to bring their ghost scenarios into view and make the figure-ground reversal a key part of their strategy practice.</p><p> <strong>Use scenario planning to acknowledge implicit assumptions.</strong> Recognize that every organization&#39;s strategy presumes a future scenario that often remains unquestioned. That is, every executive engages in a form of implicit scenario planning, whether they are conscious of it or not. Making scenario planning a regular part of the strategy-making process achieves two important goals: It alerts leaders to how turbulent conditions could change the context within which they work and compete, and it acknowledges the reality that current conditions themselves present a hypothetical future scenario, not a fixed reality.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Recognize the figure-ground dilemma.</strong> Acknowledge that the figure that is attended to (most often, the organization&#39;s strategy) and the background that is so often ignored (the unexamined ghost scenario) cannot successfully be the focus of attention at the same time. Instead, executives need to flexibly and sequentially shift between the two to investigate each fully and avoid the trap of making implicit assumptions about the other. AXA 花时间刻意探索 ESG 的未来，而不是假设目前的使用和理解方式不会发生变化。 Swift purposefully focused on understanding the potential future contexts of digital currencies rather than just implicitly assuming subsequent options from the existing trends.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Dedicate executive time and resources to the problem.</strong> Organizations must intentionally create a time and space for leaders to explore how relevant economic, political, technological, social, and environmental factors might be changing. Contrast a small set of future scenarios with the ghost scenario to pinpoint where current strategy might need to be adapted to be well positioned for the range of ways the context might develop. Some organizations even have dedicated units, such as the <a href="https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/what-are-scenarios/meet-the-shell-scenarios-team.html#vanity-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2hlbGwuY29tL2VuZXJneS1hbmQtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi90aGUtZW5lcmd5LWZ1dHVyZS9zY2VuYXJpb3MvbWVldC10aGUtc2hlbGwtc2NlbmFyaW9zLXRlYW0uaHRtbA">Global Business Environment scenarios team</a> at Shell International. <a href="https://horizons.gc.ca/en/home/">Policy Horizons Canada</a> plays this role for the Canadian government.</p><p></p><p> For all of these efforts to be truly useful, scenario planning outputs must be fed back into strategic decision-making rather than written up in a report and placed on a shelf. They should also be disseminated more widely in an organization so that people at all levels and functions can consider possible implications from their own perspective — implications that might not occur to leadership. For a strategy to be successful when the context changes, executives need to have a balanced approach — recognizing both figure and ground as important areas for discernment. That is, they must recognize the importance of the background or ground upon which their actions will play out, even as they plan their next move. Savvy executives know that they must both envision and embrace change. The trick is learning to adeptly shift one&#39;s attention between the figure and the ground to see how the context might unfold, so it doesn&#39;t leave your strategy ungrounded.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-ghost-scenarios-haunt-strategy-execution/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>用人工智能推动跨学科创新：沃尔沃的 Anders Sjögren</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/fueling-interdisciplinary-innovation-with-ai-volvos-anders-sjogren/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/fueling-interdisciplinary-innovation-with-ai-volvos-anders-sjogren/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 11:00:37 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. <p>Sam Ransbotham ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ransbotham">@ransbotham</a> ) is a professor in the information systems department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College, as well as guest editor for <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> &#39;s Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy Big Ideas initiative.

Or is it also customer acquisition and dealer networks and all kinds of data analytics to run a business of making and selling cars?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Yes. So, I mean, all of those apply to Volvo Cars, but the part I&#39;m really active in is more in the part of the making of the car.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I think that&#39;s a great point because when most people think about cars and artificial intelligence, I think they immediately jump to this idea of fully self-driving cars. And what you&#39;re pointing out is how much other stuff that there is going on, even in the production of cars, that can benefit from artificial intelligence. You know, I think perhaps everyone&#39;s frustrated that we don&#39;t have fully automated cars now, but there&#39;s so much going on behind the scenes that people don&#39;t get a chance to see. What are some of the examples of the ways that you&#39;re using artificial intelligence in the production process?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> If we take a little bit of a step back, the goal of Volvo Cars is really to give people the freedom to move in a personal and sustainable and a safe way.</p><p> If we start with “personal,” then it&#39;s really critical that we understand you and make you feel special as a customer or as someone in the car. And there, of course, it has to do with starting with the sensors and then really interpreting those values. That can be cameras, different types of steering input …</p><p> Another area is definitely sustainability. AI is being used there to make sure that we have as many lightweight parts as possible. So using AI, one can, for example, get mechanical parts with the same strength and those kind of properties, but with much lower weight and less material that&#39;s being used.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> In the design process, you&#39;re talking about, right? As engineers consider all the different permutations of parts, yeah?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> In the design process — yes, exactly. That&#39;s really the essence of AI, I think, in lots of engineering activities, is that we go from manually deciding first what we want to do, but then actually performing all the different steps. That&#39;s the current way of doing it, while in the AI era, it&#39;s much more about deciding and describing what are the aspects I want to reach to? What are things I want optimized, and what are maybe the boundary conditions? And then the AI helps you get there.</p><p> So in the context of the mechanical parts, you might say, “These are the attachment points. These are the strength and stiffness properties I want. Give me the part with those properties but [make it] as light as possible and also, of course, possible to produce.”</p><p> That could be one area. And also, it is super important for sustainability that we use as little material as possible and also have as low a rate as possible.</p><p> And then, of course, the third point was about [safety]. And, of course, we have autonomous cars, but also, even before that, there are other types of functionality being used. For example, understanding the driver: Is the driver aware or not? Should we maybe nudge him to take a cup of coffee or something if he seems to be tired?</p><p> In the later versions of our cars, we understand if there are some pets or children left in the car, maybe on a hot day, and then preventing them [from getting] hurt in such a situation and so on.</p><p> I&#39;d say that those are some of the areas where AI can really be a core technology in bringing us toward our purpose.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That&#39;s really interesting because lots of times organizations tell us they start with a problem they&#39;re trying to solve and then find a technology to solve it, and that makes sense, because otherwise you&#39;re trying to find a problem to fit a solution, which seems backward. You mentioned that your cars can sense … if a person or a pet is accidentally left in the car. How did Volvo make the decision to focus on that particular problem to solve?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> A lot of what we do is really created by real-world safety in that we actually see what are the actual causes of people getting injured. I mean, if we take the analogy with crashes and that type of safety, we have teams that go out to sites when there has been a crash to really see what actually happened in reality and not just on certification [from] that type of crash test and so on.</p><p> And, going back to this example, if we look here, pets and kids do get hurt — hopefully not in a Volvo car, but that&#39;s reality, right?</p><p> But what you mentioned there is really super interesting because then it also goes the other way around: Like, now that we have these sensors, what are the other really valuable functionalities that we can provide our customers with through this, of course, taking privacy into account and so on?</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> This is quite intriguing because Volvo … I remember as a child that my uncle used to say, “You want a safe car, you get a Volvo.” And it&#39;s always been synonymous with safety, and it&#39;s really amazing to step back and think about ... for a company who has put one of its main goals for safe experience, now, with the availability of this amount of data and all of this massive amount of processing, I could imagine there are so many use cases that, to Sam&#39;s point, are being thought about. So that&#39;s really, really encouraging.</p><p> What [does] the road map here look like? I mean, is this a constant sort of innovation ideation approach going on to say, “What else could we do in these three pillars of personal, safe, and sustainable?” What is the process for coming up with these ideas and picking up the good ones and pursuing them or not?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> I think that those ideas can either come from the technology side and be really inspired by that, or it could come from the analytics side. And often it&#39;s when the new technology and the really customer-centric needs … where they meet, and also, of course, where we have the agility in the organization to execute on it. That&#39;s really where we have something that&#39;s really fruitful. It&#39;s typically a mix of different sources of this: innovations and new directions, I would say.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And there&#39;s a mechanism to create this interdisciplinary inspiration in the company?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Yeah, I would say so. I would say that there are both formal mechanisms but also informal mechanisms. [As] a car company, Volvo Cars is not super big. Of course there are also smaller ones, but I think it&#39;s also an advantage that, I mean, pretty much all the different steps, from product strategy, design, the R&amp;D, engineering, and then the later stages …</p><p> The headquarters is in Gothenburg [in Sweden], within walking distance. The US department is literally 50 meters from where I&#39;m sitting right now, while 50 meters in the other direction, there are the crash test facilities and the safety center.</p><p> So, what I want to say with that is that it&#39;s more easy to get connections and to create this kind of — how should I put it? — informal innovation activities.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> This is where relatively smaller size and colocation really, really helps. To have teams that close to each other.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> It&#39;s funny to talk about it being small, because it&#39;s certainly not a small company.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Everything&#39;s relative, yeah.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Everything&#39;s relative, I guess. As we&#39;re chatting, I&#39;m thinking about some of the people we&#39;ve talked to before, and one of the recurring themes that people have mentioned is, oh, this idea [of] starting with a business problem: “You don&#39;t have AI and find a place to use it. You start with a business problem and then solve it.” But this is kind of a nice mix on that — that it sounds like there&#39;s a lot that starts with a business problem, but then, interestingly, once these processes are in place, and once these technologies are in place, then there becomes a grassroots innovation to say, “All right; how can we use that?” And that&#39;s an interesting perspective that, I think, hasn&#39;t come through strongly — or maybe I&#39;m forgetting something — but it seems like that hasn&#39;t come through as strongly. This is a nice mix of that, that maybe works in this size organization … this colocated organization.</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Yeah, and not least in the prototyping and ideation stages. But, then, of course, before it actually goes into the product, it needs to go through a more thorough review and so on.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> There&#39;s been quite a few investments and acquisitions of smaller AI startups and firms by Volvo. Tell us a bit about the overall ecosystem of internal and vendor and partner companies that come together to bring to life some of these AI-enabled ideas that you&#39;re talking about. Is it internal? Is it external? Is it a mix? How do you think about the ecosystem?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> I would definitely say that it&#39;s a mix. Some of the things … we need to do it ourselves to get the full understanding or where we really want to be in the forefront, and [in] some other areas, we definitely want to partner with other companies that are strong in those areas. Traditionally speaking, a car is a super complex product. It has hundreds or thousands of different parts that all need to come together. And, of course, it is a space where there is traditionally a lot of suppliers supplying different parts.</p><p> Lately, we are moving more toward bringing software implementation in-house to increase the speed and agility in the development process.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That seems particularly complicated in auto manufacturing because if I think about how cars got started, they were independent systems. There was a braking system, and a power train system, and an air conditioner, and an infotainment system, and all these were separate. And that&#39;s kind of nice because then we have a certain, different standard than we would have for the infotainment system than we would have for the braking system — or at least I hope that there would be. But what you&#39;re pointing out is, each one of these may be using sensors that come from a different area, and how the whole car has become more complicated independently, but it&#39;s also become more complicated cohesively, trying to connect all these parts and have them work together.</p><p> And that seems, on the one hand, an opportunity for artificial intelligence but, at the same time, a challenge.</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Yeah. It&#39;s 100% true. It&#39;s both a really big opportunity, but that also means that&#39;s really one of the core challenges — I mean, how to build the cohesive understanding of both the inside and the outside of the car.</p><p> We speak about the customer digital twin and vehicle digital twin and so on, and in some sense, those aspects can mean a lot of different things. But, of course, these different systems that you speak about, they are traditionally in different parts of the company, so that also means that there is a lot of cross-functional collaboration that is needed. But we really need to bridge those kind of organizational borders.</p><p>我认为这确实是关键点之一，也就是说，为了成功采用分析和人工智能，这确实意味着公司的不同部门需要共同努力才能实现这一目标。 Because otherwise, it will just become a silo. Some people will not really have the benefits of it.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> You know, it&#39;s very true. It&#39;s a common theme, and in our work at BCG, we have this rule of thumb — the 10:20:70 — where we say 10% is the data and algorithms, and 20% is the technology and the digital platform, but 70% of it is the business integration and implementation and bringing different parts of the organization together. This, perhaps, is nowhere more true than at a car company, where you have, as you said, Sam, seemingly disparate systems that are coming together to create a bigger system, but each one of these units has been perfected individually, and now you want the collective perfection as well.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Anders, we talked a lot about Volvo. How did you personally get interested in artificial intelligence, in data, in technology and analytics? What&#39;s your origin story?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> I think I&#39;ve always been interested in computers. My father was really an addict, so I kind of grew up with that.</p><p> I started out as an engineering student [and got a] master&#39;s in computer science. And then I started off as a research engineer in the medical area, at the university hospital in Gothenburg, then found out fairly quickly that in order to really make use of data — conclusions and so on come from data … so I then went into the area of mathematical statistics.</p><p> So I did a Ph.D. in that, then went back to software product development. After some time, I went back to academia for a couple of years, did a postdoc, and then was offered a good opportunity at Volvo Cars. So I&#39;ve essentially been here for seven years now. That&#39;s a bit of my history.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Quite inspiring.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Anders, we also want to ask you a few rapid-fire questions, and the idea is just to answer it as quickly as you can. These are not particularly Volvo questions.</p><p> What have you been proudest of that you&#39;ve done with artificial intelligence?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> The problem is that most of the things, I can&#39;t speak about.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That&#39;s a great answer too.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> You have to wait and see. OK, well, what worries you about artificial intelligence?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> The worries?</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Oh, I think, of course, one is the longer term — the kind of singularity things. But I think a bit closer to now, so to speak, we definitely see that this super-fast progression of large language [models] and what they can do, and also the kind of systems that don&#39;t just take one problem and give one answer but can really produce a series of steps, in sequence. And that is a super-powerful technology, but a super-powerful technology can be used both for good and for bad.</p><p> That&#39;s both something that makes me super excited but also a little bit worried. 20年后的世界会是什么样子？</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your favorite activity that does not involve technology?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Motorcycling, but obviously using technology. But it&#39;s more of a … yeah.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Technology&#39;s involved. Everything&#39;s involved in technology in some way.</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Yeah, pretty much.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s the first career you wanted when you were a kid? What did you want to be when you grew up?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Medical doctor.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Well, that ties with your first career in working in the medical company, then.</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Yeah, I think so, but then I found mathematics and those things to be super exciting, so I went into that area.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your greatest wish for artificial intelligence in the future? What do you hope that we can gain from the advent of these technologies?</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> If we say the greatest wish, I think it is that we find a way to use it in a way for our common good. We need to find a way to integrate it into society, and I think that that is really my biggest wish for it.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> In a relatively short time, we learned so much about various uses of data, AI, and technology, in just what it takes to build a car in new ways, and all the different ways that AI and tech are helping and serving the people who are driving them. It&#39;s been really enlightening, Anders. Thank you for joining.</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren:</strong> Thanks for having me.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Thanks for listening.

Such resistance to an organizational policy, directive, or decision can take many forms, ranging from voicing concerns and raising questions to active opposition and sabotage. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p> Effective leaders think of pushback as an opportunity to boost their team&#39;s learning while moving their organization forward. The objective should be to increase people&#39;s understanding and build support by tempering both advocate enthusiasm and contrarian pessimism. This deeper level of understanding, while not necessarily satisfying to all in the moment, fosters a climate of candor, humility, adaptation, and trust, thereby subtly steering pushback away from latent disruptive tendencies.</p><p></p><p> Drawing on decades of research, C-suite observations, and interviews, we&#39;ve identified the major mistakes leaders make when encountering pushback and offer five guidelines to help them better respond.</p><h3> What Doesn&#39;t Work</h3><p> Leaders make three primary mistakes when facing ambivalence, disagreement, or resistance:</p><p> <strong>Suppressing uncertainty.</strong> Pushback increases uncertainty when questions are raised that might not have immediate answers or perspectives are introduced that might have recently emerged or been sidelined or overlooked. Some leaders respond to uncertainty-induced pushback by marginalizing concerns, offering placating assurances, or invoking authoritarian voices. Such practices offer false certainty that undermines trust in the long term.</p><p> According to our research, even employees who seek more certainty in their work lives want their organizations to embrace uncertainty. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> Effective leaders avoid the temptation to paper over uncertainty, even when they face demands for a level of certainty that simply doesn&#39;t exist. Even if they don&#39;t know the answers now, they can provide an operating level of certainty by discussing how they will find those answers.</p><p> <strong>Ignoring power dynamics.</strong> Leaders with positional or acquired status directly or subtly influence the nature of the pushback. Highly authoritarian power structures tend to drive pushback underground. Likewise, more subtle power signals can suppress open discussion of legitimate concerns. Leaders might then wrongly equate silence with agreement. Some people will feign acceptance while others sow dissent in the “meeting after the meeting,” thereby revealing and often amplifying people&#39;s fears.</p><p></p><p> We had an opportunity to observe one seasoned executive group&#39;s reaction — which consisted of tepid and token feedback — when their CEO proposed a new initiative. The CEO, sensing a lack of candor, probed for more input. One frustrated executive eventually blurted out, “We don&#39;t share our thoughts on this issue because you are going to do what you are going to do, regardless of what we say.” This remarkably candid comment suggested a deeper challenge: How do powerful people with strong views on particular issues encourage candor? Effective leaders take active steps to mitigate disruptive dialogue — discussed below — because they recognize that inherent power dynamics greatly influence the quality of any discussion.</p><p> <strong>Assuming that the loudest voices represent a consensus.</strong> Pushback takes many forms: Some of them are obvious, like complaints or employee petitions, while others are more subtle, like queries in meetings or a lack of engagement. Leaders are often tempted to pay more attention to the most vocal employees, assuming the people with the biggest megaphones represent majority opinion. They may or may not.</p><p> When the loudest or most politically powerful voices dominate the discussion, such dynamics often create an inaccurate impression of the level of support or divisiveness.有效的领导者认识到两种极端的危险：狂热者掩盖相关问题，或者逆向者破坏潜在的支持。</p><p></p><h3>参与抵制的建议</h3><p>有效的领导者不仅避免压制不确定性，忽视权力动态，并假设最直言不讳的人代表共识，他们还采取反映以下指导方针的积极对策。</p><p> <strong>1. 设定对话的基本规则。</strong>以下基本规则可以提高期望，缓和不尊重的宣传，并增加每个人抵制机会的价值：</p><ul><li><strong>寻求理解您不同意的观点。</strong>在讨论有争议的问题时，许多人的第一本能是立即反驳或反驳。通过表现出接受不同观点的意愿来抵制这种诱惑。提出问题或重新表述别人的论点（尤其是那些你不同意的论点）等简单的策略可以缓和反驳，并且几乎神奇地增强对话语气。同样，诸如“告诉我我的想法可能是错误的”或“我可能错过了一些东西；我可能错过了一些东西”之类的陈述。请说更多”表明对新想法持开放态度。</li><li><strong>尊重地不同意别人的观点。</strong>用诸如“让我提供另一个观点”之类的语言尊重地表达分歧，可以设定正确的讨论基调，同时也鼓励那些比较犹豫的人大声说出来。不愿分享不同观点通常表明存在潜在的信任缺陷。有时，尽管房间里存在固有的权力差异，领导者仍需要鼓励其他人分享他们的担忧。</li><li><strong>避免两极分化、扎根的断言。</strong>过于确定地倡导很可能会引发权力动态问题。表明概率水平，例如“我对这个事实有 95% 的把握”，通常会引发更激烈的辩论。</li><li><strong>消除阻力的个性化。</strong>如果一项决定被贴上“首席执行官计划”的标签，许多人会进行自我审查，并因为害怕冒犯当权者而避免提出担忧。通过在白板上记录问题而不进行归因来消除个性化的阻力，可以减轻这种权力动态，同时缓和强烈的情绪。</li><li><strong>随着讨论的进展改变你的观点和反应。</strong>经常需要提醒员工，在考虑新证据或获得新观点后改变观点并不是软弱的表现。没有人应该担心因为改变观点而丢脸。事实上，有效的领导者会在他们的观点发生转变时通过发表诸如“我看到一个不在我的雷达屏幕上的问题”之类的声明来强调。随着对话的出现，重新构建关键问题以强调新的观点。</li></ul><p> <strong>2. 引导团队了解阻力机会。</strong>许多会议或倡议的推出都以问答期结束，而没有首先向与会者提供有关阻力的期望的方向。由于缺乏清晰度，人们常常会做出各种未经检验和未言明的假设，这些假设可能并不准确。</p><p>一些员工因抵制机会而被剥夺了权利，因为他们认为自己的所有想法都应该被完全接受。他们不期望发生合理的辩论或对<em>他们的</em>抵制进行反击。这就是为什么明智的领导者会仔细地引导员工了解可能的结果，而不是接受/拒绝极端的情况。他们提出了其他替代方案，例如调整计划、引入测试期、推迟实施、修改决定或重新考虑提案。</p><p></p><p> <strong>3. 选择正确的论坛和设置。</strong>有些场合，比如市政厅聚会或在线论坛，往往会鼓励更情绪化的观点表达、姿态和发泄。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a>这种情况可能会阻碍那些不太愿意进行情绪化争论的人进行有用的询问和提问。合适的场所和论坛可以最大限度地增加富有洞察力的提问、深思熟虑的讨论和相互尊重的辩论的机会。通常，配备适当讨论参数的小团体效果最好。同样，对较小群体的在线论坛进行适当监控可以鼓励更好的抵制动力。</p><p>领导者还需要注意，有些人不愿意在别人面前分享担忧，因为他们担心被视为团队合作能力差，或者他们对如何表达担忧或捍卫自己的观点缺乏信心。为了鼓励那些不太愿意发言的人，提前向他们提供会议的讨论要点并鼓励他们写下他们的担忧和疑问通常会有所帮助。</p><p> <strong>4.先教育后倡导。</strong>熟练的教育工作者很快就会放弃这样的想法：一个好的解释就足以建立理解。通常，他们会讨论得出结论的方法，包括相反的观点和现有的问题。这种方法将不确定性融入结论，为进一步讨论和相反观点腾出空间。</p><p>相比之下，倡导者很少讨论可能与他们坚定的观点相矛盾的证据或方法。当他们确实接受相反的观点时，他们常常会轻视或嘲笑这些观点。支持者可能会回避任何批评，淡化不确定性，并认为简短的解释会启发其他人。即使是聪明的高管也常常陷入这个陷阱，高估了他们教育工作的程度和深度。</p><p>在教育之后的某个时候，倡导可能会发挥作用，但最终，有效的领导者认为允许人们表达担忧会带来好处。短期来看，阻力可能会导致调整，从而提高长期接受度和顺利实施。</p><p> <strong>5.路标拐点。</strong>随着决策、举措和政策的发展，领导者对阻力的确定性和开放程度也会发生变化。在领导层对这些拐点缺乏明确说明的情况下，员工会采用有关抵制的潜规则，例如以下内容：</p><ul><li>规则A：如果领导还没有做出最终决定，那么我可以大声说出我的观点。</li><li>规则B：如果领导者有很强的立场或者已经做出了最终决定，那么我支持它或者闭嘴。</li><li>规则 C：如果我在一个问题上争论足够长的时间，领导者就会屈服。</li></ul><p>如果潜规则 A 和 B 强化了阻力动态，那么领导者可能会高估某项举措或决策的支持程度。为什么？因为按照规则 B 运作的员工认为反馈请求是为了剧院或旨在制造支持；他们进行自我审查或仅提出象征性的反对。结果，不同意见和潜在有价值的声音都消失了。</p><p></p><p>规则 C 恰恰相反，引发了无穷无尽的争论。这会在决策被调整、修改或最终确定后滋生抱怨文化。高效的领导者知道，开放并不意味着可以进行无休止的讨论。毕竟，反推反推可以永远持续下去。</p><p>阻止这些无声规则扎根的最佳方法是在抵制期间明确指出拐点。以开放之名掩饰自己情绪的领导人破坏了整个对话的坦诚。相反，有效的领导者会分享他们对调整拟议计划的开放程度，宣布他们的情绪何时发生变化，并明确表明抵制的时间何时结束。</p><h3>一个成功的反击故事</h3><p>Capital Credit Union 首席执行官劳里·布茨 (Laurie Butz) 经常使用这些指导方针来进行抵制，以充分了解员工认为随着新举措的推出，他们正在失去什么。例如，随着 COVID-19 威胁的消退，她试图重新启动面对面的全体员工会议，以增强包容性，并就悬而未决的举措进行更强有力、深思熟虑的讨论。她认为教育过程是双向的，这需要更多的面对面论坛，鼓励遵守比屏幕发泄更富有成效的讨论基本规则。</p><p>然而，这一消息遭到了员工的强烈抵制，因为他们需要长途跋涉才能参加一年两次的聚会。一些人通过在线调查表达了对费用和时间的担忧，而另一些人则直接向直接主管表达了不满，认为“Zoom 会议在新冠疫情期间效果很好”。</p><p>巴茨承认了这些担忧，同时恭敬地为现场聚会辩护，因为毕竟，“你可以举办一场 Zoom 婚礼，但会缺少一些重要的东西。”类似的信息在她的“大使”（意见领袖）的更个人渠道中得到了回应。</p><p></p><p>随着时间的推移，面对面的会议 (1) 提高了员工参与度，(2) 重新激发了员工参与流程的兴趣，(3) 引发了对关键问题更深入的讨论。定量证据支持了这些观察结果。例如，在恢复面对面会议后，全员调查的参与率从 60% 增加到 91%，83% 的调查受访者表示他们“高度投入工作”。轶事证据也出现了：员工在离开现场会议时经常询问，“我们什么时候还有机会像这样见面？”</p><p></p><p>通过抑制不确定性、引发权力动态以及过多关注最敢于表达的员工来抑制阻力，很可能会导致短期的顺从和服从，但代价是<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/decision-downloading/">破坏长期信任</a>。巧妙而尊重地管理阻力需要预先投入时间，让员工参与进来，同时提供前进的动力。好处是：领导者学会更巧妙地影响员工如何解释趋势、事件和决策，并对新出现的问题有更深入的洞察。</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ Five-ways-leaders-can-turn-pushback-into-progress/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> ChatGPT 如何帮助经理设计更好的工作角色？</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-chatgpt-can-and-cant-help-managers-design-better-job-roles/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-chatgpt-can-and-cant-help-managers-design-better-job-roles/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 11:00:54 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Fangfang Zhang and Sharon K.

Parker 创建的一个框架，它将高质量工作定义为具有<em>刺激性的</em>工作（具有任务多样性和发展新技能的机会的工作），并融合了<em>掌握</em>（例如角色清晰度和工作反馈） ，是<em>代理性的</em>（例如工作自主性和变革参与），是<em>关系性的</em>（可以获得社会支持和积极的团队合作），并且是<em>可容忍的</em>（具有可管理的工作时间和合理的时间压力水平）。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p>尽管设计良好的工作有很多好处，但设计​​不当的工作仍然普遍存在。根据盖洛普 2019 年优秀就业调查，只有 40% 的美国人从事具有 SMART 特征的工作。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a>另一方面，16% 的人发现自己的工作缺乏基本的 SMART 特征，44% 的人的工作只具备一些令人满意的 SMART 特征。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p>当今的管理者缺乏对工作设计的了解可能可以解释这一发现。我们最近进行的一项研究探讨了人们如何为他人设计工作。 <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a>在线模拟（模拟 1）的参与者被要求设计一个行政工作角色。半职工作全部由四项复印和归档任务组成。参与者被要求从 11 项任务列表中选择 4 项额外任务来全职完成这项工作，其中包括 5 项重复性复印和归档任务以及 6 项更有意义和有趣的任务，例如问候访客或帮助同事安排会议。</p><p></p><p> Participants were scored on a 0 to 4 range, with a higher score indicating the creation of a more stimulating work design. Almost half (45%) of university-level management students and professionals/managers working in human services industries tended to incorporate repetitive and monotonous work, demonstrating a knowledge gap when it comes to quality work design.</p><p> In a second simulation (Simulation 2), participants were asked to act like a manager and solve workforce problems in four scenarios. In each scenario, the job role design was clearly poor. To fix the problems, participants rated how likely they were to adopt strategies from a list that included both “fixing the worker” approaches, which attributed problems to the employee, and “fixing the poor work design” approaches, which acknowledged the poor-quality job design.</p><p> For example, in one scenario, a warehouse worker consistently failed to meet 50% of the timed deadlines in gathering products and delivering them to dispatch — despite frequently running to pick up goods. While the majority of participants focused on choices that improved the work design (for example, “Involve the employee and their colleagues in a review to identify ways in which their work could be organized better” or “Reorganize the work so that tasks do not need to be timed”), a surprising number of participants (40%) still chose strategies aimed at fixing the worker (such as “Discreetly observe the person&#39;s behavior to see how fast they are moving”). These findings validate our finding that there is a lack of knowledge of work design among managers and staff members.</p><h3> Generative AI Can Suggest Strong Work Design</h3><p> In the study&#39;s next phase, we researched whether an AI-powered tool such as ChatGPT could help managers do better. The short answer: ChatGPT has the potential to enhance decision-making in work design. However, it is important for managers to understand what ChatGPT can and cannot do well.</p><p> We used ChatGPT to make hypothetical work design decisions for the administrative work design simulation (Simulation 1). We ran the simulation task 20 times, using a new, independent chat session with the same prompt each time in ChatGPT. The generative AI model consistently chose enrichment tasks out of the provided list, outperforming both students and professionals/managers in creating interesting and meaningful work. ChatGPT&#39;s performance was similar to that of work design experts. </p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand-column"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Work Design Decision Scores in Different Groups</h4><p class="caption"> When participants in Simulation 1 were asked to design an administrative job role, 45% mostly chose to assign the worker repetitive and monotonous tasks (scored from 0 to 4 indicating the number of enriched tasks selected by the participants). When participants in Simulation 2 were asked to address problems in four poorly designed job roles, 40% chose strategies aimed at fixing the worker rather than the poor design (scored from 1 to 5 indicating the extent to which participants will adopt the strategies, 1=extremely unlikely, 5=extremely likely). </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023_1005_Parker_Fig1-1.png" alt="Work Design Decision Scores in Different Groups"></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p> We then tasked ChatGPT to tackle Simulation 2, addressing the four managerial workforce scenarios (including the theoretical warehouse worker mentioned above), choosing strategies from a list. In each scenario, ChatGPT consistently chose strategies aimed at fixing the work design (good strategies for employee well-being, motivation, and performance) over those focused on fixing the worker. As in Simulation 1, ChatGPT outperformed students, managers, and professionals in its focus on work design to solve the workforce problems.</p><p> However, ChatGPT did not score as well as the work design experts in Simulation 2, suggesting that some caution is warranted. For example, in one session addressing the warehouse worker who was missing deadlines, ChatGPT scored 4 overall but chose the strategy “I would give the employee and her colleagues a bonus when they meet the allocated times,” which ignores the role&#39;s unreasonable time allocation.</p><p></p><h3> One Big Lesson: Specific Prompts Are Key</h3><p> To further assess ChatGPT&#39;s ability to generate suggestions independently, we ran the Simulation 2 work design tasks without providing a multiple-choice solution list. We ran each test in a new account with the chat history function turned off and in independent new chats so that the output of ChatGPT would not be affected by previous inputs.</p><p> To begin with, the outcome was worrying. When we simply instructed the AI model to “provide effective strategies to address the problem” in the missed-deadlines scenario, ChatGPT tended to address problems by trying to fix the worker and creating old-fashioned <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-progressive-roots-of-management-science/">Taylorist approaches to work systems</a> , such as conducting time and motion studies. For example, ChatGPT suggested solutions such as time management skills and additional training to help the warehouse employee, who we named Karen, improve her performance (for example, “Focus on improving Karen&#39;s speed and accuracy in locating and gathering items from the warehouse”). It also recommended providing performance feedback and incentives to motivate Karen to move faster (for instance, “By linking performance with rewards, Karen will be encouraged to focus on improving her speed and efficiency”). Each of these solutions implicitly assumes that the worker&#39;s motivation or ability is the problem rather than the work design.</p><p> After learning that such an open-ended approach was not optimal, we next instructed ChatGPT to address this same scenario using specific prompts: “Consider designing a good-quality job for Karen”; “Consider Karen&#39;s health, well-being, motivation, satisfaction, and work meaningfulness”; and “Consider Karen&#39;s work design.” The AI model then provided solutions related to improving Karen&#39;s work design, including the following:</p><ul><li> Reviewing time allocation and workload to set realistic time goals.</li><li> Involving Karen in the decision-making process and seeking her input on ways to improve her job.</li><li> Offering supportive feedback and recognition to enhance employee satisfaction and motivation.</li><li> Providing adequate training and skill development opportunities to boost confidence and engagement.</li></ul><p> These strategies would boost Karen&#39;s SMART work design characteristics, increasing the tolerability of demands, enhancing agency, boosting mastery, and making the work more stimulating.</p><p> ChatGPT also suggested solutions such as fostering a supportive work environment, encouraging team support and collaboration, offering career advancement opportunities, and promoting work-life balance. These solutions all align well with extensive research on work design and well-being and would make the job “SMART-er” and hence result in a healthier and more productive employee.</p><p> We learned from this particular experiment with ChatGPT that generative AI can make valuable work design decisions, but managers need to provide clear instructions that prioritize outcomes for the worker. For example, asking ChatGPT to “design a high-quality job” rather than simply requesting “good work design” can generate more relevant and effective strategies. Therefore, to enhance the quality of strategy suggestions generated by ChatGPT, managers need to mention specific, desirable goals in their question prompts, such as high-quality jobs; employees&#39; health, well-being, and motivation; and work meaningfulness.</p><p></p><p> One piece of good news: Managers who do not frequently use ChatGPT can learn how to write effective prompts via the ChatGPT tool itself. For example, when asked, “How can one craft a well-structured and clear prompt to effectively address work design challenges?” ChatGPT provided a step-by-step guide on how to write effective prompts. ChatGPT advised us to identify the core issue and be specific — suggestions that could be applied to work design by using prompts such as “Design high-quality work that enhances positive team interaction and collaboration for the sales team” or “Design work that is meaningful to facilitate employee acceptance of technological changes in their work.”</p><p> The experiment also showed that effective prompts need to be reviewed and tested. Managers who struggle to write effective ChatGPT prompts can improve their skills by using a prompt such as “The following is a prompt aimed at asking ChatGPT for advice from a work design expert&#39;s perspective. Please analyze and suggest improvements to get actionable and practical advice from ChatGPT.” In this case, ChatGPT will provide more specific suggestions that drive better-quality outputs.</p><h3> Five Lessons for Managers</h3><p> To address the pervasive issue of poor work role design and its detrimental effects, embracing innovative solutions is crucial. Based on our research, ChatGPT has emerged as a promising AI-powered tool to help managers design healthier and more productive jobs. But it&#39;s not a panacea and needs to be used wisely. Our advice for managers:</p><p> <strong>ChatGPT cannot replace training.</strong> Managers need to be <em>aware</em> that worker problems can emerge from poor work design and that work design, in turn, can affect worker well-being, motivation, and work meaningfulness. This means that before using ChatGPT to design better jobs, managers still need basic training on work design concepts. To get started on this topic, see the related article “ <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-well-designed-work-makes-us-smarter/">How Well-Designed Work Makes Us Smarter</a> ” and the <a href="https://www.smartworkdesign.com.au/">SMART Work Design site</a> .</p><p> <strong>Managers need to be supported in their goal to create well-designed work.</strong> Managers need to be <em>motivated</em> to create better jobs for their staffs. This means managers themselves need roles in which the creation of healthy employee work roles is seen as a legitimate and important responsibility, versus having their sole focus be the bottom line. For example, if managers get promoted purely on the basis of productivity achievements, they will not have much motivation to design SMART work for their teams.</p><p> <strong>Managers need healthy jobs themselves.</strong> Managers need sufficient time to be able to pay attention to how well their staff members&#39; jobs are designed. This means managers&#39; own jobs need to be <em>tolerable</em> and not excessively time-pressured.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Managers need to learn ChatGPT prompting skills.</strong> Managers should be encouraged to use generative AI to help with work design challenges, but they need clear and comprehensive instructions as to how to use it effectively. For example, managers need to be specific and to mention goals such as employee well-being and motivation when seeking work design recommendations from ChatGPT.</p><p> <strong>ChatGPT will augment, not replace, people in designing better jobs.</strong> Unlike simulations, real-life job design situations are often characterized by their ambiguity and complexity, with numerous variables that can influence outcomes. Real situations require a deep understanding of context, human emotions, social dynamics, and political and ethical considerations, all of which can be challenging for an AI tool like ChatGPT to fully grasp. We recommend using ChatGPT as a <em>complement</em> to human managers rather than as a <em>replacement</em> for them.</p><p> By incorporating ChatGPT&#39;s suggestions alongside human expertise, organizations can foster higher staff engagement, job satisfaction, and overall performance. Achieving such a synergy between managers and AI can pave the way for a better future for work design and employee experience.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-chatgpt-can-and-cant-help-managers-design-better-job-roles/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
