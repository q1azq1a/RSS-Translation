It just needs to be [&#8230;]]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><figure class="article-inline"><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/W23-QA02_1290x860.jpg" alt="" /><br /></figure><p>许多领导者不知道如何根据结果来管理工作，而不是众所周知的“座位上的流浪者”——跟踪谁在办公室以及在办公室呆了多长时间。但在混合工作场所中，有可能拥有高绩效、健康的工作场所文化，并且人们可以灵活地工作时间和地点。只是需要以不同的方式进行管理。</p><p>这是未来论坛的 Brian Elliott 传达的信息，他在 2023 年 5 月举办的<cite>麻省理工学院斯隆管理评论</cite>研讨会<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/series/work-23-the-big-shift/">Work/23</a>期间与乔治华盛顿大学商学院的 N. Sharon Hill 和 Atlassian 的 Julie Dervin 一起在小组中发表了演讲。</p><p>埃利奥特表示，在他的公司调查的 10,243 名知识工作者中，93% 的人表示他们希望工作时间具有灵活性。他说，那些有选择的人的<a href="https://futureforum.com/research/future-forum-pulse-winter-2022-2023-snapshot/">生产力得分比没有选择的人高出 39%</a> 。那些对工作<em>地点</em>有一定灵活性的人得分也更高（8%）。</p><p></p><p>要在员工对灵活性的渴望和组织的战略目标之间找到平衡，需要重新检查需要亲自完成的工作类型。它还可能需要同一组织内不同群体的不同工作配置，并且肯定需要不同的方法来衡量员工完成的工作。</p><p>与会者向演讲者提出的问题多于时间，埃利奥特同意在活动结束后回答一些问题。 （为了清晰起见，问题和答案已进行了轻微编辑。）</p><h6>您如何衡量生产力？大多数员工表示，他们按照自己的时间表在家工作效率更高，但事实真是这样吗？</h6><p>这是一种异端观点：我们需要停止尝试衡量知识工作的生产力，而将所有时间和精力集中在衡量结果上。</p><p>生产力指标采用输出（发送的电子邮件、关闭的案例）并将其除以输入（活跃时间），然后根据质量调整更好的结果（重新打开的案例）。这在某种程度上可以适用于死记硬背的日常任务，随着时间的推移，这些任务会变得自动化。而且，这些指标可以被利用，人们也会利用它们——甚至包括购买<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHBQQVG">鼠标摇动器</a>。正如 Atlassian 的 Dominic Price<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/the-problem-with-productivity-metrics">所写</a>，“生产力一直是衡量机器和资本影响的好方法。这从来都不是衡量<em>人类</em>影响的好方法。”</p><p>在未来论坛上，我们已经涉足这一领域；我们比较了具有灵活性和不具有灵活性的人群，发现具有位置灵活性的人群的生产力得分更高，而具有日程灵活性的人群则具有更大的优势。斯坦福大学的<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30292">尼克·布鲁姆（Nick Bloom）</a> 、哈佛商学院的拉杰·<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30292">乔杜里（Raj Choudhury</a> ）和其他人的学术研究也表明了同样的情况。</p><p>但这是一个奇怪的问题，因为当人们在办公室时我们没有问这个问题。我们只是假设，因为人们在场，所以他们正在做一些富有成效的事情。我们都知道这不准确。</p><p>相反，让我们跳过整个混乱的过程，花时间弄清楚我们组织的目标和关键结果 (OKR)，并以一种可以按业务部门和职能向下级联到团队级别的方式来实现。从团队层面来看，很多事情都可以延伸到个人层面，以发现个人在他们所做的事情以及他们作为队友的表现方面的影响。</p><p>评估人们对团队目标的影响比较困难，但比安装更多衡量他们的投入和产出的生产力指标会让我们走得更远。</p><h6>随机碰撞似乎是推动创新的关键。在跨团队建立联系方面，您如何促进偶然性？</h6><p>联系是员工敬业度和保留率的重要组成部分，但与创新的联系充其量是虚假的。<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4093796">多项研究</a><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=991">表明</a>，真正促成创新的是心理安全。</p><p>在我们于 2021 年进行的研究中，未来论坛发现位置（无论是完全现场、混合还是完全远程）与团队创新几乎没有相关性。相反，重要<em>的</em>是人们是否觉得自己可以提出问题以及团队是否愿意承担风险等因素——也就是说，他们是否感到心理安全。</p><p>建立联系很重要，但我们应该在组织中有意识地这样做，而不是依靠随机机会。您可以通过以下三种方式执行此操作：</p><p> <strong>1. 有意的跨团队联系。</strong>诸如开放式午餐会之类的计划，由内部专家轮流出席或主持“有问题的会议”，将其他职能部门的领导带入您的季度计划周期，并在 Slack 或 Teams 中创建公共渠道，以便根据主题分享见解（如人工智能）可以走很长的路。</p><p> <strong>2. 利用工具建立联系。</strong> Donut（一款适用于 Slack 或 Teams 的应用程序，以编程方式将团队中的个人配对）等产品有助于确保每个人都能保持联系，而不仅仅是那些在同一楼层或同一栋大楼工作的人。</p><p> <strong>3、帮助新员工建立人际网络。</strong>过去几年的一大挑战是，太多公司在雇用人员时没有重新考虑如何建立联系并了解文化。我最喜欢的建议之一来自欧洲的简柏特公司，那里的新员工会被安排在团队之外与六个人会面，无论是面对面还是在虚拟咖啡会上，每个人都应该再提供两到三个联系人。</p><p>投资新工具和流程也可以带来巨大的推动作用。在头脑风暴会议之前，像<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/12/using-brainwriting-for-rapid-idea-generation/">头脑风暴</a>一样思考流程：让人们有低头的空间思考一些研究结果或问题，提前写出自己的想法，然后与小组分享，同时带来更多新想法。它还降低了群体思维的可能性。</p><p></p><h6>您如何以一种鼓舞人心和包容性的方式传达这样一种期望，即人们应该每周去办公室一两天，而不是强行和独裁？</h6><p>过去两年，很多公司声称每周需要 3 天亲自办公，而实际情况是平均每周 1.5 天。这掩盖了这样一个事实：通常有一批初级员工每周来两到三天，而更多高级员工来的次数较少。</p><p>重复这一政策是行不通的，威胁要解雇那些不经常来的人也是不现实的，而且会滋生怨恨。领导层知道，一些经验更丰富、更关键的人才的加入频率较低。初级员工也知道这一点。</p><p>相反，我们所看到的工作重点是通过团队级别的协议帮助团队找出自己的节奏。例如，销售团队和工程团队的需求是不同的。销售团队最终可能会规定每周有两天是默认在办公室工作的日子，并将这些日子与更多“抬头”而不是低头的特定活动叠加在一起，例如培训课程、指导时间和一-上一个。另一方面，工程团队最终可能会在每个月中抽出一周的时间亲自进行规划、共进午餐和演示日。</p><p>鼓励高级员工每周至少有一天来参加指导课程、参加培训以及与初级员工一起喝咖啡，这比简单地告诉他们出现要更进一步。</p><p>另一个关键因素是，去办公室工作不会一直比在家工作更糟糕。人们并不总是想要免费的午餐，他们想要一个团队会议的场所，能够找到一个安静的地方来接客户电话，以及有效的 Wi-Fi。对于很多公司来说，这需要重新设计工作空间。</p><h6>管理者应该怎样做才能避免弹性工作制延续甚至夸大工作场所中现有的偏见？ “眼不见心不烦”是一个真正令人担忧的问题。</h6><p>邻近偏见和出勤主义可能带来更好的机会和回报，这是一个真正的风险。我们需要创造一个公平的竞争环境，首先要培训经理和领导者根据他们产生的结果而不是投入（办公室时间、响应速度、始终在线）来评估团队和个人的绩效。领导者及其员工合作伙伴不仅需要关注晋升和奖励周期，还需要关注他们的人才发展渠道以及谁正在获得新的、闪亮的项目。</p><p>我们与 Slack 执行团队合作，制定了一项规则，即所有高级管理人员的定期审核（例如 CMO 对新项目提案的每周审核）都完全以虚拟方式完成。这不仅有助于解决人们听不到房间另一端的谈话的常见挑战，还有助于缓解“在会议发生的房间”参加这些会议的压力，而初级员工可能每年只参加一两次。</p><h6>科技以外的许多公司和行业都存在知识型员工和需要亲自到场工作的员工（例如零售业和制造业）之间的分歧。您如何建议灵活定位，以免造成不公平的双重标准？</h6><p>办公桌（办公室）员工和无办公桌（或一线）员工之间的差异远远超出了远程工作的能力：它们包括工资、福利、设施、培训等。</p><p>无办公桌员工的人才短缺对许多公司来说是一个巨大的挑战。但我不认为答案是强迫办公桌员工回到办公室全职工作。这并不能真正解决无办公桌员工的任何问题。</p><p>这里的答案是投资于无办公桌员工的特定需求。根据<a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/why-deskless-workers-are-leaving-and-how-to-win-them-back">波士顿咨询集团的研究</a>，日程灵活性和选择是留住人才的首要因素。领导者正在投资一些项目，例如轮班能力以及为呼叫中心工作人员提供多种类型的日程安排。 Neiman Marcus Group 通过为销售人员提供灵活的商店和部门以及工作时间选择，将营业额减少了 20%。</p><h6>我在一家初创公司。在一家新兴公司中，随着公司的成长，管理层会非常关注工作文化。初创公司或任何企业如何在允许远程或混合模式的同时建立文化？</h6><p>我坚信文化的建立与你身在何处、墙上的标语或欢乐时光的质量无关。文化是根据员工的日常经历和你所做的决定而建立的：你作为公司的优先事项、你如何对待你的客户和员工、你资源的项目以及你奖励的对象。</p><p></p><p>也就是说，我见过一些确实有助于建立坚实基础的实践。以下是其中三个：</p><p></p><p>首先，数字优先并不意味着“永不面对面”。让人们聚集在一起，即使分布广泛，也是建设文化的重要组成部分。对于团队来说，我建议至少每季度花几天时间主要关注团队建设、社交和联系。随着初创公司的发展，这通常从每个人每季度一次变成团队每季度一次，最后每个人每年一次。</p><p>其次，弄清楚你们如何一起工作，并分享更多关于自己的信息。您的<a href="https://futureforum.com/2022/06/23/team-level-agreements/">团队级别协议</a>不应只关注人们在一起的频率，还应该涉及您的沟通方式、决策方式等。共享<a href="https://futureforum.com/2022/07/15/personal-user-manual/">个人用户手册</a>等工具也可以对建立信任文化大有帮助。</p><p>第三，在工作中创造透明度。推动文化的关键因素之一是领导力沟通，随着公司规模的扩大，在设置护栏的同时保持透明度非常重要。哪些主题对您的公司和使命最重要？我们如何彼此互动？将内部沟通从首席执行官“问我任何问题”会议扩展到知识共享的公共论坛需要时间和精力； <a href="https://slack.com/blog/transformation/a-modern-leaders-guide-to-organizational-transparency">其他人的指导</a>会有帮助。</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss>

What can I do?” If you’ve found [&#8230;]]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><figure class="article-inline"><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Fosslien-1290x860-1.jpg" alt="" /><br /></figure><p> “我的团队看起来真的很焦虑，”一位经理最近告诉我。 “我们刚刚经历了一次重组，对未来有很多担忧。我想给每个人某种保证，但我也不知道六个月后会发生什么。我能做些什么？”</p><p>如果您最近发现自己遇到类似的情况，那么您并不孤单。过去一年里我见过的几乎每一位人民领袖都问过我这个问题的某个版本。在最近的一项研究中，89% 的人力资源领导者表示，他们的团队表达了对<a href="https://www.humu.com/blog/the-toll-of-workplace-anxiety-and-what-to-do-about-it">工作保障、领导层变动或重组的</a>担忧。</p><p>当不确定性很高时，管理者应该致力于使工作成为一个稳定的场所，而不是另一个压力来源。 “最高效的管理者会清楚地表达出他们关心团队中的成员，”Atlassian Team Anywhere 实践主管 Molly Sands 解释道。 “研究表明，表现最好的团队的管理者一贯采取的不同做法是让他们的报告<a href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/601872ae12d42e2264ff9ac4/62d6d89b1037a1bb82393638_Infographic _ Actions that drive great management.pdf">感到有价值和舒适</a>。”</p><p></p><p>当许多重大决策以及更广泛的经济状况超出您的控制范围时，您如何提供保证？这看起来几乎不可能，但事实并非如此。管理者可以通过以下七种方式在动荡时期为团队提供支持，而不必做出无法兑现的承诺。</p><p><strong>帮助每位员工朝着梦想的工作努力。</strong>你不能总是保证某人升职（或者不幸的是，甚至不能保证工作稳定），但你可以承诺为你的员工提供各种有价值的学习机会，无论接下来发生什么，这些机会都会对他们有所帮助。</p><p>为了展示您的团队成员愿意承担的经历或项目，请他们向您展示一份他们很高兴在三到五年内担任的职位的招聘启事。一起浏览列出的职责，并指出他们认为自己缺乏技能或引人注目的经验的任何职责。然后致力于通过为他们提供相关任务或项目来帮助他们在这些领域成长。</p><p>养成职业聊天的习惯也很有用。每六周，为每份报告安排 30 分钟的时间来提出以下问题：</p><ul><li>您最喜欢什么类型的项目或任务？</li><li>您认为当前职责的哪些部分让您充满活力？</li><li>您觉得自己在角色中不断学习和成长吗？</li><li>您希望在未来发展哪些技能？</li></ul><p>重点是根据这些对话为他们创造或提供相关机会。</p><p><strong>与您的团队共同制定中期任务。</strong>当面临不确定性或频繁改变优先事项时，我们常常会感到陷入困境，或者觉得我们付出的所有努力都没有什么成果。这种无助感可能会导致冷漠和脱离。事实上，我在 Humu 的团队二月份针对持续不确定性的影响进行的研究表明，大约 40% 的<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/web-assets-humu/eBooks/FY24 Q1 eBook - Uncertainty/eBook_Uncertainty_01.pdf">员工感觉自己的雄心壮志</a>不如一年前。</p><p>为了让您的团队成员重新焕发活力，请将他们聚集在一起，确定并努力实现共同的三个月目标。展望未来三个月可以为您的员工带来长期的稳定感，但这段时间足够短，即使您周围的情况发生变化，您也可能不必改变您的使命。例如，营销团队的目标可能是在下个季度将网站流量增加 25%，或者就如何更快地共享信息和做出决策进行实验。正如 Creativity Partners 创始人杰米·伍尔夫 (Jamie Woolf) 和海蒂·罗森菲尔德 (Heidi Rosenfelder) 建议的那样，“为了更好地让您的团队参与未来的共同创造，请尝试提出诸如‘哪些新的利润来源可以取代日益减少的利润来源？’之类的问题。”或者‘我们能做些什么来打破团队内部的隔阂？’”</p><p></p><p><strong>帮助您的团队在两周内取得胜利。</strong>通过将团队成员的注意力集中在他们<em>可以</em>控制的事情上，并为他们每个人分配一个可以在一周或两周内完成的特定任务，可以快速增强团队成员的进步感。首先将您的中期使命或长期目标划分为小里程碑，并跟踪和庆祝每个目标的实现。</p><p>工程经理莎拉最近将一项雄心勃勃的产品发布分解为一系列特定功能和更新，然后从列表中为她的报告分配单独的任务。她还在每周结束时安排了 15 分钟的团队签到，以庆祝他们所取得的成就，并跟踪团队在实现共同目标方面的集体进展。</p><p><strong>尽可能地保持清晰。</strong>在困难的情况下进行深思熟虑的解释对于赢得信任和减少焦虑至关重要。下次您要分享最新消息时，请准备好讲述如何做出决定的故事，并思考可能出现的任何疑虑或问题。计划好如何应对每一个问题。如果您不确定该说什么，请向其他领导或人力资源部门寻求建议。当您与团队成员分享决定时，鼓励他们提出澄清问题。</p><p>对于管理者来说，表达自己的情绪也很重要，同时避免在团队面前情绪化地处理新闻。 “你应该说，‘我对本季度的结果感到失望’，而不是‘我对结果感到非常失望。我很害怕我们都会失业。我不知道该怎么办，”桑兹建议道。 “透明度并不意味着你必须分享你的感受或担忧的一切。”</p><p></p><p>您还可以通过与您的团队讨论最近影响他们的决定（例如新产品路线图或费用政策的变化）来进行清晰度审核。在下一系列的一对一会议中，提出以下问题：</p><ul><li>您是如何以及何时得知这个决定的？</li><li>有什么不清楚的吗？</li><li>下次与团队沟通变更时，我可以采取哪些不同的做法？</li></ul><p>这些对话可以帮助您确定如何提高透明度，并让员工清楚您正在尽力让他们了解最新情况。</p><p><strong>当您无法清晰地表达时，请提供上下文。</strong>经理们往往保持沉默，直到他们能够做出具体的决定。但缺乏沟通仍然是沟通的一种形式——它通常会滋生不信任和流言蜚语。</p><p></p><p>为了避免误解，请解释为什么您无法提供更多详细信息，并提供您希望获得更多信息的时间表。例如，您可能会这样说：“我还没有收到关于销售宣传将做出哪些改变的回复。我希望在一周左右的时间内能与大家分享更多信息，但我希望尽可能透明地了解我们目前的情况。”</p><p><strong>鼓励您的团队从福利中受益。</strong>研究表明，高达 80% 的员工对其公司提供的<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2019/07/02/only-half-of-employees-understand-their-benefits-heres-what-hr-leaders-can-do-about-it/?sh=a4a1a578133c">福利感到困惑</a>。当预算缩减时，设计和资助支持团队的新方法可能是一场艰苦的战斗。您可能会惊讶地发现，仅仅通过让员工意识到已经存在的事情就可以极大地提高士气。例如，尽管我的前雇主为休完产假返回的女性提供了在回来的第一个月兼职工作的选择，但许多准妈妈并不知道这项政策。时任 Humu 产品负责人的 Sands 在公司范围内的 Slack 频道上标记了这一选项后，几位女性（包括我）利用了它并对这项政策表示感谢。</p><p>查看公司手册，或安排与人力资源部门的快速会议以复习知识。在即将召开的团队会议中，简要概述您的组织的优势，并鼓励您的团队成员充分利用它们。您可能想特别强调心理健康福利、假期政策或灵活的工作选择。首先可以这样说：“我知道这是一段压力很大、不确定性很高的时期，所以我想重点介绍一下我们公司提供的一些计划和福利，这些计划和福利可能会帮助您感觉更好。”</p><p><strong>帮助您的团队说不。</strong>通过介入保护团队的时间来维护他们的心理健康。设定明确合理的期望，并在报告拒绝非紧急请求时支持您的报告。</p><p></p><p>您还可以寻找方法来更清楚地了解他们被要求做的所有事情，并旨在建立友好的障碍。例如，当我得知我的团队因销售请求而不堪重负时，我创建了一个简短的表格，并建议我的报告指导所有请求者完成该表格，以便开始该流程。这具有三个功能：（1）它使我能够更好地了解我的团队正在做什么，（2）我可以帮助我的报告确定优先顺序或根据需要拒绝，（3）它减少了请求的数量，因为很少有请求人们实际上填写了表格。</p><p></p><p>不确定性会滋生焦虑，尽管管理者无法打响指，神奇地让一切完美到位，但他们可以采取措施帮助团队感到更有权力、得到支持并能够取得成功。为团队成员提供对个人有意义的成长机会并帮助他们快速获胜可以恢复他们的控制感和动力。围绕变更和更新创造透明度——或者解释为什么尚未宣布决定——可以恢复员工的信任。帮助人们投资于自己的福祉并设定健康的界限可以让他们更轻松地度过工作场所的风暴。</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-support-your-team-when-uncertainty-is-high/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>利用人工智能提高关键绩效指标</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/improve-key-performance-indicators-with-ai/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/improve-key-performance-indicators-with-ai/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 11 Jul 2023 11:00:38 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Michael Schrage, David Kiron, François Candelon, Shervin Khodabandeh, and Michael Chu. <p class="mt20"><strong>迈克尔·施拉格 (Michael Schrage)</strong>是麻省理工学院斯隆管理学院数字经济倡议的研究员。他的研究、写作和咨询工作重点关注数字媒体、模型和指标的行为经济学，作为管理创新机会和风险的战略资源。</p><p class="mt20"> <strong>David Kiron</strong>是<cite>《麻省理工学院斯隆管理评论》</cite>研究部编辑主任，也是其<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/big-ideas/">“大创意”研究计划的</a>项目负责人。</p><p class="mt20"> <strong>François Candelon</strong>是波士顿咨询集团的高级合伙人兼董事总经理，也是 BCG 亨德森研究所的全球总监，他的研究重点是技术对商业和社会的影响。您可以通过<a href="mailto:candelon.francois@bcg.com">candelon.francois@bcg.com</a>联系他。</p><p class="mt20"> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh</strong>是 BCG 的高级合伙人兼董事总经理，也是 BCG 北美人工智能业务的联席领导者。他是 BCG X 的领导者，在推动人工智能和数字化业务影响方面拥有 20 多年的经验。您可以通过<a href="mailto:shervin@bcg.com">shervin@bcg.com</a>联系他。</p><p class="mt20"> <strong>Michael Chu</strong>是 BCG 合伙人兼副总监，专注于将人工智能和机器学习应用于商业职能中的业务问题，包括优化定价、促销、销售和营销。您可以通过<a href="mailto:chu.michael@bcg.com">chu.michael@bcg.com</a>联系他。</p> ]]>;</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Analytics and Performance]]></category><category><![CDATA[Metrics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Prediction Tools]]></category><category><![CDATA[Smart Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[AI & Machine Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Data, AI, & Machine Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Executing Strategy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Organizational Transformation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Strategy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy]]></category><description><![CDATA[About the Research This article series presents findings from the seventh annual global research study on artificial intelligence and business strategy by MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group.

Improving performance without enhancing KPIs creates competitive risk. Companies that focus on — or align around — suboptimal measures are at a competitive disadvantage. Focusing on performance without a commensurate focus on its measure creates an inherent imbalance that can sabotage a company&#39;s efforts to compete effectively.</p><p> Based on our research — which includes results from a global survey of more than 3,000 managers and qualitative analysis of more than a dozen executive interviews — we have identified three ways to enhance strategic metrics with AI:</p><ul><li> <strong style="font-size:1.25em;">I</strong> mprove existing KPIs.</li><li> <strong style="font-size:1.25em;">C</strong> reate new KPIs.</li><li> <strong style="font-size:1.25em;">E</strong> stablish new relationships among KPIs.</li></ul><p> This article explains how this Improve-Create-Establish, or ICE, framework can help leaders and managers repurpose KPIs to make their people, processes, and technologies more effective. Our research shows that AI-enhanced KPIs are associated with strategically valuable business benefits, including increased efficiency, better alignment, and greater financial benefit. Integrating AI into the strategic measurement process has enormous implications for the future of capital allocation, customer engagement, employee experience, EBITDA, and every other executive metric.

We offer several practical steps on how to use AI to enhance their KPIs.</p><p></p><h3> Improve Existing KPIs With AI</h3><p> Companies that initially use AI to boost performance numbers tend to find that the technology creates opportunities to revisit and review key performance parameters.</p><h4> The Substitution Effect at Wayfair</h4><p> Wayfair&#39;s AI approach makes that case. While losing a sale may appear to be a straightforward measure, the online furniture retailer used AI to reexamine the fundamentals behind its lost-sales KPI. As CTO Fiona Tan recalls, “We used to think that if you lost the sale on a particular product, like a sofa, it was a loss to the company. But we started looking at the data and realized that 50% to 60% of the time, when we lose a sale it is because the customer bought something else in the same product category.”</p><p> This AI-enabled analysis allowed Wayfair to experiment with substitute offers based on customer concerns such as price points, shipment times, and other factors. Demand for these substitute products provided a new lens on what had been previously measured and interpreted as lost sales. Recognizing this “substitution effect” led Wayfair to adjust pricing across its entire sofa domain, revamp product configurations in its fulfillment centers, and reprioritize legacy KPIs.</p><p></p><p> At one level, Wayfair used AI to transform its legacy lost-sales KPI into a more valuable metric that differentiated truly lost sales from actual sales. But at another level, the AI behind this upgraded KPI also enabled more sweeping changes. Tan&#39;s team used the substitution effect to develop a “profit-awareness framework,” which changed the way the company interacted with customers. Wayfair&#39;s furniture recommendations began to factor in delivery times and shipment costs, as well as product incidents and product profitability, when making next-best offers. Explicitly measuring and incorporating the substitution effect reframed lost sales as sales opportunities and led to pricing shifts. This reframing consequently aligned product placement decisions with the needs and capacities of distribution centers and warehouses, which improved both employee and customer experiences.</p><p> Companies across the industry landscape are finding ways to use AI to improve existing KPIs. Some use AI to deepen their understanding of factors that drive KPI outcomes, whereas others use AI to identify and prioritize which KPIs deliver the most value to the organization. While our survey results suggest that most companies will satisfice around improving KPIs (that is, rely on human judgment), we also see companies recognizing that AI makes possible altogether new KPIs that can achieve, and drive, next-level performance.</p><h3> Create New KPIs</h3><p> In addition to improving existing performance metrics, AI offers the potential for managers to algorithmically discover and generate entirely new KPIs. While our survey shows that only 16% of respondents&#39; organizations use AI to generate new KPIs, 90% agree that their use of AI has measurably improved their KPIs.</p><p> For example, hunting for indicators that can help physicians preempt sudden cardiac death, which afflicts 300,000 people in the US every year, is an ongoing effort for physicians and researchers. These types of deaths come out of nowhere; doctors can&#39;t predict them, since patients don&#39;t present as high risk. It&#39;s an especially frustrating condition because there is a known effective treatment — installing a cardiac defibrillator — if doctors can identify at-risk patients in time. One of the researchers in this hunt, Ziad Obermeyer, a physician and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, is working with Region Halland Health System in Sweden whose electronic health record data can be linked to a variety of government data. He and his collaborators trained an algorithm to predict sudden cardiac death in the year after an electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed, using death certificates, and a variety of other data points taken from government records and electronic health records.</p><p> “The algorithm became quite good at predicting who&#39;s going to succumb to sudden cardiac death in the year after an ECG is taken. Every time someone gets an ECG, it generates a risk score that measures the probability the individual will die from sudden cardiac arrest,” says Obermeyer. That ECG score can also function just like a key performance indicator: With the score in hand, a doctor might observe how it changes if the patient is prescribed a medication such as a beta blocker or an ACE inhibitor. While the research is at a very early stage, it might one day empower doctors and patients to work together to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death — and identify new interventions that might decrease the risk. “Having the ability to turn these very complicated biological signals into indicators is very powerful,” Obermeyer says, “and I think that&#39;s going to be something that we&#39;ll see a lot more of, not just for sudden cardiac death but for diabetic complications and all sorts of other preventable, high-stakes conditions.”</p><p> Obermeyer&#39;s use of AI to create a new KPI for sudden cardiac death promises to improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance physicians&#39; sense of their own efficacy. Developing and discerning new key performance indicators with AI is an emergent phenomenon across the business landscape and among large companies we interviewed, such as DBS Bank, General Electric, General Motors, Sanofi, Schneider Electric, and Walmart. These companies are using AI to identify indicators of future performance at earlier and earlier stages of corporate activity. This capability facilitates better situational awareness and a more effective response to changing market conditions, among other benefits.</p><h3> Establish New Relationships Among KPIs</h3><p> No KPI is an island. Many executives we spoke with emphasized that better managing their business requires that they bring local KPIs together into a more integrated set of metrics. Executives across industries explicitly remarked on the inherent organizational and computational tensions between maximizing local KPIs and optimizing higher-level, more macro KPIs. As KPI features and parameters evolve, the importance of anticipating, modeling, and coordinating multiple KPI interactions with AI becomes more critical.</p><h4> DBS Bank Integrates Its KPIs With AI</h4><p> Singapore-based DBS Bank once relied on independent KPIs for each function touching different points along a customer journey. That is, for a given product, marketing would, for instance, have its own customer engagement metrics, product would have its own attrition metrics, finance would have its own revenue metrics, etc. Over the past three years, however, the multinational banking and financial services company has replaced that vertical model with a horizontal one. DBS created a value map that ties the use cases together into a single customer journey with outcomes in four categories: customer experience, employee experience, profitability, and risk. “We call it &#39;managing through journeys,&#39;” says Sameer Gupta, DBS&#39;s chief analytics officer. “Each customer journey would have multiple drivers, and each driver would in turn have multiple metrics to measure. You can imagine how quickly these scale, and it would be humanly impossible to optimize such a large number of drivers and metrics. AI is a force multiplier that gives us the ability to analyze large numbers of drivers and metrics and also identify those that need to be acted on now.”</p><p> In the new model, the outcome data is visible to cross-functional squads, whose members all have a stake in optimizing results in all four categories. “Everyone is looking at the same data, and everyone is accountable for the same outcome,” Gupta notes. The squads use experimentation, data analytics, customer immersion, and AI to continually review the factors driving different outcomes. In addition, they retain a sharp focus on choosing the correct metrics.</p><p> Establishing these interrelationships among their KPIs has been, in Gupta&#39;s words, “a fundamental shift.” He anticipates that AI will have an increasingly prominent role as the organization continues to coordinate its metrics in a drive toward continuous improvement. “We are starting to unpack to ask, &#39;Do we currently make that decision through data and AI enablement? Is there an opportunity to make it through data and AI enablement? If there is, how can we do it?&#39;” Gupta says. Discerning new relationships among KPIs with AI and other analytical techniques can yield new business opportunities, new insights, and a valuable set of data around which to manage organizational behaviors.</p><h3> Leadership Takeaways</h3><p> The future of strategic measurement belongs to smarter KPIs. Our research suggests, however, that few legacy organizations are strategically using AI to improve their KPIs. This makes both AI and KPIs undervalued assets. Leadership needs to invest accordingly. Using AI to improve KPIs, create new KPIs, and establish new relationships among KPIs creates an opportunity to capture measurably greater value. The ICE framework invites executive and boardroom discussions that should lead to management investment in improving strategic measurement.</p><p> Our research also emphasizes the need for leaders to align not only on which KPIs to pursue but, even more fundamentally, on the purpose of those KPIs. Will KPIs be primarily retrospective, or will they predictively lean into the future?</p><p> If the latter, organizations need road maps for improving existing KPIs; a commitment to exploration and experimentation around creating new KPIs; and a recognition that relationships among KPIs may matter as much as, if not more than, the individual KPIs themselves. Intelligent KPIs should not be primarily managed as independent performance silos; rather, their interdependencies and interrelationships must be understood and addressed. As our examples have shown, these shifts represent operational, organizational, and cultural challenges to leadership.</p><p> As has been the case with almost every successful AI initiative, KPIs, like the algorithms that comprise them, must be transparent and explainable. KPIs — organizationally, culturally, and operationally — cannot be seen as black boxes. They should be designed and deployed to be trusted. This cultural component should not be minimized or taken for granted. Otherwise, people at all levels of the organization will seek to game the metrics that guide them, ensuring organizational misalignment.</p><p></p><p> Underlying this new emphasis on AI and KPIs, and on strategic measurement more broadly, is an acknowledgment that quality KPIs depend on quality data. KPIs trained or supervised on biased, incomplete, and flawed data sets are likely to be biased, incomplete, and flawed. Data quality matters more wherever KPIs matter more. We see organizations committed to AI-driven KPIs becoming even more committed to cultivating data as an asset. They see investments in data reflected in KPI improvements.</p><p> Finally, as AI-influenced KPIs become more influential in the enterprise, their own performance will require new levels of monitoring and oversight. Leadership will need to be able to evaluate how well their KPIs are doing, individually and collectively. Are they the right KPIs for sustainable success? Are they appropriately anticipating the future? Are they making the right decisions — and helping humans make the right decisions — for achieving desired and desirable outcomes? Simply put, KPIs will require their own KPIs to help answer those important questions.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/improve-key-performance-indicators-with-ai/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The 10 Most Popular Articles in 2023 (So Far)</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-10-most-popular-articles-in-2023-so-far/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-10-most-popular-articles-in-2023-so-far/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 06 Jul 2023 11:00:48 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[MIT SMR Editors. ]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence]]></category><category><![CDATA[Corporate Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hybrid Workplace]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership Development]]></category><category><![CDATA[Remote Work]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership]]></category><category><![CDATA[Organizational Behavior]]></category><category><![CDATA[Talent Management]]></category><category><![CDATA[Workplace, Teams, & Culture]]></category><description><![CDATA[Three-plus years after COVID-19 interrupted office-based operations with a sudden transition to remote work, managing hybrid teams remains a pressing issue for leaders.

Hybrid culture has its own pitfalls to manage, with risks like feelings of disconnection among employees and “productivity paranoia.” Based on the most-read articles in the first half of 2023, readers of <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> seem keen to address these issues. Tools for improvement can be found in articles on skills-based culture change, effective one-on-one meetings, and intellectual honesty. Readers have also been focused on the bigger-picture issues of ESG, sustainability, and the growing role of AI in performance management and strategy.</p><p> The following are the 10 most popular articles of the year so far. We hope they will continue to help leaders in managing and supporting employees and in building thriving, innovative organizations.</p><p></p><h4> <span class="blue">#1</span><br /> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/work-from-home-regulations-are-coming-companies-arent-ready/" style="border-bottom:none;">Work-From-Home Regulations Are Coming.

Livestock? The Socratic method? Somehow, we talk about all three. Find out how these connect with AI in today&#39;s episode.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> I&#39;m David Hardoon from Aboitiz Data Innovation, and you&#39;re listening to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> .</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Welcome to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> , a podcast on artificial intelligence in business. Each episode, we introduce you to someone innovating with AI. I&#39;m Sam Ransbotham, professor of analytics at Boston College. I&#39;m also the AI and business strategy guest editor at <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> .</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And I&#39;m Shervin Khodabandeh, senior partner with BCG and one of the leaders of our AI business. Together, <cite>MIT SMR</cite> and BCG have been researching and publishing on AI since 2017, interviewing hundreds of practitioners and surveying thousands of companies on what it takes to build and to deploy and scale AI capabilities and really transform the way organizations operate.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Welcome. Today, Shervin and I are excited to be joined by David Hardoon, who holds several senior positions at the Aboitiz Group. David, thanks for joining us.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Thank you very much, Sam, Shervin.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Can you first tell us a bit about the Aboitiz Group? Where do you work?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> The Aboitiz Group is a 100-plus-year-old conglomerate that originated starting in Spain — Catalonia — and relocated to the Philippines. It started in the hemp business but is now quite diversified, from the main business — power generation and distribution across the Philippines — [to] financial services, cement, construction, utilities, [real] estate, airports, food, agriculture. We&#39;re now going through a transformation and becoming — I love this term, by the way — a techglomerate.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What is Aboitiz Data Innovation?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> About seven years ago, give or take, the bank started with all digitalization of the banking services. And what that had resulted in, as you would imagine, [was] a tremendous amount of data. The more you engage your consumers digitally, the more you have digital services — well, surprise, surprise — the more data you have.</p><p> And the question came as well, how are we really using it? Are we using it? What&#39;s the best way to put it to good use? And that question kind of also went beyond just the bank into the rest of the businesses, as you can imagine. Power has a lot of data; agriculture, airports, etc., have a lot of data.</p><p> We were born with a very on-point mandate: operationalizing data, operationalizing AI. Really, how do we put it to good use?</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What are some of these uses?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> I mean, there&#39;s the usual financial side, where we all learn from hyperpersonalization, financial crime. And don&#39;t get me wrong — that stuff … always gets me all excited. I spent a few good years in the financial regulator [space] here in Singapore.</p><p> But let me give you an oddity: cement, an industry that you wouldn&#39;t really associate with data or AI. We sat down with the CEO at the time, and we said, “Look, even in the world of cement, you have a lot of data.”</p><p> How can this work? So let me give you a little tidbit of how the world of cement works. And this is something that was new to me. So basically, it&#39;s like baking. I don&#39;t know if you bake, but it&#39;s like baking. It&#39;s basically, you have mixtures. You have these kind of formulas, and you end up with cement, which will have different types of properties. And these properties [are] what&#39;s absolutely critical depending on what you&#39;re planning to build, whether it&#39;s a mall, a high rise, a low rise, residential, etc., and so forth.</p><p> Having said that, as with baking, you kind of need to do a bit of trial and error. You need to try out these different mixtures to make sure it produces the right one. That results in operational overhead. It results in wastage. I mean, as with baking, you stick this stuff into kilns — literally, it&#39;s a furnace — to bake it. Using data, using the information that&#39;s coming from all the devices, the IoT, using AI, being able to actually tell the bakers or, in this case, the chemical engineers what is going to be the output of this mixture before they even start, while at the same time maintaining that quality control, which is absolutely crucial. Now this is, by the way, not just hypothetical. This is already operational for the past year in all the plants — about six plants in the Philippines — and results in operational efficiency, results in reduction in [the amount] of wastage, resulted in what I like to call quantifiable ESG [environmental, social, and governance]: a 35 kiloton reduction of CO <sub>2</sub> emissions. So that&#39;s a nice unusual example I like to give in terms of how data is used.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Well, I could tell you, Sam and I are going to love that. We&#39;re both chemical engineers.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Oh, well, there you go.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Actually, when you said baking, I did my Ph.D. in catalyst synthesis, so I spent a lot of my time baking various aluminosilicates to create catalysts. And you&#39;re completely right: You try all these things. Some work; some don&#39;t work. And had there been the ability for me to know ahead of time, I probably would have gotten my Ph.D. in a tenth of the time.</p><p> But seriously, this is quite interesting. Now, if you go from personalization and cyber and fraud, and you also have this example in baking cements, then we must believe that there is such a wide portfolio of things that you are considering. So tell us more about what makes it into that portfolio, because there is no end to what you could do. What are the kinds of things you get excited about?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> You&#39;re absolutely right. Being fortunate working in a conglomerate, you kind of wake up every day and discover something new. So there are kind of two dimensions to it. On the one hand — and I&#39;m going to go back to this term <em>operationalization</em> , operationalizing data and AI — it&#39;s stuff that has to make sense to the business. So revenue, operational efficiency, risk management. And then we have to look at the things around the corner. We have to experiment. But those may not be things that get immediately deployed. Like, effectively in agricultural builders, we have the animals; we have pigs, swine, and poultry. And as part of that process, we want to make sure that the animals have the best possible care provided to them. On an experimental side, we say, “OK, how can we use technology that&#39;s already available but may not have been put in exactly in this particular context, not in Southeast Asia?” So we&#39;re using voice recognition and image recognition for pigs to help identify stress and detect illnesses, so that could be automatic alerts to the caregivers.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What&#39;s the ground truth on that? That would be interesting to know.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That&#39;s a great question.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What&#39;s the training data?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> So this is the amazing stuff. It&#39;s a very expressive animal. So when you actually go there with the people who take care of them, they can literally point at them and say, “This animal is distressed,” and you&#39;re constantly recording.</p><p> We&#39;re kind of, “OK, is this really something that&#39;s relevant? Does it make sense?” Like, can we have that conversation with the baker, you know, the chemical engineer? Can we have a conversation with the animal keeper, the veterinarian and so forth, or the pole engineer when we&#39;re dealing with electricity cables? It&#39;s extremely important.</p><p> And that&#39;s one of the things that I realized throughout my career of doing data, is where things failed, where you suddenly had this divergence of exploring scientific research — and I came from the world of science, you know, like ex-academic — without really seeing that connectivity. And if we go all the way back, even when radar was invented, the reason things fall apart is whereby the very, very small gaps of “Well, it&#39;s not quite there; oh, it&#39;s not quite usable.” So that&#39;s the first part.</p><p> Then, the second level is seeing, well, is this something that, as much as possible, is truly going to make a difference to either our internal users — because that&#39;s extremely important — and for many of the businesses which are within the group, which are actually B2B, like in power, where, essentially, we provide power and wholesale [electricity]? So it&#39;s our internal users in terms of, let&#39;s say, predictive asset maintenance — critically important.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That is really fantastic. I mean, what you&#39;ve said is inspiring on so many levels. One is, let your imagination be the limit, right, because [of] the question of “Can something be done better, more effectively? Can you see around the corner there?” And there&#39;s data, then, yes. That&#39;s one thing that&#39;s inherent in all these examples that you gave.</p><p> You started with what most would consider quite advanced and interesting things, and we have guests who talk about those all the time: personalization, fraud, cyber. All of those are very important. And then you went to cement. And then you went to pigs. And then you talked about human and AI …</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Yeah.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Which is quite critical too. I just find that very, very energizing.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Well, it&#39;s the nexus between human and AI. There are two critical things that I believe have to go hand in hand — have to. While this may change in the future to some degree or extent — I mean, who knows what&#39;s going to happen around the corner? Things change so rapidly. But I&#39;ll be the first one to admit this: I truly came to this appreciation when I worked [for] the regulator — surprise, surprise — [of the] criticality of combining governance and innovation. And I used to get asked this question repeatedly, of “Oh, but don&#39;t you think governance inhibits innovation? It stifles us.” And I came to the view of, I&#39;m vehemently against that perspective.</p><p> I would argue that not only it does not stifle it — it would result in more and even better innovation. It&#39;s essentially about just simply having, you know, common sense. I was privileged in being in the process and coming up with the FEAT principle. So this was <em>fairness</em> , <em>ethics</em> , <em>accountability</em> , and <em>transparency</em> , back at the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p><p> I remember that when it came out — and we deliberately kept it very simple — and I showed it to our governor, our managing director, and he was just like, “David, isn&#39;t this just common sense?” And I just smiled, and I was like, “Well, no; even common sense has to ... it&#39;s not always that common. It has to be written down.” But it&#39;s critical. That&#39;s No. 1.</p><p> And No. 2, what you were mentioning is that, yes, while AI and data can do what is seemingly miraculous stuff, it&#39;s critical that this combination with us humans and <em>how</em> we use it is baked in at the very beginning. And even now, obviously, everyone&#39;s talking about ChatGPT, but remember: All the data that it&#39;s trained on is from <em>us</em> to a certain extent.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah. You can&#39;t take humans out of the loop, because after a while, they will lose what makes them human.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> But we have examples of that. I mean, that&#39;s OK in some places. I mean, neither of you know how to navigate by the stars, I&#39;m guessing, unless, Shervin, you&#39;ve got some tricks up your sleeve that I haven&#39;t learned yet. I mean, most people don&#39;t drive a manual transmission; that seems to be a skill that&#39;s … well, OK, maybe one or two of us do here. But the point is, we don&#39;t have to retain all possible skills. We just have to be savvy about which ones we hang on to.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> That&#39;s exactly [right], what you said: It&#39;s some, not all. But sometimes you find that you see this trend of like, “Oh, look what it can do. <em>Everything</em> gets automated.” And I remember, if I go to my early days as a consultant — you know, I used to be a consultant doing AI — you would find a lot of times, potential clients and people you spoke to, even if they didn&#39;t say it explicitly, what they were trying to achieve was like, “Oh, just do everything automatically with AI.”</p><p> And you need to have almost this natural inclination by saying, “OK, if it&#39;s contextual, if it makes sense.” Like you said, maybe I want to pick up star navigation because I&#39;m interested in it. I want to learn about astrology or astrophysics or whatnot.伟大的。 But you see it now becomes a niche topic that some people pick up. The general public doesn&#39;t need to know how to do it. But we need to be able to identify that decision point rather than just go [into a] “No, everything now, AI galore” kind of situation.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Well, I mean, what you&#39;re saying is, there&#39;s value in the ongoing dialogue. There&#39;s value in ongoing challenge. And every time there is a dialogue, I mean, even back in Socrates&#39;s time, the dialogue is where it elevates the conversation. And you&#39;re rightly pointing out that the moment you say AI is the be-all and end-all is the moment that you are under-delivering on AI, and then you&#39;re for sure under-delivering on the human potential.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Well you&#39;re losing a potential answer. Let me give you two examples. In the financial section, we have Union Bank of the Philippines, amongst others. While AI governance regulation is not yet — <em>yet</em> — a requirement, let&#39;s say, in the Philippines, we&#39;ve situated a working group, which is an interesting combination of people, from your risk officer, legal, compliance, and then you have marketing, customer engagement, experience. What happens is, while you still have the traditional process of model validation, etc., from a statistical, mathematical, data point of view, the models are presented in this working group for us to have a debate. Because a model may pass all the statistical tests, but if this model goes wrong — even that 10% or 5% — there is a significant reputational risk at play or there&#39;s a potential impact to the consumers. That debate is important because if you just looked at it from that statistical, even a potentially automated process, you would miss it.</p><p> Now, the resolution, interestingly enough — and I honestly tell you, like, maybe eight out of 10 times so far — isn&#39;t data, isn&#39;t AI. The resolution a lot of times is process, which is people. And that makes us actually wiser and understanding, “OK, how do we use it, and how do we engage with it? And when do we allow” — Sam, to your point — “that automation?” And when we go “no,” I retain the veto to overrule, to a certain extent. So that&#39;s one example.</p><p> The other one is if I go back to my cement [example], and in fact, we did this very deliberately at the very beginning because we didn&#39;t want our colleagues and chemical engineers to think, “Oh, great. Why do you need me? You&#39;re just going to automate the whole thing.”</p><p> No. The whole point was, we absolutely need them because there may be new types of mixtures that we haven&#39;t considered. You will still need to have that experimentation. The whole goal is providing information.</p><p> What it has resulted in is efficiency. If I give a swing again to another one — when ChatGPT came out, I got asked straightaway from a few boards, “What does this mean?” And my instinctive reaction, rather than going into this whole lengthy explanation of liberation, I just responded by saying, “It means that every one of us can have the productivity of 10 people.”</p><p> So this is what this stuff means, and that&#39;s what that nexus, the dialogue, the integration, the augmentation means — is that we now have the ability to be far more productive, whatever “productive” means in that context. For some people, they may say, “I just want to work two hours but [appear] as if I work the whole day.” Some may say, “I want to work the whole day.” … It may differ. But that&#39;s what it means because now we&#39;re able to take all this data.</p><p> I&#39;m sure some of you remember, back in 2000, you had these memes online of “getting information off the internet is like drinking from a fire hose.” It&#39;s still true. We&#39;re inundated with information, with data, but it&#39;s like distilling it down to something that&#39;s relevant to me, usable, that I can do something with it and get that gain, essentially.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I think one thing that&#39;s coming out of this conversation — Shervin used the word <em>Socratic</em> , and, David, you used the word <em>dialogue</em> . What&#39;s nice about this is it&#39;s dropped this hubris that I feel like I see in a lot of machine learning. Machine learning seems to be about humans teaching machines. So it&#39;s this sort of “We know all. We make the machines emulate us, and if they do, they pass the Turing test, and, yes, everything&#39;s golden.” But then you get pushback, and you say, “Oh, no. The machine can teach <em>us</em> things we&#39;ve never known before.” Well, that just has switched the direction. It still has that same directional hubris, but the things that you&#39;re both talking about are much more [oriented around the] Socratic and dialogue.</p><p> When you think about what that group can form together — and Shervin and I have got some results from last year&#39;s research that said about 60% of the people are thinking about AI as a coworker. And that strikes me as that sort of a relationship, because between the two, yes, you find some new compound that maybe someone wouldn&#39;t have tried. I don&#39;t know what the chemical engineering equivalent of the Fosbury flop is. Do you remember the Fosbury flop, where he learned a different way of jumping over the high bar, and then suddenly everyone else adopted that technique? That sort of idea seems like it could come out of this approach.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> It&#39;s actually really interesting you bring that up. I mean, I&#39;d love to say, “Oh, yeah, we had this all intended in the very beginning,” but I&#39;ll be very honest and say, I think it&#39;s more of a nice consequence that wasn&#39;t fully intended at a point in time.</p><p> But I want to go back to that FEAT principle. One of the principles resulted in a lot of discourse — and I mean a <em>lot</em> — where we had a statement amongst all of them that said that we should hold AI to at least the same standard as human decisions. So AI-based decisions should be held to at least the same standard as human-based decisions. And the debate was phenomenal and [people] said, “Oh, no, we should hold it to a higher one,” etc., and so forth.</p><p> But what the intention of that principle was saying is, if you&#39;re using now … so let me go back again to, let&#39;s say, a financial [example]: loan provisioning. And if [you&#39;re] using an AI algorithm and you&#39;re finding that “oh, we&#39;re discriminating,” OK, yeah, absolutely, that&#39;s something that needs to be addressed, reviewed, and corrected. But hold your horses there. Take a step back. Take the AI out of the equation. Had you been discriminating before the AI? And that&#39;s really the question because ... I remember I had long debates with many regulators. Maybe debate is the wrong word: <em>discussions</em> with many regulators. And I was actually a bit opposed to regulating AI, and I&#39;ll explain what I mean by that.</p><p> I&#39;m not opposing regulation. But when they said “regulating AI,” I got a bit defensive. I said, “What I&#39;m worried about is that we&#39;re like, &#39;OK, well, since AI now is showing me all this stuff that I don&#39;t want to know about, then I&#39;m just not going to use AI.&#39; And we&#39;re going to go back to the same procedures previously, which, guess what — it&#39;s the same problem. You just weren&#39;t paying attention to it because that information, that knowledge, wasn&#39;t bubbled up to the surface.”</p><p> So, what I kept on arguing is that, yes, the regulation has to be in play. And yes, there may be certain scenarios whereby AI requires higher scrutiny. But the regulation is still on the outcome. The regulation is still in the fact that, for example, it&#39;s a case of discrimination. You should not be discriminating; whether you&#39;re using a human-based process or an AI-based process is kind of beside the point. But I just want to emphasize that point, Sam, because it really goes back to what you were saying of, it&#39;s now teaching <em>us</em> things that we may have been, let&#39;s say, sometimes consciously ignorant of, sometimes inadvertently unaware of.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> David, tell us about your background. How did you end up where you are?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> If I roll back all the way to the beginning, and I&#39;m going to say this again with a big smile myself, how did I end up where I am? Detention. That&#39;s how I ended up here.</p><p> I must have been, what, 14, 15, 16 years old, and I got sent to the library because of detention. And, you know, if you&#39;re in a library, you have nothing better to do. I picked up a book on Prolog. Don&#39;t ask me why, from all the books I could have picked up, I picked up one about Prolog. And this is really before knowing anything about the whole world of, well, I guess in that case, it would be expert-based systems. And I started reading, and I just couldn&#39;t put it down. And that kind of triggered this exploration of, how can we better capture knowledge? How can we better learn?</p><p> And that obviously resulted in kind of learning a bit more about neural networks, AI. In fact, I was one of the first two students who took the degree of computer science with artificial intelligence. It was literally brand-new, from that perspective.</p><p> My Ph.D. thesis was about semantic models, so literally the representation and encapsulation of knowledge, effectively, and information; [it] was on learning musical patterns/music, or generating music from brain patterns. And the whole idea about that is essentially providing expert-based systems knowledge, if you think about it in that way, for people who, say, can&#39;t sit in front of a piano and play but are fully capable cognitively.</p><p> So that&#39;s kind of what brought me here. I know it&#39;s a very weird kind of journey. But yeah, I need to thank my literacy teacher: Thank you for sending me to detention.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> OK, so we&#39;ve got a segment where we&#39;re going to ask you some quick questions. What are you proudest of in terms of artificial intelligence? What have you done that you&#39;re proudest of?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Where to begin? What I&#39;m most proud of is the way we&#39;ve been able to graduate — and I literally mean that — from the academic world to the industrial world.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What worries you about AI? You&#39;ve mentioned some worries today. But what worries you?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> What worries me is I don&#39;t think we&#39;re fully appreciating what we&#39;re creating. I think we need to focus head on with the realization of what we&#39;re creating and what we&#39;re seeding for possibilities, for good and for bad.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your favorite activity that does not involve technology?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> SUP: stand-up paddling. Being on the water and just paddling away. It&#39;s extremely soothing. It&#39;s actually phenomenal exercise, for those who haven&#39;t tried.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I&#39;ve tried and I&#39;ve missed the stand-up part. I&#39;m OK with the paddling, but the stand-up seems to lead to trouble. What&#39;s the first career you wanted while you were sitting in detention? What did you want to be when you grew up?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> I wanted to be an astrophysicist.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your greatest wish for AI in the future? What are you hoping we can gain from this?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> I don&#39;t know. Self-actualization? I hope we learn more about ourselves. It&#39;s already giving us capabilities. I mean, for example, I&#39;m dyslexic. Thank heavens for auto spell-checkers!</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Well, thank you for taking the time. I think that there&#39;s a lot that you&#39;ve mentioned. I think we can go back to even examples of food 100 years ago. We had a terrible food cleanliness [problem], and now we have a supply chain we can trust. Perhaps we can build that same sort of supply chain with data. Thank you for taking the time to talk with us today. It&#39;s been a pleasure.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Thank you, Sam, Shervin.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah.谢谢。</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> And maybe, if I may just add another note, I think that&#39;s really the critical thing: It&#39;s AI <em>trust</em> . It&#39;s about trust.非常感谢。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Thanks for listening. Next time, Shervin and I talk with Naba Banerjee, head of trust product and operations at Airbnb, about how the travel platform uses AI and machine learning to make travel experiences safer.</p><p> <strong>Allison Ryder:</strong> Thanks for listening to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> .

These technologies are taking over more and more aspects of business as they seep into the collective consciousness. As Vox put it, generative AI is “ <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2023/1/5/23539055/generative-ai-chatgpt-stable-diffusion-lensa-dall-e">suddenly everywhere</a> ,” and it&#39;s poised to profoundly change daily life within organizations in many ways, particularly in the sphere of communication.</p><p> More than ever, when people receive texts, emails, or other digital messages, they have reason to wonder whether an actual human being wrote them. ChatGPT is even being used to write <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/chatgpt-is-being-used-to-write-emails-big-companies-are-embracing-it.html">custom messages</a> to individual executives on LinkedIn. In response, tools are being created to help people determine whether a message was really <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90830518/tools-to-detect-ai-generated-text-chatgpt">written by a human</a> . Some of these tools are made by the same companies whose technologies generate such text. But few people are likely to use these detectors in the short term, and even if they do, there will be a continuous cycle of AI-based text generators constantly working to outsmart the detectors.</p><p></p><p> The net result is clear: When it comes to digital communication, we&#39;re unlikely to trust most “personal” digital messages for a while to come. This is why, in working to build authentic relationships, sidestepping technology altogether has newfound power.</p><h3> Handwritten Messages Take on New Value</h3><p> Few people answer calls from unrecognized phone numbers these days. And executives are increasingly aware that AI is also being used to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/11/why-chatgpt-ai-are-taking-over-the-cold-call-salesforce-leader.html">schedule such calls</a> , which can make them feel like just another name on a list.</p><p> In an effort to connect with decision makers, I recently tried going a different route: I wrote notes by hand to several executives and dropped them in the mail. Some of these have led to very positive personal responses and meetings, and even contract discussions. These relationships are being built on <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-on-books/author-talks-susan-mcpherson-on-building-meaningful-relationships-in-business-and-in-life">meaningful foundations</a> that could lead to long-term business growth.</p><p> There have always been people who prefer to write business notes by hand, but it&#39;s never before carried such a significant connotation — that a real person has taken the time to write out a personalized message rather than choosing an easier option. And a recent study shows how powerful that can be: Researchers from business schools at the University of Maryland and Yonsei University in South Korea found that “presenting a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10949968221102306?journalCode=jnma">handwritten note</a> has a positive and significant effect on customer spending” and that “warmth underlies the key findings.”</p><h3> Humanizing Communication</h3><p></p><p> A similar principle applies to internal communication as well. Some managers now use technology for things like employee recognition and turn to generative AI to create and send complimentary messages to team members. While this may be helpful for overwhelmed and exhausted managers, it can also reduce the sense of meaning and personalization that employees may be looking for. This is why handwritten notes can be a powerful way for managers to show employees — especially <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-create-belonging-for-remote-workers/">remote workers</a> , who aren&#39;t in the office to receive such recognition face to face — their genuine appreciation.</p><p> Writing notes by hand may not be the right move for everyone — such as if someone&#39;s penmanship is particularly difficult to read. But there are other ways to personalize communication, including creating videos or voice memos tailored to a specific individual, or even leaving a voicemail if a phone call goes unanswered. Some people block off a time in their schedule and say, “I&#39;m going to keep this two-hour block open in hopes that you might want to chat. Reach out anytime within that time frame, and I&#39;ll drop whatever I&#39;m doing.”</p><p> The key is to always be on the lookout for ways to emphasize our humanity in our communications. The more we do that, the less of an interloper AI will be in our relationships — and the more authentic and rewarding they&#39;ll become.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/amid-growing-ai-humanize-communication-to-strengthen-relationships/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Four-Day Workweek: How to Make It Work in Your Organization</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-four-day-workweek-how-to-make-it-work-in-your-organization/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-four-day-workweek-how-to-make-it-work-in-your-organization/#comments</comments><pubDate> Thu, 29 Jun 2023 11:00:45 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew Barnes. <p>Andrew Barnes is the founder of Perpetual Guardian, New Zealand&#39;s largest corporate trustee company.

It would be crucial, he knew, to still deliver the same output, customer service, and profitability. He landed on what he calls the 100-80-100 rule: “We pay 100% income for 80% time, as long as we get 100% output.”</p><p> The trial made global headlines — “We stopped counting when we got over about 14,000” — and Barnes was inundated with requests for advice. He started a not-for-profit organization and began helping companies on their own pilots, providing virtual workshops, mentoring others, and networking opportunities. The results, which now include data from 91 companies and 3,500 workers, have been analyzed by a team of academics.</p><p></p><p> And those results have been universally positive. “Not only are 90%-plus of employees saying they like the four-day week — and, in fact, they really don&#39;t want to go back — but companies are seeing material benefits in productivity,” Barnes said.</p><p></p><p> Barnes talked about the experiments and their findings during <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/series/work-23-the-big-shift/">Work/23</a> , an <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> symposium held in May 2023. He wasn&#39;t able to get to all of the questions from attendees during the event, so he answers some of them below. (Questions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity.)</p><h6> Is there any research comparing a four-day workweek versus five reduced days (at six hours a day, for example)? Do the results suggest that four days is the better way?</h6><p> Both are viewed by us as four-day weeks! The clickbait is “a four-day week,” but in reality, we talk about <em>reduced hours working</em> — the 100-80-100 rule. The key is that employees get the time off that&#39;s important to <em>them</em> . In my company, we have some people who take a full day off, others who take two half days, and others, often working parents, who work compressed hours five days a week. That schedule helps with child care issues, which a single day off would not address.</p><p></p><h6> How do you measure the success of the four-day workweek from the perspective of employees and teams when it comes to productivity versus company results like revenue?</h6><p> Obviously, it&#39;s easier to see whether there&#39;s improvement in company results such as profitability and revenue. We often find that people ask how we measure employee productivity. This, of course, raises the question of how productivity is <em>currently</em> being measured. All too often, it quickly becomes clear that many organizations use time as a surrogate for productivity.</p><p> Part of our program is helping organizations develop other productivity measures so that improvements can be more clearly assessed. A key part of this is helping employees identify the unproductive parts of their day. Simply eliminating unproductive activity will, by definition, increase productive activity.</p><h6> I find that much of what fills the time outside of tactical work are personal conversations and relationship-building. Do those things diminish when you move to a four-day week?</h6><p> No. In fact, the evidence suggests that these improve. By combining policies such as quiet hours (deep work), fewer and shorter meetings, and better social facilities (in our case, a better staff breakout area), we find that staff cohesion and team-building actually increase. By reinforcing that staff members need to work together to allow everyone to achieve the objective of reduced hours of working, there is often more time for these interactions, not less.</p><h6> Gallup&#39;s US panel data from 2020 shows that employees who work four days per week have higher well-being than those who work five or six days. However, Gallup&#39;s data also shows that the <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/358346/gallup-workplace-insights-learned-2021.aspx">percentage who are actively disengaged rises</a> among those who work fewer days. Gallup says that employees who already feel disconnected from their employer are likely to drift even further away. What do you advise companies to do to address this?</h6><p> In the context of a society where many employees work from home and are therefore separated from the usual workplace culture, the impact of reduced hours working is actually minimal. It is also necessary to differentiate between the old style of four-day-week working (where only a few worked four days and most worked five, often with the former receiving lower pay) and the new model, where everyone works a reduced schedule with no reduction in pay. Companies in our trials report significant increases in engagement scores. In the case of our own company, scores increased by 40% — to levels the researchers said were the highest they had ever seen in New Zealand.</p><h6> What differences do you see in the effects of the four-day workweek on people doing different kinds of work — say, between software developers and creative workers versus salespeople?</h6><p> Obviously, there are practical differences in how the work is actually done, but the impact on employees across the companies in our various trials appears to be consistent. Employees report being more productive, more rested, less stressed, and happier. It is a thesis of mine that healthier, happier, more rested employees are more productive. Who would have thought!</p><h6> What kind of training and prep do companies do to introduce a four-day week?</h6><p> We encourage organizations to take a couple of months to plan and prepare before initiating the six-month trial. Both the preparation and trial allow organizations to flex the process to find out what works for them. The bulk of the efficiencies and improvements come from empowering staff members and creating a culture where individuals recognize that they have to work together to reduce wasted time. In my own organization and in many others, training was therefore limited and largely unnecessary.</p><h6> How do you build employee trust to successfully achieve the stated goals when implementing a reduced workweek?</h6><p> Put simply, if trust does not exist prior to the implementation of the four-day week, it is unlikely the implementation will be successful.</p><h6> We run a 24-hour operation. Have you seen this done in organizations such as this, and what is the impact on the staffing numbers? Don&#39;t you have to increase the number of employees?</h6><p> In many ways, it is easier to introduce a four-day week into a seven-day, 24-hour operation, as the organization is already running shift patterns. A reduced-hour week simply requires shifts to be reconfigured. Remember that our thesis is that productivity actually increases, so in some operations, each shift can be staffed with fewer employees.</p><p> Alternatively, in people-heavy organizations such as medical facilities, it is likely that more staff will have to be recruited. The savings here, though, come from reduced recruitment time and turnover, fewer sick days (67% fewer, according to the trial data) with reduced impact on productivity, and lower costs for expensive temporary staff. Evidence also suggests that outcomes improve.</p><h6> Have you done this work with clients in consulting industries? What kind of success have you had there? How was billable time affected?</h6><p>是的。 PR firms, legal firms, and consultancies have all moved to the four-day week. Billable hours is often quoted as an impediment, but it is simply a mechanism to allocate costs. The clients pay on value and outcomes. If you can now do the work quicker under the four-day model, just adjust the cost allocation units. The client doesn&#39;t care. A simple example: Two consultants produce an identical piece of work. One takes an hour, one half an hour. Why would the client pay twice as much for the former? In reality, billable hours get adjusted in order to align the bill with the amount the client will pay.</p><p></p><h6> What obstacles did you encounter when making the switch to a four-day workweek?</h6><p> The principal obstacle was that members of my leadership team were highly skeptical, if not hostile, and my board universally hated it. Bringing leadership on the journey and helping them to walk the talk is critical for the project&#39;s success. I have set out the usual obstacles in various papers that are on the <a href="https://www.4dayweek.com/">4dayweek.com</a> website and in my book, <cite>The 4 Day Week</cite> .</p><h6> Can you provide sample policies used by companies?</h6><p> The 4dayweek.com website has lots of helpful material, including the research and a white paper. That white paper includes the policies we introduced at Perpetual Guardian to implement the reduced schedule.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-four-day-workweek-how-to-make-it-work-in-your-organization/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 1</slash:comments></item><item><title> Communication Is at the Heart of Positive Employee Relationships</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/communication-is-at-the-heart-of-positive-employee-relationships/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/communication-is-at-the-heart-of-positive-employee-relationships/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 27 Jun 2023 11:00:12 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Ben Laker. <p>Ben Laker ( <a href="https://twitter.com/drbenlaker">@drbenlaker</a> ) is a professor of leadership at the University of Reading&#39;s Henley Business School and coauthor of <cite>Too Proud to Lead: How Hubris Can Destroy Effective Leadership and What to Do About It</cite> (Bloomsbury, 2021).</p> ]]>; </dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Communication]]></category><category><![CDATA[Employee Recruitment and Retention]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership]]></category><category><![CDATA[Skills & Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Talent Management]]></category><category><![CDATA[Workplace, Teams, & Culture]]></category><description><![CDATA[In today’s competitive job market, companies must focus not only on finding the best candidates but also on fostering positive relationships with them, starting with the first step of the recruitment process through every stage of employment.

How leaders communicate with prospective and current staff members can significantly affect their organization&#39;s reputation as a place where people want to work. After all, having a culture that incorporates transparent and open communication is essential to building trust and loyalty.</p><p></p><h3> The Importance of Communication Skills in Hiring</h3><p> According to research, oral and written <a href="https://newmanu.edu/top-5-skills-employers-look-for">communication skills</a> are among the top five most sought-after attributes in potential new hires: Employers want workers who can effectively convey their ideas, perspectives, and knowledge.</p><p> Employees with strong communication skills are able to express their thoughts and emotions clearly, making them more efficient in the workplace. Additionally, they are better equipped to manage challenging conversations or negotiations with clients or coworkers through their ability to listen attentively, provide accurate feedback, and resolve conflicts.</p><p> Good communication skills also foster a better company culture: Employees create a stronger bond when they are able to effectively communicate with one another. This not only creates a cohesive and productive work environment but also increases their loyalty to the organization.</p><p></p><p> Hiring managers should screen resumes for clear and concise writing abilities and pay attention to how candidates speak during interviews to assess their communication skills. If appropriate, they should request written work samples before an interview to assess candidates&#39; writing capabilities. Candidates who can effectively communicate their qualifications and skills in writing will likely be able to better articulate them orally during the interview.</p><p></p><h3> The Hiring Process: Clear Expectations and Open Dialogue</h3><p> All parties involved in the hiring process need to be clear and concise when conveying information. Hiring managers must clearly define expectations, roles, and responsibilities when talking to potential candidates: One study found that 48% of employees who left a job early did so because their employer&#39;s <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/study-48-of-workers-have-left-a-job-because-it-didnt-meet-expectations/551179/">expectations were unclear</a> .</p><p> Establishing an open dialogue with candidates during the hiring process is essential for building trust and gaining insight into their communication styles. By using a combination of open-ended questions, role-playing scenarios, and exercises that focus on communication, employers can better understand each candidate&#39;s approach to their work and create a foundation for a strong working relationship.</p><p> Once a new hire is brought on board, providing feedback on their communication skills can help them understand what they are already doing well and where they can improve.</p><h3> Navigating Layoffs: Transparency, Empathy, and Compliance</h3><p> In an era marked by recession fears and downsizing, how companies handle layoffs can have a profound impact on their reputation and employee morale. To maintain a positive relationship with employees during layoffs, employers should prioritize clear, honest, and timely communication. This means providing as much advance notice as possible to all employees, explaining the rationale behind the decision, and offering support to those affected, such as career counseling, resume preparation, and job search assistance. By treating employees with respect and empathy, companies can minimize negative impacts and maintain a favorable reputation.</p><p> Furthermore, organizations must comply with laws governing layoffs to ensure the fair treatment of employees and avoid legal repercussions. Employers should be aware of their state and local laws to ensure that they meet minimum notice requirements and other regulations. Consider the case of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, where the initial decision to <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/bed-bath-beyond-to-pay-out-severance-to-1300-workers-after-initially-bypassing-law/ar-AA1aKgBG">bypass severance laws</a> led to lawsuits — and thus more negative publicity for a company that had recently declared bankruptcy — followed by a reversal of the decision.</p><h3> Creating a Culture of Open Communication</h3><p></p><p> The key to fostering positive relationships with candidates and employees alike lies in creating a culture of open communication. This means valuing transparency, honesty, and empathy, no matter the stage of employment. Companies should also encourage open dialogue among all levels of the organization, providing opportunities for employees to voice their concerns and ideas. This can help to establish a sense of trust, promote a collaborative work environment, and, ultimately, contribute to the company&#39;s overall success.</p><p> In addition to fostering open communication, employers should invest in training and development programs that help employees enhance their communication skills. This benefits the individuals, contributes to a more effective and cohesive work environment, and can, ultimately, lead to greater success for the organization and a more productive work environment overall. By prioritizing communication at every stage of the employee life cycle, managers can foster a positive work culture in which individuals feel valued, supported, and empowered to succeed.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/communication-is-at-the-heart-of-positive-employee-relationships/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> It&#39;s Time to Face the Three Challenges of Learning</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/its-time-to-face-the-three-challenges-of-learning/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/its-time-to-face-the-three-challenges-of-learning/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 26 Jun 2023 11:00:08 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Lynda Gratton. <p>Lynda Gratton ( <a href="https://twitter.com/lyndagratton">@lyndagratton</a> ) is a professor of management practice at London Business School and founder of the advisory practice HSM.

But at a recent research workshop that my team and I ran with executives from over 40 companies, it became clear that organizations&#39; traditional learning models are facing pressure from the emergence of new work models. The participants identified these three learning challenges as the most acute:</p><p> <strong>1. Increased workloads have reduced learning time.</strong> Eighty-eight percent of executives at our workshop chose workload pressures as one of their top challenges. They said that many employees, particularly those managing others, feel that their workloads have significantly increased in recent years. Some shared sensitive internal data that suggests burnout has increased during that period. The net result of higher workloads is that employees not only lack the headspace for learning but also feel pressured to prioritize work tasks over learning activities. Battling this challenge will require leaders to maximize the value of any available learning time.</p><p></p><p> <strong>2. Hybrid work has increased the complexity of learning.</strong> Two-thirds (66%) of executives said that flexibility in terms of where and when employees work is an important challenge. Executives fretted that employees may not be connected in moments that matter for formal and informal learning. Managers reported that they find it more difficult to identify development opportunities for remote employees and that they fear that remote work is having a negative impact on how people share tacit knowledge. Indeed, research shows that 47% of employees are concerned about <a href="https://newsroom.poly.com/English/press-releases/news-details/2021/Poly-Evolution-of-the-Workplace-Report-Highlights-Need-for-Work-Equity-and-Total-Meeting-Equality-for-Hybrid-Workers/">missing out on informal learning opportunities</a> while working from home. Addressing this challenge will require leaders to build a robust learning strategy in a hybrid business environment.</p><p> <strong>3. A tightening labor market has brought skill shortages.</strong> Sixty-five percent of executives identified finding workers with specialized skills as a major challenge. Many of the executives we spoke with said their companies have historically looked to the external labor market for these specialty hires. However, as the market tightens, particularly for hard-to-find digital skills, the focus has shifted to boosting the skills of internal employees. Reskilling has always been seen as important, but now it&#39;s critical. Tackling this challenge will require leaders to align business strategy with expertly executed upskilling and reskilling initiatives.</p><p> While these are tough challenges to face, executives also acknowledge how important it is to solve them. Skill shortages are one reason, but there is also the significant motivational impact of successful corporate learning.</p><p> In today&#39;s volatile labor market, where employees are quick to move from one job to a more advantageous opportunity, the chance to learn something new that will be valuable in the future is a central reason why they stay. Indeed, studies show that 76% of employees say they would <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work-is-just-work">stay at their jobs longer</a> if they could benefit from learning and development support.</p><p> Moreover, in the face of growing concerns about workplace inequalities, there is a perception that <a href="https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/files/5552_en.pdf">skills-based learning</a> can help to significantly reduce them. This is particularly the case for employees who are not highfliers, who don&#39;t have a college degree or an educational certificate, or who have historically been excluded.</p><p></p><h3> How Companies Are Relearning How to Learn</h3><p> So here is the paradox: At the very time that learning is seen as a crucial part of the business strategy of many companies, those tasked with delivering on a learning agenda describe significant uphill battles.</p><p> Still, I&#39;m seeing experiments by managers who are rising to the occasion by trying out new ways of learning and new ways of delivering learning that can be models for others in similar situations. Here&#39;s how they&#39;re addressing the three essential concerns.</p><h4> 1. They&#39;re using personalization to maximize the value of learning time.</h4><p> One way of making sure every hour devoted to learning counts is by closely aligning learning with the specific needs of the learner. This kind of personalization is typically hard to deliver at scale. But experimentation with virtual and online instruction has opened up routes toward personalizing learning.</p><p> One approach is to develop learning plans, or pathways. At the Dublin-based law firm Matheson, the learning team offers 12 learning pathways (that change annually) from which employees can choose, such as the client experience or environmental, social, and corporate governance issues. Each pathway is a blend of participation in core projects and tutorials delivered by employees who are subject matter experts. One important innovation is that the pathways are available to both lawyers and business service employees. A member of the learning team told me that the approach is designed to break down the traditional siloes between those communities and embed learning into the natural flow of work.</p><p></p><p> Other organizations have approached the task of personalized learning by using AI-driven career diagnostics. Accenture developed an AI tool called Job Buddy to help employees build individual learning plans based on data about themselves, their group, and the external labor market. The tool was designed to use machine learning algorithms to suggest career paths and upskilling opportunities based on an individual&#39;s current job, skills, and experience. Following this individual diagnostic, a learning platform provided resources such as online courses, workshops, and mentoring programs.</p><h4> 2. They&#39;re leaning into the hybrid experience.</h4><p> The pandemic increased the prevalence of hybrid working and set the scene for learning to be as flexible as work is.</p><p></p><p> At global online marketplace Etsy, peer-to-peer learning has always been a priority. Zofia Ciechowska, Etsy&#39;s vice president of strategy and operations, told me that learning is viewed as an opportunity for employees and even vendors to share their knowledge, skills, or craft with the community. Employees have run courses on a vast range of topics as diverse as how to navigate the Tokyo subway system and how to make a candle. The sheer variety of courses is a reflection of Etsy&#39;s culture and mission of keeping commerce “human” by enabling people to showcase their talents and educate one another.</p><p> Crucially, in the spirit of hybrid work, Etsy&#39;s workshops are delivered both face to face and online. Employees, whatever their work schedules, are able to participate fully. This rich community-based learning program has successfully driven informal connections, piqued curiosity, and resulted in robust employee engagement scores.</p><p> The learning team said it has been fascinating to see the benefits of learning flow in both directions — for the person being taught as well as those delivering the courses. Employees get a chance to show off their passions and engage with their peers by sharing knowledge they are proud of.</p><h4> 3. They&#39;re reducing skill shortages by focusing on transferable skills.</h4><p> In the face of tightening labor markets and skill shortages, the most obvious learning strategy is to focus on reskilling current employees rather than recruiting new ones. The challenge, as many executives shared, is that this is fiendishly hard, particularly at scale.</p><p> As an international bank, HSBC is changing constantly, and reskilling is essential to delivering on its strategic plan. The bank is working to ensure that all employees are equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to grow in their careers so they can be successful now and in the future.</p><p> The bank recently rolled out a skills-based development program for internal candidates who want to pursue a career in wealth services. By spending 20% of their working time over a period of three to nine months, participants were able to identify, assess, and develop the transferable skills they needed to move into relationship manager roles in the bank&#39;s wealth and private banking services businesses.</p><p></p><p> “This pioneering program is helping us build a strategic talent pipeline for a very important part of our business,” said Laura Powell, HSBC&#39;s global head of HR for wealth and personal banking and global functions. HSBC plans to extend the program to external candidates later this year.</p><p></p><p> Only 2% of executives who were part of our research workshop on learning said they believe that instructor-led learning will be a priority for their organization going forward. Instead, 39% said that “in the workflow” learning would be more important.</p><p> What has come through crystal clear is that while some of the more traditional forms of learning are diminishing, experiments and new projects are demonstrating how significant challenges can be overcome.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/its-time-to-face-the-three-challenges-of-learning/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> How to Help Employees With ADHD Address the Challenges of Remote Work</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-help-employees-with-adhd-address-the-challenges-of-remote-work/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-help-employees-with-adhd-address-the-challenges-of-remote-work/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 22 Jun 2023 11:00:24 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Maria Hamdani, Najma Hamdani, and Maitraye Das. <p>Maria Hamdani, Ph.D., is a professor of management in the College of Business at the University of Akron.

As organizations refine their virtual work practices, it is important to ensure that they are inclusive of neurodivergent employees. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is among the most prevalent neurodivergent conditions. While some individuals with ADHD may find that remote work is well suited to their needs and gives them a greater degree of control over their work environment, others may find that remote work presents unique challenges. Remote work often lacks concrete time cues and can introduce different kinds of distractions and methods for sharing information than an in-person office setting, which can be challenging for some people with ADHD. If these challenges are not managed effectively, they can lead to a host of issues, such as burnout, anxiety, productivity loss, demotivation, and, ultimately, quitting. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p> Managers can work with employees with ADHD to implement simple strategies to better tailor remote work to their needs. Because employees may be undiagnosed or choose not to disclose their neurodivergent conditions, the five evidence-based interventions we suggest below can help foster better remote work practices to the benefit of all employees. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> But before we go into more detail about those, let&#39;s briefly discuss ADHD.</p><p></p><h3> Understanding ADHD</h3><p> ADHD stems from structural differences in brain regions and variations in cellular and neural mechanisms that pose challenges to the daily self-regulation of goal-directed behaviors. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> Consequently, executive functions such as attention, time management, working memory, response inhibition, and mental processing of rewards operate differently to varying degrees in people with ADHD. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> These executive processes work together to help translate our bigger goals, visions, knowledge, and skills into daily goal-directed actions across all aspects of our lives, including work. Some individuals with ADHD may find that their differences disrupt these goal-oriented actions, even when they possess a clear vision, knowledge, skills, and motivation. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> Though medication can help regulate concentration, inhibition, and working memory, inclusive work practices and accommodations across five daily behavior dimensions can help to unlock potential and create the conditions for success. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p> ADHD is often underdiagnosed in adults due to the misconception that it is only a childhood diagnosis or one that all children eventually grow out of. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> Gender and racial disparities in underdiagnosis introduce additional complications. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> Undiagnosed and untreated ADHD can lead to secondary anxiety and depression, as well as significant and sometimes devastating costs at both an individual and collective level in terms of lost productivity, health care expenses, unemployment, justice system impacts, and spillover costs to family members. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a> A proper ADHD diagnosis and inclusive work practices can reduce these costs and enable individuals with ADHD to live fuller work and personal lives.</p><p></p><p> Gender differences in ADHD are frequently overlooked, which has widened the diagnosis and treatment gap for women. <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a> Males are three times more likely to receive an ADHD diagnosis than females, and they are typically diagnosed at a much younger age. <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a> Many early educators mistakenly believe that ADHD is mainly a diagnosis for boys and thus under-identify it in girls. Males generally present with hyperactivity and external displays of problems (such as classroom disruptions or fighting with peers), whereas females often internalize the symptoms of inattention, exhibiting low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. This makes detection and referral more challenging among females, who may be misdiagnosed with anxiety or depression rather than ADHD. In the workplace, women with ADHD may feel overwhelmed and unsupported, and consequent low self-esteem and anxiety about deadlines or project details, or worries about making mistakes, can lead to decreased productivity, weakened performance, and missed career opportunities.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> ADHD Resources for Better Understanding</h4><ul><li> National Institute of Mental Health: “ <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/adhd-what-you-need-to-know">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Adults: What You Need to Know</a> ”</li><li> Children and Adults With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: “ <a href="https://chadd.org/for-adults/diagnosis-of-adhd-in-adults/">Diagnosis of ADHD in Adults</a> ”</li><li> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: “ <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/diagnosis.html">Symptoms and Diagnosis of ADHD</a> ”</li><li> Russell A.

Aligning virtual work practices around these suggestions can enhance the productivity of all employees. That said, neurodivergent employees often know what conditions are most conducive to their effectiveness at work and should be consulted on changes to work practices that affect them. </p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand-column"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Inclusive Virtual Work Practices to Enhance Productivity</h4><p class="caption"> In remote work environments, leaders can adopt these approaches to enhance the productivity of all employees, whether they&#39;ve been diagnosed with ADHD or not. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-06-22_Hamdani_Figure.png" alt="Inclusive Virtual Work Practices to Enhance Productivity"><br /></article></aside></div><p></p><h4> 1. Time Management and Planning</h4><p> While individuals with ADHD can effectively formulate a big goal or vision, some of them might struggle with daily minutiae, in large part due to <em>time blindness</em> , which is a skewed perception of time. <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a> This can lead to difficulty organizing activities in a timely manner to fulfill daily tasks and meet demands, along with procrastination, missed deadlines, forgotten and unfinished tasks, and difficulties with multitasking. Time management can be especially challenging in remote work models due to the lack of external time cues, such as driving to work or lunch breaks, and weaker daily supervision and accountability in these settings.</p><p> To support planning and time management, managers should work with their reports to translate big goals into daily, actionable chunks using an easily accessible daily planner. They can also create a daily accountability system, such as peer check-ins or daily progress charts. Using tangible markers of the passage of time, such as putting a clock on one&#39;s home office desk, scheduling daily reminders to start a task, and setting timers to finish tasks, followed by breaks, can help as well. Whenever possible, managers should consider offering extended deadlines to factor in difficulties with time perception.</p><p> When working with virtual teams, managers should balance meeting schedules and productivity expectations. <a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a> Think carefully about how many weekly team meetings are necessary and, when possible, use asynchronous communication to help employees perform the assigned tasks at their preferred time. Implementing a hybrid model in which people go to the office some days to attend meetings and remain home (or in a distraction-free office space) other days for focused work can be a viable option to balance productivity with meeting schedules.</p><h4> 2. Mental Organization and Working Memory</h4><p> Due to differences in their working memory, some adults with ADHD may benefit from using external tools to do simple calculations, keep multiple pieces of information in mind while solving a problem, organize their thoughts while communicating, and remember to return calls or keep appointments. To support mental organization, encourage the use of external tools that bring important information into one&#39;s visual field, such as daily checklists, Post-it notes, written instructions, color-coded visual cues, and clearly visible deadlines.</p><p> Remote work can be mentally taxing and feel overwhelming due to the speed and volume of information sharing. Having to attend multiple virtual meetings — which can incorporate a mix of video, audio, text chat, and file sharing — within a single day can be especially demanding, particularly for neurodivergent employees.</p><p> Rather than creating a competitive atmosphere where everyone vies for a chance to be heard, consider ways to make virtual meetings more accommodating and inclusive. For example, meeting organizers can formalize routines for taking turns and allowing people time to gather their thoughts before speaking; schedule pauses for questions and answers; and turn off chat features for large groups, to minimize distracting cross-talk. Sharing materials in advance and distributing notes, recordings, and transcripts afterward can also be especially helpful for those who find it difficult to take notes while simultaneously paying attention to conversations.</p><h4> 3. Self-Motivation on Prolonged Tasks</h4><p> Certain individuals with ADHD might find it tough to stay motivated and focused during lengthy tasks without immediate rewards. Managers can encourage these employees to break down larger tasks into smaller steps, complete with mini deadlines and rewards. For instance, set 30-minute or one-hour goals and celebrate each accomplishment with small rewards, such as a cup of coffee or a short stroll outside. It&#39;s important to set timers for these breaks to return to work; the <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-managers-can-help-workers-tackle-digital-distractions/">Pomodoro Technique</a> can serve as a helpful model.</p><p> To combat “Zoom fatigue,” allow for transition time in between back-to-back meetings, and provide breaks during longer meetings to regulate focus. This approach will help prevent employees from zoning out and can help them to recharge their mental energy.</p><h4> 4. Inhibition of Impulses</h4><p> Individuals with ADHD can struggle with impulse control, causing them to react inappropriately, make impulsive comments, interrupt others, talk excessively, be emotionally reactive, experience difficulty waiting, or not recognize and fix mistakes quickly. These challenges can be even more prominent in remote settings, where social cues are limited.</p><p> Employing a coaching and feedback model can increase employees&#39; self-awareness about impulsive behaviors. <a id="reflink14" class="reflink" href="#ref14">14</a> Rapport-building practices, such as the use of a workstyle preference survey, can help managers discover ways to increase productivity and minimize frustration for neurodivergent employees. <a id="reflink15" class="reflink" href="#ref15">15</a> Remember to be compassionate and give employees grace; behaviors such as zoning out or speaking out of turn aren&#39;t due to laziness or ill intentions but rather stem from differences in how information is processed.</p><p></p><p> Consider posting guidelines of best practices in a visible location to provide a clear framework for action. Similarly, incorporate productivity strategies like digital <a href=" https://chadd.org/adhd-news/adhd-news-adults/could-a-body-double-help-you-increase-your-productivity/">body doubling</a> , in which employees can accomplish tasks that they find frustrating by working alongside others through virtual coworking apps (such as Flown or Focusmate) to help maintain focus on the tasks at hand. <a id="reflink16" class="reflink" href="#ref16">16</a> In addition, encouraging regular physical exercise and calming practices in daily routines is essential to help people replenish the mental resources required for self-control and inhibition of impulses.</p><h4> 5. Attention, Concentration, and Focus</h4><p> Remote work is fraught with <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-managers-can-help-workers-tackle-digital-distractions/">distractions</a> and requires special considerations to enable increased focus. To enhance focus and minimize boredom, consider providing adjustable desks, knee chairs, wobble stools, and active seating. Schedule breaks to help people avoid zoning out, and, when they&#39;re in the office, provide access to quiet spaces to minimize distractions. Consider offering assistive technology to help with task completion, such as dictation tools, audio recording software, and noise-canceling headphones, which can help all employees with productivity in remote and hybrid settings.</p><p></p><p> Our research has uncovered additional strategies that can help reduce distractions in virtual workspaces. <a id="reflink17" class="reflink" href="#ref17">17</a> Having meeting attendees use a uniform or blurred background can help minimize background noise and decrease visual triggers. Giving employees the option to turn off their cameras (for at least some part of the meeting) can be helpful to those who may become overly concerned about or distracted by their own facial expressions. Managers should also be mindful of the flurry of information that is available during online meetings and should be OK with employees asking for clarification in order to refocus after a moment of distraction.</p><p></p><p> ADHD can affect people&#39;s ability to perform in many areas of their lives, including online work settings. Individuals with the diagnosis have different needs, ranging from not requiring any accommodations to needing reasonable personalized accommodations. The gender and racial differences in diagnosis, barriers to accessing care, and stigma have exacerbated ADHD&#39;s costs to individuals&#39; overall well-being in the personal and professional domains. By adopting inclusive work practices, organizations can better support and tap into the talents of a diverse workforce that might otherwise be marginalized and underutilized.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-help-employees-with-adhd-address-the-challenges-of-remote-work/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
