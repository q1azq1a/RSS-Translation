这在许多情况下可能是可以接受的。 <a id="reflink19" class="reflink" href="#ref19">19</a>另一种需要考虑的策略是时间转移：在一天中碳强度往往较低的时间执行要求较高的工作负载，例如训练期。</p><p><strong>重新架构：</strong>构建功能良好的人工智能模型需要强大的软件/硬件架构，旨在扩展和微调模型，同时保持低延迟响应时间。选择有效的机器学习模型架构（例如稀疏模型）可以提高机器学习质量，同时将计算量减少 3 到 10 倍。 <a id="reflink20" class="reflink" href="#ref20">20</a>一旦人工智能模型投入生产，从性能、安全性和最终用户体验的角度管理技术债务至关重要。管理不善或忽略技术债务而支持功能改进可能会导致其迅速积累并带来严重的技术风险，包括性能缓慢，质量不佳，意外停机时间，数据丢失甚至安全漏洞。只有某些应用程序或AI模型才能重新设计。不过，当机会出现时，至关重要的是，研究更有效的机器学习模型体系结构以确保质量更好的同时减少计算。</p><h3>其他AI可持续性实践</h3><p>除了三个R之外，AI领导者还必须注意以下途径，以提高可持续性。</p><p><strong>数据管理：</strong>数字数据生产正在迅速加速。在2022年，世界估计有97个Zettabytes或97万亿千兆的数据。到2025年，这个数字可能几乎翻了一番，达到181个<a id="reflink21" class="reflink" href="#ref21">Zettabyt。21</a>大多数数据都是用于一次使用的，再也不会被使用，但可以保存在占用空间并使用大量电力的服务器上。因此，减少不必要的“黑暗数据”的负责数据管理实践对于可持续的AI开发和部署至关重要。较大的模型不一定等同于更好的模型；随着时间的流逝，性能会恶化。通过将数据存储和处理重新定位到实施更节能的冷却并由可再生能源供电的数据中心，以及实施数据压缩，重复数据删除和归档性数据的数据，可以将能源消耗和环境影响最小化。</p><p><strong>教育和意识：</strong> AI领导者可以通过教育员工，合作伙伴，客户和公众对AI的环境影响来促进对环境负责的AI实践。这些影响尚未得到广泛的理解，即使单个chatgpt查询可以比常规的Google搜索产生的碳多100倍，诸如ChatGpt这样的工具的简易可用性看起来等同于查询搜索引擎。 <a id="reflink22" class="reflink" href="#ref22">22</a>组织和决策者应对AI的环境后果，他们就越会寻找具有较低环境影响和压力AI提供者的解决方案，以采用更可持续的实践。</p><p></p><p><strong>合规性：</strong> AI领导者将需要关注围绕能源效率和电子废物管理及其对技术投资的影响的新兴法规和最佳实践。总部位于美国的非营利性贸易协会scultableIt.org发布了针对其业务可持续性影响的有史以来的第一个标准。一般性和注重人工智能立法都正在出现，例如欧盟公司的可持续发展指令及其<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence">人工智能法案</a>，该法预计将在2024年完成并生效。在美国，美国证券交易委员会的碳披露规则正在审理中，加利福尼亚州最近通过了两项法律，这些法律将要求公司提交年度公开报告，以披露其直接，间接和供应链温室气体的排放，并由独立且经验丰富的第三方提供商进行验证。</p><p></p><p></p><p>生成AI模型的广泛采用迫切需要行业中的所有参与者，包括AI的经理和用户，以对这项有前途的技术的环境和社会影响承担更大的责任。</p><p>遵循本文概述的可持续性AI实践可以帮助建立更可持续的AI生态系统。通过找到方法来最大程度地减少我们的AI开发和部署过程消耗的能源和自然资源，并在讨论AI的讨论中更多地关注可持续性问题，我们可以利用这项技术的力量，同时最大程度地减少其对地球和社会的负面影响。</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/tackling-ais-climate-change-problem/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>为更透明的可持续发展报告做好准备</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/get-ready-for-more-transparent-sustainability-reporting/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/get-ready-for-more-transparent-sustainability-reporting/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 12 Dec 2023 12:55:56 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Richard Barker. <p>理查德·巴克（Richard Barker）是牛津大学赛德商学院（Saïd商学院）休假的国际可持续发展标准委员会的全职成员。本文表达了作者的个人观点，而不是ISSB的官方立场。</p> ]]>; </dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Environmental Sustainability]]></category><category><![CDATA[Financial Reporting]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investor Relations]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sustainability Metrics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Operations]]></category><category><![CDATA[Strategy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sustainability]]></category><description><![CDATA[Traci Daberko Rigorous sustainability-related financial disclosure is coming.

与全球可持续性报告实践的自愿结盟本身将影响SEC的规则制定。 SEC的作用是帮助确保市场提供投资者需要的物质信息，并以通过成本效益测试的方式进行。如果已经围绕测量和报告达成共识，报告的成本较低，对投资者的收益更大，并且物质信息更容易获得。</p><p>如上所述，业务领导者还必须警惕某些法规的域外范围。 9月初，加利福尼亚通过立法，要求任何外部公司在该州开展业务，并产生超过10亿美元的年收入。同时，目前，国际关注的重点是欧盟的ESRS要求，这些要求比预期的要深得多，更广泛。有12个标准，详细涵盖了一系列环境，社会和治理披露。 ESR的范围扩展到“双重重要性”，这意味着不仅向投资者报告，还向所有其他利益相关者报告有关其材料的问题。</p><p></p><h3>加紧满足严格可持续性报告的要求</h3><p>随着授权的公司报告的扩展为包括可持续性问题，以下指南可以帮助您制定一项计划以构建必要的功能。</p><p><strong>不要停止您已经在做的事情。</strong>您可能已经以某种形式进行了可持续性报告，应用了SASB，TCFD或全球报告计划（GRI）和/或向CDP报告。您需要以这些做法为基础，但是您已经在正确的道路上。</p><p><strong>不要让完美成为善良的敌人。</strong>在自愿披露的领域中，投资者想要的是您可以合理提供的。请记住，可持续性数据仅间接相关。投资者不想知道您的温室气体排放，因为他们想知道他们的存在如何影响您的财务状况。为此，对排放的合理估计通常足够好，并且通过使用行业平均值，通常不难实现。您应该谨慎地传达估计的基础，并且不应夸大您对测量的信心。适当利用安全港的规定。您的投资者不想要的是什么，这将传达您不透明的，您没有有关业务或两者兼有的物质信息。这两个都是投资者不投资的好理由。</p><p><strong>与财务报告保持一致。</strong>如果您的可持续发展报告与您的财务报告和投资者演讲分开，那么您将缺少一个技巧。投资者想了解您与可持续性相关的地位和绩效如何影响您的财务前景。您可以用金融语言表达与可持续性相关的指标和目标，越好。例如，拥有净零温室气排放的目标是一回事。制定过渡计划是另一个量化将需要的资本支出的过渡计划，并指导投资者了解当前和预期的损益表效应。</p><p></p><p><strong>专注于气候，并为SEC要求做好准备。</strong>由于气候是主要的可持续性问题，因此排放是SEC监管的重点。如果您尚未在与气候相关的报告之上，那么在某个时候，您需要做好准备，包括准备对外部进行审核。此外，气候很可能是您在可持续性报告中最好的起点。它影响所有公司，测量实践相对确定，市场理解相对较高。而且，如果您可以做好气候报告，那么您将建立可持续性报告的大多数其他方面所需的功能，例如整个价值链中的关系和数据系统，以及将可持续性数据转化为投资者评估的财务影响的艺术。要拥有这个基础，您将需要将数据和控制系统扩展到直接控制的操作之外，因为只有在价值链环境中才能理解可持续性绩效。因此，您应该开发（材料）范围3温室气体排放报告，无论SEC是否要求它。一旦范围1和2披露是广泛的，这将变得更容易。</p><p><strong>在您的价值链中拧紧系统和控件。</strong>随着可持续性报告从自愿到强制性的发展，您应该期望从财务和法律职能中获得更大的影响力和控制权，而可持续性报告的所有权将偏离现有房屋，例如沟通，外部关系和敬业的可持续性团队。这种迁移将带来更高的系统和数据质量障碍，因此几乎可以肯定意味着额外的成本。但是，一如既往地关注业务案例，这意味着要考虑收益和成本。</p><p>与财务会计的比较再次有所帮助。您的财务功能很昂贵 - 也许太贵了。也许这可能更有效。但是，有人建议没有它，您的公司会更好吗？毫无疑问，当SEC首次提出披露要求时，成本有所推迟。但是随后世界继续前进，报告所带来的净收益也已被充分理解。可持续性报告也是如此。如果您建立一个真实的可持续性故事，则收益将超过成本。此外，与之相关的是，您应该保持领先地位。在一个卫星数据和人工智能的世界中，您的可持续性绩效将越来越多地<em>向</em>您报告，而不是<em>您</em>的可持续性绩效 - 在这种情况下，最好的法律和声誉保护将受到控制和透明。不要让您的可持续发展故事是违反社会许可证的运作条件的道歉回应。</p><p><strong>与ISSB全球基线保持一致（并要求您的供应链也可以这样做）。</strong>您的监管义务由SEC决定。没有理由期望SEC面向投资者的重点与ISSB的重点不同。然而，有充分的理由期望在世界其他地方的主要司法管辖区中，监管会变得更快，更快。您在全球经济中运作，在全球经济中，投资决策的收益更大，并且如果每个人都具有相同的测量和披露标准，则收集可靠数据的成本较低。与ISSB保持一致是与SEC保持一致的最有效方法，同时还可以降低成本并提高数据质量。</p><p><strong>使用ISSB标准作为ESR的基准。</strong> ISSB和ESR之间的基本差异是，前者需要向投资者报告（与SEC一致），而后者也需要报告对所有其他利益相关者的重要问题。如果您的操作吸引您进入ESR的域外范围，那么您的最佳响应很简单：无论如何要在美国和全球向投资者报告，然后单独包含ESRS合规性所需的其他披露。</p><p></p><p><strong>有助于行业规范的发展。</strong>可持续性问题因行业而异。公司在资本市场中按行业进行分类，以更好地实现类似类似的比较，并分析共同的对特定于行业的风险和机遇的风险。这就是为什么SASB标准是基于行业的原因，以及ISSB同样致力于这种标准设定方法的原因。鉴于行业专业知识位于行业内，可持续性报告仍然是一种年轻的实践，因此公司应积极参与有关其领域最佳实践报告的讨论，直接和间接帮助塑造未来的标准。</p><p></p><p>最重要的是，确保您的可持续性报告与价值创造有真实的联系。如果感觉像是一项合规性的练习，那么您的公司就会缺少机会。您的投资者重视的信息和对您的领导业务有价值的信息之间应保持一致。投资者可能会认为该公司面临着更大的风险，即在迅速变化且日益危险的世界中被抛弃，并且您在市场上的声誉可能会受到影响。相反，请考虑愿意拥抱跟踪和披露可持续性绩效不仅可以赢得市场的支持，还可以通过重点和问责制来帮助您通过地球和社会对我们所有人的深刻过渡来帮助您管理公司。</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/get-ready-for-more-transparent-sustainability-reporting/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>悖论中隐藏的机遇</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-hidded-opportunity-in-paradoxes/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-hidded-opportunity-in-paradoxes/#comments</comments><pubDate> Tue, 12 Dec 2023 12:45:16 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott D.

Lewis将悖论定义为“持久，相互依存的矛盾”。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a>这意味着它们至少包含两个彼此相关但似乎与之矛盾的要素。伦敦商学院教授赫米尼亚·伊巴拉（Herminia Ibarra）描述了“<a href="https://hbr.org/2015/01/the-authenticity-paradox">真实性悖论</a>”：为了取得成功，领导者被告知是真实的，但是真实的领导者可能会努力发展，因为他们专注于自己忠于自己而不是成功所需的成功。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a>一些学者断言，组织的构想本质上是悖论的<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0018726702555001">，因为</a>“一方面，它包含了自由，创造性，独立的人类主题；另一方面，这些主题之间的关系渴望成为组织，秩序和控制之一。” <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a>创新似乎是敏锐的悖论。为了解决克莱顿·克里斯滕森（Clayton Christensen）著名的创新者的困境，您需要倾听并忽略最好的客户。维持并破坏您当前的业务模式。支持并破坏您当前的价值网络。更广泛地说，当今的领导人必须建立包容性和独特的文化，以赋予员工权力和指导员工，同时为具有多种欲望的员工打下人类的工作生活平衡。</p><p></p><p>这种明显的悖论可以在个人，团队，组织，甚至更大的环境的水平上产生，在组织，行业，州或整个社会等更大的环境中。但是，如果悖论从根本上是无法解决的，这是否意味着这些业务挑战是无法克服的吗？</p><h3>一个悖论的行业</h3><p>能源行业似乎处于悖论的特别敏锐的时刻。皇家荷兰人壳牌的一份<a href="https://www.shell.com/business-customers/lubricants-for-business/perspectives/under-pressure-leading-in-paradox-industries.html">报告</a>称，诸如商业运输，电力，制造业和能源“悖论行业”，“巨大的压力，以增加其产量<em>并</em>减少对我们星球的影响。长大<em>并</em>收缩足迹。自动化<em>和</em>创造作业。” <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a>赌注很高。激进投资者建议这些紧张局势是如此棘手，以至于壳牌应该分为三家公司。 2023年6月，壳牌新任命的首席执行官宣布计划在资本分配中“无情”，削减了对可再生技术的一些投资，并增加了对化石燃料的投资。首席执行官Wael Sawan说：“最终，我们需要做的就是能够为股东带来长期价值。” “答案不能是，&#39;我将投资[清洁能源项目]，并获得差的回报，这将证明我的良心。&#39;那是错误的。” <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a></p><p>面对一个看似不可调节的悖论，壳牌和其他能源公司有哪些选择？考虑另外两家主要能源公司采取的对比方法。</p><p>在1990年代后期，石油和天然气巨头的BP试图（并且失败）将自己重新品牌重新品牌为“超越石油”，并投资了数十亿美元，从而在风和太阳能项目上投入了数十亿美元，其中许多后来被<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bp-solar/bp-turns-out-lights-at-solar-business-idUSTRE7BK1CC20111221">关闭</a>或旋转。由于首席执行官伯纳德·鲁尼（Bernard Looney） <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/bp-gambles-big-fast-transition-oil-renewables-2021-09-20/">宣布</a>计划将公司的石油产量削减40％，出售250亿美元的化石燃料资产，并提高其从可再生资源发电的能力，因此2020年2月，BP试图再次朝着清洁能源推动清洁能源。它承认其清洁能源业务正在亏损，并将至少直到2025年继续亏损。但是，当三年后的能源价格上涨时，鲁尼<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/inside-bps-plan-reset-renewables-oil-gas-boom-2023-03-07/">宣布</a>计划减慢计划中的削减措施并将其缩减为可再生能源的支出。尽管BP的领导人强调，该公司正在审查而不是结束，而不是结束，而不是迁移其投资组合的承诺，但这个故事似乎令人想起，让人联想到其首次涉足清洁能源。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p> BP最近的历史可以说是行动中的一种或心态。也就是说，当您看到悖论的两个部分之间的明显张力时，您会选择一个或另一个。 BP从根本上接触了可再生能源，与化石燃料相反，积极地加强（或营销）前者以牺牲后者为代价 - 这种方法注定要在情况发生变化时倒退。</p><p>相比之下，丹麦能源公司Ørsted采取了一种/和方法，直接陷入了悖论的矛盾，以找到使似乎处于紧张局势的部分的解决方案。管理层于2009年宣布，该公司（当时称为东能源）将寻求到2040年的可再生能源中产生85％的热量和电力。它探索了在海上风能的投资，并开始自行退出煤炭。到2019年，它已成为世界上最大的近海风能生产商，在计划提前21年实现了积极的目标。 2019年，它出售了其煤炭业务和液化的天然气单元。虽然它不再产生汽油，但它继续以基础设施提供商和商人的身份在该空间中发挥作用，并在2019年<a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/rsted-sells-lng-unit-says-its-natural-gas-business-is-going-nowhere">指出</a>，“将有一个长期的过渡期，直到100％的绿色能源系统，在此期间没有汽油就不能做。天然气是可用的最小有害化石燃料来支持向绿色能源的过渡，我们将在未来几年继续贸易天然气。” <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p>当然，公司应根据市场条件动态调整其策略。但是，更广泛地说，他们应该重新考虑限制的看法，即在追求短期回报与长期战略重新定向之间存在张力。一系列学术研究反复表明，追求行星友好的政策和最大化财务回报之间的权衡是错误的。哈佛商学院教授乔治·塞拉菲姆（George Serafeim）在他的《<cite>目的 +利润》</cite>中描述了一项研究，该研究表明，目的驱动的公司对可持续性问题进行了综合的看法，在其股份回报中获得了6％的风险调整后提升。 <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a></p><p>击败市场的经过验证的途径。一个也对地球有益。很简单，对吧？很不幸的是，不行。</p><p></p><h3>悖论的偏振能力</h3><p>悖论是复杂的，自适应的，系统级问题，不确定性猖ramp。这就是<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-leaders-delude-themselves-about-disruption">为什么</a>尽管从业者和思想领袖工作了二十年，但创新者的困境被证明是如此固执的原因。 <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a>人类遭受了可预测的偏见和盲点范围，这使得追求/和解决方案具有挑战性。确认偏见导致领导者忽略违背其现有信念的证据。损失厌恶和现状偏见意味着人们更喜欢避免风险而不是服用风险。层次结构和集体思维使小组难以通过复杂性看到自己的方式。</p><p>在过去二十年中进行的学术研究中的一个反复发现是，悖论会产生两极分化的反应。我自己的研究证实了这一发现。 <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a>我与史密斯和刘易斯这样的学者所确定的学者们面对悖论的商业领袖进行了十二次深入访谈，例如追求利润和目标之间的紧张关系，维持当前的运营和推动颠覆性的成长，推动颠覆性的增长，并奖励个人绩效和鼓励个人绩效和鼓励公平。 （请参阅“研究”。）</p><p>从积极的一面来看，这些悖论产生了好奇心，兴奋和参与的感觉。我的一位研究主题，每天都在与帕拉多克斯（Paradox Daily）面对面的角色，领导一家高度保守的公司的创新部门，他描述了甚至<em>讨论</em>悖论的方式如何使他感到“受到刺激，就像在一场出色的国际象棋游戏中一样。”一家在一家大型消费品公司内帮助创立了20亿美元业务的高管，他描述了如何找到“指出线”（不符合期望的数据）令人兴奋解决方案。另一位高管描述了他作为大学校长，他如何面对高质量，基于校园的教育与可访问，负担得起的在线计划之间的悖论。高管组成并领导了几个专业团队。一个人确保校园和在线产品都符合严格的学术标准。另一位帮助校园教授向在线教育者那里学习，反之亦然。除了改变他的研究所外，高管还指出了努力是如何引发个人成长的：“在组织层面上，我更有效，在个人层面上，我要么是一个更好的人，要么我至少是一个更自我意识的人”。</p><p>但是，<a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/19416520.2016.1162422">研究</a>还表明，悖论可以促进“焦虑，不确定性和歧义，使人感到受到威胁和防御。” <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a>前首席执行官在两个组织中进行战略转型，描述了面对悖论如何提出有关组织身份的基本问题：必须做出选择使该身份的各个方面无效的选择可能会对与组织旧身份建立联系的个人产生级联的影响。</p><p>一位从业者描述了寻求在律师事务所创新的悖论。律师说：“我所做的工作本质上是自相矛盾的，因为我们打算做创新，但根据定义，这是新的，但是如果这太新了，没有人实际上想这样做，因为他们想看到有些证据，或者他们希望保证它会起作用。”虽然律师摆脱了基于过去的先例做出决策的做法似乎很微不足道，但这种休息将要求律师质疑自己及其组织中的基本作用。失落的偏见律师被沮丧和沮丧：“我被困在中间。我不能说：“让我们去改变这些阻碍我们工作的结构”……[或]说，&#39;做突破性的事情，“这样就感到无能为力。”</p><h3>真的是悖论吗？</h3><p>尽管经典的哲学悖论在其逻辑限制中无法解决，但如果您愿意，当领导者思考超出明显的约束或“超出<em>para</em> -box之外”时，业务中的矛盾问题就可以产生解决方案。克里斯滕森（Christensen）称他的第一本书<cite>《创新者的困境》</cite> ，而不是<cite>创新者的悖论</cite>。颠覆性变化的挑战令人烦恼，但是就像现代高管面临的悖论一样，它们是可以解决的。没有自然法则说律师事务所在查看创新项目时必须使用过去的先例。个人可以改变一个小组并成为其中的一部分；个人可以改变自己而不会失去自己的自我意识。</p><p>考虑一下解决的其他一些看似不可调和的紧张局势：</p><ul><li>人们普遍认为，盈利的制造需要在成本，质量和速度之间进行权衡 -

In the exact minute that you read this sentence, you can&#39;t be in balance, because you are doing one thing or another. Now, zoom out and imagine that you estimate that your life expectancy is 80 years. That&#39;s about 700,000 living hours. Let&#39;s say you are a <em>really</em> hard worker, averaging 50 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, for 50 years. That&#39;s 125,000 hours. So you work only 18% of your living hours.平衡！ Those extreme answers are not particularly useful, but consider the possibilities opened up by taking a quarterly perspective. That time frame allows rituals such as a weekend family retreat, decision rules such as having no more than 10 days of travel in a quarter, or more rigorous time-boxing, such as dedicating blocks of time for family activities.</p><p> Similarly, a shift in time horizon can reframe the renewable-energy tensions described previously. Consider one <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43663662">study</a> contrasting five organizations operating in the oil sands of Alberta, Canada. <a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a> All of the companies faced apparent paradoxical tensions in terms of their temporal (short- versus long-term) and philosophical (business versus society) orientations. Some companies viewed these issues as either/or poles that forced a choice. They prioritized practices that favored efficiency, such as quantitative planning, and minimized interactions with stakeholders, which led to what the researchers described as “temporal myopia” that resulted in the “narrowing of the solution space.”</p><p> Those that stepped back, shifted perspectives, and considered the interconnections between issues engaged multiple stakeholders and sought avenues for cross-collaboration. This approach allowed them to develop integrated solutions with greater potential for long-term benefits for all relevant stakeholders — including themselves.</p><p> One way to shift perspectives and find those points off the line that point to novel solutions to a problem is to run a series of thought experiments that play with constraints. That can involve <em>removing</em> a constraint, such as asking how you would approach an apparent paradox differently if you had infinite time or infinite resources, or <em>imposing</em> a constraint, such as imagining what you would do if the government suddenly outlawed the use of a particular raw材料。 While it might feel like imposing constraints would limit creativity, research consistently shows that constraints can focus problem-solving energy and boost creativity. One technique that can help spur these thought experiments is what Hal Gregersen <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/03/better-brainstorming">calls</a> a “question burst,” where you brainstorm not for answers, but for provocative questions. <a id="reflink14" class="reflink" href="#ref14">14</a></p><p> <strong>Adopt a paradox mindset.</strong> Adopting a mindset that views apparent paradoxes as opportunities boosts creativity and organizational performance, according to <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-20753-002">research</a> . <a id="reflink15" class="reflink" href="#ref15">15</a> People who demonstrate a <em>paradox mindset</em> agree with statements such as “Tension between ideas energizes me” and “I am comfortable working on tasks that contradict each other.” The paradox mindset can be approached in three ways. First, leaders can be <em>screened</em> to identify those predisposed to have a paradox mindset by having them complete a short <a href="https://paradox.lerner.udel.edu/">diagnostic</a> . <a id="reflink16" class="reflink" href="#ref16">16</a> Second, the items on the diagnostic can be used as <em>prompts</em> before a group discussion to help people consider multiple possibilities when discussing an apparent paradox. Research shows that simply starting a meeting by stating that tensions create possibilities helps a group adopt more of a paradox mindset.</p><p></p><p> Finally, there can be conscious efforts to help people <em>develop</em> a paradox mindset. Experience in dynamic circumstances or on challenging problems builds what is <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smj.3415">known</a> as <em>cognitive complexity</em> (the ability to consider multiple possibilities with nuance), a key enabler of a paradox mindset. <a id="reflink17" class="reflink" href="#ref17">17</a> Development plans that give high-potential leaders experience launching new products, working in emerging markets, or building new organizational capabilities help to prepare them to confront future paradoxes. More broadly, individuals can consider going on a paradox quest, consciously doing something that would be unusual for them, such as the following:</p><ul><li> Taking an art class, learning a musical instrument, or learning a new language.</li><li> Doing an extreme activity, such as skydiving.</li><li> Volunteering or participating in a socially oriented activity.</li><li> Enrolling in an online program to develop a new skill, like coding.</li></ul><p> <strong>Hold a paradox sparring session.</strong> Boxers use sparring sessions to train. The goal isn&#39;t to knock their opponent out but to practice form and response. A paradox sparring session is a purposeful place to bat around ideas and challenge assumptions. For example, in the early 2000s, a reorganization led to confusion within the iconic Danish toymaker Lego. Managers were being asked to do things that felt contradictory, such as simultaneously focusing on developing people and meeting stringent production targets. Lewis and fellow academic Lotte S. Lüscher led the group through a series of sparring sessions to discuss the apparent tensions. <a id="reflink18" class="reflink" href="#ref18">18</a></p><p> Sparring sessions <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smj.3415">should</a> challenge participants with four types of questions:</p><ul><li> <em>Linear</em> questions, such as “What are your concerns?” encourage explanation and bring logic to the surface.</li><li> <em>Circular</em> questions, such as “What do you think others think?” explore other perspectives and home in on polarities.</li><li> <em>Reflexive</em> questions, such as “What does what you say imply?” seek opportunities to critique and connect existing options.</li><li> <em>Strategic</em> questions, such as “Is what you say realistic?” motivate more expansive solutions.</li></ul><p> This approach helps to tease a perceived paradox out of a seeming mess, creating opportunities to explore potential novel solutions to transcend it. For example, Lego challenged managers to drive performance and allow teams to be more self-managed. A sparring session devoted to the seemingly paradoxical question of how managers could both let go of and retain control led to specific solutions, such as alignment around goals and degrees of freedom for teams, more regular dialogue between managers and teams, and focused investment to teach teams how to solve problems. Lego ultimately created a list titled “11 Paradoxes of Leadership” to help future leaders develop practical solutions to vexing challenges on their own.</p><p></p><p> Organizational paradoxes are ultimately illusions. They are artificial constructs, sometimes of a system, many times of the mind. They fail to meet the definition of a paradox because they are not irreconcilable. Yet these illusionary obstacles persist as groups and individuals protect themselves from the perceived challenges of addressing them. They demand engagement because the process of engagement reveals the illusion, develops a deeper sense of self, and builds an organization&#39;s capabilities. One of my research subjects, a former Silicon Valley executive researching the human side of transformational change, began our interview by saying, “Continual creativity comes from paradox. … All great meaning comes from grappling with paradox.”</p><p></p><p> Leaders who feel like they are facing a paradox should ask themselves four questions:</p><ol><li> Is the perceived paradox truly a law of nature, or a difficult choice?</li><li> Am I imposing a constraint that is creating the perceived paradox?</li><li> Am I hesitating to act because the perceived paradox is the result of the system I helped to construct, perpetuate, and potentially benefit from?</li><li> Does a different frame reveal the paradox as an illusion?</li></ol><p> There&#39;s no doubt that tackling perceived paradoxes presents challenges and requires work. It may feel easier for leaders to collectively shrug their shoulders and say, “What can I do? It is just too hard.”他们可以做得更好。 Perceived paradoxes can be dissected and transcended, turning helplessness into empowerment. Make the paradox choice to turn either/ors into both/ands.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-hidden-opportunity-in-paradoxes/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 1</slash:comments></item><item><title>设定雄心勃勃但现实的环境目标</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/set-ambitious-but-realistic-environmental-goals/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/set-ambitious-but-realistic-environmental-goals/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 12 Dec 2023 12:25:37 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Kate Isaacs, Jason Jay, Jeremy Gregory, and Elsa Olivetti. <p>Kate Isaacs and Jason Jay are senior lecturers at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

They also serve to focus the attention and resources that are required within organizations to drive social and environmental progress on the ground.</p><p></p><p> However, setting appropriately ambitious sustainability goals that can pull a steady line of progress through today&#39;s uncertain business landscape is an exceedingly difficult task. Economic volatility, evolving stakeholder demands, scientific and technological developments, and variable sociopolitical pressures mean that the ground is constantly shifting under leaders&#39; feet.</p><p> Activist stakeholders in particular are watching company performance on these issues closely, demanding corporate transparency around goals and progress, and faulting companies that fail to follow through on their pledges. A 2022 study published by the nonprofit organizations <a href="https://newclimate.org/news/press-release-corporate-climate-responsibility-monitor-2022">NewClimate Institute and Carbon Market Watch</a> identified 25 large corporations with net-zero commitments and rated 21 of them as having “low integrity” or worse because their plans would reduce emissions by only 40% on average, not the 100% implied by net zero.</p><p> Companies also provoke criticism for tiptoeing forward with too much hesitancy and leaping ahead too far too fast. Sustainability goals that are perceived by employees and other stakeholders as insufficiently ambitious can draw internal and public criticism and activist ire. And goals that are very ambitious could provoke resistance from stakeholders who prioritize short-term financial gains, view the technical challenges of complex issues like decarbonization as insurmountable, or are simply unprepared for or unwilling to change. For company leaders who are trying to mediate in the middle, it can feel impossible to get goals just right.</p><p> Climate goals must also take into account current business realities. Chief sustainability officers (CSOs) are focused on environmental and societal concerns but must square their goals in these areas with their companies&#39; dependence on problematic resources such as plastic, fossil fuels, and cheap labor, as well as with the company&#39;s material issues, its purpose and strategic priorities, and the mindset of its leaders.</p><p> Our research, which included focus group discussions with leaders of corporate sustainability initiatives, found that in this atmosphere of both uncertainty and heightened scrutiny, many leaders are grappling with how far to go in setting environmental sustainability goals and what level of disclosure they should achieve. The more ambitious the goals, the stronger the creative tension between an envisioned future and the current reality. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> The role of leaders is to manage this tension carefully to inspire their people, engage them in action, and grow stakeholder trust.</p><p> The question at the heart of our research is how this tension can be managed, both intentionally and productively, to drive tangible progress and increase stakeholder trust over time. To do this, leaders must attend to where their company is now and what resources are available to them while also attending to stakeholder input about the social and ecological system of which they are a part. They must aim for integrity at every step in the process: meeting the goals they set for themselves, communicating proactively when they fail to do so, and helping lead systemic changes that supersede any one company&#39;s ability when working alone.</p><h3> No Clear Path to Net-Zero Goals</h3><p> All of the companies in our focus group have publicly committed to reaching carbon neutrality or net zero by 2050. But in our discussions, leaders expressed serious doubts about whether they will be able to achieve their goals, especially those in industries that consume a great deal of industrial process heat, such as petrochemicals, steel, and cement.</p><p> Our participants expressed confidence that they could meet Scope 1 goals — that is, achieve net-zero emissions from sources that their organization directly owns or controls. Most also have what they feel are realistic plans to achieve Scope 2 goals, which cover emissions from the generation of electricity that they purchase (to power a fleet of electric vehicles, for example). These goals can be reached by improving energy conservation and shifting to sources of clean, renewable energy in competitive energy markets, or via power purchase agreements with developers of renewable energy projects.</p><p> Achieving Scope 3 goals is much more challenging across industries, and none of our participants had a predictable road map for doing so. Scope 3 goals include all other indirect emissions associated with an organization&#39;s supply chain; its customers&#39; use of its goods or services, including disposal of packaging and products; and employee commuting. Achieving Scope 3 emissions reductions will require systemic changes at scale toward low-carbon fuels and electrification in transport and logistics. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> Changes like these will require new policies, new technologies, and new collaborations within industries and across sectors. To find a path forward on goals that are well beyond what they can achieve on their own and create systemic solutions, companies must reach far outside their own walls to partner with many kinds of stakeholders.</p><p> Based on the experiences and insights of the companies in our study, what follows is a developmental path for organizations that want to set and achieve increasingly ambitious goals and manage the creative tension of the journey in an intentional way.</p><h3> Step 1: <span class="normal">Engage stakeholders to determine the highest-priority areas for sustainability goals.</span></h3><p> Leaders must start by answering two questions: “What are the most meaningful and material sustainability issues where setting goals will matter most?” and “Are there issues we should be working on that we are not?” It&#39;s hard enough to achieve one big, hairy, audacious goal; it is folly to try and achieve 20. To make progress, companies must focus on a small number of issues.</p><p> Companies often center this process on external scanning and sensemaking, which are critical for staying abreast of society&#39;s rapidly changing expectations of company actions and impacts. Public awareness of issues like climate change, racial justice, and public health can rise in response to crises and other events, during which stakeholders identify companies as focal points to take action and create change. This process will always be dynamic and noisy, and if sensemaking is not proactive enough, companies might miss the mark.</p><p> Therefore, companies can and should try to understand what issues are on the minds of external stakeholders (prospective employees, customers, investors, suppliers, and communities) as well as the <em>shapeholders</em> who influence business conditions, such as standards bodies, regulators, scientific experts, nonprofit advocacy groups, and policy makers. Proactive sensemaking happens through a variety of mechanisms, including direct meetings and regular interviews with stakeholders, permanent customer and stakeholder advisory councils, regular attendance of key industry and issue conferences and forums, and benchmark comparisons with competitors. Several of our focus group participants already use AI tools to distill public conversations about the company and industry, and this is a growing area of practice.</p><p> The problem is that this outside-in view does not converge easily with internal perspectives. It can result in an extensive wish list of actions that are hard enough to measure and report, let alone set meaningful goals for and drive progress toward. Narrowing priorities requires an inside-out view as well: clarity about the domain of purpose, mission, and values; a view of the business model and vision for its future; and strategic priorities that move the company closer to that imagined future. This means it&#39;s crucial that leaders also listen to the concerns and priorities of <em>internal</em> stakeholders, particularly the employees who hold the keys to business success, and use that information as input to goal setting.</p><p> Boeing looked to its values and its mission statement — “to connect, protect, explore, and inspire the world through aerospace innovation” — as the foundation to identify six focus areas of sustainability where it has set goals: employee safety and well-being; global aerospace safety;多样性、公平性和包容性； innovation and clean technology; sustainable operations;和社区参与。</p><p> To arrive at these goals, leaders from the company&#39;s sustainability office interviewed Boeing employees and also surveyed and conducted interviews with external stakeholders. These efforts uncovered a number of sustainability topics that connected back to the company&#39;s overall strategy and future direction. Boeing leaders reviewed the stakeholder feedback, looked for common themes, and ultimately pruned the list down to a manageable number of priorities.</p><p> “Trying to be everything to everyone is not going to be successful. We deliberately zeroed in on six areas to drive alignment and focus that employees and external stakeholders can rally to support,” explained Jill Graftenreed, Boeing&#39;s director of sustainable operations and reporting.</p><p> Finally, the company&#39;s sustainability leaders needed to get leaders in other areas of the enterprise to take ownership of these priorities, so they engaged the appropriate internal functional leaders to identify one or two targets for each priority along with metrics to measure progress. This required additional consultation and benchmarking with external stakeholders, industry peers, and standard-setting bodies.</p><p> “It was important to us that we provided metrics that are meaningful and consistent with what others in the industry are also using,” Graftenreed said. “Stakeholders want to look across companies to compare how they are doing.”</p><p></p><h3> Step 2: <span class="normal">Develop an aspirational vision of success that is informed by the science of sustainability and stakeholder expectations.</span></h3><p> Once they identify high-priority issues, sustainability leaders must generate a vision of the future they aspire to create, which can serve as a North Star for company efforts. For instance, a company&#39;s climate vision might link to the scientifically driven vision to limit global warming <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/">to 1.5 degrees</a> Celsius to avoid the most catastrophic impacts and allow for adaptation.</p><p> While many companies set goals by starting with their existing emissions footprint and calculating forward to arrive at carbon reduction goals that they believe they can reasonably achieve, aspirational companies flip this process around: They establish a vision that is aligned with scientific recommendations and stakeholder expectations and then figure out their company&#39;s contribution to achieving that vision.</p><p></p><p> Salesforce anchored its climate goals externally to a single shared planetary vision of a just transition to a 1.5-degree Celsius future and then worked backward to align its Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions goals accordingly. This translated into a companywide goal to reduce full value-chain annual emissions by 50% by 2030 and to nearly zero by 2040, using 2019 data as a baseline. In addition, Salesforce set location-based emissions targets that pushed beyond the IT industry&#39;s standard practice of using carbon offsets and renewable energy credits from greener sites to compensate for more emissions-intensive locations.</p><p> Connecting a company&#39;s contribution to a big shared vision involves building shared commitment through extensive conversations with employees, managers, and company leaders and with external stakeholders and shapeholders. And this work is never finished, given that stakeholder views on what is a legitimate aspiration can be dynamic and noisy. For instance, one company had set ambitious emissions goals two years earlier but then became aware that the SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative) had suddenly grown very influential. In following the SBTi agenda, the company decided to set more ambitious goals around its Scope 3 emissions. As the organization&#39;s leader told us, “We set carbon-neutral goals, but what everyone wants now is net zero.”</p><p> The aspirational vision that a company sets at this stage might also need to be updated based on new scientific developments, new technological capabilities, or changes in key stakeholder concerns. Inditex, which owns seven brands, including fashion retailer Zara, started its sustainability journey in the early 2000s with its first multiyear sustainability plan. In 2013, the company published a biodiversity strategy that defined some basic principles and an aim “to embed a biodiversity agenda in our day-to-day business decisions.” Later, company leaders created a road map that included not only climate action but also critical sustainability issues such as impact on soil health, water quality and availability, and ecosystem protection and restoration. This commitment was further reinforced in July 2023, when Inditex announced the launch of new, specific targets that address external stakeholders&#39; expectations, including goals related to the promotion of preferred raw materials and biodiversity.</p><p> Inditex used standards set by organizations such as Textile Exchange to guide its 2030 goal to use only “preferred fibers” as textile raw materials in order to reduce the negative impact on the environment. The company also worked with environmental experts, third-sector organizations, unions, and nonprofits to analyze impacts on local communities of activities such as garment manufacturing or retail store operations. One of the results of this process was an ambitious target of protecting, restoring, regenerating, or otherwise improving biodiversity across 5 million hectares at locations throughout the world.</p><h3> Step 3: <span class="normal">Set midlevel goals to gain early traction on the high-level vision.</span></h3><p> Next, leaders must set achievable goals that move the company from its current state (honestly and accurately assessed) toward the future vision developed in Step 2. In order to produce the desired outcomes, goals should not be too narrow, too ambitious, or too short-term — what some have called “goals gone wild.” <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> Leaders must understand the business intimately enough to set goals that intentionally create productive tension between vision and current reality and move the company forward, beginning with a series of small, achievable steps and building up to larger goals over time. They must carefully consider the specificity, ambition, timing, and ethical implications of their goals, as well as the range of outcomes their intended goals might produce.</p><p> At pharmaceutical company Takeda, the CEO had set a high-level climate goal to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030 (from 2015 levels). Rich Wilner, head of business transformation and environmental sustainability, noticed that despite this goal, carbon reduction projects in the factories were not getting funded. He set out to connect the “top to the shop” by setting a goal at one plant to launch just one capital investment project that year aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Beginning with this small goal helped that plant overcome the inertia of getting started on the journey, and the approach was quickly adopted across the network of plants.</p><p> Later, Wilner successfully advocated for important organizational changes to align behavior with the intent to reduce carbon emissions. This included changes to the company&#39;s capital allocation process that would weight GHG-reducing projects favorably, along with the implementation of monitoring and forecasting tools that plant managers could easily use. The company further incentivized progress by incorporating the successful completion of carbon reduction projects into employees&#39; annual bonuses. These moves helped set up the next 10 projects for success and got Wilner&#39;s division on track with corporate goals.</p><h3> Step 4: <span class="normal">Build momentum with willing stakeholders, and expand the goal horizon toward the vision.</span></h3><p> Once the organization has gained traction on early goals, the work of sustainability leaders should shift to accelerating uptake inside the organization and gradually extending the goals toward the aspirational vision.</p><p> In his former role as sustainability manager at the Kroger grocery chain, Vontier&#39;s senior global director of sustainability and ESG, Nate Streed, sought to build momentum around a high-level vision of zero manufacturing waste companywide, including three dozen food manufacturing facilities and thousands of retail stores across the country. Like Wilner, Streed started small, by visiting seven plants — whose pioneering leaders were early and willing adopters — to understand their waste production process. Although plant leaders initially kept him at arm&#39;s length, they came to understand that he genuinely wanted to learn rather than just dictate solutions from corporate headquarters.</p><p> Streed encouraged plant leaders to experiment with new waste-reduction strategies by reframing waste as something that retains value and prompting questions to spur innovative thinking. One plant, for example, created dedicated bins for recyclable polypropylene straps and then got the vendor to color-code the straps for easier sorting. Another was able to provide coffee grounds and burlap sacks to a local landscape contractor in South Carolina.</p><p> Streed and his team harnessed the natural dynamic of collaborative competition among plant managers, encouraging them to share successful strategies and solutions while competing on plant-level metrics. Corporate leaders reinforced his efforts by making personal visits to celebrate the progress of these creative, locally tailored waste solutions. They also assured local leaders that they wouldn&#39;t be punished for trying new things, even if the initial results negatively affected performance metrics.</p><p></p><p> From these seven early-adopter plants, Streed and his team were able to continue to build momentum toward zero waste, bringing more plants on board and identifying more waste-reduction innovations. Today, almost all of Kroger&#39;s manufacturing plants operate as zero-waste facilities (with over 90% diversion), and in 2022 Kroger achieved 79% waste diversion companywide (including stores, warehouses, offices, and other facilities). <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a> This illustrates how a high-level corporate vision must be paired with on-the-ground measurement and continuous improvement and innovation efforts that expand progress toward the ultimate vision.</p><p> An organization that embraces both a vision for sustainability and an ethos of sustainability-oriented innovation sets its people up for serendipitous discovery. Researchers at Dow were working on designing minuscule hollow spheres to create a light-scattering pigment in paint. That plan fell apart when researchers discovered that a small amount of heat caused the spheres to collapse. But because innovators were thinking in terms of sustainability, they recognized that the spheres could be used in a different way. If a dark-colored paper were coated with the spheres, a thermal printer could burn away the coating to produce a printed page — an environmentally friendly alternative to coating thermal printer paper with toxic chemicals such as bisphenol A. Attuning to sustainability leads to serendipity and unexpected value.</p><h3> Step 5: <span class="normal">Scale efforts to lead systems change.</span></h3><p> When companies identify systemic challenges that make Scope 3 and other value-chain goals difficult to achieve, there is an opportunity for leadership on a larger stage. This shift involves engaging with others in the industry, in cross-sector coalitions, and in policy debates to define collective goals and set the conditions for shared success.</p><p> Salesforce realized that achieving Scope 3 goals in particular could not happen without the wider engagement of the cloud computing industry. It began scaling up its efforts to the system level by taking action along three dimensions:</p><ul><li> It identified its core competency as delivering transformational software tools to businesses of all industries, sizes, and geographies, and articulated its customer value as helping them navigate successfully into the future. Clarifying the company&#39;s purpose and the value it creates led Salesforce to the development of its Net Zero Cloud tool, which enables customers to track, report, and reduce emissions.</li><li> It identified where the leverage points were for the company to influence impacts and the value chain across scopes 1, 2, and 3. For example, Salesforce notified all of its suppliers in 2020 that climate would be part of all new standard purchasing agreements. To do business with Salesforce, suppliers must prepare emissions reduction plans that disclose their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and deliver all of their products and services on a carbon-neutral basis or pay for the cost of carbon.</li><li> The company took a broader view of the systemic issues beyond its control and where it was well positioned to contribute. Salesforce led and joined consortia to promote more sustainable offices and data centers, greater adoption of high-quality renewable energy, carbon credits, sustainable aviation fuel, and nature-based solutions.</li></ul><p> Former Salesforce CSO Patrick Flynn suggests asking, “Which of the very important things that need to be done are ones that we are uniquely suited to do or, at the most extreme, that will not happen unless we do it?” This provides a starting point for a focus area for action, along with a defensible story and strategy that can be explained to company employees and external stakeholders.</p><p> Maritime shipping is another sector in which sustainability solutions will depend on many organizations and stakeholders working in concert. It is both a hard-to-decarbonize sector (heavily reliant on petroleum-based fuel) and a significant contributor to many companies&#39; Scope 3 supply chain emissions. Maersk, one of the largest players in the industry, began setting goals in 2008 to reduce carbon emissions through fleet efficiency and the pursuit of alternative fuels, and it eventually set an ambitious 2040 net-zero target. Company leaders quickly realized, however, that they could not achieve these objectives alone. Alternative fuels require systems change — the creation of new supply chains and regulatory frameworks for lower-carbon fuels like methanol, green hydrogen, and ammonia.</p><p> As a result, Maersk has engaged the United Nations&#39; International Maritime Organization on carbon policy and joined alternative-fuels consortia with a wide range of partners, including green power provider Ørsted, ammonia fertilizer leader Yara, shipbuilders like Hyundai, Sumitomo for fuel supply chain provision, and a variety of financial institutions. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> Ultimately, creating supply corridors for ammonia or methanol will require engagement with ports and communities around the world along major shipping routes.</p><p> At Inditex, leaders saw that achieving the goal of having 25% of its textile materials produced by regenerative or organic farming practices was at odds with the industry reality that a mere 2% of all cotton grown worldwide is organic and the percentage grown using regenerative farming practices is even lower. Meeting its target will require its ongoing support of external projects and advocacy groups that work to meaningfully grow these practices. It has since joined Conservation International&#39;s Regenerative Fund and donated 15 million euros ($15.9 million) to help scale up regenerative farming practices. It is also working with Action for Social Advancement, together with Laudes Foundation, IDH, and WWF India, to foster regenerative agriculture, restore ecosystems, and improve community well-being in a 300,000-hectare area in the Indian states of Madhya Pradesh and Odisha 。</p><p> A number of strategies for action are available to companies that seek to promote systemic change. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> Business leaders have convening power to bring diverse stakeholders to the table, provided that they have demonstrated a sincere commitment to sustainability goals and have a track record of making progress on goals. They have economic power to put direct pressure on suppliers and to make demands of policy makers, given their critical role in providing jobs and creating a functioning economy and society. Leaders can use their power wisely to convene and fund new initiatives if they have earned credibility by implementing steps 1 through 4, and if stakeholders perceive that their motivation is to create societal as well as business benefit.</p><p></p><p></p><p> Ultimately, sustainability is a team sport. The challenge that company leaders face is to set provisional/achievable corporate goals that grow organizational capabilities to reach toward the needs of the planet and its people. Those needs are incredibly high right now. But company leaders don&#39;t have to face them alone; an insular approach to managing sustainability goals will not create the future we want for business or life on planet Earth. Engage with the board, executives, and employees to manage the tension. Engage with the value chain and even competitors for joint problem-solving. Engage in the wider public policy debate to change the system and make goal setting and achievement more feasible for everyone. And help everyone understand that transformation is a journey — one that sometimes starts with a single capital expenditure project in a single factory and ultimately creates a better future for all.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/set-ambitious-but-realistic-environmental-goals/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Meet Tomorrow&#39;s Workforce: Today&#39;s Student Labor Activists</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/meet-tomorrows-workforce-todays-student-labor-activists/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/meet-tomorrows-workforce-todays-student-labor-activists/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 11 Dec 2023 12:00:36 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Ayanna Howard. <p>Ayanna Howard ( <a href="https://twitter.com/robotsmarts">@robotsmarts</a> ) is dean of the College of Engineering at The Ohio State University.</p> ]]>; </dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Compensation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Employee Recruitment and Retention]]></category><category><![CDATA[Labor]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership]]></category><category><![CDATA[Organizational Behavior]]></category><category><![CDATA[Talent Management]]></category><description><![CDATA[Nick Lowndes/Ikon Images Student labor activism is on the rise in new and surprising ways.

Not only do students in higher education regularly turn out to support striking staff members on college campuses, but they&#39;re also organizing and joining unions themselves in growing numbers. This direct action sets the stage for their lives after they leave higher education, because when students are involved in organizing efforts in their on-campus working lives, you&#39;d better believe these same workers will seek out unions later in their careers.</p><p> The number of student-worker bargaining units in the US grew from 54 at the beginning of 2022 to 84 in July 2023 — a <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/labor-unionization/2023/09/06/grad-worker-unionization-booming-even-down-south">56% increase</a> — according to the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions. While there&#39;s been steady growth over the past few decades in the organization of graduate students, whose focus is often on teaching requirements and compensation, what is new is a surge of undergraduate student workers turning to collective bargaining around issues such as minimum-wage pay and病假福利。</p><p></p><p> Business leaders would be wise to pay attention to how some universities are working with students to address these challenges. The task for schools is to ensure the rights of students to unionize for an improved on-campus work environment while also providing those same students with the educational benefits of living and learning on campus. There are parallels here to how businesses must juggle the need for both workplace productivity and employee satisfaction. Today&#39;s student organizers are building expectations for partnership that they will bring with them to their future workplaces.</p><p></p><h3> The Rise of Undergrad Unionization</h3><p> Before 2016, nearly all organized student unions were composed of graduate student employees. In fact, there was only one that wasn&#39;t: In 2002, undergraduate students who served as resident assistants at the University of Massachusetts Amherst became the <a href="https://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/sites/ilr.law.uiowa.edu/files/2023-02/Fitzpatrick.pdf">first union of student resident assistants</a> in the country. Then, after 2016, other undergraduate unionization efforts began popping up, at Grinnell College, George Washington University, and Reed College, among others.</p><p> Students — whether they are focused on the two-year associate&#39;s degree, the four-year bachelor&#39;s degree, or graduate studies — represent approximately <a href="https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/Working-Learners-Report.pdf">8% of the US workforce</a> . Many work within campus environments like The Ohio State University, where I am dean of the College of Engineering, either because work-study on campus is required as part of their financial aid package or because there are few flexible part-time work opportunities available for the traditional 18-to-23-year-old student.</p><p> The kinds of issues they&#39;re organizing around are closely aligned with the issues raised by unions in the retail and service industries. A <a href="https://slu.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Union-Density-2023.pdf">2023 report</a> out of the CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies noted that the new wave of student-worker unions “has included teaching and research assistants in both the humanities and the previously quiescent STEM fields, as well as undergraduate resident advisers, student dining hall workers, and library staff.” The 30 new student-worker collective bargaining units launched since the start of 2022 represent 35,655 workers — a number that might be getting a big boost soon: At California State University, over 19,300 student assistants are hoping to vote as early as January 2024 on their organizing efforts, which would make them <a href="https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/college-beat/2023/10/student-workers/">one of the largest student-worker unions</a> in US history.</p><p></p><p> The year 2022 marked another change: the evolution of the student-worker strike. The CUNY report cites 20 strikes by workers in higher education in 2022 and 2023 by a mix of faculty members, postdocs, and students and states that “this explosive growth in strike activity in higher education is unprecedented within recent memory.” The most notable of these, the University of California graduate student workers&#39; strike, lasted over five weeks and is now recorded as the <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/after-historic-strike-uc-grad-students-say-university-isn-t-honoring-pay-agreements">largest ever at a US institution of higher education</a> . It ended with an agreement for higher pay, fee waivers, and other benefits.</p><p> Some experts postulate that there&#39;s a <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/labor-unionization/2023/04/26/were-not-slowing-down-student-workers-say">strong correlation</a> between the growth of unions on college campuses and the growth in high-profile organization efforts off campus (most recently at Amazon, Apple, and Starbucks). In fact, union organizing among college-educated young workers has been trending up. Gallup reports the relatively high <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354455/approval-labor-unions-highest-point-1965.aspx">approval rate of 77% for labor unions</a> among young adults.</p><h3> Power Dynamics to Watch</h3><p> On college and university campuses, unionizing student workers represent a unique constituency. On the one hand, their relationship to the school is one of worker-employer. On the other hand, they are also paying for a service and educational product, making the relationship one of customer-provider.</p><p> Schools navigating this dual identity need to think of these student-worker activists as a new kind of stakeholder — one to engage with and ultimately keep happy. California&#39;s state superintendent of public instruction, Tony Thurmond, who also serves as an ex officio member of the California State University board of trustees, put it this way at an October press conference about that school&#39;s student unionization efforts: “The California State University is stronger today because students are rising up to hold the university system true to its mission to open the doors of higher education and a strong future to every student, no matter their background.”</p><p> Corporate organizations faced with newly organizing employees often don&#39;t initially think of them this way — as a cohort that they similarly have to engage with and ultimately keep happy. Some successful negotiations eventually bring both sides around to this understanding, if only begrudgingly.</p><p> It&#39;s worth noting that this student movement is occurring at exactly the same time that some employers in corporate America have <a href="https://time.com/6221176/worker-strikes-employers-unions/">spied on and fired workers</a> who were leading organization efforts (actions that are illegal under the National Labor Relations Act). But companies must understand that if their values do not align with this new generation of student workers who have lived the experience of political advocacy, they will have difficulty in recruiting. “I think unions are incredibly important,” a college sophomore <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2023/11/06/campus-labor-activism-spreads-to-undergrads/">told nonprofit news organization Marketplace</a> after undergraduates at her school, Barnard College, voted to unionize in October. “I would be honored to be part of one after college.”</p><p></p><p> In their article “ <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/leading-in-an-age-of-employee-activism/">Leading in an Age of Employee Activism</a> ,” Megan Reitz, of Hult International Business School, and John Higgins, coauthor of the book <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Leadership-Unravelled-The-Faulty-Thinking-Behind-Modern-Management/Cole-Higgins/p/book/9781032033686"><cite>Leadership Unravelled</cite></a> , noted, “We are entering an age of employee activism that may well upend our assumptions about power within organizations.” Some business leaders might see this as a passing trend, but many of us in the university environment know that student labor activism is becoming the new norm — and see learning how to address the needs of the newest generation of worker-customers as an imperative. Companies and their leaders have an opportunity to watch how these negotiations play out on college campuses and understand that they&#39;re likely to also be tasked at some point with navigating the different (and perhaps divergent) interests of established employees and management, community members, and younger employee activists.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/meet-tomorrows-workforce-todays-student-labor-activists/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>领导的情感景观</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-emotional-landscape-of-leadership/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-emotional-landscape-of-leadership/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 07 Dec 2023 12:00:37 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Benjamin Laker, Natalia Weisz, Vijay Pereira, and Alfredo De Massis. <p>Benjamin Laker <a href="https://twitter.com/drbenlaker">(@drbenlaker</a> ) is a professor of leadership at the University of Reading&#39;s Henley Business School in the UK Natalia Weisz is a professor of leadership at IAE Business School in Argentina.

On one side, there&#39;s a team seeking direction and inspiration;另一方面，高层正在仔细审查每一个决定。 This journey isn&#39;t just about taking on added responsibilities like managing teams and coordinating projects; it&#39;s also about stepping into a heightened arena of emotions that includes joy, pride, anxiety, fear, and occasional self-doubt.</p><p> As new leaders climb the organizational hierarchy, they face both the joys of success and the burden of failure, and the significance of their decisions is magnified in their more visible role. In our research — forthcoming in the journal <cite>BMJ Leader</cite> — approximately 67% of new leaders reported feeling immense pride when their team achieved a milestone. Similarly, 72% cited joy when their guidance positively impacted a team member&#39;s growth.</p><p></p><p> On the flip side, the pressures are evident too. About 58% of respondents confessed to experiencing anxiety when faced with critical decision-making, while almost half (49%) said they felt apprehensive about potential missteps being viewed critically by superiors. Interestingly, 53% of first-time leaders expressed occasional self-doubt, emphasizing the importance of mentorship and peer support in navigating this intricate leadership terrain.</p><p> Underlying these challenges is the essential yet often overlooked domain of emotional regulation, which stands out as a key determinant in the efficacy of leadership. Whereas an individual contributor might excel with technical prowess and domain knowledge alone, leadership mandates a heightened level of emotional intelligence — not just the capacity for personal emotional regulation but also the ability to recognize and manage the emotions of others. This emotional competency in leadership plays a pivotal role in shaping team dynamics. A leader with a high level of emotional intelligence fosters motivation, morale, and performance. In contrast, those who falter in this realm risk creating a counterproductive and potentially toxic environment, hampering creativity and impeding organizational progress.</p><p> Other skills and aptitudes are undeniably essential in leadership; however, it&#39;s the adept handling and comprehension of emotions that delineates a flourishing leader from one who merely gets by or even stumbles. Recognizing this significant nuance and its implications for leadership development, our research team sought to bridge this knowledge gap. We employed a two-step methodology: an initial broad survey, followed by qualitative interviews. The online questionnaire was directed at over 2,000 new leaders, especially those with two to five years of leadership experience. Feedback was collected over three months to gather insights into their experiences with emotions at work. Then, to gain a deeper understanding, we chose 100 new leaders to participate in detailed interviews.</p><p></p><h3> Regulating Emotions at Work: A Guide for First-Time Leaders</h3><p> Our research took a comprehensive look at the practical challenges leaders face and the strategies they employ in the area of emotional regulation. We identified common trends and insights that inform the six best practices that follow.</p><p> <strong>1. Understanding the role of self-awareness.</strong> The linchpin to effective emotional regulation in leadership is self-awareness. Leaders should routinely engage in introspection, asking themselves, “How do I feel right now?” and, “Is this emotion serving or hindering my leadership?” By actively addressing these questions, leaders can better understand and regulate their emotional responses. In our research, leaders who adopted this introspective approach witnessed a 45% improvement in team morale and a 38% increase in decision-making efficiency. Further, organizations reported a 32% rise in overall productivity when their leaders practiced consistent self-awareness. Embracing this approach not only bolsters leadership capabilities but tangibly benefits the entire team and organization.</p><p></p><p> <strong>2. Enhancing vision through diverse feedback.</strong> A leader&#39;s journey is not walked alone; feedback from trusted individuals can provide invaluable waypoints. Building a circle of mentors, peers, and even receptive subordinates allows leaders to gain insights beyond their immediate perspectives. Such external viewpoints can illuminate emotional blind spots, fostering growth and adaptability. Our research underscores the significance of this collaborative approach: Leaders who actively sought and integrated feedback experienced a 60% uptick in their adaptability to change and a 45% improvement in interpersonal relationships within their teams. In the dynamic landscape of leadership, this constant dialogue proves to be a keystone for sustained success.</p><p> <strong>3. Establishing boundaries for sustainable leadership.</strong> Assuming a leadership role is accompanied by heightened responsibilities. However, perpetually being on call can lead to burnout and diminished effectiveness. Setting clear boundaries, both for themselves and their teams, ensures that leaders have dedicated moments to decompress, reflect, and return with renewed vigor. Our findings underscore the pragmatic advantages of this approach: Leaders who established and communicated clear boundaries reported a 59% increase in their own productivity and a 51% enhancement in team satisfaction levels. Furthermore, these leaders noticed a 42% decrease in their own stress-related issues. Establishing boundaries is less about creating distance than it is about cultivating an environment where leaders and teams can function optimally.</p><p> <strong>4. Embracing authenticity — the strength of vulnerability.</strong> The mantle of leadership often comes with misplaced expectations of stoicism or an emotional facade, but true leadership strength can be found in authenticity and vulnerability. By acknowledging personal feelings and judiciously sharing them, leaders can bridge gaps, foster deeper connections, and engender trust within their teams. Our research found that leaders who embraced vulnerability witnessed a 66% increase in team trust levels and a 49% rise in team cohesion. Moreover, these authentic leaders reported a 38% improvement in their own job satisfaction. In the realm of leadership, vulnerability is not a liability; it&#39;s an asset that nurtures trust and authentic relationships.</p><p></p><p> <strong>5. Having extracurricular coping strategies — the key to balance.</strong> As leadership intensifies, the need for balance becomes paramount. Developing coping mechanisms outside the professional sphere is not a luxury but a necessity. Whether it&#39;s through physical activity, putting pen to paper in a journal, engaging in creative outlets, or cherishing moments with loved ones, these pursuits offer an essential emotional reset. According to our research, leaders who actively engaged in such extracurricular coping strategies saw a 56% reduction in work-related stress levels and a 47% increase in overall well-being. Additionally, these leaders noted a 43% improvement in their problem-solving capabilities within the workplace. Cultivating effective coping mechanisms is vital for a leader&#39;s holistic growth and endurance in their role.</p><p> <strong>6. Practicing breathing and mindfulness — anchors in chaos.</strong> In the fast-paced world of decision-making, the solution sometimes lies in simplicity: taking a moment to breathe. A single deep breath can provide immediate clarity amid chaos. Incorporating mindfulness and brief meditation practices into the daily routine establishes a bedrock of calm. By anchoring themselves in the present, leaders can tackle complex scenarios without being consumed by overwhelming emotions. Our research highlights tangible benefits: Leaders who integrated regular mindfulness practices into their lives reported a 50% enhancement in their emotional resilience and a 40% increase in clarity during high-pressure situations. This focus on the here and now is a cornerstone for modern leadership success.</p><h3> The Continuous Balancing Endeavor</h3><p> We urge every emerging leader to invest in emotional intelligence training and regularly engage in self-reflection in order to master their emotions and thereby lead with clarity and conviction. Consider taking these actions, starting today:</p><p> <strong>Regularly reflect.</strong> Commit to five to 10 minutes of introspective reflection daily, actively dissecting how your emotions drive your decisions. Document your insights in a journal, and push yourself to draw connections between feelings and actions. As days turn into weeks, you&#39;ll spot recurring patterns that shape your choices. Harness this newfound self-awareness and proactively channel it to make better, more informed decisions in your daily life.</p><p> <strong>Actively listen to varied voices.</strong> Begin each month with an intention to diversify your feedback channels: Select a colleague, a team member, and a mentor for their insights. Approach these conversations with an open heart, deliberately curbing the instinct to justify or counter the other person&#39;s perspectives. By absorbing their words and understanding their viewpoints, you&#39;re granting yourself a rich, multifaceted mirror into how you&#39;re perceived. Use this invaluable feedback as a directional compass that can steer you toward personal and professional development. And share your own experiences with your team: Discussing a personal lesson you learned or how you dealt with a challenge can foster an environment where others feel safe to share and learn.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Define digital work boundaries.</strong> Prioritize your well-being by establishing unmistakable “office hours” in digital environments, such as refraining from addressing work-related emails or messages after 7 pm Clearly communicate this boundary to your colleagues: Setting an example of the importance of work-life balance might inspire team members to carve out their own digital limits and protect their personal time. This proactive approach not only upholds individual well-being but also fortifies a collective respect for boundaries within the workplace.</p><p> <strong>Discover your personal reset mechanism.</strong> Earmark a minimum of one hour every week to immerse yourself in a non-work-related hobby or passion, be it painting, running, or reading a gripping novel. Recognize this time as your sacred reset hour — a sanctuary for your mind and soul. Opening up about your experiences and the refreshing benefits you reap can motivate your team members to also find and embrace their own “reset” passions. Such proactive dedication not only enriches individual well-being but also fosters a culture of holistic balance within a team.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Commence with calming breath work.</strong> Kick-start your day or pivotal meetings by dedicating the first two minutes to deliberate deep breathing exercises. Take the lead and set an example, guiding your team through the rhythm and benefits of this calming practice. By actively promoting this ritual, you not only rejuvenate individual minds but also cultivate a collective sense of serenity. Seize this tranquil foundation to steer discussions, decisions, or tasks with heightened focus and a unified approach.</p><p></p><p> While emotional regulation might seem like a small component in the grand scheme of leadership, it&#39;s critical in determining a leader&#39;s effectiveness. Emotions, if unchecked, can cloud judgment, create conflict, or lead to impulsive decisions. Conversely, when harnessed correctly, they can inspire, motivate, and drive a team to greatness. In today&#39;s fast-paced work environment where the lines between the personal and professional often blur, it&#39;s more crucial than ever for leaders, especially those stepping into the role for the first time, to master the art of regulating emotions at work.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-emotional-landscape-of-leadership/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>领导力发展让我们失望。这是修复方法</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/leadership-development-is-failing-us-heres-how-to-fix-it/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/leadership-development-is-failing-us-heres-how-to-fix-it/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 12:00:36 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Hannes Leroy, Moran Anisman-Razin, and Jim Detert. <p>Hannes Leroy is an associate professor in the Department of Organisation and Personnel Management at the Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University.

Those responsible for selecting such programs often struggle to show how their spending has produced significant, enduring changes in participants&#39; individual capacities or collective outcomes, yet operating executives continue to fund these efforts without requiring such accountability. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> The result: a massive leadership development industry in which few distinguish between snake oil and effective healing potions.</p><p> Our review of leadership development programs (LDPs) at several dozen business schools around the world illustrates the typical shortcomings. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> Few program directors we surveyed could identify how the design and evaluation of their leadership development offerings consistently meet scientific standards of desired impact. Instead of documenting improvement in participants&#39; capabilities, for example, the majority (70%) said they settle for positive reactions to the program or evidence of knowledge gained, at least in the short term (63%). None linked their programming to changes in participants&#39; career trajectories, followers&#39; attitudes or performance, or team- or organization-level outcomes.</p><p></p><p> Similarly, our recent interviews with 46 HR executives revealed that their selection of LDPs is seldom guided strongly by evidence of effectiveness. Rather, most acknowledged that they have made such decisions with limited information, often investing significant sums based on things like the “looks” of a program (such as a well-designed website) or the charisma of the faculty. As one executive noted, leadership development decisions seem to resemble the online dating industry, where swiping left or right is based more on appearance than substance.</p><p> This problem is not inevitable. From our years of studying leadership development, developing and delivering programs, and working with chief human resources officers and chief learning officers at organizations such as Ericsson, Microsoft, Philips, the Red Cross, and Siemens, we have arrived at a simple premise: Good leadership development requires attention to three core elements — a program&#39;s vision, method, and impact — and the integration between them.</p><p> Just a few good questions about a program, and careful parsing of the answers, can clarify how well each of these elements is designed and aligns with the others — and lead to significantly better decisions. This article will explain what makes for a quality program and outline the questions leaders and program developers should be asking to determine an LDP&#39;s effectiveness.</p><h3> A Solid Program Stands on Three Legs</h3><p> A leadership development program should be fundamentally about the growth of participants. An effective one will increase participants&#39; knowledge, skills, or abilities. Any evaluation of an LDP should start with its <em>vision</em> : what capabilities or qualities the program aims to develop in participants, why this is important, and how it will address specific developmental needs.</p><p> A good program will have very specific goals — for example, that participants will develop their leadership identity, or improve their emotional intelligence or their ability to think critically under stress. And it will clearly specify the foundational thinking or evidence on which it is built. If a program developer can&#39;t tell you what their specific vision is, why it&#39;s a fit with your own organization&#39;s needs and goals, and the principles it&#39;s based on, there&#39;s little reason to think you&#39;re going to get meaningful results.</p><p> There&#39;s also little reason to think you&#39;ll reach a desired destination if you don&#39;t have an effective plan for getting there. This is why the second key dimension to evaluate is the <em>method</em> of a leadership development program. This consists of curriculum (for example, participants will study illustrative cases and be taught effective techniques for strategic analysis) and teaching/learning methods (participants will discuss and debate, engage in experiential exercises, and build their own models, for instance).</p><p></p><p> The third component on which an LDP should be evaluated is its <em>impact</em> — the expected outcomes for participants and other stakeholders. Programs worth choosing can articulate how the participants will change. This is ultimately about a program&#39;s ability to clearly explain its expected results, including how those results are assessed.</p><p> Our experience suggests that most program buyers ask at least implicit questions about the vision, method, and impact of the LDPs they are considering. However, we assert that they often ask the wrong questions or are too readily satisfied with unsatisfactory responses when they do ask better questions. (See “Ask the Right Questions.”) Constrained by budget, time, or power to make operating changes, they&#39;re understandably drawn to programs that promise simplicity, novelty, and comfort for, and high ratings from, participants.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Ask the Right Questions</h4><p class="caption"> Managers tasked with choosing effective leadership development programs often don&#39;t gather the most useful information.

Combining vision, method, and impact into an integrated, consistent whole is required to produce meaningful results. (See “One Company&#39;s Approach to Improving Leadership Development.”) But this alignment is missing from many programs. Consider a program that promises to produce “leaders with superior emotional intelligence skills” that first assesses participants&#39; current capacities and then provides ideas for how to improve. The components are misaligned because the method is poorly suited to the vision of behavioral skill development. A stronger offering would have participants iteratively attempt to assess and manage their own and others&#39; emotions in real time, with guided coaching and correction provided along the way. Similarly, asking participants whether they enjoyed an emotional intelligence program or believe they&#39;ve improved fails to assess impact in a way that&#39;s aligned with the vision to improve skills. A more effective assessment would use multisource ratings to document emotional intelligence behavioral capacities before and after the program. </p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand-column"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> One Company&#39;s Approach to Improving Leadership Development</h4><p class="caption"> Here&#39;s how an industry-leading energy giant in Europe redesigned a leadership development program to better meet its needs.</p><table id="Chart#" class="chart-grouped-rows no-mobile"><thead><tr><th>想象</th><th>方法</th><th>影响</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><strong><span class="blue">•</span></strong> Facing changes in market dynamics, industry regulation, and public opinion, the CEO set out to enhance intrapreneurial behavior throughout the company.

Below, we suggest six alternatives to common queries. Sharper inquiry should help program buyers gain a better sense of the overall coherence of a program&#39;s vision, method, and impact.</p><p> <strong><em>Instead of asking</em> “Will participants experience personal growth?” <em>ask</em> “Will participants grow their ability to lead others?”</strong> Practicing yoga or tai chi.写日记。 Exercising and eating well.冥想。职业规划。 Reducing clutter. The opportunities to grow are nearly endless. As individuals, many of us have invested resources in learning about the activities above and would claim to have grown from doing so. But it&#39;s not clear that our capacities to lead others toward a shared objective improved as a result.</p><p> So why are these and so many other similar activities often included in leadership development? Savvy purveyors know it&#39;s a lot easier to get an organization to sponsor something supposedly related to leadership than to call it what it is: worthwhile human development that may or may not have any relation to the key behaviors required to lead others successfully. The problem is that associating too many things with leadership development often makes it become less, not more, respected. And this overly broad labeling helps explain why organizations might fund these kinds of learning experiences when times are good — understanding that they might contribute to broader objectives like personal well-being and longer-term growth in leadership capacity — but quickly cut what seem like fun perks when budgets get tight. One of us previously taught at a university where the leadership skills programming included things like learning golf and dining etiquette. Not surprisingly, most of the faculty pointed to courses like these when arguing that leadership development is an unscientific endeavor unworthy of a serious educational institution.</p><p> That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to keep the program&#39;s vision front and center. How is the proposed program related to the ability to lead others effectively, and over what time frame? There needs to be an explanation of how this learning directly contributes to key aspects of leading. This isn&#39;t to say that nothing outside of nuts-and-bolts skills training (such as setting goals and motivating others) can be linked to leading successfully, but the links need to be explicitly made.</p><p> Research on effective leadership development points to the importance of linking what participants will learn to a <em>needs analysis</em> — an assessment of gaps between organizational objectives or role requirements and a learner&#39;s current capabilities. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> Some LDP providers, such as the consulting firm Mercuri Urval, refuse to work with organizations that won&#39;t start with a needs analysis that establishes the leadership challenges connected to company context and strategy, because it&#39;s key to demonstrating an LDP&#39;s ROI and impact.</p><p> <strong><em>Instead of asking</em> “Will they be motivated to attend?” <em>ask</em> “Will they be motivated to use what they learn?”</strong> Most of us aren&#39;t motivated to go to medical appointments because we find them enjoyable; we go only if we think they will help keep us healthy or restore us to health. That is, we&#39;re motivated not by the experience itself but by the utility of the advice and treatment we receive.</p><p> We believe that the same logic should apply to choosing an LDP, but we&#39;ve seen that programs are often selected more for their entertainment value than their usefulness. Programs should be selected based on expectations for what participants will be able to do as a result of having attended the program, not based on features designed primarily to entice them to attend.</p><p></p><p> Of course, motivation to attend is relevant — but it isn&#39;t the same as motivation to subsequently use what has been learned, that is, <em>motivation to transfer</em> . <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> That comes from programming that is sufficiently relevant to the goals or problems of participants to be purposefully recalled and applied in subsequent situations. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> This is why connecting learning and development directly to on-the-job experiences can be so powerful, though it is much more challenging than classroom learning. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p> The lesson for leadership development initiatives, in a nutshell: Select programs based on the evidence about what participants will be able and motivated to do after attending, not how excited they&#39;ll be to show up. Tell participants how the program will be useful for addressing the things they care about, and make sure the program then does so explicitly. When participants, like patients, believe that the treatment they&#39;ve been prescribed will reduce their distress or promote their health, they&#39;ll be motivated to stay engaged.</p><p> <strong><em>Instead of asking</em> “Is it easy enough?” <em>ask</em> “Is it appropriately complex?”</strong> When you get on a plane, do you hope the pilot&#39;s training was easy and convenient?当然不是。 You hope that it&#39;s been sufficiently rigorous and appropriately complex so that the pilot knows what to do when they hit unexpected weather or experience equipment malfunctions in flight. You hope the same is true for the air traffic controllers overseeing planes&#39; flight paths. You want their training to have been designed to prepare them to skillfully use what they&#39;ve learned, not to maximize some other objectives. In contrast, all too often, leadership development programs are designed to maximize convenience for participants or to minimize interference with work deemed more important.</p><p> The science of effective learning has clearly shown that learning is deeper and more durable when it&#39;s effortful. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> This means that if you want participants to reliably encode what they&#39;ve learned into long-term memory and be able to reliably retrieve and use what they&#39;ve learned in a variety of relevant contexts, you need to do things that both participants and educators find less appealing in real time. This includes spacing out the learning rather than massing it into a single block; interleaving new topics throughout rather than sticking to a single theme until participants have achieved mastery; and varying the conditions of practice. These techniques can make it significantly more challenging to run an LDP, but they&#39;re crucial to supporting the ultimate goals: the sustained transfer of learning, and improved results. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a></p><p> The truth is that if something is important enough to merit significant investment, it&#39;s also likely to be complicated enough that efficacy must be prioritized over ease.</p><p> <strong><em>Instead of asking</em> “Will participants be comfortable?” <em>ask</em> “Will participants learn, even if they&#39;re uncomfortable?”</strong> Concerns for participants&#39; comfort seem to guide the design of far too many programs. It&#39;s clear why this is the case; a program that doesn&#39;t score well on immediate post-program satisfaction surveys might not be funded again. However, meta-analytic research evidence indicates that there is generally no significant relationship between liking an educational experience and learning from it, or between short-term satisfaction and the transfer of what has been learned. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a> We know from both experience and the literature that growth comes through crucible experiences of trial and tribulation, not from being comfortable in the moment.</p><p></p><p> It&#39;s established, for example, that development involves getting out of one&#39;s comfort zone — facing rather than avoiding challenging experiences — and that higher-intensity practice (more physically or emotionally taxing, for instance) leads to more improvement (as long as it stops before the point of overload). We also know from psychology that avoiding or minimizing the duration or intensity of discomfort actually interferes with learning new patterns and replacing old ones. <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a> Put simply, you don&#39;t overcome an aversion to public speaking or challenging interpersonal interactions by hiding from them; you do so by facing them in supportive learning environments. This is consistent with the core of cognitive behavioral therapy: To sustainably change your behavior, you have to surface, challenge, reinterpret, and replace unhelpful thoughts and feelings currently associated with difficult situations. That&#39;s not easy or comfortable, but it is effective.</p><p> That&#39;s why the company BOLD (Beyond Outdoor Leadership Development) seeks to advance traditional outdoor training by stretching participants beyond their comfort zones in challenging wilderness expeditions. In the pressure-cooker environment of a novel, high-stress context, participants are encouraged to experiment with new behaviors that will build or hone leadership capabilities. BOLD designs the experiences to create the deeper, more enduring well-being that comes from self-growth rather than the immediate but fleeting well-being associated directly with enjoying the experience itself. <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a> And, in fact, longer-term satisfaction scores often are very high as a result of the growth experienced.</p><p> <strong><em>Instead of asking</em> “Will we change participants&#39; hearts and minds?” <em>ask</em> “Will we see changes in how participants behave?”</strong> Here&#39;s another guiding belief we&#39;re wary of: If you change people&#39;s thinking, you&#39;ll change their behavior. That sounds good but is problematic for at least two reasons: Changing behavior-guiding beliefs is very hard, and the link between attitudes and behavior, in general, just isn&#39;t that strong. If this sounds counterintuitive, consider how often people&#39;s belief that exercise is good for them, their desire to be healthy, and even their intention to work out 30 minutes a day don&#39;t reliably result in the desired behavior — actually exercising.</p><p> It&#39;s well documented that by adulthood, people vary considerably in how they see the world — how, for example, they prioritize different values and how strongly they endorse different beliefs. Adult attitudes are deeply ingrained and far too resistant to change for a short intervention to be likely to alter them.</p><p> Even if it were easy to change attitudes, decades of research suggest that there&#39;s a low likelihood that this would translate to sustained behavior change. In general, attitudes don&#39;t predict relevant behaviors very well; they become more reliably connected only when people consciously set up concrete behavioral commitments and accountability processes and do the hard work associated with forming new habits. Other research suggests that it&#39;s useful to think about value change as a desired product of behavior change (not its cause) because our sensemaking about what we do can influence what we believe. <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a></p><p> Scholars of diversity, equity, and inclusion in organizations know all too well that leadership programs focused on DEI beliefs or attitudes can leave daily behaviors largely unchanged. Even programs that show clear positive effects on attitudes often have limited impact on behaviors. Whether this reflects the general challenges of connecting attitude change to behavioral change or another possibility — that people often espouse values that don&#39;t reflect their actual beliefs, perhaps because they know what the socially accepted position is — the result is the same. Changing what people say they believe is seldom the ultimate vision of an LDP, and it&#39;s often a poor proxy for how they subsequently behave. So why not measure what tends to matter more: what people do differently following a development program.</p><p> <strong><em>Instead of asking</em> “How will we justify the spend?” <em>ask</em> “Will we spend only what we can justify?”</strong> Those who run operating units of any size are similar to venture investors and loan officers: They&#39;re not interested in (re)investing in poorly justified opportunities, because their own outcomes depend on the return on what they put in. Therefore, make a solid case for the ROI of LDPs. Communications consultant Nancy Duarte suggests, for example, that if you believe pitch coaching is a valuable development area for salespeople, then your program should include a plan to track how the pitches that participants develop and practice during the program are subsequently used and whether they increase contract renewals or new sales. <a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a> Or, if you&#39;re hiring a partner to deliver the LDP, insist that it also be invested in its outcomes. Consider the example of Great Lakes Institute of Management, a consulting firm in India: It has a pay-for-performance fee structure wherein a percentage of its compensation is tied directly to noticeable post-program changes in participants.</p><p> Here&#39;s a more provocative idea for those in leadership development: If you can&#39;t make a compelling case for investment, don&#39;t spend the money you were allocated. Producing underwhelming results with the budgeted amount doesn&#39;t compel future investment; rather, it undermines it by reinforcing skeptics&#39; beliefs that the returns aren&#39;t worth the expense. So if you know you can expect meaningful outcomes only with twice the allocation you have, consider developing a compelling explanation for why you&#39;re going to run the program only every other year. Refusing to spend what you have might feel risky, but the courage to do so might be what it takes to inspire longer-term support for leadership development.</p><p> None of this means that the only useful investments are those that can be tied directly and immediately to financial outcomes. That&#39;s a decidedly limited view of human development that ignores the myriad ways in which employee growth and well-being are also indirectly related to individual and organizational objectives. But that doesn&#39;t obviate the need for the rigorous thinking and sound measurement that are central to good leadership development.</p><h3> Partner With Program Developers for Better Results</h3><p> Breaking the cycle of wasted resources and disappointing results from leadership development programs won&#39;t come solely from more rigorous evaluation of programs by buyers. It&#39;s unlikely to happen unless key stakeholders stop blaming each other after the fact and start working together constructively upfront. What&#39;s required is a stronger partnership between the senior executives who sponsor leadership development and the HR personnel and/or program developers who select, manage, and deliver it. Neither side can align vision, method, and impact without the support of the other.</p><p></p><p> In a healthy partnership, both parties have a seat at the table, agree to acknowledge their responsibility for what is and what should be, and agree to make changes when things aren&#39;t working. Leadership development personnel might, for example, push back harder on demands for convenient delivery schedules and reject a focus on program satisfaction scores. And they could commit to doing better at linking programming and its results to key organizational objectives. For their part, operating executives could stop complaining that development takes participants away from their “real jobs” for too long and start looking beyond short-term outcomes when evaluating programs.
