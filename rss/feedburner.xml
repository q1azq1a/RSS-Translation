12%，或者病毒可以扰乱商品、零部件和人才的全球流动时，一家公司在面对不断发展的事件时快速适应的能力对其生存和繁荣至关重要。</p><p>业务弹性是一种动态属性，可通过企业价值在不断变化的环境中的稳定性和持久性进行回顾性衡量。实时性体现在企业对业务环境的即时变化和渐进变化的及时适应。</p><p>我们的工作采用了企业的复杂适应性系统视图，表明弹性源自三种基本的适应能力：感知和监控，以识别商业环境中出现的新变化；业务模型组合开发，以构建和测试跨运营环境的能力；和基础能力建设，以长寿驱动增长，避免企业停滞。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a>此外，这些能力中的每一项都取决于<em>风险情报</em>能力的发展。</p><p></p><p>我们将风险情报定义为严格解释风险及其给公司带来的后果或机会的磨练能力。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a>它使领导者能够看穿环境的复杂性，并系统地识别、分类和解释风险。这使他们能够超越已知的风险因素，有意识地探索未知的风险，从而拥抱而不是避免不确定性。重要的是，风险情报让人们认识到，个别风险或它们表现出来的形式远不及它们对公司价值交换系统的共同后果——即管理、识别、创造、传达、交付、获取、保护和维持价值。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a>最后，它为领导者提供了风险的网络视图，不仅阐明了风险的直接后果，还阐明了风险在公司价值交换系统中级联的方式，从而能够更有效地分配风险缓解资源。在本文中，我们将风险情报分解为可操作的元素，领导者可以追求这些元素，以帮助长期加强他们的组织。</p><h3>识别、分类和解释风险事件</h3><p>领导者无法准确预测特定的风险事件，也无法让公司为所有风险做好准备。然而，他们可以系统地识别、分类和解释风险事件，揭示看似不同的事件可能产生相似的后果。</p><p>第一步是研究每个业务价值函数，并确定可能对其有效性产生影响的似是而非的风险事件。为了帮助完成这一过程，我们构建了一个与行业无关的清单，将我们的研究中确定的与个体价值交换系统组件相关的 99 个主要风险类别分为三层。 （请参阅“价值函数风险清单”。）虽然不可避免地并不详尽，但该资源可作为识别任何企业面临的潜在风险的可靠起点。 </p><div class="callout-highlight callout-highlight--transparent callout--expand-column" id="fig1"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>价值函数风险清单</h4><p class="caption">这份源自标准普尔 500 指数 20 年数据的风险清单显示了公司价值交换系统（绿色节点）的功能如何与业务功能及其各自的风险类别相关联。 </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MAG_FE_Sheth_fig1.png" alt="价值函数风险清单"/></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p>接下来，领导者应该根据风险事件的影响<em>范围</em>、它们引起的变化的<em>持久性</em>以及事件发生的<em>频率</em>来描述和分组风险事件。 （参见“风险特征”。）领导者随后可以解释每组风险事件与公司价值交换系统组成部分之间的联系。</p><div class="callout-highlight" id="fig2"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>表征风险</h4><p class="caption">每一种风险都可以根据其影响的广泛程度、它引起的变化可能持续多长时间以及它发生的频率来描述。例如，大雪事件具有行业内范围、诱发临时变化、发生频率低等特点。 </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MAG_FE_Sheth_fig2.png" alt="表征风险" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p>风险分类从了解风险事件的范围开始，它传达了一种风险影响在受影响的利益相关者范围内的感受范围。 COVID-19 大流行的广泛范围在整个价值网络中产生了供需方面的影响，而范围狭窄的事件，例如单个制造工厂的罢工，往往会产生更有限的影响。当多个利益相关者经历同时或相继的中断时，影响的复杂性增加会阻止系统自组织恢复常态。这种情况也可能会引起主权国家或国际组织的干预，它们可以帮助恢复或充当新的破坏力量。</p><p>要对风险事件进行全面分类，领导者还必须考虑其后果的持久性。大流行和 2021 年苏伊士运河堵塞都造成了供应方中断，但每个事件引起的变化的持久性差异很大。虽然运河堵塞等供应链冲击通常遵循自组织修正机制，即价格上涨降低需求并使滞后供应正常化，但同样的公式不能用于应对像大流行这样的长期情况。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a>在规划和实施响应策略之前了解持久性很重要。例如，大流行造成的业务中断范围更广，后果更持久，与运河堵塞的影响更有限相比，影响的价值体系功能要多得多。</p><p></p><p>风险事件发生的频率也很重要，因为处理频繁事件所需的企业机制可能不同于处理单一事件的机制。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a>尽管公司从所有事件中学习，但他们对重复发生的事件的响应通常会转化为标准操作程序。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a>例如，采用条形码和扫描仪实时跟踪和管理库存，在很大程度上消除了由于数据不匹配而导致的库存记​​录错误和延误。</p><p>我们的范围、持久性和频率 (SPF) 框架提供了一个结构化视图，显示风险事件本身如何不如其后果重要。当多个风险事件同时发生时，该框架特别有用，因为它为管理人员提供了一种通用的、合乎逻辑的方法来考虑它们并快速获取信息和理解。然后将这些事件与公司的价值交换系统联系起来，经理们可以更容易地看到不同的风险何时仍然会对其价值函数产生类似的后果。 <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p>考虑一家制造商与一家海外供应商打交道，其产品由于贸易战而突然被征收高得多的关税，以及一家价值链合作伙伴的破产。这些风险事件具有 SPF 特征（两者的范围都是公司间的，它们的持久性是可逆的，并且它们的频率很低），并且同样重要的是，这两个事件也会影响相同的价值函数。破产和贸易战都可能减缓投入并提高供应方的成本，使满足客户需求变得更加困难。两者还需要制造商确保新的供应来源并稳定运营现金流。通过根据 SPF 框架描述这些潜在风险事件的特征并将它们与价值函数联系起来，管理人员可以将它们更简单地视为对公司的特定价值函数具有共同后果并需要类似准备和响应的风险组。</p><h3>划分和减少不确定性</h3><p>风险事件后果的不确定性是不可避免的，但可以根据不确定性水平落在完全了解和完全无知（两者都是极端且不太可能）之间的范围内来管理。 <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a>然后，领导者应设法将具有较高影响不确定性的风险降低到较低水平。 （参见“影响不确定性的管理水平”。） </p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand-column" id="fig3"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>管理影响不确定性水平</h4><p class="caption">一旦管理人员将风险映射到适当的级别，他们应该采取建议的关键行动，将高阶风险转换为低阶风险。 </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MAG_FE_Sheth_fig3.png" alt="管理影响不确定性水平" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p></p><p>导致 1 级不确定性的风险事件通常涉及数量非常有限的具有明显公司内部影响的未来情景，在这些情景中，可以准确了解风险事件与企业价值交换系统之间的因果关系。此类事件的示例包括生产中的例行变化、预期的销售损失以及执行手动任务时的人为错误。当特定类型的 1 级事件频繁发生时，它们表明过程中存在错误或疏忽，如果诊断正确，这些错误可以永久纠正。例如，货物盗窃——在拥堵的交通枢纽中经常发生的问题——可以使用跟踪集装箱货运并保持实时记录的光学字符识别扫描仪来防止。重要的是，在第 1 级，对公司价值影响的总体不确定性在预期的可接受范围内。</p><p>导致 2 级不确定性的风险事件涉及大量的替代未来情景并具有公司间后果；然而，尽管它们更具挑战性，但它们发生的可能性及其影响是可以估计的。企业的正式情景规划练习通常涉及 2 级事件，在这些事件中，先前获得的有关风险因素影响的知识可以提高准确性和整体有效练习。为期六天的苏伊士运河堵塞是可以预见的，因为 2018 年多艘船连环相撞使运河关闭了两天。因此，五角大楼已经在其正常运营准备中进行了更长时间的堵塞。 <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p>导致 3 级不确定性的风险事件涉及一组有限的场景，其中某些已知风险事件可能以未知方式影响公司。关于风险事件后果的连锁反应如何在这个层面上表现出来的知识有限。通常，这些风险包括具有行业内范围和多利益相关方影响的不太频繁发生的事件，应将其视为最坏的情况。</p><p> <a href="https://www.portrevel.com/">Port Revel</a>是一个位于法国阿尔卑斯山湖上的培训设施，它通过帮助海运公司模拟最坏的情况并确定通过主要为小型船舶设计的航运基础设施运营越来越大的集装箱船的先前未知后果来降低 3 级不确定性。它密切模拟了海上运输中最棘手地点的条件，允许实习飞行员在强风中驾驶大型集装箱船穿越迷你苏伊士运河，在拥挤的迷你旧金山湾驾驶和停靠游轮，以及操纵油轮通过仿亚瑟港。这些演习引出了意想不到的船舶性能和飞行员行为，有助于识别和解决以前未知的事件后果。</p><p>第 4 级不确定性包括具有未知风险因素的事件，这些事件可能会产生各种负面后果，其影响无法估计。这些未知的未知因素通常通过“其他未知风险可能影响我们的业务运营和预期绩效”等陈述以 10-K 表示。在存在未知未知数的情况下开发场景模型具有挑战性。这些模型是对世界的不完整表征，在开发它们时可能会带来无法想象的风险。</p><p>一旦领导者将影响的不确定性排序为不同的级别，他们就可以专注于通过数据、模拟建模和逻辑分析发现未知因素，将较高级别的影响不确定性转化为较低级别。例如，2016 年英国脱欧公投与 2019 年脱离欧盟之间的三年时间间隔为领导人提供了一个机会，可以将想象中的事件转化为可能的情景，并把握其巨大的贸易影响。通过关注其价值链中最脆弱的方面，例如跨境交易数量最多的方面，领导者本可以认识到通过拥挤港口的货物即将重新分配，并模拟重新路由场景。例如，众所周知，费利克斯托处理着英国 48% 的集装箱贸易，这些货物本来可以发往多个较小且不那么繁忙的港口。港口即将拥堵的迹象也可能暗示延误的可能性很高，并且需要在英国持有更多库存以保证准时交货。</p><p>可能产生永久影响的全系统变化通常是由明显的大趋势引起的，例如技术突破、消费者需求模式的变化、全球事件或监管机构的干预。一旦这些趋势出现在公司的雷达上，它们就可以被跟踪并快速解释（如果必要的观察和建模能力到位）。例如，经过多年辩论后于 2022 年 12 月颁布的欧盟碳边境税要到 2026 年才能全面实施，为企业提供数年时间来减少由此产生的不确定性。</p><p></p><p>此外，对于可能不常见但影响很大的潜在事件，企业可以检查可能更好地认识到类似事件的后果的其他行业；然后他们可以解释对他们自己的价值交换系统的影响。例如，英国脱欧战略家本可以研究美国和加拿大以及美国和墨西哥在汽车和白色家电行业的跨境贸易，以帮助他们应对迫在眉睫的自由贸易协定和边境法规。</p><p>主动识别似是而非的风险事件及其潜在后果是有助于建立真正风险情报的行动类型。然而，我们的研究表明，公司很少强调发现未知和似是而非的风险事件及其结果，而是将注意力集中在管理已知风险上。我们还发现，即使直接竞争对手公开披露了这些风险，公司也不具备类似的完整风险知识。我们对 10-Ks 的研究表明，即使在同一行业的公司之间，对风险因素的认识也存在显着差异。例如，在金融行业 18 家可比公司首次公开数据泄露后，他们对网络风险的认识滞后了八年之久。这种模式在另外四个行业中是一致的——包括零售、电信、技术和医疗保健。</p><p>此外，我们的分析表明，人们对风险因素之间因果关系的认识程度很低，这就是风险在现实世界中如何影响公司。一个已知或未知的风险因素一旦显现，可能会影响其他相关的已知和未知风险因素，从而产生一连串的后果，这是合乎逻辑的。这最终会以可能已知但出乎意料（或更糟的是，被误解）的方式影响一家公司。</p><p></p><p>虽然大多数公司认为他们正在为风险事件做准备，但他们往往只关注 1 级和 2 级不确定性，因此制定了高度具体但范围狭窄的缓解计划。以马士基为例，该公司在 2017 年成为勒索软件网络攻击的受害者，导致其整个网络瘫痪数日，并停止了全球 76 个港口码头的运营，损失约为 3 亿美元。 <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a>然而，这家航运公司直到 2013 年年度报告才公开承认网络攻击的风险，尽管黑客攻击和其他网络威胁的风险自 1990 年代末以来就广为人知（尽管可能并未被认真视为托运人的主要风险）。因此，很少有风险是完全未知的，而特定行业的未知数在其他部门可能不是未知数。</p><h3>构建企业风险网络并将其情境化</h3><p>要更清楚地了解 3 级和 4 级不确定性，了解企业风险之间的联系非常重要。开发量化风险网络 (QRN) 会有所帮助。 QRN 是一张加权图，它将所有已识别的潜在风险与公司的价值交换系统功能联系起来，并帮助决策者解释相关影响。此外，QRN 可以揭示违反直觉的见解，例如一个功能间接暴露于通常与不同但相关的功能相关的风险。例如，货运公司航运需求预测不准确的风险直接影响其运营费用管理功能，并间接影响设施容量、运营能力和客户让步以及公司声誉。</p><p>出于三个原因，公司应该建立自己的风险网络。首先，每家公司都有自己独特的价值交换体系，其领导层最了解这一点。其次，有弹性的公司需要建立冗余，这在资源受限的环境中很难做到。自定义 QRN 突出了连接最紧密且最脆弱的价值函数，从而创建了分配资源以支持企业的优先顺序。第三，自定义 QRN 为公司领导提供了风险共享图，他们可能会或可能不会就关键漏洞达成一致。 QRN 构建活动将管理注意力集中在经常被忽视但可能至关重要的职能和相关风险类别上，以最终帮助领导者预测未来并为未来做好准备。</p><p>要开始构建您公司的风险网络，请根据您的业务所依赖的关键价值函数和清单中捕获的风险类别来识别与您的业务特别相关的风险事件。从公司备忘录、公共风险披露、投资分析师报告和历史知识等数据源中识别每个类别中的似是而非的风险事件。例如，管理运营职能的领导者可以使用库存风险类别（例如设施和流程管理、采购和分销）来构建一个合理的风险因素或事件列表（例如意外风暴、设备故障、输入短缺、应急物资耗尽、工人健康紧急情况、通信中断或罢工），这些都可能影响业务连续性。请注意，这些列表可能包含每个风险类别下的多个风险因素。</p><p>接下来，使用 SPF 框架描述相关风险，确定与公司价值函数相关的合理情景，并确定潜在的应对措施。这种做法使管理人员有机会特别注意不太重视的风险，并帮助他们降低风险对公司价值交换系统影响的总体不确定性水平。</p><p>由于原型公司是按功能组织的，因此应该为 QRN 中的每个功能节点估计潜在风险对单个功能的影响（例如罢工对采购的影响）以及不同价值功能之间的相互关联性。例如，一旦管理者定义了公司采购和运营职能之间的相互关联程度，他们就可以推断出罢工对采购的直接影响及其对运营的间接影响。加权影响，即使使用高、中、低等相对术语，也为管理人员提供了一种共同语言来讨论重大风险和可能的情景，并有助于解决关于什么是可能的或什么是重要的争论。被确定为特别重要或脆弱的功能应由专家进行分析，以更深入地了解影响它们的风险及其相互关联性。</p><p>我们创建了一个通用的 QRN，首先要求具有部门和职能专业知识的领导者以 10 分制表示他们的职能与其他业务职能之间的相互联系。 （参见“定量风险网络”。）然后，我们要求领导者说明这些联系所产生的特定风险对其职能领域的潜在影响。例如，一位表示与业务战略职能有显着关联的销售和营销专家被问及销售预测风险、销售执行风险和声誉风险是否会对业务战略产生高、中或低影响。公司可以遵循此流程，通过利用内部领导者和外部专家来建立统一的理解。一旦编码，数据就构成了风险网络表示和公司特定 QRN 的基础。 </p><div class="callout-highlight callout-highlight--transparent callout--expand-column" id="fig4"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>量化风险网络</h4><p class="caption">这种广义 QRN 的可视化表示揭示了风险类别与企业职能之间的联系。它说明了公司如何分离和识别连接多个相关风险的关键价值函数，因此在构建企业弹性方面尤为重要。功能越中心，字体越大； QRN 中的粗链接意味着功能和风险类别之间的高影响关系。 </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MAG_FE_Sheth_fig4.png" alt="量化风险网络" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p>这样的 QRN 通过阐明价值交换系统的核心功能，帮助领导者更好地了解公司对风险事件的脆弱性。影响核心功能的风险事件将意味着对公司价值交换系统产生强烈的负面影响。例如，财务资本管理直接连接到 15 个财务风险类别，并间接连接到其他职能的 30 个风险类别。在影响金融资本管理的任何一个风险类别中发生的任何事件都将对所有其他相关职能产生影响；例如，重大的货币风险可能会影响公司的采购决策。因此，保护​​金融资本管理职能对于弹性至关重要。相比之下，对营销和销售职能的负面影响不太可能对该公司造成级联影响。 <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a></p><p>专家知识、行业见解、经验和模拟都有助于构建企业风险的网络视图。 QRN 是基准资源，可帮助公司隔离最坏情况并对其进行客观建模，估计因果模式，并有效降低 3 级和 4 级不确定性。</p><p>拥有完善的 QRN 的公司将能够区分由于流行病和运输路线阻塞等原因导致的业务中断的范围和后果。它还将能够查明可能会因这些事件而遭受重大后果的业务部分，例如价值交付、价值创造和价值保护，并确定应该为这些事件中的每一个事件保护的准确业务功能。在大流行的情况下，这些功能将包括财务资本管理、市场风险评估和技术管理；对于范围较小的阻塞，这些将包括运营管理和运营费用控制。此外，公司可以使用价值函数风险清单，并为在每个函数中识别的风险事件构建场景模型。</p><p>最终，将似是而非的风险事件的知识及其可能与公司价值函数的相互作用相结合，使战略家能够制定量身定制的缓解计划和应对策略。认识到需要更好地了解一组特定场景的领导者可以投资开发精确的模型，以减少它们对公司影响的不确定性。</p><p></p><p></p><p>驱动任何大型复杂企业的价值交换系统不断受到挑战，因为动态业务环境中的上下文会发生变化。这增加了预测变化、探索新的商业模式变体以及不断追求下一波增长支持能力的风险。风险情报有助于领导者开展这项工作，使他们能够更好地专注于维持持续的价值交换并培养实现弹性所需的适应性。</p><p>为了创建和培养风险情报，公司需要一个中央风险管理职能部门，该职能部门配备广泛的职能专业知识，并提供识别和分类风险所需的资源。它需要接受风险不确定性与风险规避的心态，并降低不确定性水平。它需要一个以动态方式更新的特定于公司的量化风险网络。最后，它需要一种风险情报文化，在这种文化中，整个组织的领导者共享一个共同的框架和语言来解释风险和指导资源分配以减轻风险。归根结底，磨练风险智能能力是构建弹性企业的关键。</p><p></p>

For example, loan originators were increasingly underwriting mortgages based on lower credit standards and substantially less documentation than before. So an original assumption undergirding Moody&#39;s M3 Prime model — that the technology that mortgage originators were using to streamline the loan application process was also enabling a more accurate assessment of underlying risks — wasn&#39;t modified to reflect the changing lending environment. The managing director of credit policy at Moody&#39;s told a federal inquiry panel that he sat on a high-level structured credit committee that would have been expected to deal with issues like declining mortgage underwriting standards, but the topic was never raised. “We talked about everything but … the elephant sitting on the table,” he said. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6个</a></p><p></p><p>Moody&#39;s model also assumed that consumers&#39; FICO credit scores were the primary predictive factor in loan defaults. But the quality of this data input significantly diminished over time: As the use of these credit scores became increasingly common, individuals found ways to artificially inflate them. As a result, low- and no-documentation mortgages carried latent risk that was not being taken into account in Moody&#39;s algorithmic model. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p> <strong>Superficial remodeling.</strong> This phenomenon occurs when organizations make only minor modifications to the algorithmic model in response to substantive changes in the environment. At Moody&#39;s, some major changes to the environment included a growing number of loan originators, increasingly low-quality mortgages, and an unprecedented decline in interest rates.</p><p> Moody&#39;s response to these changes was to seek to capture more business in the rapidly growing market, so it fine-tuned the model to be “more efficient, more profitable, cheaper, and more versatile,” according to its chief credit officer — not to be more accurate. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> When it modified M3 Prime to introduce the M3 Subprime model, it extrapolated loss curves for subprime loans based on premium loans rather than developing fresh loss curves for subprime loans.</p><p> <strong>Simulation of the unknown future.</strong> Relying on an algorithmic model to produce viable scenarios for the future environment can also leave organizations vulnerable to algorithmic inertia. Moody&#39;s constructed a simulation engine featuring 1,250 macroeconomic scenarios that enabled it to estimate possible future losses based on variations in economic markers such as inflation, unemployment, and house prices. However, the simulation engine was limited by its underlying structure and assumptions, so analysts did not consider the changes that were occurring, did not update scenarios, and failed to accurately represent the changing macroeconomic environment. Based on the belief that detailed performance histories could more precisely reveal causal links between economic stresses and loan behavior, Moody&#39;s used estimates based on historical parameters rather than expected pool loss distributions to examine behavior in stress scenarios. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p> <strong>Specialized compartmentalization.</strong> This situation arises when experts in different domains are involved in an algorithm&#39;s design and use and there is no overarching single ownership or shared understanding of the model. At Moody&#39;s, responsibilities for the credit rating routine were divided between the domain experts (credit rating committee members) who used the quantitative model and the quantitative analysts who had developed it.</p><p> Because ownership and use of the model were distributed, and Moody&#39;s didn&#39;t strictly define how to use it, credit rating committee members established ad hoc rules to adjust the results of the model when its outputs didn&#39;t conform to what their expert judgment led them to believe it ought to produce. Model outputs weren&#39;t considered final; rather, the models were seen as tools to be used in conjunction with other approaches, and there was much divergence in how different ratings committees made their determinations.</p><p> The models were developed and modified by individuals who were distant from the domains in which they would be applied; disparate groups of domain experts then used the models in inconsistent ways without understanding their underlying logic. The managing director for rating RMBSs described the model as so technically complex that few people understood how it worked. <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a></p><p> This issue is at the heart of what makes algorithmic inertia hard to tackle: The models and algorithms are often so complex that domain experts can hardly grasp the details of their functioning, while data scientists are disconnected from how their models are being used in the real world.</p><h3> Develop Practices That Combat Algorithmic Inertia</h3><p> We have described how each of the causes of algorithmic inertia played out in Moody&#39;s use of an algorithmic model to dynamically incorporate changes in the environment into its credit ratings. Despite recognizing flaws in the model and making active attempts to change it, the organization was unable to effectively adapt to the environment, thereby substantially contributing to the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p> To prevent similar degradation of critical algorithms&#39; predictive value, we suggest that organizations implement the four practices described below. (See “Keeping Algorithms Relevant.”)</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Keeping Algorithms Relevant</h4><p class="caption"> Organizations can increase the likelihood that algorithmic tools will effectively adapt to changes in the environment by following four practices. </p><table id="Chart#" class="chart-grouped-rows no-mobile"><thead><th style="border-right:hidden;border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;"></th><th style="border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;"></th></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right:hidden;border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding-left:0px;"><p> <strong>Expose Data and Assumptions</strong></p></td><td style="border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;"><p> Articulate and document the data and the fundamental assumptions in the algorithmic model. </p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right:hidden;background-color:#f0f0f0;border-bottom-color:black;padding-left:0px;"><p> <strong>Periodically Redesign Algorithmic Routines</strong></p></td><td  style="background-color:#f0f0f0;;border-bottom-color:black;"><p> Periodically redesign — and be willing to overhaul — the algorithmic model and how it fits into broader organizational routines. </p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right:hidden;border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding-left:0px;"><p> <strong>Assume That the Model Will Break</strong></p></td><td style="border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;"><p> Actively consider scenarios outside the scope of algorithmic models by challenging predictive assumptions, assuming that the model will be fundamentally flawed, and envisioning qualitative alternative predictions of the future.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right:hidden;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding-left:0px;"><p> <strong>Build Bridges Between Data Scientists and Domain Experts</strong></p></td><td style="background-color:#f0f0f0;"><p> Ensure that data scientists and domain experts work closely together to design the algorithmic model and the organizational routine in which it is to be embedded. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><!--IMAGE FALLBACK FOR MOBILE BELOW --></p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MAG_Glaser_Table_2.png" alt="Keeping Algorithms Relevant" class="no-desktop" /></p></article></aside></div><p></p><p> <strong>Expose data and assumptions.</strong> Organizations should articulate and document the data used in their algorithmic models, including data sources and fundamental assumptions underlying their data selection decisions, which can have deleterious effects. <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a> Models often include operationalizations of many concepts, and it is easy for organizations to lose track of these parameters, which can be buried in layers of software code. Parameters representing the environment need to be documented to ensure that they remain visible. Similarly, the fundamental assumptions undergirding the model should be articulated and periodically revisited.</p><p> Moody&#39;s used a data set on premium mortgages to train a model that was intended to be used to rate RMBSs composed of subprime mortgages. Initially, this might have been a reasonable choice due to the availability of data. But when a model&#39;s initial data set isn&#39;t refreshed, algorithmic inertia can result. As the Moody&#39;s case suggests, data is never completely accurate, objective, and flawless. Therefore, making the sources of data and assumptions about those sources transparent to algorithm users, and continually reflecting on the appropriateness of that data, are critical practices for organizations seeking to avoid algorithmic inertia.</p><p> Organizations must keep data sources clearly organized and evaluate them periodically. Different data sources have different qualities and characteristics. Ensuring that these sources are distinguished from one another before they are fed into algorithmic models, processed, and constantly compared against one another enables data scientists to identify and eliminate algorithmic inertia sooner rather than later.</p><p> The assumptions underpinning the use of an algorithm should also be documented and articulated. Any attempt to model the environment involves quantification — transforming aspects of reality into numerical data. Such quantification inevitably involves making assumptions about how the environment works. However, while quantification is necessary for algorithmic models to work, details about how it is performed can get lost in the complex process of designing and using algorithmic models. Therefore, maintaining a living record of such assumptions may prevent the emergence of algorithmic inertia.</p><p> <strong>Periodically redesign algorithmic routines.</strong> Organizations should regularly redesign — and be willing to overhaul — their algorithmic model and reconsider how it fits into broader organizational routines. The initial design of an algorithmic model can take a lot of work, and it is natural for an organization to want to reap the benefits of that work. However, in a dynamic and quickly changing environment, it&#39;s important to be willing not just to make incremental changes to a model but to fundamentally overhaul it if necessary.</p><p> Of course, organizations face a trade-off when it comes to overhauling an algorithmic routine: It can be very expensive to completely re-architect an algorithmic model. However, the consequences of failing to do so can be disastrous.</p><p> For example, when Moody&#39;s had to rate an increasing number of subprime-dominated RMBSs, the organization chose to incrementally modify the M3 Prime model. However, it may have been more effective to specify the distinctions between the prime and the subprime markets and do a deeper overhaul of the original model. In addition to rethinking the algorithmic model itself, an organization can consider how it is deployed in practice: Hypothetically, Moody&#39;s could have applied the M3 Prime model differently to different types of RMBSs — perhaps simply requiring more human intervention for tranches composed of lower-quality loans.</p><p> Redesigning and overhauling an algorithmic model is contingent upon understanding what organizational processes interrelate with the model and analyzing the implications that changes in the environment have for it. If it becomes clear that either the model or the processes that it relies on or feeds into have been rendered obsolete or ineffective, an overhaul should be seriously considered.</p><p> <strong>Assume that the model will break.</strong> It can be dangerous for an organization to think of potential future scenarios only through the prism of what algorithmic models predict: All assumptions embedded in a model limit the potential futures that can be considered. To address algorithmic inertia associated with the simulation of an unknown future, it is important to assume that the model will break. Consider scenarios beyond the scope of the algorithmic model; this requires challenging predictive assumptions as well as presuming that the model is fundamentally flawed.</p><p> An active practice of considering scenarios that are <em>outside</em> the model can help motivate and inspire the prior two practices — exposing data and assumptions and periodically redesigning algorithmic routines — by forcing team members to actively consider the limitations of algorithmic models.</p><p></p><p> One particularly useful approach might be to make use of qualitative predictions of the future instead of quantitative predictions that rely on available data from the past. These forms of scenario planning offer opportunities to consider radically different visions of what the future may hold. This might also entail developing hybrid algorithms that do not precisely rely on past data to predict scenarios but also embed in them qualitative measures and expert rules introduced by domain experts.</p><p> <strong>Build bridges between data scientists and domain experts.</strong> Organizations must create processes for data scientists and domain experts to work closely together to design their algorithmic routines. <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a> Practically speaking, data scientists and AI specialists approach problems very differently than domain experts do. Domain experts focus on organizational routines and idiosyncratic situations, whereas data scientists focus on developing generalizable constructs based on mathematical principles. To overcome algorithmic inertia, data scientists and domain experts must work closely together to understand how characteristics of organizational routines and idiosyncratic situations map to the mathematical parameters used in an algorithmic model.</p><p> When the worlds of data scientists and domain experts are completely separate, there is also the danger that data scientists and domain experts will shift responsibility by superficially trusting each other&#39;s work. Such assumptions can actually prevent crucial dialogue between the two worlds. For instance, Moody&#39;s ended up subverting the results of its credit rating model because the credit rating analysts didn&#39;t attempt to understand why the model might be generating results that didn&#39;t fit with their intuitions. Building bridges between data scientists and domain experts enables domain experts to obtain an intuitive grasp of how the algorithmic model works. Such common ground could enable organizations to create and use models that better adapt to changes in the environment.</p><p> One structural bridge-building practice that organizations can use to facilitate communication between data scientists and domain experts is establishing a position such as a product manager. This should be held by one individual with both domain and data science experience who has direct responsibility for overseeing algorithmic routines. For example, some data experts have called for the creation of a new organizational structure that includes an “innovation marshal” role — someone who is respected by both data scientists and field experts. <a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a> Given their knowledge and expertise in both areas, these people can gain the respect of the organization by developing and maintaining “high-bandwidth, bidirectional communication channels” that help ensure that algorithmic routines are able to adapt to environmental changes. <a id="reflink14" class="reflink" href="#ref14">14</a></p><p></p><p> Another bridge-building practice is called <em>model explainability</em> : describing the algorithmic models in a practical and comprehensible manner. For data scientists, such explainability can facilitate access to the expert knowledge needed to counteract the sources of algorithmic inertia; for domain experts, such explainability can help them develop a deep and intuitive understanding of how the model takes environmental changes into account. Model explainability establishes common ground between two groups of professionals who have different types of expertise. Such practices enable organizations to build bridges instead of just talking about them.</p><p></p><p> Organizations seeking to reap the benefits of powerful predictive analytics are increasingly confronting the problem of algorithmic inertia. Despite leveraging dynamic algorithms to adapt to changes in the environment, organizations may find that the results are not keeping pace with new developments. By exposing data and assumptions, periodically redesigning algorithmic routines, assuming that their models will break, and building bridges, organizations can increase the likelihood that their substantial investments in algorithmic solutions will pay off with better decision-making.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/predictive-models-can-lose-the-plot-heres-how-to-keep-them-on-track/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> We Should Bring Moore&#39;s Law to Climate Action</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/we-should-bring-moores-law-to-climate-action/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/we-should-bring-moores-law-to-climate-action/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 12 Jun 2023 17:00:51 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew Winston. <p>Andrew Winston ( <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewwinston">@andrewwinston</a> ) is a globally recognized expert on how to build resilient, profitable companies that help people and the planet thrive.

He leaves behind one of the more successful companies in history and, of course, his famous <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/gordon-moore-obituary.html">Moore&#39;s law</a> . He predicted in 1965 that the density of transistors on a microchip would double every year and adjusted his forecast in 1975 to “just” doubling every two years. The latter projection has held true for nearly 50 years.</p><p> It&#39;s often said that the phones in our hands have more computing power than the 1969 Apollo moon mission. That&#39;s true, but it&#39;s also a vast understatement — our phones actually have <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a25655/nasa-computer-iphone-comparison/">more power than all of NASA at the time</a> , a fact that demonstrates the shocking reality of exponential change.</p><p></p><p> We humans tend to think in linear terms: If things grew a bit last year, they&#39;ll grow a bit more this year. It&#39;s hard for us to grasp what happened with semiconductors. In 1971, there were around 2,400 transistors per microprocessor. Fifty years later, a chip holds 58 billion transistors, and Intel intends to make it <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/opinion/moore-law-now-and-in-the-future.html">1 trillion by 2030</a> . If something doubles every two years, it grows roughly 30 times per decade, 1,000-fold in 20 years, and 1 million times in 40 years. In 60 years, you&#39;ll get something 1 billion times faster.</p><p> It&#39;s hard to overstate what this speed of change has wrought on the world. At the fun end of things, my teenage boys are utterly unimpressed that they can look up nearly any fact or stream any video or song nearly instantly. At the same time, misinformation can travel much faster. As for AI? It will get rapidly better at both the good and the bad. (Look up “deepfakes” if you want to be scared.)</p><p> Moore&#39;s law has also led to some of the most classic failures in business history. Kodak didn&#39;t get ready for digital photos. Blockbuster was blindsided as well, as downloading a movie went from impossible to a real-time capability in just a handful of years. Once streaming movies became a trivial act, the rent-a-video model was dead.</p><p> In all of this, I see two critical lessons. First, we can make remarkable progress if we enable early success, believe much more is possible, compete like crazy to do it, and <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-missing-discipline-behind-failure-to-scale/">invest what&#39;s necessary</a> . The core point here is that, to state the obvious, Moore&#39;s law is not a law. Nobody mandated the big chip companies to cut the width of a transistor down to nanoscale over decades. They did so because of competition, massive public and private spending to build markets for chips, and impressive levels of innovation in theories, manufacturing technologies, device design, and marketing. (Did we <em>need</em> iPads once they were feasible?) Moore&#39;s law proved to be a powerful and bold prediction of what an industry could accomplish, based on early experience and success.</p><p> Second, we can draw parallels to the critical business challenge of our times: how to thrive and grow while managing our social and environmental impacts (especially climate change). We can embrace rapid change to operate in a sustainable or net-positive way.</p><h3> We Can Embrace the Exponential Again</h3><p> Like in the 1960s and &#39;70s, once again we&#39;re barreling down a path we&#39;re not sure how to travel, driven by external goals — most importantly, how fast science tells us the world should decarbonize. “Science-based targets” are a quasi-Moore&#39;s law for fighting climate change. Keeping up with these aggressive targets is an important creator of business value, a path to excellence in innovation and performance, and a core way to stay relevant to customers, employees, and other stakeholders (and not get Blockbuster-ized).</p><p></p><p> So far, many clean technology sectors are doing a good impression of the semiconductor world. The cost of clean power and battery storage has been, if not halving every two years, still declining very quickly. According to the International Energy Agency, <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/evolution-of-solar-pv-module-cost-by-data-source-1970-2020">the cost per watt of new solar modules</a> dropped 96% between 2000 and 2020. Over 45 years, solar costs have plummeted 500-fold, halving roughly every five years. While not the pace of Moore&#39;s law, it&#39;s been plenty fast enough to shake up entire sectors and create vast new opportunities. The cleantech transition is a multitrillion-dollar shift in how we travel, build buildings, make things, and much more.</p><p> Like with semiconductors, this performance in the cleantech sector has come from a combination of innovation, investment, policy support, and the massive build-out of manufacturing capacity at scale (mainly in China). But perhaps most important in both cases is that the pace of change has required willpower and new mental models. When those of us in the sustainable business world started pushing the idea of science-based targets 10-plus years ago, the pushback was palpable. “How could we possibly move that fast?” many would ask. “ <em>Why</em> would we move that fast, given how much it costs?” But skepticism flips to enthusiasm when you cross cost and mental tipping points.</p><p></p><p> As powerful as Moore&#39;s law has been in driving deep technological and social change in society, again, it was a man-made goal. Companies were driven to move toward it by competition, innovation, and profit motivations. This time, with climate objectives, we&#39;re using global planetary thresholds to shape the goals on how fast we need to go — not just with carbon but with water use, the amount of toxics or plastics in the environment, the prevalence of human rights abuses in supply chains, and more.</p><p> These are not nice-to-haves if we want our world to thrive. The sustainability “laws” we&#39;re grappling with are decidedly <em>not</em> theoretical or invented — they&#39;re based on the laws of nature and physics. Smart companies will see these nonnegotiable realities as the incredible opportunity that they are and get moving.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/we-should-bring-moores-law-to-climate-action/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Manage Your Workforce Ecosystem, Not Just Your Employees</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/manage-your-workforce-ecosystem-not-just-your-employees/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/manage-your-workforce-ecosystem-not-just-your-employees/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 12 Jun 2023 11:00:03 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Elizabeth J.

The most common answer is also the most surprising.</p><p> A confident minority of executives say their workforce is just their employees. But the overwhelming majority, especially leaders on the front lines of organizational transformations, takes a broader view that goes beyond just employees. Increasingly, they characterize the workforce as all of the people and groups involved in achieving the company&#39;s business objectives. Organizations&#39; extended workforces have become so essential to their businesses, brands, and approaches to value creation that they need to think differently about, and act differently toward, their entire workforce.</p><p> That represents a shift in management perspective since we began our study of the future of the workforce a few years ago. We are seeing this change across industries and a variety of organizations, large and small — and it is challenging leaders to redefine who and what constitutes their workforce and to develop new management practices and organizational structures.</p><p></p><p> Hierarchical, command-and-control, internally focused management practices are ill suited for workforces that span internal and external organizational boundaries. Using siloed functions to independently manage employees and external contributors, for example, is fraught with challenges: Ill-defined decision rights, governance processes, and power dynamics can undermine even the most well-intentioned executives. In addition, the technology systems for managing employees are typically different and disconnected from those for accessing and tracking external contributors. This lack of integration creates inefficiencies that can thwart efforts to obtain and maintain strategically valuable capabilities.</p><p> We define <em>workforce ecosystem</em> as a structure that encompasses actors, from within the organization and beyond, working to create value for an organization. Within the ecosystem, actors work toward individual and collective goals with interdependencies and complementarities among the participants.</p><p> Workforce ecosystems include employees as well as external contributors and partners of various kinds — long- and short-term contractors, gig workers, application developers, service providers, and crowdsourced actors. An ecosystem perspective explicitly recognizes that accessing and engaging workforces is no longer the sole purview of the human resources function but requires cross-functional actions involving leaders in the C-suite, IT, procurement, finance, legal, and other areas.</p><p> Intentionally orchestrating a workforce ecosystem requires leaders to coordinate activities across their own organization and with external contributors. To meet this challenge, companies need to reassess coordination between functions such as human resources, procurement, and IT. Decisions also need to made about how to govern relationships with external contributors, such as application developers and subcontractors. We developed the concept of <em>integration architectures</em> to define both that internal coordination and how organizations interact with their extended workforce.</p><p></p><p> Our integration architecture model contrasts with the default, siloed approach to managing interactions in most workforce ecosystems. Typically, contingent workers are the responsibility of procurement. Partners and alliances are often handled by strategy, and AI and automation are part of the tech organization (but rarely regarded as part of the broader workforce ecosystem). HR typically oversees full- and part-time employees. In this common approach, multiple groups work independently to govern the contributors for which they have a mandate, but efforts across the organization are uncoordinated.</p><p> Managers in different departments frequently use combinations of external and internal workers without any centralized coordination. These decentralized approaches may be efficient on a local level, where each business unit and functional manager retains maximum control, but they are suboptimal at an aggregate level.</p><p> Indeed, decentralization can have substantial drawbacks when orchestrating a workforce ecosystem. Dispersed efforts may not be aligned with overall strategic priorities and may undermine a business&#39;s pursuit of new strategic directions. The lack of integration may limit available data about who (and what) is contributing to an organization. It may lead to cost inefficiencies as contingent workers are sourced on an ad hoc basis. And it likely means that both internal workers and external contributors (existing and potential) have less visibility into opportunities to contribute. While decentralization is currently the most common approach to managing employees and the extended workforce, it is almost always uncoordinated.</p><h3> Why Centralized Integration Architectures Appeal</h3><p> Given the shortcomings of decentralized architectures, many organizations orchestrating workforce ecosystems are creating integration architectures that are more centralized and cross-functional in their design. In some organizations, HR coordinates workforce ecosystem management with the procurement and IT functions; in these cases, business leaders and teams work with HR and others to proactively manage risks. Other companies are adopting a more cross-functional approach to managing all types of individual workers and providers; in these cases, HR plays a key but less central role, with talent marketplaces playing a more prominent role in supporting workforce needs across business units and functions.</p><p> Swiss global health care company Novartis, for example, has set up a cross-functional steering committee to manage its approximately 100,000 internal workers and roughly 50,000 external ones. Novartis is working to provide managers with visibility into internal and external talent sources, an effort driven by data culled from a variety of partners and platforms. The process will be facilitated by curators called workforce strategists, who will grant managers real-time access to teams of employees, contractors, and technologies.</p><p> The pandemic prompted HR at another global company we studied to get more involved with overseeing the broader workforce because of the concerns it raised about remote and onsite work policies, pay continuity, absences, and sick leave for both contingent workers and employees. Before the pandemic, HR paid close attention only to what was going on with full-time-equivalent or part-time employees, the company&#39;s vice president of HR reported; often, with contingent workers, “HR was not in the loop at all,” she said. At that time, there wasn&#39;t even a shared understanding of who comprises the company&#39;s contingent workforce. The pandemic lent urgency to the idea that the company would have to be more centrally integrated and agile to take care of its contingent workers. It also underscored that the company needed to better manage the reputational, legal, operational, and cost risks of the broader workforce, and to use the entire workforce to its fullest competitive advantage.</p><p> At this same company, hiring processes and procedures had historically differed by department — and departments tended not to communicate with one another. HR supported decisions about hiring permanent employees, while procurement brought in contingent workers. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to HR, managers were often converting contingent workers into full-time employees. A newly developed clearinghouse platform that involved HR, procurement, and finance gave the company data-based cross-functional visibility into tracking and approving external workers.</p><p> Management of the contingent workforce had been a hot potato at the company, according to the chief procurement officer: “Anybody who was at the center was on the hook for all the risk and none of the benefit.” But he described the company as having shifted to thinking of its relationship with contingent workers in strategic rather than transactional terms, which involves managing the contingent workforce cross-functionally. As the vice president of HR explained, “There was an acknowledgment between our CFO, our chief general counsel, our CHRO [chief human resources officer], and our chief operating officer that they all had skin in the game.”</p><p> Talent marketplaces are another great tool for anchoring a centralized and more cross-functionally integrated architecture. NASA, for example, used to have six talent-market platforms spread across multiple units, each of which independently matched employees with gigs and projects. Now the space agency uses a single talent marketplace — one orchestrating mechanism — to coordinate access to internal human talent across the organization. Extending its internal talent marketplace to external contributors is on NASA&#39;s horizon.</p><p></p><h3> Integration Architecture Challenges</h3><p> While centralized and cross-functional integration architectures are enabling organizations to achieve higher levels of coordination in their workforce ecosystems, these efforts are in their nascent stages. Even among companies on the leading edge of workforce ecosystem transformations, leaders emphasize that these efforts are just starting to gain traction. In our research and consulting work, we see that most organizations still take reactive, local, and uncoordinated approaches to enlisting and retaining external talent and complementary contributors. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1个</a></p><p>Leaders realize that such decentralized efforts are both cost- and resource-inefficient and risk demotivating internal employees. Yet they struggle to establish a centralized cross-functionally integrated architecture for workforce ecosystem orchestration. We have heard the following concerns:</p><ul><li> How do you identify the right set of stakeholders to create a centrally integrated architecture for workforce ecosystem orchestration?</li><li> How do you get stakeholders to engage in local workforce ecosystem experiments to tailor shared goals to specific contexts?</li><li> How do you promote coordinated learning from local experimentation?</li><li> How do you improve your workforce ecosystem implementation process over time?</li></ul><p> To create an integrated workforce ecosystem, at least three types of issues need to be addressed: structural design (pertaining to the division of labor, goals, and incentives), politics (relating to resources, power, and status), and culture (affecting individuals&#39; search for identity and meaning). We recommend taking a phased approach to these issues, which intertwine, overlap, and can reinforce one another. This process is likely to be most appropriate for large, established organizations that are starting to embrace workforce ecosystems, but key elements should be helpful for those in small and medium-size enterprises. (See “Four Phases of Orchestrating an Integrated Workforce Ecosystem.”)</p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Four Phases of Orchestrating an Integrated Workforce Ecosystem</h4><p class="caption"> The graphic below describes the key challenges associated with orchestrating workforce ecosystems and the phases associated with addressing them. <a id="reflinki" class="reflink" href="#refi">i</a> </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MAG_Altman_Figure.png" alt="Four Phases of Orchestrating an Integrated Workforce Ecosystem" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p> In the first phase, we propose creating an orchestration team to develop a working plan, goals, and metrics in consultation with relevant local and central stakeholders, both internal and external. This team should focus on integration considerations within the organization (functional roles and responsibilities) and on relationships with external participants. By working with groups within the organization that already engage external workers, the team can get a head start with managers experienced in orchestrating parts of workforce ecosystems. From a structural design perspective, they can quickly begin to highlight and address previously identified skills gaps.</p><p> To deal with political concerns, the team can choose local well-respected and action-oriented champions to lead transformations. Additionally, the team can include representatives from external contributors to bring their perspectives to the efforts. Team members should be able to speak for functional areas, product groups, and business units as appropriate; the key is to obtain participation from across stakeholder groups. Finally, to grapple with cultural challenges, at least one team member should play the role of a boundary spanner, serving as a go-between among the central team, local teams, and other affected groups.</p><p> In the second phase, we suggest promoting local experimentation. Central orchestration teams can introduce pilot programs to explore potential configurations of workforce ecosystem relationships. These experiments can address structural issues, such as staffing projects with a mix of internal and external workers, identifying necessary skills, ensuring competencies, and measuring the quality of outcomes. They can address political challenges, such as internal employees resisting contributions from external workers and local leaders feeling tension as they lose some control over team composition. Finally, cultural questions may arise as employees adapt to shifts in responsibilities, especially if they need to take on more of a facilitation role coordinating participants from various sources.</p><p> In the third phase, we emphasize coordinated learning and resourcing, which spans challenges (and successes) identified by local teams and overseen by the central team. Structural impediments, such as existing policies and procedures (intellectual property licensing models or training rules, for example) may serve the organization well in a traditional employee life-cycle model but require revision for a workforce ecosystem. Resourcing issues may arise as local managers hire more external workers or partner more easily with subcontractors but then refuse to release employees to accept other opportunities. Even when the C-suite and lower levels embrace changes, midtier managers might be resistant because they are often tasked with managing the day-to-day challenges of these sometimes highly disruptive transformations.</p><p> In the fourth and final phase, we consider workforce ecosystem expansion. Once initial pilots are analyzed and new practices are starting to be institutionalized, leaders should consider what other new systems, tools, goals, metrics, and processes have proved successful enough to adopt. These should be regularly reviewed as the organization continues to gain knowledge and experience. Leaders may want to expand the central orchestration team to include representation from other internal groups. And they may want to consider connecting their workforce ecosystems with others — for example, working more closely with client organizations and their ecosystems. Culturally, leaders may consider more actively promoting distributed learning and workforce ecosystem activities through storytelling and other communication tools. They will likely want to highlight growth opportunities while also beginning to address the myriad concerns that inevitably accompany such transformations.</p><p> This four-phase approach offers a practical way to engage, connect, and activate key stakeholders. From there, organizations can begin to shape their own strategies and pathways by experimenting with new types of integration architectures and quickly iterating as they learn what does and doesn&#39;t work across different contexts.</p><p> Echoing the way that integration architectures define how internal functions and business units work together to orchestrate workforce ecosystems, leaders need to define how to govern relationships with external contributors. Leaders face several decisions about which integration architectures are appropriate for external contributors.</p><p> The choice of third-party integration architectures may determine the degree to which partners are willing to expend resources to participate in (or contribute to) the workforce ecosystem. Decisions around how to coordinate with developer ecosystems, for instance, can be critical to effective workforce ecosystems. Google Play is Google&#39;s distribution marketplace for apps and content. In comparison to Apple&#39;s App Store, through which Apple distributes apps and content, Google has a lighter touch, with less-strict requirements and compliance testing. Apple&#39;s policies are known to be much more stringent. Integration architectures with external developers may have more or less rigidity and be more or less welcoming.</p><p> Crafting integration architectures with third parties raises questions about who should own these relationships within the enterprise. For example, video game console manufacturers often enable third-party developers (complementors) to create games that work on their systems; frequently, it is the demand for these third-party games that drives sales of particular consoles. Should developer relations be the responsibility of a business development or strategy group (that may also handle strategic alliances) or a separate group with specific responsibilities for developer ecosystems? An integration architecture helps define responsibilities and adjudicate potential conflicts among internal groups with competing interests.</p><p></p><p> Implementing integration architectures in your organization begins with an assessment of how your workforce ecosystem currently functions. How much visibility and control does your organization&#39;s HR function currently have over internal and external contributors? If these contributors are currently managed in a decentralized manner, evaluate whether your organization is best served by this architecture.</p><p></p><p> If you recognize that a more centrally integrated and orchestrated workforce ecosystem would be a better approach for your organization, decide which groups and individuals should be part of the orchestration team. Should someone (or some group) be centrally responsible for overseeing the entire workforce ecosystem?</p><p> Throughout our research, we have heard leaders describe their struggles to engage talent essential to their company&#39;s success within an increasingly complex and connected workforce ecosystem. We have observed time and again that intentionally orchestrating a workforce ecosystem perspective can help leaders take a much richer and more nuanced view of their own organization and the people, partners, and technologies upon which they rely to meet their strategic goals and objectives.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/manage-your-workforce-ecosystem-not-just-your-employees/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Opening Access to the Fast Track for Career Equity</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/opening-access-to-the-fast-track-for-career-equity/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/opening-access-to-the-fast-track-for-career-equity/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 08 Jun 2023 11:00:49 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Haig R.

Collectively, these companies employed over 700,000 people. About 40% of the employees were based in the United States.</li></ul></aside><p> Business leaders tend to focus their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts on addressing bias and discrimination because these practices are pervasive and discrimination is illegal. But in the process, they overlook situational factors that play a leading role — and are easier to address — in determining whether women and people of color get promoted and are among the higher paid.</p><p> Career and pay equity are inextricably linked. Women and people of color continue to be underrepresented among managers and executives, and often among senior professionals as well. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> While pay equity is improving for these demographic groups, the raw pay gaps (average and median differences between women and men, and between people of color and White employees) remain high in many companies. These pay gaps will persist until women and people of color occupy the career levels and roles that command the highest pay at a rate that reasonably reflects their representation in the workforce.</p><p></p><p> Inequity not only hurts individual employees; it also deprives businesses of the talent that is overlooked. If leaders understand how situational factors affect their employees&#39; prospects for advancement, they can apply <em>proactive career management (PCM)</em> — identifying and removing barriers to employee success — to make their workplaces more equitable and more productive.</p><p> To better understand the factors underlying these differences in career outcomes, I examined the results of analyses of multiple years of promotion, retention, performance, and pay data in 20 large and midsize companies that collectively employed more than 700,000 people. The findings confirmed that significant gender and racial differences in promotion probability for women and people of color are attributable to four factors that are consistently consequential to employees&#39; success: performance ratings, role assignments, reporting relationships, and flexible working arrangements.</p><p> With the exception of performance ratings, these factors are related to an employee&#39;s circumstances, not their knowledge, skills, or behavior. For instance, if career progress requires experience in certain roles but women are proportionally underrepresented in those roles relative to men, the net result is that fewer women will advance.</p><p> Certainly, bias and discrimination are also in play: In most of the organizations, we found large, unexplained gender and racial disparities in the likelihood of promotion that cannot be accounted for by any business-relevant factors. And we found universal and sizable racial disparities in performance evaluations, with people of color, particularly Black employees, less likely to receive high ratings. These are a logical focus for corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts because they are evidence of bias or discrimination.</p><p> But because the explained differences often have the greatest influence on career advancement and pay equity, it&#39;s important to address them directly. The good news is that these factors are often the easiest to address successfully. Proactive career management is a data-driven approach that offers a solution that works.</p><h3> Four Factors Drive Who Advances at Work</h3><p> Let&#39;s look more closely at the four factors I identified that explain who receives promotions, high performance ratings, and larger pay increases at work and why women and people of color tend not to see those benefits.</p><p> <strong>Performance ratings.</strong> Because performance ratings affect all other outcomes, such as promotion, retention, and pay, disparities in this area have a cascading effect. In 89% of the companies studied, Black employees were less likely to receive high performance ratings. The differences can be sizable, with the majority at 25% or higher. Moreover, because performance ratings tend to persist from year to year — a high rating one year predicts the likelihood of a high rating the next — the tendency for people of color to get lower ratings becomes a virtual blockade to their progress. Interestingly, women are generally more likely to be highly rated than otherwise comparable men, but that doesn&#39;t translate into a higher probability of promotion for them.</p><p> <strong>Access to accelerator roles.</strong> In every company, certain roles are career accelerators and others are dead ends, regardless of who occupies them. In this study, having a supervisor role at any level almost universally improved the chance that an employee would be promoted and receive high ratings. However, we almost always found that women and people of color were far less likely to be in such roles than men or White employees, respectively.</p><p> The differences are often stark and steep. For example, in a global financial services company we studied, US-based employees who were supervisors were 50% more likely to be promoted and 55% more likely to receive high performance ratings than those who were not supervisors. Outside the US, supervisors were 89% more likely to be promoted and 37% more likely to get high ratings. These effects were even larger for female supervisors than for male supervisors. But across the company, women were half as likely to be supervisors. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2个</a></p><p>Further, because women are more likely than men to face career disruption during their child-rearing years, they may take on supervisor roles later. In such cases, they don&#39;t experience the same compounding benefit of being in such roles as their male colleagues.</p><p> <strong>Reporting relationships.</strong> Whom one reports to can have a decisive impact on the trajectory of one&#39;s career. We generally found that people who reported to supervisors with high performance ratings were significantly more likely to receive a high rating as well. The probability that they would be promoted also increased.</p><p> We saw similar effects for employees whose managers were higher up in the corporate hierarchy than the norm for someone at their level and thus had more clout. To the extent that women and people of color are less likely to report to high-performing and higher-level supervisors, they are less likely to receive high ratings or promotions themselves.</p><p> They may also be less likely to benefit from these relationships when they do have them. At a global insurance company, those who reported to a top-rated supervisor were about 50% more likely to be promoted and 30% more likely to receive high performance ratings. Those whose supervisors were at a level higher than the norm were 9% more likely to be promoted and 14% more likely to be highly rated. However, having a high-performing or higher-ranked supervisor did not help women and people of color as much as it helped White men.</p><p> <strong>Flexible working.</strong> Increasingly, organizations view flexible work arrangements as essential to attracting and retaining talent, particularly women and younger employees. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, more companies and employees have embraced such arrangements, but historically, they have been career killers. For example, those who work part time or remotely or take family leave are less likely to be promoted, are paid less, and are more likely to leave their companies.</p><p> At a business I&#39;ll refer to as ConsumerCo, opting for flexible work arrangements hurt both women and people of color. The percentage of women working part time was three times that of men; for people of color, it was two times that of White employees. Overall, working part time reduced promotion probability by 50% and the likelihood of receiving a high rating by 70%. It also increased turnover probability by 25% compared with similarly situated full-time workers.</p><p> Likewise, leaves of absence were disproportionately taken by women and people of color. Those on leave were about 50% less likely to be promoted or receive high ratings and much more likely to turn over — at least 150% more likely in the US and at least 80% more likely globally. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3个</a></p><p>Unless companies do something to mitigate the negative consequences of flexible working on employees, the phenomenon of higher levels of flexible work arrangements risks further undermining career progress for women and people of color.</p><h3> The Case for Proactive Career Management</h3><p> With the exception of performance ratings, these drivers of career progress, or lack thereof, are situational. This is telling. It indicates that whether employees advance is not just a reflection of the talents and skills they bring or what they do, but also of how well their employers position them to succeed. All too often, women and people of color simply aren&#39;t positioned to succeed in the same way their White male counterparts are.</p><p> This is not to say that bias and discrimination are not factors, as mentioned above. However, employers can make measurable progress on DEI when they understand the extent of the positioning issues in their workforce and deal with them in a purposeful, systematic way. This is where PCM comes into play.</p><p></p><p> The idea behind proactive career management for DEI is simple: Identify and rank the factors that most influence career success and retention; if and where they skew significantly against certain demographic groups, intervene to eliminate or reduce the disparities. In other words, work to ensure that demographic characteristics bear no relationship to how well or poorly positioned an employee is to stay and succeed at work.</p><p> Every organization has talent flows that shape their workforce. Employers hire, train, and develop employees. And they value employees by giving them promotions, high ratings, raises, and other forms of compensation for the knowledge, capabilities, behavior, and experience they bring, the effort they deliver, and, ultimately, how they perform. Meanwhile, employees&#39; decisions to stay or leave are influenced by whether their careers are progressing.</p><p> These talent flows and rewards define the internal labor market of an organization and produce the supply of people with the attributes needed to meet the demands of the business. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> But as we have seen, different demographic groups within an organization do not have the same opportunities to acquire these attributes or be rewarded for them.</p><p> By not distributing opportunities equitably, companies effectively restrict their talent supplies. Women and people of color become more likely to leave or, if they stay, become less engaged because their careers are stalled. Knowing how the internal labor market functions for different demographic groups within an organization is thus crucial for a company to execute its DEI strategy.</p><p> To implement PCM, organizations should start by creating a success profile that identifies and ranks the factors that drive who advances. From there, they can examine how each factor influences the probability that employees from different demographic groups get promoted and whether the organization is valuing their capabilities and efforts equitably.</p><p></p><p> Small organizations might rely on the four factors described in the previous section. For them, controlled, statistical analyses of their own internal labor market data are likely infeasible. Such organizations might complement the research with qualitative input about the keys to career progress from their leaders and employees who have successfully risen in the ranks there.</p><p> Large employers with complex organizations will be best served by developing an objective success profile based on empirical evidence that identifies and ranks the critical individual and situational factors that drive success in the organization. The natural place to start is with the factors that drive promotions. But organizations might examine other markers of success as well, like pay, ratings, and retention, to see how well the results align with those from the analysis of promotions.</p><p> After creating the profile, the next step is to examine how the profile plays out for different demographic groups. There are two questions to answer.</p><p> First, are the factors that most influence employee success distributed similarly across demographic groups, or do they tend to be concentrated more in some groups than in others? These are <em>quantity effects</em> , and they reflect the relative frequency of the factors across groups. For instance, are women and people of color as likely as men and White employees to have the prized characteristics or to work in circumstances associated with success?</p><p> Second, when people possess the prized characteristics or work in favored circumstances, do they benefit equally from those attributes, or do some demographic groups benefit more? These are <em>price effects</em> . They reflect whether the employer values the attribute, behavior, or situation in question differently for one group than for another.</p><p> Objectively answering these questions is the foundation of PCM, as illustrated in the case of ConsumerCo.</p><p></p><h3> Positioning Employees for Success at ConsumerCo</h3><p> ConsumerCo&#39;s leaders were committed to improving career and pay equity in both their salaried and front-line workforces.</p><p> The company recognized that having a diverse workforce was not a luxury or a concession to social good; it was essential to its success. With an increasingly diverse customer base and growth occurring mostly in markets outside the US and Europe, having a leadership team and a workforce well attuned to the preferences and norms of local cultures was important to achieving growth targets.</p><p> HR and DEI leaders modeled their workforce data to uncover and assess the success profile for their salaried workforce. They identified 12 factors that were most likely to predict whether someone would be promoted. Situational factors dominated this success profile — a finding that stunned company leaders, who viewed the culture as a meritocracy. Of the top 12, only performance ratings and tenure were specific to the talents or accomplishments of an individual employee. The rest were purely circumstantial.</p><p> Being an expat (working outside one&#39;s home country) was the most positively influential factor. Reporting to a supervisor at a higher level than is typical had the least impact among the top 12 factors, but the effect was statistically significant.</p><p> Other factors included three of the four described earlier: having a high performance rating, being in a supervisory role, and reporting to a highly rated supervisor. In addition, working in certain functions or business lines mattered a lot to how one&#39;s career progressed.</p><p> Similar modeling showed that even the probability of receiving a high rating was inordinately influenced by situational factors. This finding suggested that performance ratings were not accurate measures of individuals&#39; contributions.</p><p> When ConsumerCo&#39;s leaders mapped the success profile to women in the company, they found that when women were positioned in situations conducive to their future progress, they usually fared as well as men. But overall, they were less likely to be so positioned. (See “Mapping Women&#39;s Experiences to a Success Profile.”) For instance, women who were expats were more likely to be promoted from those roles than otherwise comparable men, but women were less represented among the expat population.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Mapping Women&#39;s Experiences to a Success Profile</h4><p class="caption"> A global consumer products retailer identified the 12 attributes that most strongly influenced whether an employee would be promoted. It found that in most cases, when women possessed any of these attributes, they were as likely to be helped by it as men were. However, women were less likely than men to possess 9 of the 12 attributes.

When they did have those roles, it did not help their careers to the same extent as comparable men, for reasons that were not clear. ConsumerCo leaders could see that female employees faced a double whammy of sorts: Not only were they blocked from this accelerator role, but they also didn&#39;t get the same lift to their promotion prospects as their male colleagues when they did have that role.</p><p> When the company looked at people of color, it found that they tended to be both less well positioned and less valued than White employees. ConsumerCo needed to change its internal labor market dynamics to achieve career and pay equity for women and people of color.</p><h3> A Checklist for Change</h3><p> Focusing on situational factors has a distinct advantage: They&#39;re easier to address than individual characteristics. For instance, although tenure is an important driver of success, it is a fact of people&#39;s employment history, not something that ConsumerCo could change overnight.</p><p> Still, ConsumerCo identified several areas where it could act reasonably quickly, such as changing reporting relationships for women and people of color, finding opportunities for them to gain more supervisory experience earlier in their careers, and addressing the disparities in performance ratings for people of color.</p><p> The company had found that taking a leave of absence thwarted career advancement, especially for women, and so it is also developing new leave and career development policies to address imbalances for that group.</p><p> Here&#39;s where the “proactive” part of PCM comes in.</p><p> The analysis of ConsumerCo&#39;s success profile made it possible to create a simple checklist of green lights (career advancers) and red flags (success blockers) that managers could use to evaluate the positioning of individual employees. By considering whether women and people of color on their teams were experiencing more green lights or red flags, line managers and supervisors could identify who was well positioned to stay and thrive, as well as who might be at risk of stalling in their career or leaving the organization.

They can then take any steps needed to increase access to success drivers and mitigate unintended consequences.

For each factor, they could effectively evaluate the situational reality of different groups and tailor their interventions to address the most significant gaps.</p><p> For instance, they found that female, Black, and Hispanic employees were less likely to be reporting to highly rated supervisors, while Asian employees were more likely to have this advantage. And although women were less likely to be reporting to a manager one grade higher than usual, there were no such disparities for people of color. Also, while every non-White racial group was significantly underrepresented in one of the core functions that most contributed to advancement, women were more likely to work in that function than men.</p><p> ConsumerCo is in the early stages of rolling out interventions to address its disparities. But other companies I have worked with have pursued a variety of solutions.</p><p> Closing gaps due to flexible work arrangements often requires changing the culture. In many companies, part-time work is looked upon as evidence of lower commitment, and it can be difficult to shake these perceptions. However, companies can make quick progress on pay if they stop factoring leaves of absence into the statistical models that they use to assess pay equity and adjust wages and salaries to close gaps.</p><p> Situation-based racial disparities in performance ratings have been reduced in some companies through the calibration process used to align ratings by different supervisors. Some have also eliminated forced rankings that provide for a very limited percentage of employees to receive top ratings. These tend to favor people with more tenure, whom supervisors have known longer, and presumably better — and who are more likely to be White.</p><p> Some clients have addressed the importance of supervisor roles by expanding training, both to reinforce the importance of these roles and to help supervisors understand the impact they have on employees&#39; prospects. Leaders can offer training to help women and people of color gain the experience they need to advance — and close the gap between women and men in these positions.</p><h3> Proactive Career Management Has Benefits and Risks</h3><p> Because a success profile is built from an organization&#39;s data, it is more likely to reflect reality than the assumptions that leaders make about how employees succeed. Leaders may be prone to thinking that what got them to the top could get anyone else there as well, and they may oversimplify their own path. Further, people tend to generalize based on their own experiences, even if they don&#39;t represent the organizational norm.</p><p> A good empirical model can counter the tendency of people to engage in wishful thinking or to cling to belief. It can also account for the effects of being in different business lines, functions, geographies, and job families. This is something that&#39;s hard to do based on personal observation and experience alone.</p><p></p><p> Another value of PCM is that it is grounded in what creates value for the business. If, for instance, a role becomes critical to growth, one would expect the employer to accord more value to that role and the employees who successfully deliver value in it. And to the extent that an organization&#39;s DEI strategy helps ensure that high-potential women and people of color are able to access these newly valuable roles and perform them ably, it will serve the greater business need.</p><p> If there is a downside to PCM, it relates to the sharing of sensitive data and intelligence. PCM proceeds from objective modeling of the drivers of success and how they affect different groups. Invariably, the models will surface potentially damaging information about the existence of systemic gender or racial disparities in outcomes and opportunities, which creates legal risk.</p><p> PCM works best when managers understand the realities uncovered by the models and the reasons why specific actions are warranted. Thus, it requires a reasonable level of transparency. Corporate legal departments may, however, object to exposing what they may believe to be strong evidence of bias and inequity.</p><p> There&#39;s a delicate balance to be achieved. Most organizations I work with accomplish it by sharing high-level information with business and line leaders, and sometimes employee groups, about the reasons for particular actions while restricting the more granular data to a smaller group of top executives and HR and DEI leaders. Legal counsel almost always presides over such decisions; however, such advisers have become more understanding of the need for data-driven DEI strategies, appreciating that people can&#39;t solve problems they don&#39;t know about or understand.</p><p></p><p></p><p> The unexplained disparities in career opportunity and advancement at many organizations are important to address because they signal the potential influence of bias and discrimination. But doing so should not override attention to differences that can be explained by legitimate, business-relevant factors. The surest, most sustainable way to create career equity and equitable representation across all levels of an organization is to address the organization&#39;s career development practices (or lack thereof) that systemically impede the progress of women and people of color.</p><p> Of course, the work that employees do, their knowledge and skills, and how hard and effectively they work influence whether they will succeed. But success is also determined by how individuals are positioned to succeed — and organizations can do better at ensuring that all high-potential talent can gain experiences that will set them up for growth.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/opening-access-to-the-fast-track-for-career-equity/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Empower Your Team, Empower Yourself</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/empower-your-team-empower-yourself/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/empower-your-team-empower-yourself/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 07 Jun 2023 11:00:24 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Russell Clayton, Andrew Artis, and Dejun Tony Kong. <p>Russell Clayton is an assistant professor of instruction, teaching MBA courses in the Muma College of Business at the University of South Florida.

With budgets tightening and workforce disruptions such as layoffs affecting many sectors, now is not the time for organizations to eliminate employee professional development and training. Likewise, individuals should continue to upskill regardless of whether organizational resources are plentiful. In this article, we explore ways that executives may approach learning and development (L&amp;D) spending, as well as strategies for employees to secure professional development funding.</p><h3> For Managers: How L&amp;D Can Keep Teams Competitive</h3><p> In this first section, we&#39;ll explore three key strategies for managers to effectively allocate resources for L&amp;D, even during difficult economic times. When they better understand the importance of such programs, leaders can make more informed decisions that benefit the organization in the long term.</p><p></p><h4> 1. Assess the risk of cutting L&amp;D budgets.</h4><p> When budgets are tight, L&amp;D is often among the first programs to suffer cutbacks. This frequently happens because training is perceived as the low-hanging fruit when it comes to justifying budget cuts. However, these types of short-term cost-saving measures may not be a wise strategic move for executives. Having well-trained employees is critical to staying competitive, and we encourage executives to assess the risks their organization will be taking should they decide to eliminate employee training dollars.</p><p> For example, organizations that cut L&amp;D spending may fall behind when the economy recovers compared with those that maintain their investments. As a result, workers could lack the critical skills needed for organizational success. Furthermore, investing in L&amp;D helps companies do more with less. The number of skills needed for a single job has increased 10% annually since 2017, according to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-02-03-gartner-hr-research-finds-fifty-eight-percent-of-the-workforce-will-need-new-skill-sets-to-do-their-jobs-successfully">research conducted by Gartner</a> . Those organizations that continue to prioritize upskilling will have employees who are up to date on the skills needed to accomplish their work, whereas organizations that significantly cut L&amp;D likely will not.</p><p> <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-survey/2020/reports/pwc-23rd-global-ceo-survey.pdf">PwC&#39;s annual CEO survey</a> found that companies with advanced L&amp;D programs in place had higher employee engagement and were better at attracting and retaining top talent. Executives must keep this in mind, even in the face of economic downturns, because slashing L&amp;D budgets can increase the risk of losing talented employees. As Josh Felperin, global sales director of Alps Controls, put it, “Investing in employees&#39; personal and professional development on a consistent basis should be any leadership team&#39;s No. 1 priority, not just financial results.”</p><h4> 2. Shift to framing L&amp;D as an investment.</h4><p> Managers need to consider L&amp;D as an investment rather than a cost. Think about how L&amp;D can generate revenue instead of being just another budget line item. For example, upskilling and promoting from within can save organizations money on recruitment and hiring. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, the average hard cost of recruiting a new employee is $4,700, with total costs — including soft costs such as time — amounting to two to three times the position&#39;s salary. Now imagine what your L&amp;D managers could do with just half of that dollar figure in terms of upskilling a current employee instead of hiring a new candidate. Not only are you saving on recruiting costs — you are also helping your organization close the skills gap that is plaguing many industries.</p><p></p><p> Finally, executives should view their <em>own</em> L&amp;D activities as an investment. In a tight economic environment, it might be tempting to cut both L&amp;D funds and the time dedicated to training. However, research has found a significant relationship between <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ijtd.12082">executive L&amp;D activities and organizational performance</a> .</p><h4> 3. Strategically prioritize the skills to be developed.</h4><p> When facing economic headwinds, budget reductions across all departments might be unavoidable, and we&#39;re not arguing that L&amp;D budgets should remain completely untouched. However, we do advocate for allocating funds to strategic training priorities. The reality is that some L&amp;D training may be postponed until the economy flourishes again. It might be necessary to prioritize hard skills, like project management or cybersecurity, over soft skills, like time management, in the short term. While we strongly support <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/12/20/the-surprising-thing-google-learned-about-its-employees-and-what-it-means-for-todays-students/">soft skills training</a> — they play a key role in every business — we understand that L&amp;D funds may need to be spent on immediate hard-skills training needs in order to keep your organization competitive.</p><p> Match your L&amp;D expenditures to your organization&#39;s KPIs. Amazon is a great example of a company that does this. Despite recent major layoffs, it continues to train employees in key areas through its Upskilling 2025 initiative, including hard skills like cloud computing services and machine learning. Regardless of which skills you value most, the imperative is to be sure you&#39;re providing training opportunities. “Organizations that are not investing in the development of their employees are working against themselves and tripping over their own feet,” Jon Sexton, senior vice president of culture and leadership development at Vibrant Credit Union, asserted.</p><p></p><h3> For Employees: Strategies for Securing Professional Development Opportunities</h3><p> Pursuing professional development opportunities in the workplace can be challenging, particularly when budgets are constrained. Instead of passively waiting for workshop and training opportunities to arise, employees need to be proactive in convincing managers of the mutual benefits of L&amp;D investments.</p><p> That said, asking for money when budgets are tight is never an easy conversation, particularly when L&amp;D is perceived as merely nice to have. We recommend the following approaches to prepare your case, shape a productive conversation, and secure funding for your professional development.</p><h4> 1. Align your goals with your organization&#39;s needs.</h4><p> To increase your chances of obtaining approval for professional development opportunities, frame your request by demonstrating how the training will support your team&#39;s objectives. If you can explain how it will move your team forward, you&#39;re more likely to gain your manager&#39;s support (and funding).</p><p></p><p> Take the case of Nick. His employer already had an in-house training team delivering Continuing Professional Education hours for accountants, so he didn&#39;t think it would sign off on an external CPE course that focused on reviewing skills. To justify the expense and need — given his position as a junior accountant at the time — Nick discussed how the course would benefit the firm <em>first</em> and himself <em>second</em> with the managing partner. Nick emphasized that the course would help the company maintain its commitment to providing accurate, reliable information to clients through specific training on how to avoid making common tax accounting errors. By making the compelling argument that the external training would provide critical skills to help the company achieve its mission, Nick was able to convince his manager that the training would be valuable and received the funding.</p><p> Similarly, when Amanda, an insurance professional, asked her manager to pay for her training to earn her claims adjuster license, she took what she described as a “help me, help my team” approach. Amanda made her pitch for professional development during a time when the team she was on was struggling. While her current job function was <em>not</em> that of a claims adjuster, earning the license allowed her to help her organization in an area that really needed assistance.</p><p> During your pitch, ask your manager how they would like you to share the knowledge gained from training. This might involve a one-on-one follow-up, sharing presentation materials or bullet points summarizing the training, or even hosting a workshop to review the material with your team. By being proactive in sharing what you&#39;ve learned, you further solidify the benefits of professional development for the entire team.</p><h4> 2. Bring your manager on board.</h4><p> As <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/learning-for-a-living/">Gianpiero Petriglieri has noted</a> , many organizations “are not as hospitable to learning as their rhetoric suggests.” While employees may be frustrated by managers who overlook learning or prioritize performance over all else, they can educate managers on the benefits that professional development can bring to the company by taking a tactful approach.</p><p> For example, one vice president at a large industrial services company was reluctant to see training as an investment, fearing that employees might demand a raise or even leave after the training. In truth, this belief is a myth, if not irrational. Employees are a greater flight risk when they do <em>not</em> see internal opportunities and have to look elsewhere for personal growth. After all, employees are humans who have the fundamental need to feel competent, and they appreciate arrangements that are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2015.08.002">customized to their skills and interests</a> . Employees can share third-party sources that emphasize the importance of targeted training to employee retention and engagement. For example, <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236438/millennials-jobs-development-opportunities.aspx">research from Gallup</a> suggests that professional development is a top factor in retaining millennials.</p><p> When discussing the topic with your manager, it&#39;s important to embrace a positive tone and remember that there might be resistance along the way. Shape the conversation in a way that focuses on how professional development increases the retention of valued employees. Be prepared to hear “no,” but probe to find out what might make your manager say “yes.” By understanding their concerns, you&#39;re better equipped to overcome those barriers. Consider asking questions like, “What would help you say yes?” or, “Would you worry about our competitor sending employees to this training?” This encourages your manager to consider the potential upsides of your request.</p><p> Three communication touch points are helpful for closing the circle when it comes to getting your manager invested in L&amp;D as a team resource. First, communicate clearly about the training you&#39;re seeking and gain permission to attend the training. Second, update your manager <em>during</em> the training, expressing your enthusiasm and gratitude. For example, you can send your manager a short status update on how the training is going and initial ideas you have to bring back to the team. Lastly, once the training is complete, acknowledge your manager&#39;s support when sharing your newfound knowledge with the team. By showing your excitement, you can inspire coworkers who also desire professional development.</p><h4> 3. Show your commitment to learning.</h4><p> When pitching your professional development request, consider providing several options, ranging from fully funded by the company to partially funded by you. Demonstrating your commitment to learning new skills, even if it means investing your own money, can make your request more persuasive.</p><p> Divya, for example, found a $2,500 training opportunity to develop the soft skills needed to better serve customers at her government agency job. Knowing that funding was limited, she proposed several options to her manager, including 100%, 50%, and 25% company funding. By having some skin in the game, Divya showed that she was serious about the training. In the end, her request was fully funded by the agency, but she was prepared to accept partial funding and cover the rest herself.</p><p> You can also show your commitment by exploring lower-cost or free opportunities before pursuing other options. An effective way to do this is to detail what you have learned so far through training options at no cost to your employer — and what skills or knowledge gaps still exist. Perhaps you want to earn a certification in data visualization. You can begin by completing online courses for free or at minimal cost, which can provide the foundational knowledge needed in this area and demonstrate your time investment. Then, explain to your manager what you&#39;ve learned and why additional, funded training is necessary to further your goals.</p><p></p><p> This collaborative negotiation process allows you to (1) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1571-9979.1999.tb00178.x">adopt an interest-based approach</a> , (2) help your manager <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60407-4">overcome psychological barriers</a> , and (3) <a href="https://doi.org/10.5465/amj.2012.0461">build trust</a> and mitigate your manager&#39;s perception of risk.</p><p></p><p> Prioritizing learning and development is essential for both managers and employees to help steer their organizations toward sustainable success and maintain a competitive edge. Even during economic uncertainty, strategic L&amp;D investments can boost employee engagement, close skill gaps, and foster growth. By recognizing the value of professional development and adopting a collaborative approach, leaders and employees alike can create a thriving learning culture that promotes individual and organizational success.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/empower-your-team-empower-yourself/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Do You Have a Corporate Philanthropy Strategy?</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/do-you-have-a-corporate-philanthropy-strategy/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/do-you-have-a-corporate-philanthropy-strategy/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 06 Jun 2023 17:00:01 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Ane Casajús-Burutaran, Tina C.

While management scholars have long pointed out the importance of corporate philanthropy, businesses&#39; approaches to it vary widely, and few have fully integrated it into their corporate strategy. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> This article examines the shifting landscape of corporate giving and the potential implications for businesses and their stakeholders.</p><p> As companies face growing pressures to incorporate purposeful social missions into their core businesses, leaders have gained experience managing initiatives aimed at social impact in addition to profit. While corporate social responsibility (CSR) is part of most companies&#39; business strategies, philanthropy often remains disconnected from core business objectives. This makes it challenging for leaders to discern what types of philanthropic engagement should be prioritized and why.</p><p></p><p> We define <em>strategic corporate philanthropy</em> as voluntary giving that builds on the company&#39;s core competencies to achieve social impact while improving its competitive edge — resulting in a win-win situation. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> The scope of corporate philanthropic engagement is vast. (See “Main Types of Corporate Philanthropy Engagement.”) Even though gift matching has led the way for many years in the US, Coca-Cola, Google, and Walt Disney are just a few of the many multinationals that now engage in more than one type of corporate philanthropy. IBM&#39;s Open Source Community Grant program (with annual contributions of $200,000), the Danone Ecosystem (an impact investment fund with over $200 million committed since 2009), and the Ikea Foundation (with unrestricted funding for selected nonprofits working on emergency relief) are examples of the great diversity of corporate philanthropic engagement.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Main Types of Corporate Philanthropy Engagement</h4><p> <strong>Community grants:</strong> The company supports local community efforts or nonprofits with financial or in-kind contributions.</p><p> <strong>Corporate foundations:</strong> The company establishes and funds an independent legal entity to manage its philanthropic projects. These can be directly operated by the foundation or co-led through partnerships or grant giving.</p><p> <strong>Corporate sponsoring:</strong> The company finances the events, projects, or programs of a nonprofit organization.</p><p> <strong>Gift matching:</strong> The company matches the charitable donation of an employee, usually at a 1-1 ratio.</p><p> <strong>Venture philanthropy:</strong> The corporation takes the principles of venture capital financing to select, guide, and support a charitable project. This is often done through a corporate foundation.</p></article></aside></div><p></p><p> Increasingly, companies are establishing corporate foundations, which are legally independent entities that work exclusively on philanthropic activities. This allows them to take a more systematic approach to giving and create a “philanthropic identity.” Examples include the Walmart Foundation (with annual giving of $1.5 billion) and the Chanel Foundation (supporting over 150 charitable organizations since 2011). However, guidance remains limited on what type of philanthropic engagement would best fit a company&#39;s strategy.</p><p> Corporate philanthropy has the potential to create multiple benefits for a business, including enhanced reputation, legitimacy, local integration, network creation, knowledge acquisition, institutional acceptance, and stakeholder trust. But it also bears risks. Thus, companies must think carefully about what, how, and where to engage.</p><p> Our research examines the various strategies companies are testing in the realm of corporate philanthropy. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> When building a corporate philanthropy strategy, a business&#39;s most important decisions revolve around three central issues: what topics to engage in, which parts of the company can support these efforts, and how to maximize impact. First, in terms of engagement, companies can either actively engage in the design, implementation, and evaluation of potential projects (operational), or provide the resources for another organization to take the lead (grant giving). This decision should be based on their knowledge and expertise in their respective field. The second decision is whether to house the project in an external entity, like a corporate foundation, or internally under a department like sustainability, HR, public relations, or partnerships. Lastly, the project must be anchored within the community to make a real impact, either through the company&#39;s own networks in the country or through local partners.</p><p></p><p> Our analysis offers a framework to assist managers in their decision-making process, enabling them to ask the right questions to understand the fit of a philanthropic project for their organization. Three dimensions need to be assessed.</p><p> <strong>Cognitive fit:</strong> <em>Does your company have the knowledge and expertise to engage in this social issue?</em> Corporate philanthropy, much like any business activity, demands specialized competencies; thus, companies need to be selective to maximize their impact. Tackling complex issues related to their primary industry is a good starting point because businesses already have expertise in dealing with customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. Prominent examples include the Loewe Foundation&#39;s commitment to creativity and craftmanship — aligned with its identity as a luxury fashion house — and Adidas&#39; focus on expanding access to sports for all.</p><p> <strong>Structural fit:</strong> <em>Can the project be linked to the internal structure of your organization?</em> Every project needs organizational support to be integrated with the company&#39;s corporate structure and processes, which will potentially involve CSR, HR, or logistics. But one unit or department has to be in charge of providing adequate economic, human, social, and intellectual capital. We find that different corporations develop very different structural solutions to manage their philanthropic activities. Roche decided to create a whole new department, called the Corporate Donations and Philanthropy department, integrated under the CEO&#39;s office. Inditex still carries out its philanthropic activities within its sustainability department, and Visa chose to manage its donations through the Visa Foundation, as an independent entity.</p><p> <strong>Contextual fit:</strong> <em>Is the company well anchored in the local community, and does it have access to it, in order to effectively design and implement the project?</em> Gaining access to the local context is critical for success — it enhances onsite decision-making capabilities and fosters trust among stakeholders. If the organization engages in a familiar context, it can better tailor social solutions to local needs and do so more efficiently. For instance, HSBC&#39;s Hongkong Bank Foundation has distributed over HK$2.4 billion ($305.8 million) to support the Hong Kong community, its home market. Another example is the eBay Foundation, which encourages its employees to volunteer and give within their local communities.</p><p> Answering these questions helps companies craft a corporate philanthropy strategy and determine the implications of alternative pathways. (See “Designing a Corporate Philanthropy Strategy.”) Our assessment framework can be used on individual projects and to systematically manage a portfolio. When planning and defining a potential philanthropic project, managers can answer the questions related to the three dimensions and consider the recommendations given for each option. For example, a US-based fintech company seeking to engage in research projects focused on Alzheimer&#39;s disease would have a low cognitive fit between the philanthropic project and company expertise. It would also have a low structural fit if it did not have an in-house department to support community outreach for medical issues. Additionally, the fintech firm would score low on contextual fit if it were to engage in a program in Somalia — a market in which it doesn&#39;t operate or have specific knowledge. Under these circumstances, a grant-giving strategy through an external body like a foundation would be advisable. As this case reveals, thinking about the three dimensions can help managers establish guiding principles for their corporate philanthropy strategy and set rules regarding what, how, and where to engage. </p><div class="callout-highlight callout"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4 style="line-height:1.5;"> Designing a Corporate Philanthropy Strategy: An Assessment Framework</h4><p class="caption"> Using a structured framework to answer key questions, companies can craft strategies that not only guide the development of potential philanthropic projects but also streamline the management of their philanthropic portfolios. </p><table id="Chart#" class="chart-grouped-rows no-mobile" style="width: 100%"><thead><tr><th style="width:23%;" class="white"> Dimension</th><th style="width:30%" class="white"> Assessment</th><th style="width:45%" class="white"> Evaluation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p> <strong style="font-size:larger;"><span class="blue">Cognitive Fit</span></strong><br /> (the “What”)</p></td><td><p> <strong>Does your company have the knowledge and expertise to engage in this social issue?</strong> </p></td><td><div style="vertical-align:top"><div style="background-color:#43BD29; width:15%; text-align:center; float:left;"><p> <span class="white"><strong>Yes</strong></span></p></div><div style="width:85%; float:right; padding-left:10px;"><p> Take an operational approach based on the company&#39;s knowledge and expertise.

Over time, however, the Adecco Group&#39;s philanthropic portfolio grew and became very diverse, requiring a detailed assessment across the cognitive, structural, and contextual fit of the programs. In 2021, the management team carefully selected the foundation&#39;s priority projects based on the questions provided in our assessment framework. Accordingly, other initiatives were given back to the company (and integrated into the respective departments), and some were entrusted to better-suited nonprofits to take forward. This strategic move allowed the Adecco Group&#39;s foundation, now called the Innovation Foundation, to redefine its corporate philanthropy strategy and develop a decision-making framework rooted in three principles:</p><p> <strong>Industry expertise (cognitive fit).</strong> The foundation now focuses exclusively on the domains of employment, skills, and the future of work — the business&#39;s areas of expertise. In addition to receiving financial support, it benefits from the knowledge, data, experience, and ecosystem of the Adecco Group. This mutually beneficial relationship ensures that the valuable outcomes and insights generated by the foundation are shared back to the company.</p><p> <strong>Tailored social innovation lab methodology (structural fit).</strong> The foundation developed a proprietary operating model that blends data-driven analysis, design thinking, and innovation to deliver user-centric solutions following an acceleratorlike process. Thus, projects that did not align with that format — such as grant giving and fundraising — were given back to the business. These projects were run in the marketing or sustainability department, contingent on their structural fit and their knowledge, personnel, and network needs.</p><p> <strong>Local knowledge (contextual fit).</strong> Because the Innovation Foundation focuses on projects with long-term impact — those that address the source of a problem rather than the symptoms — local partners and end users are involved at every stage. One example is the foundation&#39;s Women Back to Work project in Spain, where the continuous involvement of local organizations and beneficiaries ensures that the program incorporates a deep understanding of the real problems of women reintegrating into the workforce in that context. Once a project has been developed and tested in-house, it is spun off for a local partner organization to scale and create maximum impact.</p><p></p><p> In the year following the foundation&#39;s restructuring, the team pursued three projects aimed at boosting employability for women, young adults, and older employees. These initiatives have provided the company with insights and real-time data on the unmet needs and potential solutions for underserved populations in the labor market.</p><p></p><p> The Adecco Group&#39;s case demonstrates the power of a well-crafted corporate philanthropy strategy that is grounded in guiding principles. As corporate giving becomes increasingly important in today&#39;s business landscape, it&#39;s critical for companies to focus their efforts on maximizing their social impact as well as their competitive position. A well-executed philanthropic strategy not only benefits society but also strengthens an organization&#39;s market position by providing access to new knowledge and expanding the organization&#39;s network.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/do-you-have-a-corporate-philanthropy-strategy/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Making Investments in AI: Samsung&#39;s Hina Dixit</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/making-investments-in-ai-samsungs-hina-dixit/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/making-investments-in-ai-samsungs-hina-dixit/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 06 Jun 2023 11:00:22 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. <p>Sam Ransbotham ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ransbotham">@ransbotham</a> ) is a professor in the information systems department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College, as well as guest editor for <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> &#39;s Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy Big Ideas initiative.

Find out her five criteria on today&#39;s episode.</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I&#39;m Hina Dixit from Samsung Next, and you&#39;re listening to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> .</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Welcome to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> , a podcast on artificial intelligence in business. Each episode, we introduce you to someone innovating with AI. I&#39;m Sam Ransbotham, professor of analytics at Boston College. I&#39;m also the AI and business strategy guest editor at <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> .</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And I&#39;m Shervin Khodabandeh, senior partner with BCG and one of the leaders of our AI business. Together, <cite>MIT SMR</cite> and BCG have been researching and publishing on AI since 2017, interviewing hundreds of practitioners and surveying thousands of companies on what it takes to build and to deploy and scale AI capabilities and really transform the way organizations operate.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> On today&#39;s episode, we have Hina Dixit, an investor at Samsung Next. Hina, thanks for joining us.欢迎。</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Thank you so much. It&#39;s a pleasure being here with you.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Most of our listeners are likely familiar with Samsung — giant South Korean multinational, lots of consumer electronics — but people may be less familiar with Samsung Next, so let&#39;s start there. Can you describe what Samsung Next is and what your role is?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. Samsung Next is the private equity or venture capital arm of Samsung. We tend to be stage-agnostic, but at the same time, we have six focus areas where we invest. AI is one of them. We also invest in fintech, blockchain, and infrastructure, and media tech as well, along with health tech.</p><p> Along with these six focus areas, we tend to make more and more learned investments about the ever-changing, dynamic world as well. So if you or anyone has a cool idea, please feel free to reach out.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I should&#39;ve prepared more and had a few pitches ready so that we could&#39;ve put you on the spot here while we were recording and get you on record there. So, what, exactly, do you do, though?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I currently lead the AI investment segment area. If there is any deal which is associated with AI, I tend to lead that deal and also work on the investment strategy for Samsung Next.</p><p> When you head out to these startup demos, to these pitches and expos, you will see thousands of startups. Now, how do you ensure that you are focused on the right areas which matter to Samsung? It should also propel innovation further; [instead of simply] furthering the innovation, it should also be usable. So that&#39;s why having a paradigm will help you make those sound decisions, where you can actually prioritize certain areas ahead of time compared to other investors, and understand which of the current technologies will be booming, say, a few years from now. And accordingly, you tend to segment and understand that, OK, these are my top-priority areas.</p><p> At the same time, I&#39;m very, very passionate about mentoring entrepreneurs, mentoring fellow people in tech. I come from a tech background, so I can always understand the hiccups people face when they are moving from individual-contributor roles or management roles in these big techs and moving forward to a startup entrepreneurial journey. I love connecting with them and helping them out.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That&#39;s really wonderful, Hina. So I want to talk about both things you said, both the mentoring, but also I want to go back to how you pick an investment. I mean, obviously, where you&#39;re sitting, you are looking at thousands of opportunities probably, right? And so you mentioned there are some guiding principles in terms of how you prioritize where to focus and what fits strategically with Samsung, but tell us more about how you pick an investment once you&#39;ve already gone through that filter, that “OK, it&#39;s the right thing for the company. We want to do it.” Now you&#39;re actually evaluating an AI company. Tell us how you pick. What are the factors you consider?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I tend to focus on very important factors for me personally. Every investor out there has a very different way of investing. Some people are very intuition-driven, and I have seen such investors make really great decisions. Some people are very theory-driven, and some people tend to take it as they go.</p><p> I am a mix of all of them. I tend to make these sound, learned decisions where I&#39;m very comfortable and I know the space very well. One thing that is always very important for me is the team. Is there a right product-team fit here? Are these individuals capable of building these great products that they&#39;re promising? I think that is an essential parameter for me.</p><p> And then, moving on to the problem itself: Is this pain point really [going to be] valid in few years? The pain point has to be there. The next thing is the technical innovation. Now, that is important, because that serves as a mode for you, or mode for these entrepreneurs, right? Otherwise, any big tech [company] can just go in and create what they have created. We want to have a solid mode around these products that they&#39;re building and some sort of novelty.</p><p> And then, moving from technical innovation and the mode, obviously there has to be a decent market size. You might be building an awesome product, but at the same time, the market sizing [might be] very small. It becomes really hard to scale that kind of product. Even if it&#39;s not monetizable, it should be solving a very solid pain point, plus the impact of that particular solution has to be global. And that&#39;s another factor for me, where I tend to make my own decision that, OK, this is something which is going to change everything that we do today.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Tell us more about the team, because technology is one aspect, but how do you suss out both the capability of the team itself and then how well the team works with each other? I mean, a lot of startups have team issues, right?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Yeah.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> How do you look into that?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Sure. I think it&#39;s a very deep question, and I think it comes from my days at Apple. Apple has a very startuplike culture in some of their organization, and here I&#39;m speaking about the culture because there were so many learnings from them. When I started, there was a very open culture where people would come on the weekends to support and mentor you and help you. They wouldn&#39;t even ask for any kind of credit. They would help you move forward, and at the same time, they will not just stop there. They will empower you. They will connect you with the right connections across the organization.</p><p> I kind of felt that it is very difficult for people to be that selfless and just focus on making the product great, but I think that&#39;s what the spirit of Apple is, and I tend to see a similar spirit in founders if I know that they&#39;re very, very product-driven, or they&#39;re very, very goal-driven in terms of [their] team. Then I tend to get that sense, OK, these guys will support each other.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> You&#39;ve got some extensive experience in this area. You mentioned Apple a couple of times. Tell us a bit about how you got to where you are now from where you started.</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I come from a very humble family background. So while my dad would work very hard, I would help them out with our family business, which was a small public call office, or a PCO, where people [went] and used to make telephone calls. So I used to sit there, and I used to make those calls for people, handle the customers, and enable them to make these phone calls, and that was a very good learning point for me because I learned how to talk to people.</p><p> From being a very introverted child, I became very public-facing, right then and there. … Like, OK, these are my customers. They are top priority. I need to serve them, help them, and that&#39;s where I think some of these qualities that I [espouse] or these passions that I have — that I love helping people, I love solving conflicts — probably arise.</p><p> I did my high school from Kanpur [City in India], which is Mercy Memorial School, and after my high school, I went to a women&#39;s college because my parents were a bit conservative yet. I was the first girl in the entire family of my dad&#39;s side who went outside of the city in order to get an education.</p><p> It was immensely fun. It was a very safe and secure environment. Obviously, it was very competitive — we women tend to be very competitive — and at the same time, I made great friends there, and I learned so much from my classmates at that time. We used to trade on these various ideas, and we used to create these JavaServer Pages-based applications, web applications for online quizzing, test banks, writing educational articles.</p><p> I remember, even buying a Starbucks coffee at that time used to be a very, very far-off thought because it was so expensive for me, and I used to work multiple jobs at the same time. And then I was placed at Symantec six months ahead of graduation. So that took some pressure off of me, and Symantec was a great starting point for me. I was in their data loss prevention team. I learned significantly from all the mentors there. I still share great relationships with all of them. And then Apple happened, and the rest is history.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> One thing that&#39;s fascinating: As you were saying that, I was thinking about how you tied your exposure to customer service through that very early call office job.</p><p> At the same time, much of what we&#39;re talking about with artificial intelligence ... it strikes me that the kind of job that would be suspect or likely to be replaced, and I have to wonder, how does the next Hina Dixit come along without that experience if we don&#39;t have those introductory customer service-oriented jobs to learn those skills?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Yeah, I get the question. This has been a grave thought, and a lot of people are coming forward and discussing it. But I think AI is not going to replace people. AI is going to empower people, and that&#39;s the thought process I come from. Just because phones became relevant, it didn&#39;t mean that [the mail was] not relevant anymore. We still order Amazon packages, and we still get our bills in the mail and whatnot, and that&#39;s how I think we will be able to push mankind. That&#39;s how we keep on pushing each and every … mile toward the ultimate goal of humankind&#39;s future, right?</p><p> Moving to the ultimate goal there, I think nobody should blindly trust that, OK, AI is going to replace their job, but they should be able to learn about AI. And that&#39;s one of the things where I&#39;ve been focusing on: finding these really cool technologies which can help people ramp up on AI.</p><p> Like, why do people need to write any single piece of code in order to use AI? Why can&#39;t this be as simple as looking at an Excel sheet? Why can&#39;t this be as accessible [as a] user interface, which is very easily programmable by just any business user out there? So finding that kind of interface between AI and the current users, that is a very critical piece where I think investors should focus on, because the ultimate goal here is to normalize the usage of AI and make that publicly available and at the same time accessible as well.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I think this is a very, very good point. That vision you painted is actually quite appealing. It used to be, the human element of AI was around making the technology better, faster, cheaper, or [writing] the next-generation algorithm, which of course, we still do, but that&#39;s going to be more and more in the R&amp;D and innovation zone. I think, as you&#39;re saying, the usage of AI will go from humans&#39; role as programmers and writers of code to more working at that interface, of having these building blocks and connecting those building blocks that AI provides to solve existing problems, but more importantly, as you&#39;re saying, thinking about “What else can we do with this? How do you innovate, now that you have all this at your fingertips?”</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Yeah. I kind of think the same way, because anybody ... you know, think of Excel. Anybody can just jump into Excel and make applications out of it. I know there are a bunch of cool apps coming around productivity right now which are backed by AI.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Share with us a bit your view on the coolest areas of technology that you are looking at right now. What piques your interest these days with everything that&#39;s going on with cyber and Web3 and quantum computing and everything else? Can you share specific investments or areas you&#39;re looking at?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Sure. We are focused a lot on infrastructure pieces of Web3, and at the same time, we are also focusing a lot on the AI aspect of Web3. So can we use these decentralized systems in order to make compute efficient? That&#39;s a question that we are trying to … answer right now. We are also trying to dive in deeper on the health-tech side, where we want to digitize the normal health paradigm, and we want to empower users out there and give them more proper feedback, maybe in their diet, maybe connect them to the right agents or doctors or nurses.</p><p> The focus is on empowering the humans. That&#39;s where I think we are trying to focus. And then obviously there is meta-tech aspect, which is the metaverse. We&#39;re trying to understand, how easy would it be to convert any image into a 3D asset and place it in the metaverse? And then, how do we make this metaverse accessible, just like the real world?</p><p> It seems surreal, but at the same time, there&#39;s so much hard work and research for each and every aspect of this. We are also focusing a lot on the fintech perspective and trying to empower these LatAm [Latin American] countries, finding a way they can build very sustainable and safe credit-scoring systems in Asia, for example, [and in] India, East Asia, and LatAm countries. So building a lot of infrastructure around fintech in LatAm countries and Asian countries is another thing that we are focusing on.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Yeah, I think that infrastructure&#39;s particularly interesting because that is an area where artificial intelligence can make a difference, when you can get some scale through an infrastructure. It&#39;s one of those situations that it seems like it opens up new possibilities when the economics change — when things that were no longer possible become possible. Are there other things that you&#39;re working on that are next in the portfolio? What are we going to see from Samsung Next next?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> We are moving into robotics as well. I did invest in one of the companies, called Integral AI, and they are trying to use these large AI models or foundation models [to train] their robots. But at the same time, robotics is another area where we want to focus on the consumer robotics aspect, so any cool startups out there building these cool consumer robots, please feel free to reach out to us, and we&#39;ll be happy to jump in and help out.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Hina, we&#39;ve got a segment where we ask you a series of questions, and these are supposed to be rapid-fire. Just give us the first thing that comes to your mind.</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> OK.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> You&#39;ve got a past career that&#39;s over a decade of being involved in these technologies. What&#39;s your proudest AI moment? What&#39;s the thing in this portfolio that you&#39;re proudest of that involves AI?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I think I&#39;ll have to say Stability AI because before that, there were a lot of research communities around, but at the same time, there was no way that somebody could go and commercialize those research works. And I really value Emad Mostaque&#39;s work there — that he recognized this problem and he got these research facilities together in order to start commercializing and build more solid consumer end products.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> We&#39;ve been very positive about artificial intelligence today, but is there anything that worries you about AI?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I think one thing that worries me is that we have seen a recent burst of these large language model-based apps, and that does include ChatGPT. I love their work, but at the same time, there are other pain points. And then, obviously, there are copyright issues that we need to solve, there are security issues. So those are some of the other areas we are trying to focus on, and trying to understand how those pain points can be resolved.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your favorite activity that does not involve technology?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> It&#39;s basically gardening in my house. I just find that very therapeutic, and, secondly, I love playing with my dog, Jimmy. He&#39;s absolutely adorable.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What was the first career you wanted? What did you want to be when you grew up?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I have always wanted to be a startup founder. I was 8 when I manifested that … I would be a founder, I would be building great products, and I would be helping out other people. So ever since I was 8, [I&#39;ve been] chasing that dream.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your greatest wish for artificial intelligence in the future? What are you hoping we can gain from this?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> My biggest wish for AI would be enabling common sense in some way, because these large AI models, they do have some AI capabilities when they can be put together in conjunction. We know from the recent <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2204.02311">PaLM research paper that Google published</a> that, OK, there is a way of having these multiple multimodels work together in order to create more sensible information and reliable information out there for users to believe in, and they basically used it to train their robots.</p><p> So that&#39;s one application, but a lot can come forward from that particular research work that Google published, including chain-of-thought prompting as well. How do you use these several models to work together in order to perform better in real-world and unstructured environments? So that would be very cool to see.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> OK, yeah, that seems so exciting to me, too, because we originally had the generative AI adversarial models, where, yes, we learned how to play chess really quickly, or we learned through a game, but the universe that has expanded from the idea that we can have bazillions of these models working kind of with and against each other — that seems very natural to, well, the way that we as humans or current biology works. It seems like there&#39;s a lot of potential for that.</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Yeah, yeah.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Well, Hina, thanks for taking the time to talk with us today. I think that there&#39;s lots — actually, particularly from your background — that is inspiring to people. Thank you for taking the time to talk with us.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah, thank you so much.</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Thank you so much for having me. It was a pleasure.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Thanks for listening. On our next episode, Shervin and I speak with Elizabeth Anne Watkins, research scientist at Intel Labs.

But the storm hit Southwest harder than it did most airlines. The company&#39;s outdated computer systems collapsed, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/18/can-southwest-fix-its-tech-problems-aviation-experts-arent-confident.html">years of underinvestment in technology, particularly staff scheduling systems</a> , led to more than <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/06/1147445280/southwest-airlines-cancellations-costs-825-million">16,700</a> flight cancellations over the holiday travel period. Amid the chaos, an executive&#39;s memo demanding proof of illness for the use of any sick days indicated a lack of trust in employees. The scenario contrasts starkly with what the company was once celebrated for: the pioneering development of an alternative short-haul airline concept, an unrivaled commitment to employees, and a reliance on front-line decision-making, all of which had led to industry-best operational excellence and customer service and the highest profits in the history of the industry.</p><p> Southwest&#39;s troubles are typical of a kind of leadership malaise we see in organizations that struggle to cope with disruptive events — such as the pandemic and its aftermath, which threw airports and airlines into operational turmoil and caused supply chains to collapse. To manage short-term appearances, these leaders and their predecessors had “cashed out” capabilities and allegiances they previously relied on to help them deal with unanticipated changes. It&#39;s a practice that has become too common and too accepted: Values, qualities, and relationships that have been honed over many years and served as the foundation for earlier successes are exchanged for near-term monetary rewards — typically in the form of cost reductions and stock price improvements that prove to be ephemeral.</p><p></p><p> We call this style of short-term leadership <em>performance hacking</em> . Performance hacking is the practice of giving the appearance of effective leadership by delivering on particular metrics, without delivering real performance. It involves companies and their leaders polishing financials through the calculated manipulation of investment planning and cost-cutting measures instead of prioritizing the creation of long-term value. The usual way to hack performance is by focusing on delivering short-term financial results to maintain steady trends that are unrealistic for major companies operating in complex environments but that leaders have come to believe — perhaps rightly — that the markets expect.</p><p> What performance hacking doesn&#39;t deliver is updated facilities and computer systems; investments in product/process research and development; the ability to master or exploit new technologies; or a loyal, capable workforce.</p><p> Performance-hacking leaders might, for example, reduce investments in key organizational capabilities, allow them to atrophy, or even outsource them — in effect, cashing out the less visible products or services that seem less urgent or less cost-effective at the moment, based on the convenient but often mistaken assumption that they can always be reacquired if needed in the future. They might skimp on employee pay and growth, which over time results in their more capable (and more expensive) employees leaving and less capable (and less costly) ones taking their place. Any subsequent external disruption then reveals how much an organization&#39;s know-how, resilience, and commitment have been sacrificed by managers&#39; attempts to improve appearances.</p><p> Organizational leaders can&#39;t hack performance by themselves, of course; boards and investors must acquiesce. They often drive this behavior by rewarding executives for meeting short-term financial targets. Indeed, major investors with no stake in the company&#39;s long-term success and viability often instigate and drive the process, motivated by the potential for short-term earnings.</p><p> Performance hacking is not a new phenomenon. In 1980, one of us (Bob Hayes), with coauthor Bill Abernathy, identified elements of what we now call performance hacking and cautioned against the tendency of corporate leaders to focus too much attention on controls and surface appearances at the expense of the “drive trains” of their companies. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> In many ways, the problem is worse today than when they first wrote about it. Adding to the urgency of this concern is that, as we will soon see, such practices appear to be spreading.</p><p> What is it that distinguishes performance hacking from strategically sound business decisions that may cut losses on bad bets or shift resources to invest in the long-term health of the business? The distinction is not always obvious to outside observers and often becomes clear only in retrospect. That said, examining recent examples where companies have clearly suffered as a result of performance hacking helps us identify warning signs that leaders are engaging in the practice.</p><h3> How Performance Hacking Harms Great Companies</h3><p> In the aftermath of last December&#39;s debacle at Southwest, the pilot union published a letter that contrasted two quotations. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> The first was from Southwest&#39;s cofounder, Herb Kelleher, who is often credited with the uniquely successful business model and culture for which the company was known in its early days: “You put your employees first. If you truly treat your employees that way, they will treat your customers well, your customers will come back, and that&#39;s what makes your shareholders happy. So there&#39;s no constituency at war with any other constituency. Ultimately, it&#39;s shareholder value that you&#39;re producing.” <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3个</a></p><p>Gary Kelly, the company&#39;s CEO from 2004 until 2022, was quoted espousing a different philosophy: “Arguably, our shareholders have suffered for a long time when it comes to getting a return and our employees have been very well taken care of.” The pilot union blamed that shift to a greater focus on shareholders for more frequent and severe operational problems.</p><p> The stated intention to take better care of shareholders is a sign that performance-hacking leadership is ascendant, but ironically the evidence suggests that these practices are actually bad for shareholders in the long run. Cashing out vital competitive capabilities might briefly benefit a subset of shareholders, but it destroys long-term value and prospects for other shareholders and stakeholders.</p><p> The corporate leader who arguably made performance hacking a mainstream management practice was Jack Welch, General Electric&#39;s CEO from 1981-2001. By the 1990s, he had perfected ways to manage earnings per share (EPS), using tweaks and tricks to yield a smoothly rising trend that was implausibly regular, always just beating projections. <cite>The Economist</cite> called it “taking money from one pocket and putting it in another.” <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> After Welch&#39;s retirement, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge-sec/ge-to-pay-50-mln-to-settle-sec-fraud-charges-idUSTRE5734G420090804">GE paid $50 million to settle allegations of accounting fraud</a> by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5个</a></p><p></p><p>Today, many commentators trace GE&#39;s subsequent collapse — its stock plunge in the late 2010s, its removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average after years of being named America&#39;s Most Admired Company by <cite>Fortune</cite> magazine, and its breakup into three smaller companies — to Welch&#39;s focus on appearance management and what insiders called the “success theater” of his successor, Jeffrey Immelt. But these practices had wider implications: GE&#39;s ability to deliver such unwaveringly positive results, however unrealistic this was for a complex conglomerate, led investors to expect it from other companies as well. Today&#39;s CEOs still feel this pressure.</p><p> Boeing&#39;s safety troubles with the 737 Max airliner, two of which suffered fatal crashes that killed a total of 346 people, can also be traced back to a deliberate decision to supposedly prioritize shareholder interests.</p><p> From 1998 to 2000, Boeing&#39;s leaders, many of them former Welch-era GE executives who came on board through Boeing&#39;s 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas, became fixated on polishing a financial ratio called return on net assets (RONA). To accomplish this, they expanded outsourcing, slashed R&amp;D investment, and laid off almost 20% of the workforce. The new philosophy at Boeing called for avoiding what leadership described as “moonshot” investments — a focus on developing the kinds of major new platforms and technologies that had made Boeing the unrivaled industry leader over the previous 80 years but involved placing big bets with uncertain outcomes. The decision in 2010 to squeeze more value out of the 50-year-old 737 airframe instead of building an all-new airplane was a direct result of this new way of thinking. But putting new, larger engines on the old airframe and positioning them differently than in the past required additional software to compensate for changes in handling, which contributed significantly to the Max&#39;s crashes.</p><p> Despite the misalignment we see in hindsight between performance hacking and protecting shareholder value, there are indicators that performance-hacking habits are spreading. Lately, large tech companies seem to be falling over one another to lay off employees, something they have historically not done at the current scale. Meta has cut 25% of its workforce over the last year. Salesforce has cut 10%; Amazon, 8%; and Alphabet, 6%, among others. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a> These are highly profitable companies with favorable opportunities for further growth in their futures.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> The Performance Hacking Toolkit</h4><p> <strong>Business leaders, managers, and board members should be aware of these common methods of performance hacking so that they are prepared to intervene and prevent long-term damage.</strong></p><p> <strong>Liquidating non-balance-sheet assets.</strong> Know-how that resides with employees is an invisible asset in the sense that it is valuable to the company but doesn&#39;t appear on the balance sheet. Similarly, a fully depreciated physical asset (a piece of equipment — say, a mainframe computer system) has value even though it no longer appears on the balance sheet. What is tempting to leaders about such assets is that they can be used to generate earnings without any corresponding balance sheet entry. As if by magic, laying off workers, outsourcing, or selling a fully depreciated asset can seem to produce earnings from thin air, without any telltale reduction of on-the-books assets. Wise leaders never forget, though, that unaccounted value is still real value for the company that, once gone, is difficult to get back.</p><p> <strong>Time-shifting cash flows and accounting assumption shifts.</strong> Boeing&#39;s technique of shifting cash flows to manage appearances was described by an anonymous employee in a 2019 <cite>Seattle Times</cite> article: “If the defense side falls short of expectations by hundreds of millions of dollars in a quarter, the call goes out from its Chicago headquarters to the Puget Sound-based Boeing Commercial Airplanes unit with a specific target to close the cash-flow gap: Negotiate with airlines and suppliers to pull money forward, say from January into December, and delay outgoing payments the opposite way. … [It happens] &#39;pretty much every quarter,&#39; said the insider. … &#39;Everyone realizes it&#39;s not a good decision long term.&#39;” <a id="reflinki" class="reflink" href="#refi">i</a> The financial terms of these deals are private, kept between buyer and sellers, so outsiders are none the wiser when they happen.</p><div class="callout-toggle"><p> Changing accounting assumptions can also change financial results, without shifting cash flows. In 2016, GE&#39;s power division was having trouble hitting its earnings targets. It approached customers with new, sweet deals on upgraded equipment and coupled them with extensions on the terms of service contracts, some of them out to 2050 or beyond. The new sales provided an opportunity to shift the assumptions that determined how much of future earnings could be counted in the current year and thus boosted 2016 earnings. The company is still saddled with these long-term bad deals.</p><p> <strong>Drawing down buffers.</strong> One of the most common ways for managers to hack financial performance/cash out invisible assets is to remove buffers — of inventory, production capacity, duplicate groups, or facilities — from their organizations by asserting that they are unnecessary “slack.” Or they outsource those buffers to other organizations, often in distant locations. Those buffers, however, often serve an important purpose: to protect an organization from immediate disruption should it experience widespread disturbances in its competitive environment.</p><p> <strong>Stock buybacks.</strong> When a company uses its cash to purchase its own shares, earnings per share improve even if earnings don&#39;t actually change. If companies have extra cash but can&#39;t find a high-return way to invest it, buybacks can be a legitimate alternative to dividends as a means of returning value to a company&#39;s owners. But as Robert C. Pozen has explained, from 2014 to 2016, the amount spent on buybacks and dividends consistently exceeded the aggregated net income of companies in the S&amp;P 500, which suggests that companies buy back stock instead of using cash to invest in available high-return projects. <a id="reflinkii" class="reflink" href="#refii">ii</a> Pozen also noted that many borrow money to buy back shares. If this tactic resulted in long-term improvements in stock price, that might be a justification, but the evidence suggests that companies that spend more on buybacks actually underperform compared with other companies in the long run in terms of returns. Ironically, over the long term, the markets seem to interpret stock buybacks as a form of financial engineering that signals fundamental weakness. <a id="reflinkiii" class="reflink" href="#refiii">iii</a></p><p> <strong>Kicking risk down the road.</strong> In his 2011 annual letter to shareholders, Boeing&#39;s then-CEO, James McNerney, explained the company&#39;s decision to try to wring more profits out of the 737 rather than develop a new airplane: “With development costs and risks far below an all-new airplane … we reduce our business risk substantially for the next decade.” <a id="reflinkiv" class="reflink" href="#refiv">iv</a> In retrospect, however, this claim seems absurd. The decision led to the need for a new software system that was implicated in the later crashes, so it did not reduce business risk but rather deferred and magnified it. What it probably also did was reduce short-term risk to the stock price. If we read closely, we see that this is what McNerney meant by “business risk” — not the risk of a plane not performing, but the risk of short-term stock devaluation due to the uncertainties inherent in a major investment in a new plane.</p></div></article></aside></div><p></p><p> These layoffs could be warranted, as company announcements have explained, by a need to adjust the workforce to evolving competitive challenges, or to correct for having possibly overhired during the pandemic.</p><p> But they could also be gestures aimed at short-term investors. Amid Alphabet&#39;s layoffs, a major hedge fund investor publicly demanded more, seeking a 20% workforce reduction and the shutdown of some advanced R&amp;D projects. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> Layoffs have indeed been accompanied by such project cancellations, including some from the company&#39;s famed X division specifically commissioned to work on moonshots. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8个</a></p><p>In recent years, tech companies have also embraced another favorite tool of performance hackers, with rising enthusiasm: the stock buyback. It&#39;s a great tool for generating misleading EPS trends; for example, by operating on the denominator of the EPS ratio, stock buybacks enable the interesting trick of increasing EPS while earnings decrease. Such tactics have historically been employed by companies in mature markets whose leaders may be tempted to mislead because they have trouble generating growth. Tech companies, in contrast, appear to have ample growth prospects. Nevertheless, in 2021 and 2022, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft collectively announced almost $300 billion in stock buybacks.</p><h3> Performance Hacking Indicators</h3><p> Discouraging performance hacking begins with recognizing when it&#39;s happening. Signs are often apparent to insiders: As early as 2016, Southwest pilots called for Kelly&#39;s resignation after a computer system failure, citing his “misguided emphasis on cost controls” and spending cash on stock buybacks rather than investing in technology improvements. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a> Because any individual decision can have a legitimate business rationale, detecting the practice is less about spotting a smoking gun than watching for an accumulation of decisions and actions that add up to a likelihood that leaders have succumbed to temptation. Here are some of the indicators.</p><p> <strong>Sudden, unexplained improvements in performance ratios or key results, or trends that seem unrealistically smooth.</strong> The EPS trends at GE were too smooth. The improvements in RONA at Boeing from 1998 to 2000 happened too fast to signal real operational change in such a large company. We know now what was really being signaled: excellence being cashed out. Sound management requires investing in creating new capabilities — <em>building</em> excellence — which often worsens performance metrics, at least initially. Numbers and trends that only improve should therefore elicit suspicion, not celebration.</p><p> <strong>A degraded customer experience.</strong> Whether it&#39;s flight cancellations, reduced customer support, or lower-quality products, an overt shift toward maximizing shareholder value in the short term might involve “borrowing” that value from customers.</p><p> <strong>Sudden enthusiasm for outsourcing, or a shift to more transactional people management that downplays the importance of employee expertise.</strong> Scholars Gary Pisano and Willy Shih have convincingly argued that outsourcing production based on narrow financial criteria usually also outsources expertise critical to a company&#39;s capacity to innovate. <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a> Leaders engaged in performance hacking often see employee contributions to a company&#39;s products and services as just another fungible resource, interchangeable with what can be easily obtained externally. They dismiss the notion that employees are reservoirs of unique competitive know-how who have been and can be invested in and developed over many years.</p><p> <strong>Decreased leadership emphasis on the operational characteristics of the business, and fewer leaders with industry expertise.</strong> While Southwest founder Kelleher was known for his hands-on involvement in operations, Kelly rose to a leadership position on the strength of his contributions as CFO. During his tenure, he appointed an executive with an accounting background as COO. Late-1990s leaders at Boeing urged employees to avoid getting “overly focused on the box” (the airplane) and to instead conceive of the company as a generic return-making business. <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a> This type of perspective also tends to play down the importance of leaders&#39; industry-specific expertise. Past research on short-termism has implicated the hiring of leaders with little domain expertise. <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a> Under Kelly, Southwest board members&#39; airline expertise decreased noticeably. Industry expertise on the board at Boeing also declined after its late-&#39;90s transformation.</p><p> <strong>Abandoning “moonshot” development projects.</strong> Developing new competitive capabilities sometimes requires a company to place big bets. Risk inevitably accompanies such investments. And yet it is hard to imagine a company thriving in the long run if it doesn&#39;t do some of this — and, in industries where competition is very innovation-based, quite a lot of it. Past research on companies afflicted by short-termism points to tendencies to decentralize R&amp;D and shift emphasis from “research” (which has a less obvious return) to “development” (which has a clearer sense of return). <a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a> When Boeing, the dominant commercial airline innovator at the time, turned away from moonshots, it started down a path to the loss of its industry-leading capabilities (and the 737 Max crashes). Some analysts now doubt whether the company, lately competing with the likes of SpaceX and Blue Origin for aerospace talent, has the ability to create an entirely new plane. <a id="reflink14" class="reflink" href="#ref14">14</a> Might tech companies be edging toward a similar path?</p><h3> The Role of the Board</h3><p> As noted earlier, boards can be complicit in performance hacking. But at companies with strong, independent governance, boards of directors have a number of tools that allow them to encourage performance that benefits companies and their investors in the long term. They might rework executive compensation packages to incentivize long-term thinking rather than rewarding short-term share price performance. They might also use frameworks, such as the Balanced Scorecard, that offer a wider set of measures intended to better account for the creation and cashing out of capabilities.</p><p> However, we don&#39;t think this problem will be solved purely through the redesign of incentives. It&#39;s preferable that boards stay alert to the possibility of performance hacking; orchestrate ongoing conversations about the relationship between building and maintaining vital competitive capabilities and the movement of short-term financial metrics; and insert themselves into some key decisions that are routinely left to senior management (like decisions about stock buybacks, which, unlike decisions about dividends, are not legally required to involve the board).</p><p> Of course, it&#39;s critical — but hardly a given — that board members themselves take a long-term view, just as some shareholders themselves do. An example of this came in 2021 at ExxonMobil, when the hedge fund Engine No. 1 led a campaign to install, over management objections, three board members who explicitly embraced a philosophy of focusing on long-term value creation. <a id="reflink15" class="reflink" href="#ref15">15</a> Working with management researchers and consultants at PwC, Engine No. 1 developed a “total value framework” that used multiple data sources to evaluate long-term risks and opportunities, with a goal of making it clear to everyone how actions that might look good in the short term could drag down value over time.</p><p> The harm caused by performance hacking goes beyond companies and their employees, customers, and investors, however. If the only way for the market to correct for performance hacking is to let companies implode, the public at large can bear significant collateral damage. Measures for mitigating and containing risks might include establishing regulations like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, ensuring accurate financial reporting, and requiring stress testing as in industries like banking.</p><p></p><p> Silicon Valley Bank&#39;s recent implosion came just a few years after it successfully lobbied against regulatory safeguards and ultimately resulted in the government having to bail out its depositors (a significant chunk of the American startup ecosystem) to avoid wider economic damage. Leaders intent on lobbying against regulations that seem onerous should keep in mind that those regulations might play an important function in curtailing performance-hacking practices.</p><h3> The Risks of Inaction</h3><p> Performance hacking is so destructive because it often involves irreversible decisions. Organizations made vulnerable through excessive outsourcing may find that they don&#39;t have the ability to bring production back in-house when they need it, for example. Companies can also progressively weaken themselves through a long series of less visible decisions. Each of them might conform to what are considered generally accepted management principles and appear to have little effect on current operations but could be weakening certain expertise or capabilities, discarding a potentially useful technology, or undermining employees&#39; commitment to the company&#39;s success. When those capabilities, technologies, and commitments are needed in times of stress, managers may find that they&#39;ve gone down a one-way street: It&#39;s much harder to replace such invisible assets than it is to cash them out.</p><p> The pandemic, the war in Europe, the attendant disruption of global supply chains, and rising inflation and interest rates vividly illustrate the kinds of sudden stresses that business leaders have had to deal with these past three years. They also provide stark examples of the bad things that can happen to those who become addicted to polishing financial metrics at the expense of their organizations&#39; long-term resilience.</p><p></p><p> If a business leader like Welch could make performance hacking seem desirable, it should be possible for another high-profile leader (or a group of them) to make investing for the long term seem fashionable again. A strong CEO, backed by a highly respected board, can express their intention to invest for the long haul, even if the usual financial metrics might temporarily suffer. If that approach dissuades short-term investors, so much the better. This, of course, will not be easy. It will probably attract activist short-term shareholders and short sellers. But if an influential group of business leaders can prevail and demonstrate the success of this approach, other companies might follow.</p><p> One thing is certain: If this problem is left unfixed and continues to fester and hobble companies, we should resign ourselves to watching a parade of executives retire with lavish compensation packages, leaving behind hollowed-out businesses that are incapable of providing the products, services, and desirable jobs that are desperately needed.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/cashing-out-excellence/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Ask Sanyin: How Can I Field a Winning Team Without All-Star Players?</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ask-sanyin-how-can-i-field-a-winning-team-without-all-star-players/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ask-sanyin-how-can-i-field-a-winning-team-without-all-star-players/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 01 Jun 2023 11:00:57 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sanyin Siang. <p>Sanyin Siang is a CEO coach and leads the Fuqua/Coach K Center on Leadership &amp; Ethics (COLE) at Duke University.

How can I field a championship team when I don&#39;t have any all-star players?</p><p> It&#39;s easy for managers to succumb to a scarcity mentality and believe that their people aren&#39;t good enough — but it&#39;s important not to nurture this mindset. When we look closely at this problem, we often discover that the existing team&#39;s potential hasn&#39;t yet been fully realized. Building a championship team is almost always a matter of activating untapped potential, not trading for better players.</p><p> Years ago, my friend Sue Gordon, the former principal deputy director of national intelligence, told me that although you don&#39;t always get to choose your team, your team is enough and you must help them believe that it is so. How do we make the most of who we have rather than fixating on their deficiencies?</p><p></p><p> The first step is to get much better at diagnosing the underlying problems when our teams aren&#39;t functioning effectively. I start by assessing where there are skill set issues and where there are behavioral problems. The former is straightforward to address (if not overnight) by investing in training or providing opportunities to gain specific experience.</p><p> Behavioral issues — by which I mean contextually variable behaviors that can diminish an individual&#39;s effectiveness or team dynamic — are a bit tougher. For example, an opinionated, creative person may contribute meaningful new ideas in meetings but dismiss suggestions made by others, demotivating teammates and dampening collaboration. Helping that team member see the effect of their behavior and develop new communication habits can improve team effectiveness.</p><p></p><p> Second, make sure everyone knows why and how they matter. Your team can&#39;t achieve greatness if its members don&#39;t believe that their presence on the team is important, their contributions are appreciated, and their ideas will be considered. Identify each individual&#39;s differentiating contributions (what I call <em>superpowers</em> ), and explicitly share those insights with them. Superpowers are the inimitable strengths we all have — but because they&#39;re so innate to us, we often don&#39;t see them and need others to point them out to us. An important part of good leadership is identifying the superpowers of everyone on your team and encouraging them to share what they see as each other&#39;s unique talents. This has the added benefit of giving you more data about how your team can sync up.</p><p> Finally, focus on the people, not the titles. Notice the capabilities, gifts, and inclinations of the people on your team, and be open-minded about how they might work together in new configurations. The market and operating context are changing rapidly, demanding a fluidity beyond the functional constructs that exist now. Someone&#39;s current title does not comprehensively define their capabilities, and it can often constrain them to a more limited role. Having a more expansive view of each person can help you harness the team&#39;s fullest potential.</p><p> When we&#39;re open to the potential of our existing team members and create opportunities for the team to surface, see, and recognize new strengths, we can come to see that the championship team is the one we already have.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ask-sanyin-how-can-i-field-a-winning-team-without-all-star-players/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Building a Winning Workplace Culture: Strategies for Leaders</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/building-a-winning-workplace-culture-strategies-for-leaders/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/building-a-winning-workplace-culture-strategies-for-leaders/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 31 May 2023 12:48:36 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Donald Sull, Charlie Sull, and Ally MacDonald. <p>Donald Sull is a global expert on strategy and execution in turbulent markets.
