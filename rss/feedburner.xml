Plytnikaite/theispot.com</p></figcaption></figure><p>企业多元化正面临强烈反对。 Target 公司十多年来一直销售庆祝 LGBTQ+ 骄傲的商品，在保守派活动人士指责该公司对儿童进行性化并组织抵制后，该公司下令一些商店下架此类产品。由于跨性别影响者迪伦·马尔瓦尼 (Dylan Mulvaney) 的促销活动，安海斯-布希 (Anheuser-Busch) 的销售额下降，百威淡啤 (Bud Light) 失去了美国最畅销啤酒的地位。即使是福来鸡（Chick-fil-A），也许是企业保守主义的原型，反对同性婚姻和周日关门政策，最近也因聘请一位高管来领导其多元化、公平和包容性（DEI）而受到保守派的攻击努力。</p><p>大学也面临着多元化的强烈抵制。美国最高法院最近驳回了哈佛大学和北卡罗来纳大学教堂山分校的种族意识招生计划。结束种族意识招生可能会产生连锁反应，因为不明确的监管环境可能会阻碍组织实施当前的多元化努力，同时促使一些组织明确排除黑人、拉丁裔和土著群体。</p><p></p><p>最近的这些事件表明，边缘化或代表性不足群体成员对民权进步的抵制仍然根深蒂固，反对改善公平的努力也更加大胆。</p><p>多元化的强烈反对使公司陷入困境。屈服于反多元化团体的压力可能会让他们失去在其他消费者中试图培养的善意；塔吉特公司屈服于保守派压力，遭到进步积极分子的反击。退缩还可以鼓励保守派活动人士进一步提出他们的要求。虽然这可能会暂时减轻公司的压力，但从长远来看，屈服于反多元化势力可能会伤害他们。人口结构正在发生变化，非白人在令人垂涎的青年市场中所占的比例越来越大，对 LGBTQ+ 美国人的法律保护得到了广泛的<a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/599240-support-for-lgbtq-rights-on-the-rise-poll/">支持</a>。消除歧视和增加机会对于确保丰富的人才渠道至关重要。对于许多管理者和员工来说，反歧视只是道义上的责任。</p><p>多元化举措很容易受到攻击，因为许多举措都是试探性的。一次性的长达数小时的培训课程、不受支持的新员工，或者随着反种族主义抗议的消退而消亡的项目，远远达不到使组织结果真正公平所需的变革性结构变革。真诚致力于多元化的领导者必须为捍卫包容性组织的成本做好准备，并采取难以逆转多元化成果的政策。</p><p></p><h3>不温不火地拥抱多样性</h3><p>当林登·约翰逊总统在马丁·路德·金在场的情况下签署 1964 年民权法案时，他是在回应几十年来全面经济包容性的呼声。根据该法案第七章，美国工作场所普遍存在的种族歧视变成了非法。大多数采用多元化政策的组织之所以这样做，是因为社会运动迫使他们采取行动，而不是出于对平等机会的崇高承诺。</p><p>许多组织回顾性地认识到，更大的多样性有助于<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/business-case-for-diversity-in-the-workplace/">他们</a>开拓利基市场或促进创新。但关于多样性有益于盈利的论点并没有导致美国工作场所种族隔离和种族分层的根本转变。如果经济收益没有实现，领导者可以依靠多元化的商业案例来撤回对这些举措的支持。</p><p>虽然民权法推动了工作场所的真正变革，但它们在很大程度上是边缘化的。尽管黑人和拉丁裔就业在早期取得了进展，但工作场所废除种族隔离在<a href="https://www.russellsage.org/publications/documenting-desegregation">20 世纪 80 年代</a>基本停止，此后对黑人<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1706255114">男性的</a>雇佣歧视一直相对持续。在受聘时，有色人种通常被指定担任与组织核心职能隔离的多元化职位，限制了他们的职业发展和流动机会。反歧视法的执行情况因政治风向而异，通常（但不完全）在民主党总统领导下加强，在共和党总统领导下减弱。正如社会学家弗兰克·多宾（Frank Dobbin）和亚历山德拉·<a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-soc-090820-023615">卡列夫（Alexandra Kalev）</a>在他们的研究中发现的那样，试图遵守不确定的监管环境会导致公司采取有效性可疑的多元化政策。人力资源专家经常提出一些被法院视为善意反歧视努力的政策，尽管这些政策效率低下，有时甚至适得其反。</p><p>多元化的组织很少破坏白人规范和塑造这些规范的<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122418822335">权力</a>。同质性仍然是标准，多样性是偏差。尽管承认民权运动给工作场所带来的变化，金伯利·克伦肖 (Kimberlé Crenshaw) 及其<a href="https://thenewpress.com/books/critical-race-theory">同事</a>在其 1996 年出版<cite>的《批判种族理论》</cite>一书中强调了多样性政策播下的不平等基础：“正是那些执行明确的种族隔离和种族统治政策的白人，他们是公司就业办公室、学校招生办公室、银行贷款办公室等决策者的工作。”</p><p>组织对多样性的不温不火的历史使他们没有准备好应对当前的强烈反对。在对警察谋杀乔治·弗洛伊德引发的大规模抗议做出集体反应短短三年后，公司却违背了他们的多元化<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/host-of-companies-sued-alleging-unmet-diversity-equity-pledges">承诺</a>。承诺包括增加边缘群体和妇女在高级职位和董事会中的代表性；解决留任、晋升和薪酬差距问题；与高级领导者和管理者合作，提高包容性领导行为的技能。公司增加了专注于 DEI 的职位，以表明他们解决不公正问题的意图，但没有以支持长期组织变革的方式进行转变。</p><p></p><p>我们怀疑，经济放缓以及多元化的强烈反对导致公司以比其他职位更快的<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/diversity-roles-disappear-three-years-george-floyd-protests-inspired-rcna72026">速度</a>削减这些新的 DEI 职位。对 DEI 的攻击导致一些组织背弃了他们的承诺，即制定旨在解决针对面临持续不平等的群体的组织政策、实践和文化的举措。整合实质性 DEI 项目的尝试也遭到了强烈反对， <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/coca-cola-scraps-diversity-requirements-for-outside-law-firms">可口可乐</a>放弃了针对外部律师事务所提出的 DEI 政策就证明了这一点。一些维权股东攻击公司的 DEI<a href="https://www.mvalaw.com/media/news/15112_WLT_McDowell.pdf">干预措施</a>，并针对有助于减轻工作场所歧视的 DEI 审计做法。</p><h3>对抗抵抗</h3><p>尽管我们描述了一个悲观的故事，但多元化计划可以成功。研究<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/000312240607100404">表明</a>，当组织专门设立专门职位来管理和监控公平目标和计划时，多元化计划就会发挥作用。</p><p>问责制是维持有效的 DEI 政策和计划的<a href="https://hbr.org/2022/02/dei-initiatives-are-futile-without-accountability">关键</a>。虽然股权工作应涉及所有员工，但 DEI 专业人员必须有权追究领导层的责任。组织领导者必须负责设计、建模和实施重塑组织政策的公平计划。研究表明，战略性 DEI 举措是可行的，包括建立激励员工赞助边缘群体成员的辅导计划、展示招聘和晋升流程的透明度以及让员工对多元化目标负责。</p><p>最近针对多元化的强烈反对应该让组织领导者做好准备，应对内部利益相关者和外部反多元化活动人士可能抵制多元化举措的情况。发表支持 DEI 的公开声明有助于建立问责目标，但不幸的是，似乎越来越多的领导人在回应反多元化活动人士时选择沉默或投降。</p><p>我们看到了类似的现象，即右翼对气候科学的拒绝导致一些领导人淡化可持续发展目标，这种做法被称为<em>“环保”</em> 。最近的一项<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0047287520930087">研究</a>研究了酒店业的这一动态，发现消费者更喜欢酒店传达其企业社会责任努力，而不是参与“环保活动”。有趣的是，研究发现，此类沟通还促使消费者考虑自己选择的道德规范。同样，我们认为，公开讨论组织通过问责制解决系统性问题的承诺，可以减少对能够改变行为和态度并带来进步的举措的抵制。</p><p></p><p>组织应该直面多元化的强烈抵制，以及肤浅的多元化政策的空洞本质。随着多样性培训受到越来越多的批评，以及白人疲劳破坏了对种族主义的严肃讨论，组织中的种族包容性面临着生存威胁。抵制这种多样性倒退需要组织对为应对公认的种族不公正而做出的广泛承诺负责。</p><p>对于致力于将公平融入其使命、价值观、文化和实践的组织，我们建议采取战略规划方法。对隔夜结果的期望必须受到以结果为导向、可衡量的现实目标的控制，并有目标完成日期。该流程必须包括反馈循环设计，允许在计划、实施和执行中进行修正，从而为管理者提供检查影响和进度的机会。最近发生的事件使各组织有机会重申和加强其致力于通过消除不平等来创建公平组织的承诺。</p><p></p>

class="attribution">迈克尔·格伦伍德·吉布斯/theispot.com</p></figcaption></figure><p> 2023 年 6 月 29 日，美国最高法院以 6 比 3 的裁决支持禁止在大学招生中使用种族和族裔因素。这是一项重大决定，将产生广泛的社会和组织影响。尽管该裁决的范围仅限于大学招生，但我们可以利用现有数据来预测对美国企业界的影响。证据清楚地指出了两个关键结果：首先，种族多样性的大学模式将发生相当大的变化；其次，这些变化将对工作场所构成以及一系列其他措施中的种族不平等模式产生相当大的下游影响。</p><p>尽管人们可能会认为这些结论有些夸张，但对三十年来州级平权行动禁令的研究强烈表明事实并非如此。事实上，消除平权行动已经导致本科和研究生课程中代表性不足的学生（黑人和西班牙裔）比例下降，特别是在科学、技术、工程和数学领域；它还导致医学院和法学院入学和毕业的代表性不足的学生减少。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a>这些影响往往是持久的，而且重要的是，实施不明确考虑种族和族裔的替代政策对应对这些影响效果甚微。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a></p><p></p><p>将这些州级研究结果扩展到国家级表明，雇主在填补职位空缺时，可以利用的种族多元化程度较低的受过大学教育的人才，尤其是来自一流院校的人才。另外，申请人群体中的黑人和西班牙裔候选人被选中的可能性较小，因为他们的学位较少或毕业于排名较低的大学，因此资历较低，而他们更有可能申请并被录取。 -平权行动。一个不太直观的结果是，更有声望的学院和大学的白人（和亚洲人）毕业生与其他种族背景的人的接触会更少。这对他们的多元文化能力（与与自己不同的人建立联系的能力）产生了影响，并且可能有助于解释为什么雇主倾向于向种族多元化的商学院和大学的毕业生支付更高的起薪。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p>黑人和西班牙裔社区的影响将是毁灭性的。最值得注意的是，帮助满足种族相似的少数族裔客户需求的少数族裔专业人士将会减少。尽管这似乎更方便，但在医学或法律（雇用律师和执法人员）等领域尤其令人不安，在这些领域，少数族裔代表性不足往往被认为是有据可查的种族民族医疗保健的一个促成因素和刑事司法差异。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p>从更有声望的学校毕业或根本毕业的几率较低也会对组织内的种族不平等产生影响。首先，代表性不足的少数族裔不太容易找到工作，或者更有可能找到质量较低的工作。它会继续影响从进入到退出的整个人力资源管理领域的结果，因为最初的安置会对薪酬、晋升、培训/发展、保留/离职和部署等方面产生持久的影响。例如，即使是获得就业机会的黑人和西班牙裔专业人士也可能更有可能发现自己面临“最后受聘、最先被解雇”的现象。此外，起薪过低会影响其他公司的加薪规模或竞争性报价，并对个人的退休储蓄产生有害的复合效应。</p><p></p><p>那些寻求更具体证据证明禁止大学平权行动可以影响美国企业多样性的人只需看看哈佛商学院教授张乐天最近的研究即可。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a>他利用平等就业机会委员会 1985 年至 2015 年间 11,000 多家美国私营企业的数据，研究了平权行动禁令对不同种族背景的人是否成为管理者的影响。他预计高管们可能会将禁令解读为一种歧视的许可，因此不太可能雇用黑人经理或提拔黑人候选人。结果显示，“在一个州采取平权行动禁令后，公司总部位于该州的企业中，黑人经理的比例增长放缓超过50%，这种放缓主要集中在首席执行官政治保守的公司。”</p><p>通过扩大大学成绩差距，大学禁止平权行动实际上进一步推动了众所周知的机会平等，因为在财富和获得优质学前教育和 K-12 教育方面现有的种族差异增加了更大的高等教育差异，这也不利于代表性不足的少数群体。具有讽刺意味的是，这进一步增强了为维持种族现状而采取工作场所平权行动策略的必要性。也就是说，任何此类努力几乎肯定会受到法律依据的挑战，而最高法院（至少目前的组成）已表明自己极不可能赞成此类努力。</p><p></p><p>事实上，13 个州总检察长最近以先发制人的方式通知苹果、微软和 Uber 等公司，他们应该期待对任何被认为促进员工选拔中基于种族的偏好的政策进行更严格的审查。他们继续承诺对“违规者”采取法律行动，表明他们打算将最高法院裁决的范围扩大到美国工作场所。这就提出了一个问题，仍然致力于种族平等就业机会的组织可以采取哪些措施来限制他们在这个新的、不断变化的就业格局中可能遭受的损失？下面，我提供四项建议来帮助从业者、管理者和组织应对这一挑战。</p><p></p><h3>不要在场边等待</h3><p>西奥多·罗斯福总统经常被认为有这样一句话：“在任何决策时刻，你能做的最好的事情就是正确的事情，其次最好的事情就是错误的事情，而你能做的最糟糕的事情就是什么都不做。”在最高法院的裁决之后，人们可能会倾向于维持一切照旧，观望事态的发展，并在尘埃落定后采取反动的做法。然而，这样做肯定会产生相当大的后果。也就是说，继续从同一所学校寻找申请者，而不根据学生群体构成的可预测变化进行调整，会使组织完全依赖大学招生人员重新调整策略来解决很少有人能够解决的问题。过去30年。</p><p>因此，像许多组织历史上那样，继续使用学位和学位授予机构作为人力资本的代表，可能会导致几乎所有就业结果中的种族差异扩大，并对非就业结果产生连锁效应。例如，最近的一项研究表明，在平权行动禁令实施后，代表性不足的少数族裔青年往往会立即增加危险行为（吸烟、饮酒和酗酒）。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a>简而言之，预计代表性不足的少数族裔员工将会减少，种族不平等将会加剧，包括收入和晋升方面的更大差异。</p><h3>质疑一切</h3><p>好吧，你可能不必质疑一切，但如果一个组织想要在某件事上做得更好，它需要以不同的方式做一些事情，并检查它们过去是如何做的。例如，一位人力资源主管曾经告诉我，公司的政策是只从全国排名前十的工程项目中进行招聘。这种做法的一个意想不到的后果是，新员工来自与公司所在地完全不同的地理区域，而且新员工的流动率对于该行业来说异常高。 10号程序和12号程序没有质的区别，都位于100英里以内。为什么不从 12 号计划中招募员工，以减少新员工在第一年内经历极端文化冲击并离职的机会？</p><p>在当前背景下应用这一逻辑，公司可能需要扩大其搜索参数，以吸引在人口统计上与最近的申请人群体一致的申请人群体。在历史悠久的黑人学院和大学以及为西班牙裔服务的机构进行招聘是进行定向招聘的好方法——这一策略目前在法律上是允许的。在代表性不足的少数群体经常光顾的地方放置在线广告，表明您的组织有兴趣接收这些群体成员的申请。此外，在选择和薪酬方面，企业需要重新评估授予学位机构的隐性和显性权重。从一流大学毕业的好处已经分配得不一致，白人毕业生的好处比黑人学位持有者的好处更大。 <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a>为什么不减少每个人的受益，同时为更大的群体提供更多就业机会？</p><h3>深入研究数据</h3><p>为了解决质疑一切所带来的问题，组织可以求助于他们的数据所揭示的内容。例如，尽管惰性和针对竞争对手的基准可能表明某项工作需要大学学位，但数据是否支持这一论点？与种族差异相关的工作要求，例如获得学位和从著名学校获得学位，往往会对代表性不足的群体产生不利影响——这是一种统计歧视的形式。在选择的背景下，当特定的决策工具使一个种族群体（或任何其他受法律保护的类别）的成员相对于另一个种族群体的成员有利时，就会产生不利影响。虽然如果这种差异与工作相关，则这种差异并不违法，但需要数据来确定这种相关性。</p><p>当要求学位、偏向精英学校毕业生以及使用最低 GPA 分数线时，当这些要求与工作表现没有直接关系时，可能会对代表性不足的少数群体产生不利影响。在过去的几年里，关于消除此类要求的讨论越来越多，不仅是为了加强种族正义，也是为了在紧张的就业市场中挖掘更多的高潜力候选人。尽管有些人可能将其解释为一种“降低标准”以增强多样性的形式，但应该指出的是，与绩效无关的标准是不必要的，而且可能是非法的，并可能导致员工资格过高，这可能对员工的态度产生负面影响，以及存在和表现。 <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a>使用您的数据（以及相关其他人的数据）来确定工作相关性并消除不会提高您利润的障碍。</p><h3>选择潜力，训练表现</h3><p>尽管大学投入大量资源为学生的职业做好准备，但毕业生所拥有的能力水平和雇主所期望的能力水平不可避免地存在不足。例如，全国大学和雇主协会表示，雇主几乎一致认为沟通是最重要的能力，几乎所有学生都知道这一点。然而，尽管 80% 的学生认为自己非常擅长沟通，但只有 47% 的雇主也这样看待学生。关键是，超过一半的雇主认为毕业生缺乏最重要的能力。显然，53% 的雇主认为大学毕业生不是非常熟练的沟通者，他们不会留下空缺职位。如果是的话，2022年大学毕业生的失业率就不会是4%。相反，许多（如果不是大多数）雇主认识到，他们需要投资于培训，以使新员工能够跟上进度。</p><p></p><p>以种族中立但有效的方式识别潜力当然说起来容易做起来难。一般来说，用于选择员工的指标与员工的实际工作越接近越好。这表明高保真模拟、工作样本和行为锚定结构化访谈等工具可能特别有用。 <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a>选择方法还应侧重于确定可培训性，以确保组织能够最大限度地提高其培训投资的回报。这可能需要为顶尖候选人提供机会，通过积极学习新的与工作相关的能力并随后展示他们的熟练程度来展示他们的可培训性。</p><p></p><p>在过去的半个世纪中，平权行动及其后代帮助改变了美国学院、大学和组织的种族面貌。这些计划是通过为那些历史表明不太可能（或至少不太可能）获得这些机会的人提供机会来实现这一目标的。选择“<em>机会</em>”这个词既是有意的，也是重要的，因为许多人常常忽视这样一个事实：这些计划只给予受益人表明他们归属的机会。尽管最高法院的裁决消除了一种有助于公平竞争的手段，但正如亚历山大·格雷厄姆·贝尔曾经说过的那样，“当一扇门关闭时，另一扇门就会打开。”尽管这条道路似乎不太明确，但创新型公司将通过寻找、吸引和选择来自<em>所有</em>种族和民族背景的最有才华的人才来创造和保持竞争优势。</p><p></p>

But think about the other benefits: They kick-start mentoring relationships, and they open up more development and growth opportunities and more doors to advancement — all of which can enhance the employee experience, motivation, and loyalty.</p><p> Can you quantify these results? Sometimes you can&#39;t, so you gauge value qualitatively. That can mean soliciting input from managers and team leaders on a training program&#39;s impact on employees&#39; behavior, effectiveness on the job, and approach to teamwork. Considering the qualitative impact from the employee&#39;s perspective is essential, too, because talent retention has major implications for ROI. For proof of why these intangibles matter, consider a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/03/09/majority-of-workers-who-quit-a-job-in-2021-cite-low-pay-no-opportunities-for-advancement-feeling-disrespected/">Pew Research Center 2022 survey</a> that found a tie between “no opportunities for advancement” and “pay was too low” as the top reasons US workers cited for leaving their jobs. Or consider the findings of LinkedIn&#39;s March 2022 “ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220506202443/https://business.linkedin.com/glint/resources/employee-well-being-report-march-2022">Employee Well-Being Report</a> ,” which found the No. 1 driver of work culture to be “opportunities to learn and grow.”</p><p> Lang said that at ServiceNow, her team is “looking at employee retention and satisfaction with development” and tying those “very, very closely to our employee voice surveys as well” to get a holistic view of the effects of upskilling on retention. She said she saw “quick uptake as we started piloting new soft skills programs.” People have demonstrated keen interest in this type of upskilling at Snap, too: Anderson said employees view it as evidence that the company values them because it&#39;s “demonstrating [its] belief in an individual by investing in them and their development.” She also noted, “These are the types of skills that can help people internally get their own momentum, their own movement, and get their own thoughts put forth in a way in which folks will actually respond.”</p><h4> Strategize about which kinds of jobs to focus on first.</h4><p> Like any organizational change effort, upskilling a workforce requires strategic planning. To help such an initiative gain traction, it&#39;s useful to identify where you&#39;ll see the greatest immediate payoff and plan to concentrate there before you roll things out more broadly.</p><p></p><p> Lang&#39;s group at ServiceNow focuses first on people at the director and senior director levels because they have such a big say in how work gets done day to day and are responsible for keeping employees&#39; efforts aligned with organizational goals. The sooner they&#39;re communicating those goals clearly and framing performance objectives compellingly, the sooner the company will reap the rewards of hitting those targets. Attending to people at the director and senior director levels first also creates a cascade effect, equipping them to share what they&#39;re learning with their teams through one-on-one coaching, mentoring conversations, and even recommendations for courses or other learning content.</p><p> Snap, on the other hand, prefers to upskill front-line managers first, Anderson said. Because she oversees learning in a sales organization, where employees&#39; communication skills have an immediate impact on client relationships, the front line is where she sees the quickest return on investment.</p><h4> Address the time crunch head-on.</h4><p></p><p> Even if an organization&#39;s stakeholders agree that, in an ideal world, they should prioritize helping employees with soft skills, time constraints can make it tough. In the perennial battle between the important and the urgent, the urgent tends to win leaders&#39; attention and resources. Anderson described how what she calls “the here and now” sometimes gets in the way of broader learning goals at Snap: “There have been many classes where folks are like, &#39;I&#39;m so excited. I can&#39;t wait to go.&#39; And they show up, but then they have to drop out.” Work commitments and deadlines often tear people away.</p><p></p><p> One way to address that challenge culturally is by openly acknowledging it and showing how you can accommodate it in your learning schedule and course design. Create the expectation that it&#39;s more than OK for people to engage only as they&#39;re able. Think about dicing up the content into shorter modules or mini-workshops that busy employees can more easily digest. Set aside time in the workday for skill development. Learners need this type of support in the workplace, and the organization benefits too. If executives balk, remind them that making learning doable increases the ROI <em>and</em> shores up employee commitment to the organization in a tight labor market.</p><p> You might need to adjust project deadlines a bit or give people fewer tasks while they&#39;re doing development work so they don&#39;t feel pressure to do their “real” work after hours. Development <em>is</em> real work. Treat it that way as a manager — and discuss it that way with your stakeholders. It&#39;ll be an easier sell if you&#39;ve taken steps to help them see all of the benefits of the investment.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/make-your-case-for-communication-upskilling/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> CEOs Can Make (or Break) an Organization Redesign</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ceos-can-make-or-break-an-organization-redesign/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ceos-can-make-or-break-an-organization-redesign/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 02 Aug 2023 11:00:41 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Herman Vantrappen and Frederic Wirtz. <p><a href="https://akordeon.com/who-we-are/">Herman Vantrappen</a> is the managing director of Akordeon, a strategic advisory firm based in Brussels.

Some redesigns are major companywide overhauls, such as Procter &amp; Gamble&#39;s creation of six industry-based sector business units in 2019, which its CEO described as “the most significant organization change we&#39;ve made in the last 20 years.” <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> Other redesign efforts have a narrower scope, focusing on a particular division, function, or issue.</p><p> For a CEO, organization redesign is different from other large-scale change initiatives. In a corporate strategic reorientation, for instance, the CEO is bound by the decisions of the board of directors and follows a strongly analytical approach. In a functional initiative, such as setting the company&#39;s digital strategy, the CEO can delegate the lead to someone on the management team and assume a supervisory role. But in a corporate organization redesign initiative, the CEO must actively take the lead, both because of the profound impact that the resulting changes will have on the culture and employees and because only the CEO has the all-encompassing view required to reduce the risk of serious unintended and undesirable consequences from any particular redesign choice.</p><p></p><p> We have witnessed many redesign initiatives in our work with organizations over the years and have confirmed that the CEO&#39;s leadership of these efforts is key to their success. But we continue to be surprised by how many CEOs still struggle to get to effective outcomes. We&#39;ve found that plans frequently go astray or run into dead ends despite the abundant and often sensible advice in the management literature. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li> The new CEO of a business services provider wants to reconsider the role of the corporate center and the organization more broadly. Each member of the management team has their own pet idea for restructuring: One is under the spell of self-organizing teams, another is adamant about a framework used at their previous employer, and a third thinks the company should simply be a holding of small regional enterprises. It takes a long time to build even minimal alignment.</li><li> The CEO of a multilateral agency launches an exercise to make the organization less siloed. Heated debate and a couple of offsites with the management team lead to a number of major decisions, including plans for sharing resources and broadening the CEO&#39;s span of control. But after some backroom maneuvering, decisions are undone.</li><li> The founder-CEO of a family-owned engineering and construction company retires, handing over the reins to one of his children. The new leader has plans to professionalize the company&#39;s business processes and governance, but the retired founder keeps finding ways to short-circuit the CEO, undermining any effort to improve the company&#39;s functioning.</li></ul><p> When we looked back on the major organization redesigns we&#39;ve accompanied in the past 30 years (see “The Research”) and reflected on why some initiatives were less effective than others, we recognized that CEOs can fall into one of two traps: failing to use an appropriate framework, and, quite simply, failing to maintain sufficient leadership throughout the process. In this article, we&#39;ll present a systematic approach to organization redesign that CEOs can follow, and address specific behaviors that executives must guard against if they are to retain full ownership throughout the organization redesign and implementation processes.</p><h3> A Framework for Tackling Organization Redesign</h3><p> Many scholars and consultants have developed frameworks that support systematic thinking about organization design. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> The framework we are presenting here emphasizes two aspects that are often underexposed.</p><p> First, the framework recognizes that managers never start with a blank slate when redesigning their organization. There is always an existing organization in place that heavily informs any redesign. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> Even if the existing design has become dysfunctional, there are usually good reasons why it was adopted in the first place, and those reasons shouldn&#39;t be ignored. As a consequence, a good framework needs to incorporate a dynamic link between the past and the future.</p><p>其次，管理文献中当前的大部分建议都集中在计划的上游方面（例如，确定公司的目的、价值观和愿景）或下游方面（例如执行和变革管理）。关于该学科的中游核心——即结构、流程和系统等硬性内容——的讨论较少。一个好的框架应该恢复这个重要的中游部分，同时将其与上游部分（通过考虑变革的驱动因素）和下游部分（通过确保第一天上线做好准备）无缝集成。</p><p>我们通过工作逐步开发的框架旨在通过尊重变革的动态本质并关注硬组织设计变量来克服这两个缺点。从第一条原则出发，它将组织设计思维的各个组成部分整合成一个逻辑流程，从理解组织<em>变革的驱动因素</em>到<em>概念设计</em>的选项、<em>详细设计的</em>可操作性、<em>过渡</em>阶段的实施以及重组的实际<em>执行</em>过程中必要的路线修正。 （参见“组织重新设计指南”。） </p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand-column callout-highlight--transparent"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>组织重新设计指南</h4><p class="caption">该框架将熟悉的构建块集成到逻辑流程中，以指导重组计划。 </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MAG_Vantrappen_Fig1.jpg" alt="组织重新设计指南"></p><p class="attribution">来源：Herman Vantrappen 和 Frederic Wirtz</p></article></aside></div><p>处于组织重新设计前端的首席执行官需要了解此框架中突出的五个总体原则：</p><p> <strong>1. 组织是达到目的的手段。</strong>管理者改变组织设计，期望新的设计能够更好地帮助公司实现其业务目标。该期望基于以下假设：这些目标将明确、得到管理团队的接受、利益相关者的认可，并保持相当稳定。一家目标模糊或波动的公司很可能会经历破坏性的组织重组，而其业绩却没有太大改善。这就是为什么我们的设计框架首先要确定变革的外部和内部驱动因素。</p><p> <strong>2. 最好的设计是不可知的。</strong>可以说，做出组织设计选择比做出业务战略选择更困难。战略选择归结为从各种替代方案中选择一种能够最大化既定目标（例如 EBITDA 增长）的方案。通过战略，领导者权衡可用信息、假设和不确定性、资源限制以及他们自己的风险偏好。组织选择则不然。它们不是来自数学优化，而是来自对支持和反对多种设计方案中每一种的论据权重的判断。这就是为什么设计框架鼓励首席执行官考虑替代组织概念。</p><p> <strong>3.概念设计先于详细设计——只有后者才是参与性的。</strong>在概念阶段，定义了新设计的原则。这些涉及基本的组织变量，特别是架构（例如，集中什么和分散什么）。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a>在考虑替代设计概念后，选择一个并进行详细设计（例如，端到端业务流程中各种功能的角色）。详细设计可以而且应该在管理者和直接相关人员的广泛参与下完成：他们最了解什么是有效的，必须在设计结果范围内运作，并且可以充当变革大使。然而，很少建议在概念设计中采用这种参与式方法，因为概念设计往往需要熟悉公司的（通常仍然是机密的）愿景和战略选择，避免与公司各种职能的命运和速度有关的利益冲突。</p><p> <strong>4. 组织设计通过故意跳跃和紧急跳跃的模式演变。</strong>深思熟虑的战略和紧急战略的概念在战略制定的学科中根深蒂固：在公司深思熟虑的战略的指导下，组织中各级经理每天都会做出无数的决策，逐渐改变该战略的具体形式。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a>在组织设计中也观察到类似的模式：高级管理层有意决定对组织进行重大重新安排（飞跃），之后进行一系列调整（跳跃）以弥补原始设计中不可避免的缺陷。这种跳跃式的模式是完全正常的，甚至是可取的，因为完美的设计是难以捉摸的，而且公司的环境一直在变化。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a>这就是为什么设计框架会显示循环，将缺陷反馈回设计中，以便解决这些问题。</p><p> <strong>5. 设计的证明仅在第一天后才会公布。</strong>第一天是指批准的详细设计投入使用的那一刻，重新设计开始对大量人员的日常运作产生直接影响：他们做什么、如何做以及与谁一起做。为了管理信誉、尊重员工以及对业务的影响，错误应该尽可能少。 <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a>因此，在第一天之前就开始仔细的变革管理流程至关重要。 <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a>任何员工都不应该对自己在重新设计的组织中的地位一无所知。</p><p></p><h3>为什么首席执行官的持续参与很重要</h3><p>在战略制定过程中，首席执行官通过一段时间内的临时干预措施来保持参与可能是完全足够的，例如参加异地高管会议、领导指导委员会或向董事会汇报。另一方面，在组织设计练习中，我们发现最高效的首席执行官几乎每天从开始到结束都密切关注流程的脉搏。</p><p>他们这样做的原因之一是，这为他们提供了形成自己关于适合目的的设计的想法的机会，并可能从根本上改变他们的思维模式。他们花时间让自己的想法成熟，因为没有单一的最佳设计，最终的选择很大程度上是对许多有效替代方案的定性判断。</p><p>他们还始终如一地参与，因为他们意识到组织设计过程是相当无情的。每个阶段都建立在前一阶段做出的选择的基础上，逐渐涉及越来越多的人。在此过程中做出的明确或隐含的微观承诺的数量——关于角色、边界、界限、人员、人数和其他因素——不断增加。不得不回头是痛苦的，部分原因是它是广泛可见的。如果说战略制定就像种树，那么组织设计就像种草：其效果立竿见影、遍及各处，需要引起重视。</p><p></p><p>日常参与的第三个原因是帮助组织内部建立对新设计的认可。高效的首席执行官坚持充分参与有关设计活动结果的沟通，与其说是通过众所周知的“致全体员工的备忘录”，不如说是通过与现场人员交谈。只有全身心投入到实际的设计工作中，他们才能做到可信和令人信服。</p><p>最重要的是，首席执行官每天都会参与这个过程，因为他们认识到人员和互动最终将成就（或破坏）组织。充分参与设计过程为首席执行官提供了独特的机会，可以观察和影响直接报告之外的企业人员方面。</p><h3>领导力弱点如何破坏重新设计</h3><p>在我们观察到的领导者无法完全控制上述重新设计过程的情况下，他们的弱点往往反映出以下四个特征之一：三心二意、绥靖、优柔寡断或无能。我们根据对组织重新设计工作的观察，提炼出以下四种原型：</p><p><strong>半心半意的首席执行官。</strong>虽然战略制定活动的触发点往往很明确，但组织设计活动可能是由某些利益相关者的游说而不是明确的业务需求推动的。在某些情况下，管理团队或董事会成员可能会提出疑虑。首席执行官可能最初并不认为这种担忧很重要，或者倾向于发起变革，但他们可能希望让利益相关者满意，结束辩论，从而同意考虑组织重新设计——私下里认为这些计划不会有任何进展。或者，首席执行官可能对重新设计的动机感到困惑、不清楚或守口如瓶，让项目团队来填补空白。在其他情况下，首席执行官可能会自愿或非自愿地离职。在所有这些情况下，首席执行官在项目开始时都缺乏充分的承诺，导致项目开局不利。</p><p><strong>绥靖的首席执行官。</strong>每一次转型都需要仔细的变革管理，通过深思熟虑的活动将公司从目前的状态转变为期望的未来状态，并帮助人们采用变革。 <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a>然而，首席执行官在邀请人们参与时可能会太过分，这可能会导致流程过于复杂，步骤、参与者和审批点过多。例如，邀请更多评论而不是做出决定并冻结流程可能会拖延设计阶段。旨在表现出倾听意愿的安抚行为通常是出于好意，旨在发挥利益相关者管理的作用，但它也可以反映出首席执行官自己对设计概念的不确定性。</p><p><strong>优柔寡断的首席执行官。</strong>决策无能、无法做出决策或坚持坚定决策的首席执行官虽然很少见，但并未绝迹。一个典型的症状是，首席执行官在后期“在我的尸体上”威胁屈服，而经理不同意经过深思熟虑的执行团队决策。由于担心产生负面影响，首席执行官有时会在最后阶段做出妥协。在这样的组织中，不管首席执行官如何，事情都会发生。</p><p><strong>丧失行为能力的首席执行官。</strong>有缺陷的治理可能会让首席执行官很难在整个过程中掌控重新设计。在首席执行官不兼任董事会主席的公司中，董事会可能会干扰首席执行官对组织重新设计的处理。在私营公司中，退休创始人等有权势的董事会成员可能会干预设计并让首席执行官短路，保护旧的最爱或以其他方式扰乱有序的流程。这种对首席执行官的损害——无论是在概念设计、详细设计还是过渡阶段——通常在较低层次上是可见的，并且具有很高的破坏性。</p><p>计划重新设计组织的首席执行官最好考虑这些领导力薄弱的模式。他们应该根据自己的特质和阻碍其领导力的背景因素来评估自己的脆弱性，然后考虑如何克服这些脆弱性。</p><p>他们可以首先问自己四个问题：</p><ol><li>我完全相信这个倡议吗？</li><li>我会听取正确的人的意见而不让流程偏离正轨吗？</li><li>我是否准备好在需要时做出艰难的决定并坚持下去？</li><li>我能控制我需要拉动的所有杠杆吗？</li></ol><p>这种反省很重要，因为一旦首席执行官了解他们在这一关键变革工作中的领导力可能薄弱的地方，他们就可以努力减轻这些弱点。 （参见“首席执行官如何减少他们的脆弱性。”）想象一下，一位知道自己倾向于安抚的首席执行官。他们可能认识到，在概念阶段，他们应该咨询有限的高级管理人员，在过渡阶段，他们应该采用一种“遵守或解释”流程（当任何与概念设计的偏差必须得到解释和解释时）只有在获得批准该概念的治理机构批准后才能接受）并冻结设计，向员工保证公司将在启动后根据需要进行路线修正。 </p><div

Ransbotham：</strong>学习一门新语言是一个复杂的过程。一家应用程序公司希望人工智能能够帮助实现个性化、情境和动机。了解更多今天的节目。</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani：</strong>我是来自 Duolingo 的 Zan Gilani，你们正在听的是<cite>“我、我自己和 AI”</cite> 。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>欢迎来到<cite>《我、我自己和人工智能》</cite> ，这是一个关于商业人工智能的播客。每集我们都会向您介绍人工智能创新人士。我是 Sam Ransbotham，波士顿学院分析学教授。我还是<cite>《麻省理工学院斯隆管理评论》</cite>的人工智能和商业战略客座编辑。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我是 Shervin Khodabandeh，BCG 的高级合伙人，也是我们人工智能业务的领导者之一。自 2017 年以来， <cite>MIT SMR</cite>和 BCG 一直在人工智能方面进行研究和出版，采访了数百名从业者，并对数千家公司进行了调查，了解如何构建、部署和扩展人工智能能力，并真正改变组织的运营方式。</p><p><strong>萨姆·兰斯博瑟姆：</strong>欢迎。今天，我和 Shervin 与 Duolingo 首席产品经理 Zan Gilani 进行了交谈。我个人对今天的节目感到非常兴奋，因为 Duolingo 的处境非常有趣。在我们的很多节目中，我们最终都会讨论组织如何使用人工智能来增强或改进人类决策，这很棒。但 Duolingo 更进一步，专注于人类如何利用人工智能学习——大规模个性化教育，这对我很有吸引力。无论如何，这对我来说已经足够了。让我们听听Zan的说法。赞，感谢您加入我们。</p><p><strong>赞·吉拉尼：</strong>谢谢。很高兴来到这里。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong> Zan，首先，您能给我们介绍一下 Duolingo 和公司吗？您的角色是什么？</p><p><strong>赞·吉拉尼：</strong>当然。 Duolingo 基本上是一个教授语言的应用程序。我们目前教授 40 多种语言。顺便说一句，这些人中的大多数人都在学习英语，而我们的大多数学习者也在手机上学习，因此 Android 和 iOS 设备也是如此。我们是下载次数最多、使用最多的教育应用程序，无论是语言还是其他方面。我们拥有约 1600 万 DAU（日活跃用户）和 40 多万月活跃用户。我在公司工作刚刚八年，担任实验人工智能团队的首席产品经理。</p><p>我的主要职责是领导这个团队，致力于利用生成式人工智能更有效地进行教学，而且更广泛地说，我帮助公司在生成式人工智能方面取得成功。</p><p>我们现在专门针对生成式人工智能的主要用例之一是新的订阅层。 Duolingo 是一款免费增值产品。使命是提供尽可能最高质量的教育[并]让尽可能多的人[尽可能]获得教育；您所需要的只是互联网连接。所以我们有这个应用程序的免费版本，这是大多数人使用的。这非常好;公司的大多数人都花时间在这上面。然后我们有订阅级别。</p><p>我们最近刚刚推出了一个新的人工智能订阅层，名为 Duolingo Max，我也很高兴介绍其功能。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>所以实验性人工智能……它有点像你的研发实验室，如果你愿意的话？</p><p><strong>赞·吉拉尼：</strong>嗯，我想说的是，实际上公司一半以上的人都在广泛地从事研发工作——所有从事产品工作的人，以及致力于有效学习或教学的人，你可以认为是的，它作为一个实验室。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·霍达班德：</strong>太棒了。也许，对于我们的观众来说，您可以列出正在使用人工智能的各种用例或场所。当然，我的意思是，[除了]许多应用程序都具有的显而易见的个性化和游戏化功能。但请告诉我们人工智能是如何被使用的。</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani：</strong> Duolingo 自该应用程序问世以来就一直在使用人工智能，距今已有十年之久。事实上，它是由卡内基梅隆大学计算机科学教授 Luis von Ahn 和他当时的研究生 Severin Hacker 创立的。目前，它有多种不同的使用方式。例如，在增长方面，大量工作都用于优化通知。</p><p> Duolingo 与其他应用程序的不同之处在于，它确实试图帮助您保持动力。对于我们来说，从教学角度来说，我们认为学习语言最困难的事情实际上是保持动力，因为请记住：这是一件很难做到的事情。自己用手机来做这件事尤其困难——这确实是一件困难的事情。因此，通知以及收到通知的时间、通知所传达的信息确实会影响某人长期坚持使用通知的能力。因此，我们在通知的机器学习上投入了大量精力。</p><p>我们还在内容生成方面使用它，因此我们正在尝试创建有用的、合适的内容；我们也在那里使用它。然后，在该公司的一个独立部门中，即 Duolingo 英语测试，这基本上是学生上大学时必须参加的英语水平测试——有点像托福、托业或雅思的竞争对手；大多数美国人没有经历过这种情况——我们用它来检测作弊行为。我们还使用它在许多不同的地方生成内容。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>这很有趣。该应用程序的实际核心是教你语言，它的动态程度如何？当它适应一个人的学习方式时，它的个性化程度如何？</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani：</strong>个性化发挥了一定作用，但很多体验是由学习科学家和教育内容开发人员策划的。对于大多数人来说，您想要学习的顺序大致相似。例如，每个人都会先学习现在时，然后再学习其他复杂时态。但是，我们使用人工智能进行个性化的地方是专门用于“Birdbrain”的系统，这基本上是我们拥有的一个系统，它针对您将在练习中看到的问题的难度进行优化。</p><p>关于 Duolingo 需要注意的一件事是它是完全互动的。这意味着感觉就像一场游戏。所以每次你学习的时候，你都在回答一个小练习，然后你就会做对或做错。你总是会得到反馈。所以 Birdbrain 的重点是尝试提出一个金发姑娘级别的难度，因为基本上，如果某件事太难，你就会感到沮丧，并且会失去动力。如果某件事太简单了，它就会变得无聊，你就会失去动力。 Birdbrain 是我们特别用于个性化练习的东西之一。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong> Shervin，我认为有趣的一件事是，在描述他的产品时，我们只是认为语音合成、语音识别是理所当然的。这些在10年前都是前卫的东西，而现在昝，你连AI的应用都懒得提了。我认为这有点后退一步，看看现在的情况是正常的。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·霍达班德：</strong>是的。我认为你拥有的一件非常有趣而且可能是独一无二的事情就是你必须拥有的反馈循环的数量。我的意思是，通常，在许多其他应用程序中，当您考虑企业、零售、银行和电信等时，需要一些时间才能获得反馈。而且你几乎可以从很多人那里得到关于如此多的实验或小型实验的即时反馈。也许可以告诉我们更多关于学习速度和算法适应速度的信息。</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani：</strong>这里有一个很好的反映，那就是我们试图将一些有效学习的原则传递到产品本身中。然后，作为一家公司和一个组织，我们也试图按照这些原则运作。当您学习语言时，获得快速反馈确实很重要。但当你致力于产品本身时，这一点也很重要，而且，从很早的时候起，我们基本上就构建了自己的 A/B 测试基础设施，它是产品流程的核心；这是我们在 Duolingo 生产产品的核心组成部分。</p><p>在任何给定的时刻，您都会在非常细粒度的事物上运行数百个实验 - 按钮的位置[指示]页面上我们订阅价格的定价，您经典的面包和黄油实验 -还有巨大的新功能、新标签。基本上，如果这不是一个错误，那么我们可能正在以实验的形式运行它。我们在这方面做得非常非常好、非常老练。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong> Shervin 会翻白眼，因为我要讲一点学术知识，但你是体验式学习的典型案例。事实上，我将在这里给大家介绍一下你们的<a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/">Max 产品</a>，因为我认为其中有两个非常令人兴奋的部分。有角色扮演，它涉及体验式学习的学术、具体经验部分，然后是解释我的答案，这是一种反思性观察和批评。请告诉我们一些关于这两者的信息以及它们如何与学习成果联系起来。</p><p><strong>赞·吉拉尼：</strong>当然。我认为讨论一下在添加这两个功能之前我们所处的位置是有用的。在教学上，Duolingo 一直致力于隐性学习，因此无需明确告诉您“这就是您要学习的内容，这就是它的运作方式”。这就是体验的本质，因为我们认为当你这样做时，它会更加自动化。人们也会因为复杂的语法表等而变得非常沮丧和推迟。然后，第二个是你正在应用程序上学习，并且你正在做这种互动的事情 - 这些几乎是游戏般的练习。</p><p>缺失或限制的两件事是，第一，有些人确实想要解释，如果以正确的数量和方式进行解释，这可能会非常高效和有效。因此，“解释我的答案”是该问题的解决方案，而“解释我的答案”的好处确实只有在现代大型语言模型的帮助下才能发挥作用，即大型语言模型非常擅长为您所犯的错误提供通俗易懂的简明解释。制作。即使对于老师来说，在不使用行话且不花钱的情况下尝试做到这一点也确实很困难。因此，我们可以通过“解释我的答案”很好地做到这一点。它可以给你后续的插图，它可以给你例子——所有这些都可以构成大型语言模型，顺便说一句，对任何试图自学任何东西的人来说都是有好处的。对我来说，这改变了我的生活。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>或者任何想要发表演讲的人。</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani：</strong>或者任何想要发表演讲的人，是的。第二个，角色扮演，最终对大多数人来说，语言学习不是一项学术活动。他们试图将其用作现实世界中的一种技能，而这本身就是一种技能。那么如何赋予人们实践这一能力的能力呢？你如何让他们模拟这个？聊天机器人正是做到这一点的一种方法，因为现在，你所拥有的东西可以在你所处的难度级别上与你交谈，具有无限的耐心，然后也可以在事后真正给你反馈。</p><p>即使人们可以接触到以英语为母语的人（他们通常不会这样做），您仍然需要一个具有无限耐心并且真正能够理解您正在寻找的内容的以英语为母语的人。所以 Roleplay 基本上是在尝试在应用程序中提供这种体验，而不是仅仅拥有像 ChatGPT 这样的文本界面，然后让你来回说话。基本上，我们所做的就是将对话或场景分解为这些小规模的体验，你正在与一个聊天机器人交谈，他将成为咖啡师或你要借东西的朋友，然后你尝试经历一个非常具体、短暂的经历。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>山姆，我有一个问题要问你，因为山姆，如你所知，是一位杰出的教授，他一直在教人们——包括像我这样不在他班上的人——很多东西。所以我的问题，萨姆，是......不过，严肃地说，在你看来，什么才是一个好老师？</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>实际上，Zan 突然提到了几件事，这就是为什么我在他的谈话中感到有些内疚的部分原因。他所说的无限耐心——这非常重要，但也非常困难。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>不切实际。</p><p><strong>萨姆·兰斯博瑟姆：</strong>是的。 And meeting people where they are is a fundamental problem that we have in education. I mean, I sit in front of a room with 35, 40 people, and they are not homogeneous. And meeting people where they are is exactly what Zan was talking about. So, yeah, you have to know the material well, you have to keep people engaged, but you also have to keep track of where people are and what they know — present stuff that&#39;s not too easy and not too hard — and I&#39;m very attracted to this model.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> So, what&#39;s next?</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Well, yeah, that&#39;s exactly where I was going.下一步是什么？ I mean, if we can do this with language, what else can we do this with? Where does it work?</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I meant just for language. So meeting people where they are, having very good knowledge of the student and their progress, and then being able to do role-playing and lots of experiential learning, and being able to explain and guide in a more jargon-free way and in a way that you could repeat it and I don&#39;t have to rush to take notes. I mean, all of these things, right?缺什么？ I&#39;m hearing this and this is better than a regular teacher, it sounds like. But in your view, what is missing for this to be a perfect teacher — in Zan&#39;s view?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> I think we are still a very, very, very long way away from being the perfect teacher, for a number of reasons. I&#39;d also say, we don&#39;t believe, and I certainly don&#39;t believe, that at the end of the day, all you need is a chat interface and most people will be able to get really far with whatever they&#39;re trying to learn. So, to answer the first part about why we&#39;re far away from a teacher, well, some of this, I think, is unknown, but there is a real impact to developing a relationship with another human being when you&#39;re learning.</p><p> There is an emotional part of learning something new, and there is a human connection that can be as simple as the fact that you show up for your tutoring appointments because you don&#39;t want to let your teacher down, to also the fact that that tutor can be really engaging with their facial expressions, with the cadence of their voice, with the illustrations that they can tell, the way they can relate to maybe their own lives.</p><p> So that, we&#39;re still very far away from. And then, when it comes to just “Hey, why can&#39;t a chatbot teach you everything?” for most people, you still have to be organized, and being organized is quite exhausting. For example, just deciding what to eat next is often what you spend all your time doing, or deciding what movie to watch. And, similarly, deciding what to learn next is tough. So someone on the product side has to figure out the right sequencing of things for you to learn.</p><p> Similarly, being creative is exhausting as well. For a real-life tutor, it would be really difficult for them to put on a lot of different personas and do a lot of role-playing. Then you&#39;d need a tutor who is also an amazing actor. And AI gives you the ability to do that with a virtual teacher, but even then, we don&#39;t want a learner to have to come up with these scenarios all the time themselves.</p><p> The last two things I&#39;ll mention is that learning is also multisensory. It&#39;s also contextual. What you&#39;d want, ideally, is some kind of learning and context happening as well instead of just with a chatbot.</p><p> And the last thing to mention is, people really do need a sense of progression in order to stay bought into learning a language, because actual progress is so slow and so incremental, it&#39;s really hard to see. And so what you have to do is, you have to show people progress bars that are filling up, and you have to check in. I think there are probably ways that you could simulate that in a tutor experience, but those are some of the reasons why I think we care about building the experience outside of that as well and building a path that you go along, and all of these other things that go into making Duolingo what it is.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Zan, I want to come back to one thing you were talking about that I&#39;m pretty attracted to, [which] is this idea of figuring out what&#39;s the next thing that you need to learn. I mean, historically, every class that I had in languages, we had a book and we moved from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2. And somebody, somewhere, really thought through the sequence of that.</p><p> But at the same time, I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s necessarily optimal for all students. And we think about recommendation systems and Netflix, or in music; you know, we&#39;ve talked to Spotify, Shervin. This seems like a great opportunity here. What&#39;s the one thing that I could learn right now that would make the most difference? Or what&#39;s the one thing that I don&#39;t know that&#39;s keeping me from opening up this next section? That seems like a huge opportunity.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Yeah. And I would break that into two pieces as well. One of them is just, generally, what&#39;s an effective order to learn in, and what&#39;s an effective order to teach in? And it&#39;s especially useful for people who have some prior proficiency, which is most people who are trying to learn a language in Duolingo — particularly English learners, because they&#39;ve done it in school in some kind of way, and their knowledge is patchy, as we like to say.</p><p> And in those cases, the order is going to be quite different person to person because of different experiences. And then the second aspect of it is the things that you specifically are having trouble with in the moment that you need to focus on more. Maybe you&#39;re just making way more mistakes for a particular concept. Maybe it&#39;s verb conjugations that are the problem, or maybe you just don&#39;t know how to introduce yourself well. And so there&#39;s an opportunity to, say, actually spend more time in that part of the experience.</p><p> It&#39;s not that every curriculum is custom made for a unique student, but it is that where you put your attention and your focus, and the amount you put in, and the order in which you do it in is directed by some kind of tutor. I will say that&#39;s a tough thing to do. It really is a tough thing to do. We&#39;re not there, but that&#39;s part of the dream, certainly.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> So the show is <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> , and we didn&#39;t learn a lot about you and yourself. So maybe tell us a bit about your background — how you ended up in this role, and what the journey was like.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Yes. How far back should I go? Do I start with grandparents?父母？我？</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Up to you.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> OK. I&#39;ll skip the extended biography. I grew up in Karachi, Pakistan. That&#39;s where I was raised, and I came to the US for undergraduate studies. And I actually studied political science and East Asian studies in college because, one, I was interested in languages, so I took Chinese, and when I was learning languages in college, one of the most exciting things was always trying out tools to see what was effective or not.</p><p> So it&#39;s the interest in languages, it&#39;s the interest in technology that got me to Duolingo. And actually, I started in marketing because I&#39;d done some marketing and advertising internships before that. At that time, we were around 50 people at Duolingo, and we went from having just one team that worked on the app to having teams that worked on monetization, learning, and growth. And so I started working on growth as a marketing person, and then, about a year and a half in, I switched to being a product manager. And for most of my time at Duolingo, I have worked on growth, which is to say user retention, whether that&#39;s new users or existing users, growing our presence in Asia; that was super interesting.像这样的东西。 And motivation and what gets people motivated and what keeps them motivated has always just been an interest of mine.</p><p> And then, the switch to working on AI as the focus and leading this Experimental AI team came at the end of last year because, basically, we ended up partnering with OpenAI for their GPT-4 launch. And the reason why we ended up doing this partnership was actually because I knew the product manager for the GPT-4 launch at OpenAI, and when we got together, we quickly realized Duolingo is the perfect use case for the launch, because for the launch, what they really wanted was to show that companies are actually using this to transform their businesses and these are also companies that are trying to do good for the world, etc. And so we, as a company, based on that partnership and getting access to GPT-4 early, shifted a bunch of priorities [and] started really leaning into AI, and one of those things was to start this team that&#39;s trying to work on experimental features.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Very exciting. And actually, from a motivation standpoint, you&#39;ll be thrilled to know that my son is very proud of his Spanish language streak, so …</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Amazing.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> We&#39;ve got a segment where we ask you a series of questions, and these are just rapid-fire; say the first thing that comes to your mind. What&#39;s your proudest moment in AI?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> We, as a company, launching Duolingo Max has been super exciting and just paving the way for a new era of teaching. It&#39;s been created, actually, by the Max team at Duolingo, which is led by Edwin Bodge and Bill Peterson, and it&#39;s super exciting.</p><p> I&#39;d say personally, actually, the first product that my team has been working on is actually — the experiment is going live. You could kind of think of it like TikTok for reading, but it&#39;s something where all the content is generated by GPT-4. It&#39;s giving you a huge breadth of content because people need reading practice in lots of different varieties, and it&#39;s also listening as well. So I&#39;m very excited to see how that goes.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Very cool. What worries you about AI?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> I&#39;m generally very optimistic, but I think the thing that worries me is just that the pace of change is so quick that it will be destabilizing. And the goal for us as a society is to make sure we can stay stable in the face of very, very rapid change, because rapid change is what we want, actually. We want progress to come quickly but without all of the destabilizing effects. So that&#39;s the fear. I think it&#39;s a solvable problem, but that&#39;s the fear.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your favorite activity that does not involve technology?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> I play a lot of soccer. Funnily, there is technology involved with that, as it turns out, but, yes, I play a lot of soccer. That&#39;s one of my favorite activities to do.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So, what first career did you want? Poli-sci, I think you mentioned. What did you want to be when you grew up when you were a kid?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Lots of different things. There was never one answer. I wanted to be a writer, a journalist, a cricket player — a cricketer — and work in international development; I even wanted to be an architect.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> You ran the table there.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Yeah, a lot of different things.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your greatest wish for AI? What are you hoping we can get from this?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> I think AI is the way that we can create the fastest progress, where [by] “progress” here I just mean as many human beings [as possible] are living the lives that they choose to live — that they&#39;re flourishing. I think that is the highest-level goal, and that is the meaning of life for most people. I&#39;m very excited to be part of that effort.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Well, it sounds like you are. Zan, thanks for taking the time to talk to us. I genuinely feel like this is a hugely different and exciting opportunity for how we as humans can get better. And it sounds like Duolingo is doing a lot of that. Thanks for joining us.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Thank you so much.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Thanks for joining us. Next time, Sam and I speak with Jeremy King, senior vice president and head of engineering at Pinterest.回头见。</p><p> <strong>Allison Ryder:</strong> Thanks for listening to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> .

Anyone perusing handbags at a street market knows how common it is to find fake products that look identical to the real thing but might not function the same way. In some cases, this can put consumers at risk: A pharmaceutical company, for instance, discovered counterfeit versions of its product on the black market that contained no active pharmaceutical ingredients. As well, a company&#39;s legitimate product may be diverted for unauthorized sales, as when a global electronics company discovered that distributors in its network, who had ordered components supposedly for customer repairs, were selling them on the gray market.</p><p> High-demand products in every industry are lucrative targets for fraudulent criminal activity. Unfortunately, counterfeit products are a problem that many companies do not want to acknowledge or raise to their boards or shareholders. Senior executives often try to explain away the problem, rationalizing that counterfeiters will always find a way to copy products or that piracy represents only a small percentage of sales and is not worth going after. That plays right into the hands of what counterfeiters want businesses to do: ignore them.</p><p></p><p> When companies do begin to quantify the level to which counterfeiters are affecting their bottom lines, they may attack the problem with piecemeal approaches to try to prevent it from growing. But that&#39;s not enough.</p><p> Our research suggests that successfully combating counterfeits requires the attention of a broad collection of organizational functions. It works best with a multilayered strategy encompassing diverse methods and engaging the entire organization and its partners.</p><p></p><p> We recommend that organizations tackle counterfeiting with a cohesive plan for identifying, containing, and preventing it. This comprehensive process means routinely keeping tabs on contract manufacturers and charting how products move through the supply chain. It includes scoping out what is for sale in consumer markets, deploying covert markings, reviewing warranty claims, educating customers, and partnering with key agencies and competitors.</p><h3> Conventional Tactics Aren&#39;t Working</h3><p> Companies that pay any attention to counterfeiting have traditionally relied on a brand security function to track down criminal activity. These teams often detect counterfeiting using tactics such as applying covert and overt markings on legitimate products, attaching RFID tags that track product locations, and using serialization combined with blockchain to create transaction records that are resistant to tampering. For example, barcodes compliant with the GS1 Global Traceability Standard are used to track COVID-19 vaccines. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> For many organizations, though, these tactics are not enough.</p><p> Counterfeiting and illegal diversion of product remains pervasive: Our 2018 survey of 21 supply chain executives revealed that nearly half had an issue that was ongoing or had experienced an incident in the previous year. More than 70% said they&#39;d had an incident in the previous five years. (See “The Research.”) One executive told us that his company discovered that the equivalent of an entire factory&#39;s monthly production of its products was being sent into black markets, largely due to diversion from one of its own suppliers.</p><p> Counterfeiting has grown into a problem that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says was worth $464 billion in 2019, or 2.5% of world trade. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> It was once thought that counterfeiters went after only high-value or luxury items such as pharmaceuticals, designer handbags, or perfume. But now the marketplace is full of fake footwear, pesticides, cosmetics, toys, automotive parts, and medical equipment. Counterfeiters are targeting any industry and any product line where there is an easy profit to be made.</p><p> While companies may never completely eliminate bad actors from copying products or diverting goods from authorized channels, they can significantly reduce counterfeiters&#39; market penetration and restore lost revenue. Successful approaches may involve cutting off counterfeiters&#39; access to markets, eliminating their supply of unauthorized goods, or making a product more difficult to copy. Here, we&#39;ll go into detail on the three activities that a robust action plan comprises: identification, containment, and prevention.</p><h3> Identification: Gain Insight Into the Extent and Nature of the Problem</h3><p> Getting a baseline on the severity of the counterfeiting problem is a critical first step. As the size of the issue becomes clear, the potential return on investment in shutting it down also comes into view. This can help establish performance metrics for the anti-counterfeiting team that can be aligned with business objectives and outcomes. Examples of metrics include the dollar amount or percentage of revenue lost annually due to illegal product trade, total top-line revenues recovered (dollars that were previously unknowingly lost to counterfeit sales), and the number of confirmed incidents of illicit trade, counterfeiting, diversion, and tampering.</p><p> <strong>Create a cross-functional brand security team.</strong> Developing realistic measures of the current problem often requires an intensive investigation that involves applying market channel analyses that explore multiple sources of sales data and other information from both inside and outside the organization. To be effective, a brand security team should include participants from sales, marketing, operations, purchasing, logistics, finance, and accounting, as well as core brand security functions. Such teams are typically led by a global brand protection officer who in many cases has a law enforcement background and usually reports to the chief operating officer.</p><p> <strong>Examine internal and market data to flush out suspicious activity.</strong> Companies can struggle to find, much less measure, counterfeiting activity, given that clues are usually buried in data about sales, warranties, returns, and other product metrics. Unless someone is looking for it, unusual activity can easily go unnoticed.</p><p> A good first step is to start by looking at what&#39;s being sold online. E-commerce has emerged as a perfect channel to fuel the counterfeit goods industry. Consumers may unwittingly buy products from online retailers that don&#39;t verify the source of the products on their platform and whether they are legitimate. Despite counterfeit sites being shut down regularly by Amazon (and, in China, Alibaba), operators trading in fake goods regularly open up again under a different name the next day. Amazon reported that it blocked 10 billion fake listings and destroyed 2 million counterfeit products in 2020 alone. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p> Since e-commerce sites are frequently a counterfeiter&#39;s primary source of sales, companies can begin by investigating where their products — either genuine or fake — are being sold online. Looking for common attributes of counterfeiter websites can narrow down the pool of suspicious activity. For instance, a company might find four different sellers on Amazon offering an exact copy of its handbag, listing the same details and even photos. An indicator of potential counterfeiters might include spelling or grammatical errors, blurry photos, or other details that don&#39;t look quite right.</p><p> Another important data source is warranty returns. When a consumer sends a product back because it is defective (and counterfeits often are), detective work can track down where it was purchased and how. This can lead to the origin of market entry for counterfeit goods and a starting point to find their downstream source. A global medical products company we looked at hired a global brand protection officer who examined warranty and returns data, field service requests, and sales data. In his first 100 days, he found 1,000 confirmed incidents of illicit trade, counterfeiting, diversion, and tampering. This amounted to $1.4 billion — 2% of revenue — lost annually to illegal product trade.</p><p> Estimating counterfeit sales is a difficult but essential task: Companies must establish a baseline against which to gauge the effects of anti-counterfeit measures. Having an accurate understanding of the scope of the problem is a prerequisite for deciding how much to invest and what ROI to expect from anti-counterfeiting measures. In many cases, business decision makers are unaware of the extent to which their revenue and reputation are in jeopardy.</p><p> <strong>Map the supply and distribution chain.</strong> Many companies are surprised to learn that bad actors are active within their own supply chains. Overproduction, black-market sales, and unauthorized distribution are common sources of leakage that may result in a product, or copies of it, being sold through channels that a company knows nothing about. That&#39;s why an important early step is to identify the manufacturing and distribution channels through which the company&#39;s products travel.</p><p></p><p> The brand owner at a large global apparel company told us that he had heard through his distributor network that the brand was being sold in Mexico even though the company had no authorized retail presence there. To track where these products were coming from, the director hunted down bills of lading and shipping records for the ocean freight shipments that were going to Mexico. The paper trail showed that the goods were shipped from a port in Israel — by the same authorized manufacturer that was producing the company&#39;s branded product in the United States. The apparel company eventually tracked down the clothes, which were genuine products, made under the same specifications and from the same materials, but were being illicitly distributed outside of the contractual agreement between the parties. When the apparel company set up a global brand security function and mapped its entire supply network, it found that similar cases of product diversion were occurring all over the world.</p><p> Analyzing how much is being spent on raw materials in the upstream supply chains is a good place to start mapping a supply base. Procurement can reach out to the accounting team to track all third-party purchases being made on the company&#39;s behalf (a document generally known as a <em>spend analysis</em> ). If a supplier is buying more raw materials and is operating at a higher production level than what the company is ordering, this is a telltale sign that the additional product may be moving into the black market. This requires full visibility into the supply chain, beyond just Tier 1 suppliers (which is increasingly important for other reasons, in particular to manage risk related to labor or environmental violations). Some suppliers may be reluctant to disclose their upstream suppliers for competitive reasons but can be reassured that the query is for security purposes and not an attempt to cut them out of the chain.</p><p></p><h3> Containment: Limit the Problem&#39;s Spread</h3><p> With a dedicated team in place, an initial sense of the problem&#39;s scope, and an understanding of the particular counterfeiting and diversion risks that it&#39;s most vulnerable to, a company can begin to manage the problem systematically in order to contain it.</p><p> <strong>Analyze product segments.</strong> One of the key tasks for the investigation team is segmenting products by channel, margin, volume, and risk of counterfeit activity. This ensures that the team&#39;s attention is being directed toward the most vulnerable market channels first.</p><p> In many cases, a current-state analysis of a company&#39;s supply and distribution processes helps reveal a common set of product segments that counterfeiters go after. In particular, our research found that product lines with high complexity based on the variety of finished products, level of finished-product customization, geographical span of suppliers, number of tiers in the supply chain, predictability of demand, and variation in manufacturing volumes. Examples of items in this category include aircraft and automotive replacement parts, toys, high-end apparel, branded pharmaceutical products, and consumer electronics. Counterfeiters are more likely to opportunistically target product segments characterized by a greater level of complexity and exploit this complexity to their advantage.</p><p> We interviewed executives at a biotech manufacturer who knew that counterfeit products were showing up in the market but did not know the source. The brand protection team started by segmenting products into those that were big targets for counterfeiters (in this case, high-margin items) and analyzing data to estimate the number of incidents per brand. The team — formed through a close collaboration among franchises, brand owners, and regional sales managers — then rolled out a plan to franchise partners and country business units. This established brand protection priorities by product line and provided a system to track customer-reported incidents by brand and conduct data reviews every six months.</p><p> At the same time, analysts began collecting market intelligence on supply chain vulnerabilities, including potential logistics disruptions and the threat of regulatory intervention, that posed significant risks for business plans and growth targets by region. Cumulatively, these efforts helped the manufacturer prioritize those businesses and regions where brand protection could best safeguard market revenue from sudden disruptions. In the process, the team identified a significant counterfeit and diversion activity affecting a blockbuster infusion drug that was putting many patients at risk. The company said it was able to eventually reduce the number of incidents from 100 per year to zero. This required persistent efforts to deduce the source of each incident through detailed analysis and the introduction of countermeasures — including sending a message to counterfeiters warning that they would be pursued, in hopes of convincing them to go look for an easier target.</p><p> This kind of analysis begins with identifying an initial clue and following the thread of activity. The initial problem may manifest itself as a minor issue such as a customer warranty problem, a dealer who seems to be ordering too many replacement parts, or a spate of customer returns on a particular brand of product. Any of these issues may be a hint that leads to a channel of counterfeiting activity.</p><p> <strong>Start with e-commerce sites, and reach out to customs and other authorities.</strong> A team of analysts should be hunting down in-the-open counterfeit operations on e-commerce sites on an ongoing basis and reporting them to the platform operator, such as Amazon, and to law enforcement. At the very least, this introduces more friction into some bad actors&#39; businesses to slow them down.</p><p> Counterfeit products almost always have to cross borders and pass through transshipment points and customs inspections overseen by law enforcement entities. These are critical players in the supply chain, and organizations must think of them as partners in the battle against revenue loss and intellectual property theft. These relationships are particularly important in highly regulated environments, such as pharmaceuticals, food, aerospace, and automotive manufacturing, where counterfeit products can endanger their users.</p><p> An official with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) told us that it can be challenging to get brand owners to understand the CBP&#39;s process and play their part in helping the agency fight the problem. “We are in the field, inspecting containers,” he said. “If a CBP officer opens a container and sees something that looks suspicious, they will first look in our internal database of registered brands. If the officer doesn&#39;t see anything, there is nothing they can do.” Registering brands with the CBP and US Patent and Trademark Office is a critical step in containing counterfeiting.</p><p> <strong>Educate (and warn) customers.</strong> It is imperative that consumers are educated about the possibility and risks of buying fake goods. Companies should make customers aware, through brand marketing, that if they buy from an unverified online third-party seller, they bear the risk of not having the product covered by warranty — or, worse yet, having it fail with dire consequences. One company we know of began adding a statement on its Amazon website warning that products returned to it that were not licensed would not be under warranty. Companies should also emphasize to customers the importance of registering the product serial number for warranty purposes, which protects them if a legitimate product they&#39;ve purchased turns out to be flawed or faulty. If a customer tries to register the serial number for a counterfeit product, it will show up as an error and alert the brand security team to a problem.</p><h3> Prevention: Stop Future Counterfeit Ops Before They Start</h3><p> Once an organization discovers how the spread of counterfeit products in its market channels works and has taken initial steps to contain the problem, it must continue to monitor criminal activity and establish strong preventive measures. There are important roles for numerous functions in the company to play at this stage.</p><p> <strong>Product packaging experts should explore digital tracing technology.</strong> Features in current tracing technologies offer positive product authentication, can indicate tampering, can increase the difficulty of replication, and permit product tracking and tracing. Secure markings — which use a variety of packaging, blockchain, and serial marking technologies — are one method for tracking products. Many industries are working with standards organizations like ASTM International or GS1 to develop common methods for verifying products. This can help avoid the problem where counterfeiters try to copy not just the product but the digital marking, too.</p><p> In the biotech example mentioned previously, the brand protection team worked with the business to identify covert and overt authentication capabilities, which created automatic alerts when counterfeit products were being sold through market channels. The team also created a comprehensive customer communication plan using web advertisements, targeted email and Twitter campaigns, and retailer alerts about the dangers of buying from unauthorized sources. The campaign created awareness in the company&#39;s sales partner network and set the stage to identify where new counterfeit sales were occurring.</p><p> <strong>Quality assurance should review data to track down instances of product problems and returns.</strong> QA can create triggers in its data collection processes that flag potential illegitimate activities. We know of a company that noticed an uptick in its product returns, discovered that the products were not legitimate, and tracked them down to the point of sale — which revealed the source of the counterfeiting.</p><p> <strong>Supply management should step up efforts to audit suppliers.</strong> It can be particularly fruitful to track overproduction by suppliers, as well as how they dispose of products that don&#39;t conform to quality standards — products that can end up moving through black market channels and thus avoiding trade compliance policies. One large apparel company began monitoring the inventory levels within its supplier&#39;s facilities and noticed that the supplier&#39;s inbound raw-material inventories were much greater than the volume of finished goods it was shipping to the company. This was an indication that product was being produced and sold elsewhere through other channels.</p><p> <strong>Logistics should map supply routes to document compliance on the part of transportation providers.</strong> This can help ensure chain of custody along global supply chains, particularly at handoff points such as ports, warehouses, and distribution centers. Companies with multitier distributor channels should document every logistics handoff and conduct random audits to determine whether there are proper security personnel and locked gates at all distribution centers.</p><p> <strong>Human resources might want to consider monitoring employees who are dealing directly with targeted products.</strong> This may include conducting background checks, as well as increasing training to enhance staff awareness. If there is a high level of missing inventory or a sudden increase or drop in product sales, investigations may be required.</p><p> <strong>Aftermarket sales should track warranty claims and parts sales to identify product-quality problems.</strong> As with the quality assurance team, those at the front line of aftermarket sales are in a position to learn that products aren&#39;t performing as expected, which, again, may indicate that counterfeits are entering market channels. For example, a large retailer made the decision to limit its distribution channels and authorized resellers, recognizing the high potential for counterfeit products in these particular sales channels, especially e-commerce.</p><p></p><p></p><p> Counterfeiting and product diversion are not crimes that a single organization can combat. They require the diligence of brands, retailers, packaging companies, and logistics businesses. This is a rare instance where joining with competitors can yield important insights. Companies should consider joining a consortium and partnering with industry counterparts. Industry-specific groups include the Automotive Anti-Counterfeiting Council for vehicle manufacturers and Rx-360 for pharmaceutical companies. Members of React, a large anti-counterfeiting network, include Marvel Entertainment, Mattel, Pfizer, Philips, Prada, and Timberland.</p><p> Counterfeiting is also not just a private-sector supply chain problem. Labor and human rights advocates, consumer education agencies, customs agents, federal and state law enforcement agencies, local police, and consumers of counterfeit products all have an interest and role in ferreting out unauthorized activity. While counterfeiting and product diversion cannot be eliminated, dedicated efforts can curtail both significantly.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/taming-the-counterfeiting-epidemic/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Dismantle Career Roadblocks for More Equitable Outcomes</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/dismantle-career-roadblocks-for-more-equitable-outcomes/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/dismantle-career-roadblocks-for-more-equitable-outcomes/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 11:00:51 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Haig R.

Women and people of color continue to face obstacles advancing to more senior roles and are frequently not positioned to succeed in the same ways as their White male counterparts.</p><p> That was the message from Haig R. Nalbantian, cofounder and coleader of the Workforce Sciences Institute, during <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/series/work-23-the-big-shift/">Work/23</a> , an <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> symposium held in May 2023. Nalbantian helps organizations apply evidence-based, empirical methods to strengthen their DEI efforts and retention strategies and asserts that “the surging use of analytics in the HR domain to inform work and workforce management” is a big part of the future of work.</p><p></p><p> While talent and drive are important in shaping careers, situational factors profoundly affect what happens to employees at work. They include employees&#39; access to “accelerator” roles, such as customer-facing jobs; how employees navigate flexible work arrangements, such as part-time status; and employees&#39; reporting relationships, such as whether they report to higher-level or high-performing supervisors. Nalbantian noted that these easy-to-identify circumstances, which he called <em>explained differences</em> , are prevalent.</p><p></p><p> Many organizations also have pervasive and sizable <em>unexplained disparities</em> regarding who gets chosen for promotions. Nalbantian said that in both his own studies and others, “women are actually more likely to be highly rated” by their managers at elite, large employers — all things being equal — “but in the majority of companies, they&#39;re less likely to be promoted.”</p><p> He said it is critical that companies address the explained differences and explore the unexplained disparities.</p><p> Nalbantian wasn&#39;t able to get to all of the questions from attendees during the event, so he answers some of them below. (Questions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity.)</p><h6> Does your research address intersectionality in its analysis? You talked about women and people of color, but what about women of color and other people with multiple intersecting minority identities?</h6><p> In many of the client cases covered in my study, we did indeed examine intersectionality directly. We&#39;ve done this quite a bit in larger US-based organizations that have adequate populations of these demographic groups for modeling purposes.</p><p> One of the areas of particular interest to client organizations is intersectionality with respect to reporting relationships. That is, do the specific demographics of one&#39;s supervisor affect whether the employee is promoted, is highly rated, or gets higher pay increases? For example, do White male supervisors treat Black female reports worse than White male or White female reports? Do White female supervisors help the prospects of their female reports, regardless of color?</p><p> I can say that there are few regularities in these results — certainly far less than the results I&#39;ve reported with respect to performance ratings, roles, supervisor performance and level, and flexible working.</p><p></p><h6> Has this research mapped across socioeconomic status as an intersectional influence?</h6><p> Unfortunately, we&#39;ve had much more limited data on socioeconomic factors, in part because most of our clients focus these studies on their salaried populations, ignoring their hourly workers. This concerns me, as it reveals a tendency to discount front-line workers. I try to remind organizations that what happens in their front-line ranks can have a major impact on business results. I&#39;ve seen and documented this in client assignments. Still, the tendency of organizations is to prioritize their salaried employees — professionals, managers, and executives.</p><h6> You mentioned that being younger than comparable peers is an attribute favorable to success. Can you elaborate more on what your studies have found regarding age inequalities?</h6><p> The negative impact of age is close to universal among our analytical findings with client organizations. The simple fact is that once an employee gets beyond the median age of their cohort, all things turn negative: They&#39;re less likely to be promoted, they&#39;re less likely to receive a high performance rating, and their pay growth levels off or declines.</p><p> The one positive is that there is less turnover with older employees, often substantially less. Indeed, it may be that it is precisely because older employees tend to stay that employers don&#39;t feel the need to promote, pay, or recognize them in the same way as they do their younger employees. The latter have more outside opportunities, so they may need to be constantly wooed.</p><p></p><p> These negative signals about older workers can be very misleading. We often find that groups with more older workers actually outperform those with more younger workers. There&#39;s a discordance between what&#39;s found at the individual level compared with the group or organizational level.</p><p> This suggests that the productivity of older workers shows up not in their own measures of individual performance but in the performance of those with whom they work. We call this a <em>spillover effect</em> . So, for example, if older workers are less likely to turn over, they can cause their younger colleagues to follow suit, thereby bringing more stability to their work groups and making them more productive. For more evidence about the productivity of older workers, see the recent study I conducted with Richard A. Guzzo and Nicholas L. Anderson, which we discuss in the article “ <a href="https://academic.oup.com/workar/article/8/2/208/6574297">Age, Experience, and Business Performance: A Meta-Analysis of Work Unit-Level Effects</a> ” in the journal <cite>Work, Aging and Retirement</cite> .</p><h6> How can organizations ensure that age diversity and inclusion are integrated into their equity and diversity initiatives?</h6><p> Again, it is a common view among business leaders that older workers are less productive. And because they tend to cost more, they are viewed more as a liability than an asset, despite significant evidence to the contrary. For some reason that I find hard to explain, combating ageism is not high on the DEI agenda, certainly not as compared with efforts to address gender and racial inequity. I fault the DEI community for not being more aggressive on this front.</p><p> The aging workforce is a fact of life almost everywhere. Organizations that don&#39;t deal effectively with the repercussions of this secular trend and ensure that they are managing their older workers effectively run the risk of undermining organizational performance. In effect, they may make their unfounded stereotypes a self-fulfilling outcome.</p><p></p><p> I always urge my clients to undertake the kind of disciplined diagnostic work to evaluate the realities of their own workforce — to determine whether spillover effects are indeed at work in their organization, and to respond accordingly. Through this process, many of them will find that they have an asset to protect rather than a liability to discard.</p><h6> Is there any analysis done on the correlation between company performance or share price and the situations demonstrated by the survey?</h6><p> I&#39;ve undertaken client studies in which we link workforce characteristics and management practices to various business outcomes, including profitability, financial and operational productivity, revenue growth, and customer retention, among others. Our results have been mixed. In some, we&#39;ve seen that greater diversity in work group or unit composition improves business performance; in others, we&#39;ve found no effect or statistically negligible results. The most robust review and synthesis of the results of these studies is the meta-analysis of the effects of age and tenure noted above. That study did not focus on the effects of race and gender.</p><h6> What concrete steps can organizations take to battle these biases?</h6><p></p><p> My article in the summer 2023 issue of <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> , “ <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/opening-access-to-the-fast-track-for-career-equity/">Opening Access to the Fast Track for Career Equity</a> ,” speaks directly to this question. I explain how organizations can use the results of this kind of modeling to help eliminate or reduce the influence of demographics on how well employees are positioned to succeed at work. The reality is that all too often, situational factors inordinately affect the ability of employees to succeed and that women and people of color are situationally disadvantaged.</p><p> Employers who recognize that they are not positioning this talent to succeed can deploy an approach I call <em>proactive career management</em> to change this reality on the ground. This may involve getting more women and people of color into supervisory or other accelerator roles, changing reporting relationships, and neutralizing the negative effects of flexible working, among other things. I share a case study in my article to illustrate this approach in action.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/dismantle-career-roadblocks-for-more-equitable-outcomes/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Do Consumers See Your Business as a Force for Good?</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/do-consumers-see-your-business-as-a-force-for-good/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/do-consumers-see-your-business-as-a-force-for-good/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 11:00:04 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Cynthia E.

Companies such as Burger King, KFC, and McDonald&#39;s have all been recent targets of government and investor pressure to cut plastic waste. Last year, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2022/04/55-million-total-ftc-settlements-kohls-and-walmart-challenge-bamboo-and-eco-claims-shed-light">both Kohl&#39;s and Walmart</a> reached settlements of $2.5 million and $3 million, respectively, for falsely claiming that dozens of rayon textile products were actually made from environmentally friendly bamboo.</p><p> When such large, visible companies issue false claims or fail to act, it results in missed opportunities, a growing performance-expectation gap, and, eventually, reputational damage among consumers. So, what makes a business a force for good when it comes to the future of our environment? To find out, Bentley University and Gallup recently conducted a survey of 5,757 Americans to assess how they feel about business and its potential to have a positive impact on society and the environment. The <a href="https://www.bentley.edu/news-Announcing-the-Bentley-Gallup-Force-for-Good-survey-results">results of the Force for Good survey</a> highlight areas in which businesses, small and large, are failing to meet people&#39;s expectations — and how they can do better.</p><p></p><p> The public&#39;s expectations of large companies like Kohl&#39;s, McDonald&#39;s, or Walmart were made clear in our research. A slight majority of our respondents (53%) said that businesses overall have a negative environmental impact. Almost two-thirds (65%) said they feel this way about <em>large</em> businesses, whereas 16% said that <em>small</em> businesses have a negative impact on the planet/environment. Younger respondents in our study had higher expectations of businesses overall, with a whopping 81% of those age 18 to 29 saying that large businesses have a negative impact on the planet, compared with 54% of respondents age 70 or older.</p><p> Drilling down into the data, we found that more than 9 in 10 respondents rated four social and environmental concerns that businesses could act on as extremely or somewhat important: practicing sustainable manufacturing (92%); promoting increased access to education and training (92%); investing time and money into local communities (92%); and operating in a way that is sustainable for the environment (91%). Just 1 in 3 people surveyed said that businesses are currently doing an excellent or good job in any of these areas, and about 1 in 4 (26%) said that businesses are doing an excellent or good job of operating in an environmentally sustainable way.</p><h3> The T-Shirt Experiment</h3><p> One perspective on sustainability is that companies should practice environmental responsibility for the greater good — the “doing good to do good” perspective. Another approach focuses on the importance of “doing good to do well” so that both business and society benefit from leaders&#39; actions. But are these approaches in tension? Need they be?</p><p> One section of the Force for Good survey — what we called our T-shirt experiment — was aimed at getting a better read on how people think about this tension. Amid rising prices for almost everything, we asked whether respondents would be willing to pay extra for a T-shirt depending on a variety of company characteristics. Sixty-three percent of respondents said they would be willing to pay extra — 82% more — for a T-shirt if the company that made it was known for having a positive impact on the environment. The numbers are even higher for respondents age 18 to 29 and for women: Young people were most likely to say they would pay more — about 8 in 10 — and almost 7 in 10 women. (See “Results of the T-Shirt Experiment.”) Both of these consumer groups are key markets for many companies.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Results of the T-Shirt Experiment</h4><p class="caption"> To differing degrees, depending on age and gender, respondents indicated their willingness to pay more for the same product based on a business&#39;s sustainability practices. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-07-26_Clark_fig1-1.png" alt="Results of the T-Shirt Experiment" /><br /></article></aside></div><p> When people were asked how much they would pay for the T-shirt without being given any additional information, the median response was $10. This held true for those with personal incomes between $24,000 and $179,000. In other words, personal income had little effect on the value they assigned to the product.</p><p></p><p> Respondents were then asked how much more they would pay if the company were known for various attributes: having a positive environmental impact, making a positive impact on the local community, treating employees well, and contributing to charities. Among the four attributes, the premium was highest for companies known to have a positive environmental impact, with a median response of $7.</p><p> Our data indicates that Americans are, in fact, willing to reward companies for doing good. A company known for positive environmental performance can charge more for its products — evidence that “doing good to do well” works.</p><p></p><h3> A False Dichotomy?</h3><p> Most of the respondents didn&#39;t see a trade-off between good environmental performance and good financial performance. In other words, they believe that both can happen concurrently, despite business leaders&#39; arguments that sustainable practices harm financial performance. About 7 in 10 respondents (69%) said businesses that prioritize making a positive impact on society are just as profitable (47%) or more profitable (22%) than their competitors. People who said they have expertise in owning, leading, or managing a business were no less likely than those without such expertise to say that businesses that prioritize making a positive impact are at least as profitable as their competitors.</p><p> Members of different political parties had notable differences of opinion regarding the importance of sustainability. For example, 84% of Democrats said it is extremely important for businesses to operate in an environmentally sustainable manner, compared with 31% of Republicans and 59% of independents. However, a large majority of Republicans (80%) said that sustainability is at least <em>somewhat</em> important. These perspectives might affect a host of company actions, such as choosing content and spending amounts for advertising in red versus blue states and the very design of their products.</p><p></p><p> Likewise, we found significant differences across ethnic identities. Seventy percent of Black respondents, 82% of Asian respondents, 65% of Hispanic respondents, and 59% of White respondents said they believe it is extremely important for businesses to operate in an environmentally sustainable manner. When asked how they feel about focusing on long-term benefits like those for the environment versus short-term benefits like profits, 77% of Asian respondents said they are likely to support that focus — compared with 56% of respondents overall. The figures for both Black and Hispanic respondents hovered around 60%.</p><p> Even when we asked the question in a slightly different way, respondents did not see it as a trade-off but as more of a “both and” situation. For example, when asked about meeting the financial goals of investors, 79% said they believe it is somewhat or extremely important. Eighty-eight percent of respondents also said that making the world a better place is somewhat or extremely important.</p><h3> How Can Your Company Become a Force for Good?</h3><p> Results from this deep dive into what a broad and varied set of Americans believe suggest several actions companies can take or plan for.</p><p> <strong>Pay attention to your local footprint.</strong> Small companies are perceived as better at most stakeholder-related activities. Respondents were twice as likely to say small businesses positively impact people&#39;s lives than large businesses (82% and 41%, respectively). What&#39;s more, respondents are more likely to think large businesses have a negative impact on Americans&#39; lives in general (38%) than they are to say the same about small businesses (4%). This data, combined with the results across age and gender in the figure below (see “Sustainability Is Important to Consumers — but Are Businesses Practicing It?”) on positive community impact, suggests that companies — particularly large ones — should improve their relationships with their surrounding communities.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Recognize that younger Americans expect more.</strong> Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) and Gen Zers (born between 1997 and 2012) expect more from businesses in terms of both social and environmental responsibility than older respondents do. In our T-shirt experiment, 82% of respondents age 18 to 29 were willing to pay more for a T-shirt from a company known for having a positive impact on their local community. Again, young respondents (73%) agreed more than any other age group that businesses&#39; efforts to reduce their carbon footprints and/or emissions are important. Companies will need to account for their environmental stewardship among their customers and future employees.</p><p> <strong>Mind the performance-expectation gap.</strong> Environmental stakeholders and regulators are on the lookout for any discrepancy between expectations of a company&#39;s responsible environmental management and what it is actually doing — the performance-expectation gap. The vast majority of respondents (89%) said businesses have “a great deal” or “some” power to make a positive impact on people&#39;s lives, but just 57% said that businesses are very or somewhat effective at doing so. In terms of the environment, the findings revealed performance-expectation gaps of at least 30 percentage points between “the importance of” and “the performance of” several environmental goals. On questions about reducing businesses&#39; carbon footprints, engaging in sustainable manufacturing, and making the world a better place, we found considerable gaps: On those three points, 52% to 57% of respondents indicated that it is extremely important for businesses to do so, but only 24% to 28% thought they are excellent or good at it.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Sustainability Is Important to Consumers — but Are Businesses Practicing It?</h4><p class="caption"> There is a considerable gap between respondents&#39; opinions on the importance of sustainability practices and their perceptions of businesses&#39; actual practices. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-07-26_Clark_fig2.png" alt="Sustainability Is Important to Consumers — but Are Businesses Practicing It?" /><br /></article></aside></div><p> While having a dedicated sustainability leader, support from senior management, and education for employees and executives is necessary, it&#39;s important to stay vigilant in addressing the widening performance-expectation gap. In what has become a hypercritical business environment, leaders must pay greater attention to how perceptions of what their company is doing compare with what they are actually doing.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Set sustainability goals.</strong> Think carefully about how to measure what you&#39;re doing. This is a logical next step after gaining the support of senior management, and it can help your company determine the progress it has made and where it has soft or blind spots. In fact, regulators have proposed requiring companies to disclose how they set climate-related targets and measure their progress toward meeting them. Consider signing on to broadly recognized and accepted goals like the United Nations Global Compact&#39;s (UNGC&#39;s) <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/">Sustainable Development Goals</a> , which can help your company publicly commit to a plan of action, step by step. The UNGC also requires annual statements on progress to help ward off greenwashing.</p><p></p><p> With increasing attention on environmental sustainability, gaining an understanding of how various stakeholders perceive your statements and actions is vital. By identifying and understanding current perceptions and their implications, as the Bentley-Gallup study does, companies can amend their environmental commitments and processes to ensure that they invigorate their efforts to be a force for good, which will benefit the company, its stakeholders, and, most importantly, the environment.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/do-consumers-see-your-business-as-a-force-for-good/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Myth of the Mainstream</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-myth-of-the-mainstream/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-myth-of-the-mainstream/#comments</comments><pubDate> Mon, 24 Jul 2023 11:00:22 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Marcus Collins. <p>Marcus Collins is a clinical marketing professor at the University of Michigan&#39;s Ross School of Business and former head of strategy at Wieden+Kennedy New York.

The brand had become a symbol of food choices that were driving escalating rates of obesity and hypertension.</p><p> The company spent more than a decade trying to fight this perception among American consumers by targeting them with messaging about its updated menu, which offered healthier alternatives more in line with contemporary diet trends — but to no avail. Year over year, McDonald&#39;s sales declined, and its brand perception continued to spiral downward.</p><p></p><p> Finally, the company decided to go on the offensive. Instead of combating the opposition&#39;s hate and attempting to win over those in the middle, McDonald&#39;s decided to focus on its fans — the people who self-identify as McDonald&#39;s devotees despite the vitriol directed at the brand. The company&#39;s tactics included launching its Famous Orders campaign, which celebrated the favored menu items of superstar fans (like hip-hop mogul Travis Scott and K-pop megastars BTS); creating adult-targeted Happy Meals; and promoting fans&#39; own menu hacks. In doing so, it tapped into what these devotees love about McDonald&#39;s and not only activated their collective consumption but also inspired them to spread the word on behalf of the brand. The result of this strategy was a 10.4% increase in global revenue for McDonald&#39;s from 2018 to 2021 and the return of dormant customers: more than a quarter of those who came in to buy the Travis Scott meal, for example, hadn&#39;t visited the chain in over a year. Seemingly overnight, McDonald&#39;s went from being a cautionary tale to the darling of brand marketing and a case study for advertising effectiveness.</p><p></p><p> What&#39;s going on here? Conventional wisdom would tell us that in a world of increasingly polarized opinions, our best bet is to appease the middle, if only because that&#39;s where the majority of the market is. That also seems like a safe bet to many companies, as a middle-of-the-road position is less likely to alienate potential customers. But McDonald&#39;s demonstrated what can happen when you dismiss this conventional approach. Instead of trying to speak to the mass market, it chose a side. It chose to embrace the love instead, fighting the hate, and it abandoned the notion of enticing the large but indifferent middle of the market. By doing so, McDonald&#39;s marketing efforts activated a legion of fans who not only consumed but also won over others as well. What McDonald&#39;s realized is an important lesson for contemporary marketers: If you want to get people to move, you must choose a side. The notion that you can win by playing to the middle is a misleading myth.</p><p></p><h3> Choose a Side</h3><p> The core function of marketing is to influence people to adopt a desired behavior. That is to say, we go to market to get people to move — to buy, to vote, to recycle, to subscribe, to download, to watch, to evangelize, to wear a mask — and to drive a host of other desirable behavioral outcomes that will benefit our organization or interests. And what influences people the most? Well, according to everything we know about human behavior, we are most influenced by other people — not ads, not value propositions, but other people. More specifically, we are most influenced by <em>our</em> people: the individuals who abide by the same culturally established conventions and expectations that dictate what is considered acceptable behavior for people like us. These individuals typically share a similar worldview and, therefore, adhere to a shared way of life in an effort to promote social solidarity among themselves — their subculture. They consume the way the subculture consumes, vote the way it votes, and behave the way it behaves, because that is what is expected of people like them.</p><p> If these people are against you because of the shared conventions and expectations of people like them (their culture), then the likelihood of getting them to take action on your behalf will be slim. That&#39;s why right-wing Republicans won&#39;t bother trying to convert left-leaning Democrats. Instead, Republicans speak to their base — the collective of people who see the world similarly, express a similar set of cultural characteristics as the brand, and are more inclined to move in step with the brand as an act of social solidarity. They identify as members of this group and follow its behavioral norms.</p><p> Those in the unaffiliated middle of the population, on the other hand, are by nature indifferent and risk averse. While they may have opinions, they lack strong convictions in either direction and are therefore less likely to take action. In politics, they don&#39;t vote in primaries or campaign for candidates; instead, they sit on the sidelines and wait to see how things shake out. Their behavior is the same when it comes to brands.</p><p> The middle doesn&#39;t adopt new products with any urgency. They are not the first to respond to marketing communications, nor are they likely to weigh in on a debate between advocates and detractors. They mitigate their own risk of moving out of step with what might be considered generally acceptable by stepping back and observing other people&#39;s responses first.</p><p> The red herring is that we perceive this indifference as an opportunity to persuade them to one side or the other. But the truth is, they are not typically convinced by any marketing communications. Instead, they, too, take cues from other people — sometimes those who are for you, and at other times those who are against you.</p><p></p><p> With this in mind, it becomes abundantly clear that in a polarized scenario, the chances of marketers getting people to move are far greater when we activate the collective of the willing as opposed to trying to convince detractors or even persuade the indifferent. And yet, historically, marketers have focused their efforts on the middle because it represents the biggest market opportunity. However, our chances of successfully influencing behavior increases when we choose to address the people who are most likely to take action. When we do so effectively, we catalyze a propagation effect that causes the product, behavior, or idea to cascade throughout the population, thanks to the process of social contagion — the spread of affects, behaviors, cognitions, and desires due to direct or indirect peer influence of people “like us.”</p><h3> The Power of Propagation</h3><p> The idea of propagation demands that marketers leave behind the conventional approach of targeting the middle, where the majority of the population resides. Besides being of questionable effectiveness, as discussed above, reaching the middle requires costly media spending (think prime-time TV and Super Bowl ads) and places marketing messages in an arena that is noisy and saturated with competing messages. Marketers pay little attention to the fringe, a population that conventional wisdom tells us is too small and too niche. But everything that is now mainstream once started on the fringe: It started within a subculture and propagated out to become popular culture.</p><p> For instance, if you were into comic books 20 years ago, you would have been considered a nerd. Today, however, many of the most-viewed movies across the globe, such as Marvel&#39;s <cite>Avengers</cite> series, originated from comics. Twenty years ago, if you were into video games, you would have been perceived as an immature adult. Today, gaming is not only considered cool but is also a multibillion-dollar industry. Indeed, what is now normal was once fringe. Thanks to social contagion, the cultural characteristics of a community propagate from the fringe to the middle — from the subculture to popular culture. It happens from the outside in, not the inside out.</p><p></p><p> Unlike traditional marketing communications, the reach and subsequent adoption that is achieved through this kind of propagation does not rely on people hearing a message from a company or brand. (It helps, but it&#39;s not necessary.) Instead, people hear about it from someone they trust — someone like them — which increases their likelihood of adoption. As the network scientists Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler contended, “When a small group of people begin acting in concert — displaying similar visible symptoms — the epidemic can spread along social network ties via emotion contagion and large groups can become quickly emotionally synchronized.” This is the network effect that is catalyzed when you activate the collective of the willing. Don&#39;t focus on the middle: Focus on the people who see the world the way you do. Choose a side, and they will convince the bystanders, the passive, the indifferent.</p><p></p><p> Although broadcast messaging might get our attention, it&#39;s the influence of people like us, people with whom we identify, that changes our outlook and, subsequently, our behaviors. This provides a new perspective, and corresponding strategies, for marketers who aim to communicate with consumers in a culture where ideological binaries seem to divide the market. Like McDonald&#39;s did, marketers benefit from choosing a side that is most likely to move and then activating its members so that they might convert people on the brand&#39;s behalf. Status quo practices position the middle as a safe bet. However, the dynamics of cultural diffusion subvert these long-standing best practices for connecting with consumers and influencing behavioral adoption, and demand that today&#39;s practitioners develop new strategies and accompanying tactics.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-myth-of-the-mainstream/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 1</slash:comments></item><item><title> Sustainability Progress Is Stalled at Most Companies</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/sustainability-progress-is-stalled-at-most-companies/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/sustainability-progress-is-stalled-at-most-companies/#comments</comments><pubDate> Thu, 20 Jul 2023 11:00:23 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[CB Bhattacharya and Rob Jekielek. <p>CB Bhattacharya is director of the Center for Sustainable Business and the HJ Zoffer Chair in Sustainability and Ethics at the Katz Graduate School of Business at the University of Pittsburgh.

This means that they have endowed their employees with a sense of sustainable ownership, spurring them to engage in more sustainability-supporting behaviors. When every employee integrates environmental and social concerns into every business decision, sustainability progress is accelerated — an aspirational goal for all companies.</p><p> To shed light on the state of play in embedding sustainability and identify key bottlenecks, the Center for Sustainable Business at the University of Pittsburgh collaborated with The Harris Poll to conduct a survey of US employees. We wanted to find out whether their employers were taking measures that our earlier research had identified as important to prompting employees to conduct business through a sustainability lens. Our survey drew responses from 1,056 employees, representative of the US employee base. We defined sustainability for the respondents as “integrating environmental and societal concerns into business decisions and actions.”</p><p></p><p> We asked respondents to rate their level of agreement with a series of 19 statements about the status quo, such as “My company has a clear business case for improving our sustainability performance,” on a 4-point Likert scale (from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”). We also presented respondents with a series of 12 issues that could pose challenges to sustainability progress, such as “Sustainability is not built into our business strategy,” and asked them to rate the extent to which that is an actual challenge at their company (from “major challenge” to “not at all a challenge”).</p><p> Roughly one-third of the respondents asserted that their employers have made significant strides in their sustainability journeys. Although that number might sound low given the enormity of the task facing us, the good news is that there is momentum, which we can help accelerate by pointing out the roadblocks as perceived by employees. Below, we provide six key recommendations that emerged from our data for managers seeking to embed sustainability in the organizational culture and business models.</p><p> <strong>Establish a purpose based on values.</strong> Purpose is a business&#39;s raison d&#39;être — the answer to the all-important question, “Why do we do what we do?” Paul Polman, former CEO of Unilever and a leader in the corporate sustainability movement, has said, “Sustainability is totally driven by purpose.” <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> Organizations that are successful at embedding sustainability articulate the societal benefit they aim to deliver to their stakeholders, and this overarching purpose guides everything the organization does.</p><p> In our study, 36% of the respondents strongly agreed with the statement “My company wants to make a difference in people&#39;s lives, not just make profits,” while 33% strongly agreed with “My company has a higher purpose beyond profit maximization.” If purpose is the starting point for sustainability, we aren&#39;t doing very well; it is apparent that the profit-maximization narrative is alive and well. Consistently, 43% of employees cited short-term focus, a lack of investor interest, and, importantly, “Our leaders don&#39;t believe in sustainability,” as challenges. Unless CEOs and top management teams realize that profit is the <em>consequence</em> of value creation for all stakeholders and not the starting point for strategy development and execution, progress will be stifled. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p></p><p></p><p> <strong>Bake sustainability into corporate strategy.</strong> Academic researchers and others have noted that efforts to make meaningful progress toward sustainability must be driven by corporate strategy. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> Doing so increases the likelihood that, over time, “doing the green thing” will be seen as a normal part of employees&#39; jobs, and more and more decisions will be made through the lens of sustainability. With only 29% of respondents strongly agreeing with the statement “My company has a clear business case for improving our sustainability performance” and 27% with “Sustainability is core to how my company executes our business strategy,” it appears that we have a long way to go. Consistent with the status quo, 43% agreed that their company&#39;s failure to build sustainability into its business strategy represents a challenge.</p><p> <strong>Train employees, and incentivize actions that advance sustainability.</strong> Companies that are successful in engaging their workforce have invested in training that gives employees guidance on how to improve sustainability. With only 30% of employees surveyed strongly agreeing with the statement “I understand how I can improve my company&#39;s sustainability performance through my role,” there seems to be a dearth of role-specific knowledge at the individual employee level. Lack of training was cited as a major/moderate challenge by 44%, while a similar number (45%) indicated that they don&#39;t know what actions to take to improve sustainability performance. Companies need to invest more in training and sustainability knowledge creation so that employees know <em>what</em> they can do in their roles and <em>how</em> to do what needs to be done.</p><p> Managers must also do more to provide employees with incentives to advance the sustainability agenda: Forty-nine percent of those surveyed found the lack of such incentives to be a major or moderate hurdle to improving sustainability performance. Leaders should also consider whether the management culture encourages engagement and intrinsic motivation by giving employees the autonomy to solve sustainability challenges, which often require creative thinking. However, when we asked survey respondents to rate their level of agreement with the statements “My company allows me to make a lot of sustainability-related decisions on my own” and “My company gives me a chance to use my personal initiative or judgment in carrying out sustainability initiatives,” we found that, at most, 29% of respondents strongly agreed.</p><p> <strong>Create a sustainability culture in your organization.</strong> Managers can keep sustainability salient in the organizational culture by communicating progress, celebrating milestones, recognizing achievements, and collaborating on solutions both internally and with industry partners. Our research has identified the lack of a sustainability culture as one of the biggest impediments to progress, with 48% of respondents indicating that that is a major or moderate impediment at their organization. Communicating sustainability progress to employees is a key component of a sustainability culture, because it keeps issues top of mind. Celebrating successes will pique employee interest and legitimize the importance of sustainability to the organization — but only 31% of respondents strongly agreed that their company celebrates sustainability successes.</p><p></p><p> Collaborating with traditional competitors — which is increasingly necessary to address those complex “ <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/tragedy-of-the-commons-impact-on-sustainability-issues">tragedy of the commons</a> ” problems — signals to employees that the company is serious about transformational change and reinforces the culture to employees. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> With only 25% of survey respondents strongly agreeing with the statement “My company collaborates with other organizations to address complex sustainability issues,” it is evident that much work is required to open corporate leaders&#39; eyes to the potential of progress via collaboration.</p><p> <strong>Conduct business through a sustainability lens.</strong> Imagine the progress we would make if every employee in every company — from the mailroom to the boardroom — integrated environmental and social issues into every business decision they made. This, in our view, is conducting business through the lens of sustainability — an aspirational but necessary goal to reach if we are to surmount our existential crises. As previous research has shown, employees taking individual ownership of sustainability is a key driver for engaging in sustainability behaviors. In our survey, 28% of respondents strongly agreed with the statement “Employees at my company take ownership of improving sustainability performance,” while 45% identified a belief among employees that “sustainability is someone else&#39;s responsibility” as a challenge. This lack of personal ownership of sustainability performance is reflected in our survey results: Only 27% of respondents strongly agreed that they “invested ideas and creativity” to help their company be more sustainable, and just 24% strongly agreed that every business decision they make is viewed through the lens of sustainability.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Bridge the last mile.</strong> We noted a significant difference between how corporate and front-line employees responded to our questions. Compared with front-line nonmanagers working in roles such as customer support, managers working in corporate roles were, on average, about 15% more likely to see sustainability as embedded.</p><p> To ensure that their commitment to sustainability is real and provides tangible benefits to their organizations, leaders must address this last-mile gap between corporate and front-line employees. Broadly communicated messaging about the corporate purpose and environmental, social, and governance targets might not suffice in this instance; there is a real need to drive sustainability through practical initiatives and actions that can be integrated into daily tasks and routines that employees perform across the entire organization.</p><p></p><p> Interestingly, perceiving sustainability as more embedded in the organization also opens employees&#39; eyes to the roadblocks and challenges that impede progress. Our data shows that employees who are more engaged and perceive sustainability to be more embedded also perceive more roadblocks, on average, than those who are less engaged.</p><p> The implication here is that as companies bridge the last-mile gap in embedding sustainability, they should be prepared to field more questions and listen to more opinions as employee engagement on the issue increases. Companies should use one-on-one coaching, action playbooks, and tailored communication to make sustainability everyone&#39;s job. Companies need to be prepared to invest more resources into embedding sustainability — and get the entire organization to conduct business through the sustainability lens.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/sustainability-progress-is-stalled-at-most-companies/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 1</slash:comments></item><item><title> How Robots Can Enhance Performance Management for Humans</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-robots-can-enhance-performance-management-for-humans/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-robots-can-enhance-performance-management-for-humans/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 19 Jul 2023 11:00:50 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Bryan Hong and Lynn Wu. <p>Bryan Hong is associate professor of entrepreneurship and management at the Bloch School of Management at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.

Our research has found an equally and perhaps more important transformation taking place: The adoption of robots is improving companies&#39; ability to recognize and reward good employee performance.</p><p> Within every organization, leaders face a fundamental question: How do we get the best from our people? One of the most common methods is offering monetary rewards — usually, periodic bonuses — that are linked to performance. This practice is grounded in the idea that better performance should be more highly rewarded. But that approach is rarely simple to implement in practice because it requires that performance be measured well enough to be evaluated effectively. This is challenging to accomplish for most roles and even more so for individual employees. Because so much work is done in teams and managers can&#39;t monitor the specific activity of each employee or accurately measure individual performance, many organizations choose to pay bonuses based on team or company performance rather than on individual performance. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p></p><p></p><h3> Measuring Human Performance When Colleagues Are Robots</h3><p> What does all this have to do with robots? In our research, we have found that companies that adopt robots improve their ability to measure human performance. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> To illustrate, let&#39;s say you&#39;re working in a team of two. Your manager can see and evaluate your combined productivity as a team but not what each of you is doing individually at all times. In theory, both of you are supposed to be contributing equally; in practice, you&#39;re doing far more of the work, which isn&#39;t visible to your busy manager.</p><p> Then, let&#39;s say your teammate is replaced with a robot. As a machine, the robot is much more precise and consistent in doing its work tasks and might even provide data about its performance while operating. Because it&#39;s so consistent and transparent, any disruptions or spikes in productivity can much more clearly be identified as coming from either the robot or from you. If there are others in your organization who work with the same type of robot in a similar way, then it&#39;s much easier to see how their individual productivity varies from yours.</p><p> In other words, because robots are, by their very nature, much more consistent and transparent than humans, human activity becomes easier to observe if robots join the team. The more robots there are relative to humans, the easier it is to distinguish and measure individual human performance.</p><p></p><p> In one real-world example, a repair facility at a major US-based electronics company experienced a dramatic improvement in its ability to observe employee productivity after robots were implemented to assist workers in the repair process. Because robots, unlike humans, do not get physically tired while performing repetitive tasks, they were able to perform more consistently. This reduced variance in the production process and allowed managers to more clearly observe individual employee behaviors. Many employees followed a regular pattern of being more productive in the morning than in the afternoon, with substantial variance in their afternoon productivity. As a result, many workers ended up with more repairs to finish later in the day as they rushed to meet their daily quotas. This “cramming” of work was especially problematic because it typically resulted in more errors due to the workers having rushed.</p><p> Integrating robots into the repair process eased the tracking of individual employee productivity in two ways. First, robots made different types of errors than humans. The robots&#39; errors were consistent, which made human errors easier to distinguish. Second, the robots themselves provided precise data about their own performance, which made it easier to isolate performance outcomes, both positive and negative, caused by human behavior. This data generation capability allowed managers to better monitor productivity overall and to more easily detect weaknesses in the production process. Managers at the repair facility, for example, hadn&#39;t been aware of the extent of the afternoon cramming behavior until robots were incorporated into the production process. Once the problem was clearly identified, they were able to reorganize the work process to reduce errors; overall error rates at the facility have since improved.</p><p></p><p> These types of improvements in performance measurement can have especially dramatic effects on productivity in combination with performance-based incentives. If it&#39;s easier to observe and measure the performance of individual employees within organizations, good performers — who may have received little reward or recognition because of measurement challenges — become easier to identify and reward, and leaders really can do better in getting the best from their teams. And this is exactly what we find in our research: Companies that adopt robots are also more likely to adopt bonus incentives tied directly to individual performance as opposed to team or organizational performance. With better measurement comes increased rewards for an organization&#39;s good performers, and a more productive workplace. Using robots is fairer for the people who work at an organization.</p><p></p><p> Robots are changing the nature of work. Beyond eliminating some jobs and creating new ones, robots are also changing organizations&#39; ability to get the best from their people, as well as the way we experience work itself. Robots offer an exciting opportunity for businesses to redesign the roles and responsibilities of the humans that work with them, giving those companies a competitive edge over rivals not because of superior technology but because of better processes. The robot revolution isn&#39;t going to eliminate the need for humans. Rather, it&#39;s bringing both new challenges and opportunities for identifying, rewarding, and managing human talent.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-robots-can-enhance-performance-management-for-humans/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
