Images</p></figcaption></figure><p>尽管许多公司致力于实现员工队伍多元化，但他们仍然在吸引、雇用和留住代表性不足群体的员工方面遇到困难。</p><p>实现工作场所多元化并不容易，但领导者可以瞄准、解决和推动特定的数据点，并深思熟虑地激励支持它的行为。这些干预措施通常规模较小、易于实施且成本低廉，但当它们应用于吸引、招聘、入职以及员工路径周期中的选择、流程和组织杠杆时，它们可以帮助使工作场所更加多元化和包容性。</p><p></p><h3>吸引多元化人才的推动</h3><p>一家电子商务巨头的某些购物者群体的转化率 (CR) 低于目标，包括低收入有色人种和中等收入 LGBTQIA+ 人群。与此同时，该公司的主要竞争对手已成功聘用了更多女性、黑人和拉丁裔、太平洋岛民和 LGBTQIA+ 人士担任营销、行为分析和其他职位，他们的多元化观点正在转化为更高的 CR。</p><p>该公司发起了一项吸引多元化人才的重大活动。它聘请了一家猎头公司，该公司在全国范围内投放网络并投放印刷品和数字广告，突显该公司对多元化和包容性的承诺。然后领导层坐下来等待这些不同的候选人出现。广告热潮过后，在线招聘信息的浏览量在三周半左右达到顶峰，但到了第七周就趋于平稳。不到 11% 的网站访问者申请了该职位。只有三名申请人接受了面试；两人收到了报价，其中一人被拒绝。换句话说，如果你用大量的资源和巨大的花费来建造它，他们仍然可能不会来。</p><p>正如该公司发现的那样，仅仅吸引您想要吸引的潜在候选人的注意力是不够的。将合适的人才转化为申请人和候选人需要额外的宣传和培养。来自代表性不足的人口群体的个人——包括有色人种、LGBTQIA+ 群体和残疾人——通常与竞争性雇主的联系较少，并且认识的能够帮助他们顺利完成申请流程的人也较少。想要增加多样性的组织可以通过推动（修改人才招聘过程中呈现的语言和内容）吸引更多来自代表性不足群体的候选人，从而帮助产生多样化的候选人库，在整个过程中维持候选人库，鼓励顶尖候选人接受工作机会并帮助他们留住。</p><p></p><p>推动可以帮助尽早建立信任并减少信息不对称。在一次此类干预中，一家公司在在线招聘信息旁边展示了其领导层中女性和代表性不足的个人的数量，以及其多样性和包容性目标以及时间表。屏幕右下角的一段视频中，首席执行官谈到了他对包容性和多元化的承诺。这项干预措施使女性和代表性不足群体的申请比例在短期内增加了 22%，在长期内增加了 18%。来自不同社会经济背景的候选人总体上升了 17%。而且重要的是，从申请工作到接受职位的转化率上升了 8 个百分点。</p><p>增强对潜在雇主的熟悉程度的推动有助于在整个过程中维持申请人池。例如，即使求职者个人不认识公司的某个人，促进联系也可以使公司更具吸引力。一项在线实验将 1,276 名申请人在提交申请后、收到公司消息之前随机分配到以下四种条件之一：</p><ul><li>在申请处理过程中，申请人有机会向公司雇用的女性提问。</li><li>在申请处理过程中，申请人有机会向公司雇员提问。</li><li>申请人有机会向由一名男性员工和一名女性员工组成的小组提问。</li><li>申请人没有机会向任何员工提问。</li></ul><p>当女性可以向公司雇用的女性提问时，这些候选人在面试中的表现比任何其他条件下都要好。面试官评估的他们的分数提高了 34%。这些候选人也对申请流程和公司形象更加满意。那些没有收到工作邀请的人更有可能在接下来的 24 个月内重新申请。</p><p>类似地，在一家科技公司的在线实验中，我在 1,478 名申请人提交申请后、收到公司消息之前，将他们随机分配到几个条件之一。一些申请人被指派了一位求职者作为好友，如果他们被选中参加面试，他们可以与他一起练习所需的任务；有些则不然。在那些分配给好友的申请者中，一些女性与女性配对，一些女性与男性配对，一些男性与男性配对。</p><p>申请后与好友合作的求职者的面试选择率提高了 40%；这种影响在代表性不足的群体和初级职位中尤其显着。与男性配对的女性面试分数比其他条件下高出 9%。参与好友系统的候选人对整个过程更加满意，即使他们没有被选中参加面试，或者他们接受了面试但没有获得职位。女性满意度提高了 28%，男性满意度提高了 29%。</p><p>对于那些在传统上将他们排除在外的领域寻找工作的人来说，拥有业内的朋友或熟人可以减少他们的恐惧感。这些候选人正在寻求信息：“它是什么样的？我应该穿什么？我应该如何准备？我该说什么或不该说什么？如果什么 …？”了解可以消除大部分恐惧，潜在的雇主可以通过认识到这种情况并进行干预以重新设计动态来填补信息空白。平衡交流与候选人寻求的信息可以弥合分歧并建立信任。潜在雇主提供的信息可以让候选人决定该公司是否适合，他们是否可以在那里工作，以及他们是否会受到该组织的欢迎。</p><p>以运输和物流行业为例，该行业绝大多数由男性主导。缩小如此巨大的性别差距需要创造力。一家寻求雇用更多女性的公司为该公司雇用的每位女性拍摄了照片。然后，它将女性照片放置在空白区域附近，以图形方式说明性别差距，该空白区域代表缩小性别平等差距所需的额外女性。插图中还包含了该组织希望雇用足够女性来填补空缺的日期。</p><p>该公司不仅在其网站上展示了图像和文字，还与所有相关的搜索和招聘公司进行了交谈，并发起了一项旨在吸引女性申请的大型活动。在六个月的时间里，这些努力使女性申请人数增加了 30%，其中包括更多来自代表性不足群体的女性。</p><p>职位申请的设计也会影响申请的候选人数量。在之前的实验和干预中，诸如在申请中请求与性别和种族相关的信息之类的小事情已被证明很重要，但这些请求的放置可能会排斥或吸引候选人。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p>一项涉及 320 名申请人的公司研究试图确定在申请开始时、结束时以及完全不收集性别信息的影响。在最后要求性别认同的情况下，完成申请的女性比其他两种情况多 7%。</p><p></p><h3>鼓励招聘多元化人才</h3><p>从简历中删除人口统计指标可以对候选人进行公正的评估。在一家跨国公司，求职者被要求在在线门户中输入简历，这使得每个人的外观、感觉和格式都相同。所有的评论者都看到了同样的事情，所有种族和性别的指标都被删除了。被剥离的数据包括姓名、隶属关系、与宗教或文化团体相关的志愿者活动、爱好、语言技能或与特殊倡导或社区组织的联系。</p><p>删除此类数据减少了偏见的可能性，并使工作经验成为招聘团队的主要关注点。候选人还被要求描述他们在工作场所的成果和贡献。这种中立的形式集中了评估过程，并在 18 个月内将欧洲和美国代表性不足的群体数量增加了约 40%。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a></p><p>在与一家科技公司进行咨询时，我们应用了类似的原则，使用人工智能语音改变来掩盖性别。候选人使用一种名为“Gap Jumper”的工具来解决基于技能的挑战，而无需透露自己的性别，还使用了一种语音调制设备来匿名化性别和民族或种族背景。由此，女性的工作机会增加了近 16%，少数族裔群体的工作机会增加了 18%。</p><p>在设计了公平和中立的流程后，仍然需要做出聘用决定。在实践招聘艺术时，一个有用的策略是改变“我们应该包括谁？”的问题。到“我们应该排除谁？”在这种情况下，决策者不会纠结于应该选择谁的标准，而是决定应该排除谁，并从中找出一小部分最强的候选人。尽管这种方法在寻求更具包容性的背景下似乎违反直觉，但它迫使决策者密切关注核心资格并排除不符合这些资格的候选人。</p><h3>推动多元化人才入职</h3><p>在纽约市地区设有多个办事处的一家全球金融服务公司，几位合作伙伴正在庆祝聘用八名新员工。该群体的性别、种族和年龄各不相同——既有千禧一代、X 一代，也有婴儿潮一代。</p><p>千禧一代似乎毫不费力地找到了自己的立足点，而 X 一代对这个组织很熟悉，并且有许多同事已经成为他们网络的一部分。但入职过程并没有欢迎和同化卡尔顿，这位 50 多岁的黑人被聘为高管层，就像其他七个人一样。尽管卡尔顿才华横溢、技术精湛，但他获取信息的机会却减少了，这影响了他分配的几个项目。在不到 18 个月的时间里，在第一次绩效评估后不久，他就离开了公司，跳槽到了竞争对手。他的离开对公司造成了严重损害。短期内，替换他的成本将在 150 万美元到 175 万美元之间。从长远来看，他对公司作为就业场所的评价将会在他的整个网络中产生负面共鸣。</p><p>数据发现，在 12 至 24 个月后离开组织的个人与其入职经历之间存在联系，这种相关性比公司员工生活中的任何其他因素都更为突出。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a>简而言之，要么正确入职，要么付出代价。</p><p>有效的入职流程可确保新员工充分、包容地融入组织。小的修改使新员工能够更好地驾驭此流程并获取信息和服务，从而帮助他们轻松融入并提高工作效率。</p><p>与新移民一样，新员工寻求有关规范、政策、政治和行为的信息，以帮助他们在新环境中成功运作。新员工需要明确角色和期望。他们想要有关公司的背景信息。他们想知道如何茁壮成长，如何才能脱颖而出并获得晋升，以及如何才能掌握自己的工作。他们还想知道什么是高标准以及他们的目标是什么。</p><p>一家大型专业服务公司在候选人收到工作机会后立即向候选人发送一系列由首席执行官、部分董事会成员和部分执行团队成员组成的短视频，以推动其入职流程。这些三分钟的视频与公司战略保持一致，每天发送一次，持续 15 天。它们还传达了有关公司对多元化的承诺、成为公司一员的感觉、作为团队的一员如果犯错误会发生什么以及人们应该如何处理这种情况的信息。这些视频还讨论了拥有平等的成功机会意味着什么。</p><p>在另一种变化中，新员工立即被分配到一个大客户的工作项目。数据显示，这 15 个视频加上预先分配给一个大型项目，导致女性和来自代表性不足群体的个人的绩效提高，因为干预措施提高了工作清晰度。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p>在银行业，有效的入职推动包括每两周、三个月、六个月、九个月和 12 个月召开利益相关者会议。在会议中，员工们听取了在该组织工作了至少五年的人员的意见，他们讨论了新员工在入职期间遇到的问题、他们如何克服这些挑战以及他们在整个过程中对公司的看法。 12个月的过程。</p><p>该方法的一个变体使用了六个月、12 个月、18 个月和 24 个月的时间间隔，在此期间，利益相关者会议每六周举行一次。结果是，在聘用后 48 个月内，女性和代表性不足的群体的保留率更高。</p><p>入职的重要要素之一是创建和构建人际网络的机会。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a>网络带来了获取信息和指导的机会。它设定了一种社会情感基调，并影响新员工在工作中的轻松感。</p><p>一家金融机构的一项干预措施是与新员工分享一份 10 个人的名单，鼓励他们在 12 个月内联系这些人，但不要求他们联系。每份名单都包括不同的员工，其中一些是高管级别。一些新来者收到了为什么他们应该联系名单上的人的解释，而其他人则没有。实验中的一些参与者收到了电子邮件提醒，要求在三个月、六个月和九个月时联系名单上的人。</p><p></p><p>根据招聘过程中捕获的信息，选择将个人纳入特定的新员工名单。如果一名员工表达了对某个特定业务部门的兴趣，该名单中就会包括来自该领域的合作伙伴。该名单还可能包括来自新员工的近亲家庭成员居住的城市或地区的领导或人力资源联系人。如果员工需要搬迁以照顾父母或其他家庭成员，则已经提供了该重要信息。</p><p>来自代表性不足群体的个人收到了联系人列表、为什么应该联系的解释以及电子邮件提醒，他们的工作表现更好。他们的网络传播加速了，这是从他们在公司的整个生命周期中衡量的。即使 72 个月后，接受了所有三个干预措施的人仍然比那些没有接受所有三个干预措施的人更快地扩展他们的网络。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p>一家拥有许多办公室的大公司发现，较小的工作场所的入职流程似乎更有效。人们感觉更加一体化，他们的网络建立得比在大型办公室更快。相比之下，在较大的工厂，新的横向员工并没有跨代混合，也没有建立他们的网络。</p><p>作为回应，该公司采取了涉及自助餐厅的推动措施。员工根据他们在公司的工作年限分配车牌颜色。新员工分配到蓝色牌，入职六个月的员工分配到黄色牌，其他员工分配到绿色牌。每周一次，当人们一起吃饭时，颜色相同的人不能坐在一起。颜色混合创造了员工之间的互动，否则他们彼此之间是看不见的。</p><p>该策略使入职变得容易，因为人们正在创建新的网络。干预导致个人在网络中的联系的直接程度发生了 34% 的转变。它还使“介数中心性”增加了 18%，这是一个量化个人在网络内传递信息的角色的指标。</p><p></p><p>在我的研究、咨询、写作和实验中，职业轨迹上的 10 个点脱颖而出，通过特定类型的推动和干预可以支持建立和维持多元化劳动力的目标。除了吸引、招聘和入职候选人之外，多样性推动还可以应用于技能建设、避免办公室苦差事、灵活性和福祉、薪酬平等、起源和信用、反馈和晋升、网络和赞助。</p><p>为了使组织受益并成为公司战略优势的一部分，必须有意欢迎女性、有色人种和其他代表性不足群体的个人，将其充分融入组织并予以维持。这个过程应该是数据驱动的，利用大数据和人工智能的潜力来实现可持续的包容性。必须有目的地向他们提供与组织内其他人相同或平等的信息、联系、技能、项目和支持。必须认识到不平等现象，并且必须制定干预行动，以创造平等和包容性的方式推动这些状况。在多元化中获胜的公司是那些设计有利于每个人并为每个人提供公平竞争环境的流程的公司。</p><p></p>

因此能够使用其文本及其图像来确定产品类别的想法能够弄清楚它的属性。它有助于频道。它基本上可以帮助您向更广泛的受众推销并获得合理的分类学。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong> MM嗯。</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer：</strong>当Chatgpt出来时，问题是，我们该如何处理这项技术将其放在商人面前？这是我们想依靠的地方，原因有几个。首先，重要的是要尽快将其掌握在商人的手中，并与技术方面的最前沿保持联系。另一部分是，我们实际上看到了第一次有效用，而实用程序很重要，要去那里，看看我们的商人是否会使用它以及我们可以从中学到什么。</p><p>因此，我们从一个简单的道路开始：“商人正在挣扎的事情是什么？”我们看到他们每天都在苦苦挣扎。在Shopify中有数十亿美元，我们认为这是一个很广泛的工作空间，我们围绕着良好的产品描述的所有条件。然后我们感到“好的，让我们来看看人们如何使用它，看看这是否是可口的。”</p><p>因此，我们迅速求助了一个团队，我们依靠几个不同的原则。 Shopify通常建立在一组原则的基础上，并允许团队快速发展。我们所做的一些原则是，这一定很容易，这必须集成到他们的工作流程中，并且商人需要能够对那里的什么来代表他们的业务。</p><p>这是一个简单的开始。我们说：“好，让我们弄清楚好产品描述的规则是什么。应该多长？它应该使用什么音调？将使用什么类型的单词类型，什么使它真正好？”我们做了提示这一点的基本事情，然后说：“好吧，商人应该提供哪些其他上下文，我们应该寻找什么才能帮助他们？”</p><p>因此，我们说：“好吧，他们可能可以列出一些有关其产品的关键字，这符合<em>他们</em>所知道的知识领域，其余的应该是我们。就像，这应该像按下按钮一样简单。它应该感觉像魔术。”因此，我们将其命名为Shopify Magic，我们想坚持下去。商人要做的就是输入几个关键字，他们选择语调，然后按“生成”。就是这样。那是第一个版本。我们试图快速发货，看看会发生什么，而我们得到的反馈是：“这真是太神奇了。你能到处这样做吗？”</p><p>因此，就像，“好，所以这里有一些积极性。那么，接下来我们该怎么办？”因此，我们添加了一个“特殊说明”字段，最初是在试验中，我们正在做诸如“添加与我的产品有关的名人的报价”，就像如何尝试尝试如何尝试的模因。然后我们看到商人以不同的方式使用它。</p><p>我们看到他们将其用于语言，这很有趣。我们介绍了支持八种语言的能力，我们看到人们用它写翻译，这是可以预料的，但是很有趣。我认为我们看到的最有趣的人之一是，有些商人不会说英语，想向英语观众出售，并将产品描述视为弥合差距的一种方式 - 意外，但同时，同时，这是将产品掌握在用户手中的事情之一，然后用户决定将其使用的用途。值得注意的是，我们为甚至一小窗口开放了企业家精神，甚至比以前更多。</p><p>这就是AI的努力使球滚动的原因。在那之后，每个团队都想要一支球队，每个团队都想做某事，我们以各种方式加速了它。我们试图从UX [用户体验]的角度来系统化事物；每当商人看到某些东西时，他们就会知道这就是要做的。而且，我们还试图研究建筑搭档，这是一位支持AI-AI-IS助手，专门为商业而建造的助手。因此，这就是我们进入的旅程。我们有专门的团队正在研究特定功能，然后我们拥有整个公司，他们正在寻找AI可以加速商业的机会。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>因此，当我和Shervin首次听到您在做什么时，我认为这让我们兴奋的是多么普遍。诸如Shopify将人工智能纳入其工具之类的效果是巨大的。而且我认为我们正在谈论之前，您谈论过在2月[2023]介绍该产品。这是在生成[AI]时期很早的。</p><p>很多人都在调查生成剂，但这是一个令人兴奋的故事，您在生产中使用这些工具很快。我敢肯定，这有点痛苦 - 也许您可以谈论您遇到的任何痛苦或困难；也许其他人从中学到了，但也有多么普遍。这两种都是人们可以从您所做的事情中学到的有趣方式。</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer：</strong>是的。早期的挑战是挑战，但我认为这是一种乐趣。这很有趣，因为这是最新的技术。它有很多效用，我们只是想把它掌握在用户手中。一路上，我们不得不弄清楚您如何进行评估？这是什么提示的东西？您如何系统化这一点并使这是有道理的？这些破布的东西是什么 - 抹布正在<em>检索增强的一代</em>？我如何将更多数据带入提示的这种情况下，以及如何使这一点有意义？</p><p>疯狂的部分是，每周都是其他技术时期的一个月或一年的价值，突然之间有一件新事物需要尝试，我们不想错过这个新事物， 任何一个。每当有新事物出来时，我们都尝试了，我们就探索了。而且我认为Shopify的文化是探索者之一，也是手工艺者和建筑商之一。我们试图做的就是将其交给可以建造和尝试事物的人们手中。我们还在内部做了一些事情来鼓励使用人工智能，我们建立了自己的内部chatgpt实例。我们有内部Wiki进行搜索和发现。我们试图做的就是将其纳入公司的结构。这是正常的。这是预期的。然后，随之而来的所有风险和挑战（包括幻觉）都是人们熟悉的事情。一旦我们让他们熟悉它，我们就弄清楚了在某些情况下也可以解决它并接受它的方法。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我认为这是您提出的非常重要的一点，因为当我回顾自己的经验和BCG在这一领域的经验时，我们正在与许多公司合作，其中许多公司与您具有相同的心态和野心描述并正在将解决方案投入生产中，并正在接受它。然后，我要说的是，有些是对此保留的。我要说的是，其中一些是基于一些毫无根据的恐惧。</p><p>我的意思是，现实是这是新技术，它具有很大的风险，而且风险可能比传统AI高一些，因为它会变得多么普遍。但是我认为等待其他人弄清楚所有风险的心态，然后使您处于某种巨大的劣势，因为您所描述真正领先这些事情的方法是开始进行尝试并对其感到满意。</p><p>我敢肯定，在董事会级别上有一些风险和一些担忧。也许只是对当时的许多人的思考与现实是什么，对我们的某些听众的看法，以便他们了解这些风险可以缓解这些风险，而您却永远远离了这些风险。</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer：</strong>是的。我要说的第一件事是，我想描述谁是企业家，甚至将其置于上下文中。我遇到过的每位企业家都有我见过的任何人的风险承受能力最高。他们愿意放弃生活中的一切来开展业务，有时除了想创业之外，他们什么都不知道。这些人天生就可以容忍风险，因此我们的用户组与其他人大不相同。显然，您将在该用户群中获得一系列公差，但是从本质上讲，这是一个愿意潜入，冒险并尝试事物的群体。然后我们观察到的一件事是他们已经在使用它。因此，我们已经有了使用Chatgpt或其他任何东西的商人，以便能够提示，找出替代方案并将其直接使用到他们的软件中。</p><p>我们进行了短暂的研究，我们问了许多商人：这是您所知道的吗？您如何使用它？你用它做什么？他们中的许多人都喜欢，“是的。好吧，我的意思是，我只是问一切，所以我只是要弄清楚。”我们已经看到了这种情况。所以对我们来说，“好吧。好吧，我们已经拥有了这个耐风险的商人基础，并且我们通常在两个向量上担心的最大问题。”</p><p>向量的恐惧是对失去控制的恐惧。因此，沿着“这怎么说？如果幻觉我该怎么办？这对我来说是正确的吗？它会和我的买家说话吗？”因此，所有这些最初的问题以及对失去控制的恐惧很容易缓解。所以我们说：“好。好吧，这是一个快速的恐惧。我们如何减轻这种恐惧？”而且，我们通过将控制权放回用户手中来减轻人们对失去控制的恐惧。</p><p>因此，Carte Blanche原则是“如果没有用户干预，AI将永远不会写”，因此商人将始终能够看到该消息将是什么。因此，所有的幻觉风险，所有“它将要做什么？”风险消失了，因为现在它将控制权立即放回了用户手中。</p><p>第二个风险是围绕它是否准确，这通常是很多人遇到的一种风险。我们试图管理的方式是，最了解产品的人是出售产品的人。他们最了解的是他们的产品，这就是他们试图谈论的产品，他们正在尝试谈论<em>自己的</em>品牌。因此，对于我们来说，人们对我们的风险并不那么冒险，因为这将由商人决定如何以事实方式代表他们。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>您以这样的方式谈论这一点，但是当您在这里考虑实际的关键词时，这是<em>用户</em>，实际上，当您考虑它时，我们的许多工作人类和人工智能与单独的人类或单独的人AI。感谢您谈论这一点。那是非常关键的。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>我也真正喜欢的一件事是您一直在使用<em>“实用程序”</em>一词。我和Shervin谈论的许多示例，我们会问人们一个例子，他们会提出一些AI繁重的应用程序，他们实施了这些应用程序，这些应用程序跨越了组织的许多部分，这很重要，那是很棒的。但是您所谈论的实用程序似乎是微实用程序。因此，我的意思是，正如您提到的那样，人们可能已经去了一些大型语言模型并生成一些文本，然后将其粘贴到Shopify中。</p><p>您在这里的增量实用程序是在这两个工具之间来回节省了一些，但随后会逐步使其在您的工具和上下文中更好地工作。当您考虑所有这些小块如何乘以数十亿美元时，我认为这很令人兴奋。这与我和Shervin有时看到的故事不同，这是：“我们有一个很大的系统，它具有很大的实用性，并且可能没有太多的用户。”</p><p>我想回到您之前提到的东西 - 也许我只是挑选了您的语气 - 但是您在谈论欺诈检测以及这些传统的人工智能用途。现在感觉就像是矛盾的，但是您说：“哦，是的。我们正在使用它进行欺诈。我们将其用于后端业务优化和这些事物。耶耶耶。我们做了所有这些事情，但这是非常酷的东西。”您能够保持前进似乎真的很令人兴奋。下一步是什么？</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer：</strong>这是一个很好的问题。我认为对我们的希望是，我们希望AI降低企业家精神的进入障碍。我认为对我们的想法是，让我们看一下空间上的一切。因此，我们最近对图像生成做了一些事情。我们认为这是“好吧，好吧，我们也可以依靠这里。我们可以使用不同的操作模式。”因此，我们释放了拥抱的脸管，这背后的想法是“让我们将其投放到市场上，让我们看看人们将如何使用它，让我们以一种无害的方式进行。”</p><p>它背后的想法是您上传产品图像，然后选择需要切换的背景。其中一些，在隆起的场景后面有一些有趣的东西，抬高图像，弄清楚它的遮罩，确保反射和阴影将是好的，然后产生各种背景，这些背景很有意义在商业的静脉下。从中我们可以看到的是以不同方式探索的能力。我们试图与AI一起做的事情，以及您对用户群的风险承受能力的观点，这并不意味着对他们现有的工作流程造成破坏。他们中的许多人（尤其是已建立的人）都有现有的工作流程，以特定的方式完成所有操作，这就是对他们有用的。</p><p>我们要做的就是，对于需要额外推动或需要额外的任何一个额外的任何人来说，有一个按钮可以单击，这是一种调用此功能的方法，这是他们选择的。而且，谢尔文（Shervin），我喜欢您在将用户放置在适当位置方面所谈论的一些内容，而我们的格言一直是，这是可以增强而不是替代品的东西。因此，这总是可以帮助用户成为自己最好的版本的东西。</p><p>随着图像的产生，我们看到了他们的机会，如果他们愿意的话，可以整体更改店面。如果他们有感恩节的销售即将来临，他们希望能够更改所有背景以成为主题，那么这对他们来说是一个快速，简单的举动。他们的产品一直处于最前沿，他们的品牌贴在最前沿，但他们可以为特定活动而商品商品 - 如果是感恩节，如果是圣诞节，如果是新年，那么无论是圣诞节。现在需要其他照片拍摄的东西可能比以前[]更容易实现。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>完全。让我们记住几年前的复杂和不必要的面向过程的趋势是多么复杂和不必要的事情，您知道，您刚刚就背景和照片，照片，外观和对品牌的外观和影响以及所有这些都达成共识，所有这些现在，您将其全部掌握在商人手中。</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer：</strong>对我们来说，整个Shopify的许多人都使用此问题，提出正确的问题，推动界限并了解周围的某些命名法。当我说“幻觉”时，我几乎可以保证99％的Shopify知道这意味着什么以及发生的方式以及如何工作。这使对话每次进行产品开发时都有很大的不同，因为它并没有每次都提出并对其进行重新介绍。是人们尝试解决这项技术的正常问题的解决方案。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>是的。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>如果我斜视，我会看到在这个人工智能市场上发展的东西。您以易于转移学习的方式暗示了它。您可以采用这些现有型号并稍微增强它们，我认为这是过去十年来的改进，“哦，是的。当然。您可以下载这些工具并自己构建它们”到“嘿，不，您可以接受我们所做的工作，我们已经训练了我们的GPU，并烧毁了我们的GPU，并逐步燃烧了一些GPU，但随后前进。”我认为这是在这里这个市场中发生的动态。</p><p>但是，让我在这里更黑暗，谈论另一个动态。可以说，有一场平庸的竞赛吗？而且我认为这是一种有些充电的方式，但是如果您在Shopify中的所有用户都使用相同的工具来生成相同的产品描述，那并不会导致所有产品的一种香草感觉描述？我们如何推迟并超越这一点？我们让每个人都保持平庸，真是太好了。我们如何使人们与众不同？我们从哪里构建？我们如何将其超越平庸？</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer：</strong>是的。您所说的问题是有效的，对吗？因此，每个人都朝着这一标准，简单，同质，无聊的事情迈进。我们已经看到的是，我们提供的所有工具都将使您入门。这个想法不是“这是终点线”。终点线是商人。终点线是他们的产品。终点线是他们的品牌，能够相应地代表。在许多情况下，这是关于给您一些东西，这总比没有好，让您开始和思考。</p><p>我们有一个商人对我来说确实很好地描述了它。他想为他们拥有的一些托管库存建立一家插座商店，并且他们有3,000个Skus想要放在一起 - 他们想在这家初始出口商店中使用的3,000种不同的产品。他对我说的是：“通常，我会做的是我会雇用一个团队，我们要花三个月的时间才能启动这件事，我们会试图将其放在一起。”他说：“我一个人度过了一个周末，我只是使用了您这一代的功能。它让我开始。我做了几个更改。三天后，我有一家商店站起来，准备去我所有的产品。我进行了必要的更改。我不喜欢您的风格，所以我给了一些具体的说明，它得到了我想要的。”</p><p>我认为这个想法是框架内的灵活性。因此，提供一个框架，让他们开始，但让他们在世界上的所有灵活性都可以做适合自己的业务的事情，并使他们能够与受众区分开来。我认为关键是，每个听众都不一样，没有人比商人自己更好地理解这一点。这个想法是能力和增强，而不是替代。你是对的；对于人们来说，可能有一个当地的最大值。但是我们想离开所有逃生舱口，以便他们可以摆脱困境。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>我想坚持的一件事，您暗示的是确定性与随机性的确定性与随机性。从生产的角度来看，这似乎真的很难使用 - 您正在使用具有随机输出的工具，但是您想拥有一个“定义，测试，精致”过程。这两件事在许多方面对我来说似乎是相反的。你怎么处理那件事呢？</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer：</strong>其中一部分是内置的风险容忍度。因此，几乎需要期望该系统会失败，并且用户需要有一种方法来解决该故障。因此，产品描述很棒。实际上，我们看到用户对他们面前的东西感到满意之前，需要几代人。因此，考虑到这一点，您必须允许第二，第三，第四，第五代毫不费力地进行。</p><p>因此，这是我们知道将要发生的错误情况，因此我们为此计划。因此，那里有一个“再生”按钮。它提出了多个选项。在其他情况下，我们将尽可能地提出尽可能多的选择，以使其更容易。因此，主题行：您可以选择三个选项。你可以改变它。做任何你想做的事。然后，另一部分是我们了解技术将会改变，人们使用它的方式将会改变，并且他们的专业知识水平将会改变。</p><p>因此，有些人将尝试破坏系统，有些人将尝试围绕系统进行工作。我们也必须计划这种情况。因此，必须考虑所有风险和每个故障案件。然后，您几乎以一种有趣的方式做到这一点，而这是典型的迅速黑客，人们试图弄清楚该提示是什么是为此使用的。在大多数情况下，您会尽力而为，但是您希望提示会出现在那里。因此，您以某种方式编写提示，即当它出门时，就像：“嘿，您找到了我。那太棒了！您想申请工作或其他东西吗？”有很多不同的方法可以考虑到这一点。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>您的人类在循环中也解决了很多问题。</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer：</strong>正确。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>我认为，您的整个设计理念确实解决了很多背景，也是许多随机性质。你能给我们一点背景吗？您是如何扮演自己的角色的？</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer：</strong>我最初是一名工程师。我认为，由于我已经12岁，所以我正在编程，并试图弄清楚如何使计算机做我想做的事情。我担任工程师的最初角色，并在当时的仪表数据管理中被介绍给产品管理。因此，就像公用事业刚刚出现的大数据一样。我必须在那个领域工作，然后进入文档分类，然后进行广告技术，然后进行零售数据平台管理。</p><p>我一直与数据相邻，在Shopify，我的旅程一直在建立我们的基础架构和数据平台，在我们的机器学习平台上工作，并找出需要在那里建造的东西。而且我总是在机器学习/AI池中有一个脚趾。然后，我有专注于分析方面的团队，以及商人将经历的内容以及他们将如何了解他们的业务。任务始终像“如何通过数据优化我的业务？”我们研究了ML的机会，我们研究了AI的机会。然后，当生成AI出来时，这只是沿途的下一步。</p><p>因此，是出于运气，偶然的设计 - 谁知道？但是我一直在过去的15，20年中一直在数据中，这是下一步。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>好的。是时候提出五个问题了。 miqdad，你知道那是什么吗？</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer：</strong>我没有。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>好的。</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer：</strong>我的意思是，我知道五个问题是什么，但是…</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>很好！因此，我们将问您五个问题快速风格的问题。只需告诉我们您想到的第一件事即可。</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer：</strong>当然。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>您现在认为AI最大的机会是什么？</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer：</strong>我认为最大的机会是解决许多人的冷门。当我说“冷启动”时，我的意思是看着空白屏幕，不知道该怎么做，是如何导航系统，写东西还是其他可能的事情 -

Open-source models such as <a href="https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/bloom">Bloom</a> , <a href="https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/">Vicuna</a> , and Stable Diffusion, among many others, provide foundational models that can be fine-tuned to specific tasks. Research into highly optimized training routines (such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685">LoRA</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10199.pdf">BitFit</a> ) has found that they can be fine-tuned using commodity hardware, leading to a burgeoning <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3545111">ecosystem of models</a> approaching the performance of ChatGPT (though many <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15717.pdf">technical challenges</a> remain). A leaked memo in which a Google researcher laments “we have no moat” reveals that some see this explosion of open-source innovation as threatening the tech giants&#39; control of LLMs. Still, capitalizing on the rapid developments of these emerging open-source tools safely and responsibly will require new investments in people and processes.</p><p></p><h3> Managing the Risks of Open-Source AI</h3><p> While locally controlled AI solutions keep proprietary data in hand, managers must still take a number of actions to ensure their safe, effective, and responsible use.</p><p> <strong>Navigate model and data licenses.</strong> The term <em>open source</em> is, in many cases, misleading. While some models allow commercial uses, others are restricted to academic or nonprofit use. Sometimes the source code is released with the model; other times, only one or the other is released. Recently created types of licenses restrict specific use cases deemed to be harmful or irresponsible. For example, Bloom and Stable Diffusion are released under <a href="https://www.licenses.ai/">Responsible AI Licenses</a> , which might legally prevent their use in certain criminal justice and health applications. One must also consider the types of data the model was trained on. While including copyrighted material in data sets for training AI models might be considered fair use in some scenarios in the US, case law is far from settled. Having a thorough accounting of the data fed into each model will help organizations better navigate these issues. Emerging efforts like the Data Nutrition Project are adding more structure and reporting requirements to data sets to help users better understand their contents and risks.</p><p> <strong>Prevent data leakage.</strong> Even without submitting data to third-party AI services, organizations risk leaking their own data through open-ended user interfaces such as chatbots. An emerging use case allows LLMs to serve as a conversational interface to a database, which can be a powerful way to let customers quickly find answers to common questions that are customized to their own data. However, preventing the LLM from revealing private information about other customers, or proprietary data of the company, can be challenging. Research by Pew shows that these conversational agents are a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/02/22/60-of-americans-would-be-uncomfortable-with-provider-relying-on-ai-in-their-own-health-care/">concern for many users</a> , especially around sensitive topics like health care. Safeguarding data is made even more difficult by <em>prompt injection attacks</em> , in which malicious users attempt to trick the agent into revealing information it was explicitly instructed not to reveal. In an adversarial setting, the same aspect of AI systems that allows them to be creative and flexible also becomes a security threat.</p><p> <strong>Adapt to changing data.</strong> Another complication with hosting on-premise models is ensuring that they are using the latest data. While the initial release of ChatGPT (GPT-3) famously could not answer questions about events past 2021, more recent models can combine current data with models pretrained on historical data. Firms must balance updating the system with new information while also maintaining stability and consistency in user experience.</p><p> <strong>Mitigate systemic biases.</strong> AI systems can easily perpetuate and amplify social and economic inequalities encoded in the training data. It is well known that LLMs are prone to stereotyping based on gender, race, and ethnicity — such as assuming that nurses are female and doctors are male. While there has been considerable research into how to reduce such behavior, in the end this problem will not be solved by solely technological solutions. Organizations should continuously audit AI systems, measuring their performance and results to ensure that different subpopulations are being treated equitably.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Build trust with customers.</strong> Companies should anticipate heightened sensitivities over how personal data is used and be transparent with customers about any intentions to use their data for AI training — and, ideally, allow individuals to opt in. This is particularly important when it comes to data that is perceived as being extremely personal, such as audio, video, and health data. Simply updating the terms of service and sending out notifications about the change, as some companies have done, can leave customers feeling exploited and broadly damage trust. For example, after Zoom&#39;s recent move to claim such rights to using customer data made news, blowback from users and privacy advocates compelled the videoconferencing provider to not only walk back the changes but declare in its terms of service that it would never use such data to train AI models.</p><h3> Responsible Data Use in the AI Era</h3><p> If open-source AI models continue to be adopted across industries, it will not just be Big Tech facing concerns over data ownership. Every company that wants to deploy these models for tasks as wide-ranging as internal help tools and public-facing chatbots will have to confront issues related to how data is collected and used by AI systems.</p><p></p><p> While there are <a href="https://mozilla.ai/">startups</a> , <a href="https://data.humdata.org/dataset/2048a947-5714-4220-905b-e662cbcd14c8/resource/60050608-0095-4c11-86cd-0a1fc5c29fd9/download/ocha-data-responsibility-guidelines_2021.pdf ">governmental working groups</a> , and <a href="https://responsibledata.io/">academic communities</a> all working on these topics, best practices and recommended policies are still emerging. Stanford Law School&#39;s <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/2023/03/09/a-data-stewardship-framework-for-generative-ai/">AI Data Stewardship Framework</a> specifically addresses generative AI techniques. The Association for Computing Machinery, the world&#39;s largest computing professional organization, has also recently released a set of guidelines around the <a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/public-policy/ustpc-approved-generative-ai-principles">design and deployment of generative AI</a> systems, including LLMs. Those resources cover some of the issues discussed here, including limits on deployment, data and output ownership, and personal data control. We recommend that organizations of all sizes looking to capitalize on open-source AI keep a close eye on relevant guidelines and frameworks for the responsible and ethical collection and use of data for training models. They can be helpful for thinking through the potential technical and social risks of any potential project, and for developing rigorous auditing and monitoring processes to ensure safe and effective deployment.</p><p> At Tulane, we have recently established the <a href="https://tulanecs.github.io/tuceai/">Center for Community-Engaged Artificial Intelligence</a> to investigate such issues. Through a cross-disciplinary team of technologists, social scientists, and civil rights activists, we are working with nonprofits and community groups in New Orleans to understand how AI affects their work. We are brainstorming new ways of building AI systems that cede control over the data and technology behind AI to the people most affected by it. Our work is part of growing efforts around participatory or human-centered AI and data, which recognize that all stakeholders need to be included in the value created by these systems. As corporations move deeper into AI development, adhering to similar values might help them be better stewards of the data that they collect and use.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/use-open-source-for-safer-generative-ai-experiments/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> How to Start Smart With a Talent Marketplace</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-start-smart-with-a-talent-marketplace/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-start-smart-with-a-talent-marketplace/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 12:00:47 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Jeff Williamson and Donncha Carroll. <p>Jeff Williamson is a leader in human resources at Booz Allen.

At Booz Allen, we experienced that truth during the first year after launching our pilot project. Here, we&#39;ll examine some of the challenges we faced, how we overcame them, and what we learned about change management and talent marketplaces.</p><p> Having a talent marketplace represented an important change for Booz Allen. For years, we&#39;d been deploying professional staff members through informal, internal networks that operated based on who you knew and who you trusted. But this path limited our flexibility to make use of available resources and match the right talent to the right work. More importantly, it limited our people&#39;s control over their own career paths, and that hurt engagement and retention.</p><p></p><p> To test a better approach, Booz Allen launched a talent marketplace pilot project in partnership with Lotis Blue Consulting in January 2022. With the pilot, we sought to address talent management challenges that constrained growth and hurt our ability to deliver a compelling value proposition to employees — namely, issues in hiring, deployment, talent development, technology and its adoption, and culture change. We wanted to solve these problems systematically and holistically rather than introduce point solutions, which often fail to compound value.</p><p> But the level of cultural transformation required to activate and operate a talent marketplace is significant. It takes a sustained effort to work through several human behavioral- and perception-driven issues — and overcoming these issues is key to success.</p><h3> The Road to a Talent Marketplace</h3><p> Booz Allen wanted to end its reliance on traditional hiring networks centered around clients or teams. These highly localized networks made it tough to find resources in other parts of the organization that would meet enterprise, regional, or local needs. In contrast, the marketplace established a centralized approach to assess demand and source talent enterprisewide (via external hiring, internal deployment, or upskilling) and created the capability to deploy people across the entire organization.</p><p></p><p> The marketplace pilot focused on skills rather than networks. This gave employees new visibility to open opportunities across the enterprise and managers new insights into talent who could do the work. This high-resolution view on job and development opportunities vastly expanded the scope of what people could explore, improving employee engagement and delivering higher levels of individual and business performance. The pilot doubled the internal fill rate on open positions for the pilot population and garnered positive employee feedback on transparency and ease of pursuing new opportunities. Additionally, this skills-based approach gave underrepresented candidates more opportunities in technical domains with public sector clients.</p><p> In the early months of the pilot, we needed to overcome a few important challenges to build interest and excitement. Most importantly, we needed to seed the marketplace with a sufficient number of high-quality opportunities and available talent to engage both employees and managers. In so doing, we learned several important lessons — especially around change management.</p><h4> Lesson 1: Bring on the gamification.</h4><p> As our clients&#39; environments and needs are changing, the nature of our work is evolving, and we are seeing a rapid shift in in-demand skill sets. Our technical talent&#39;s ability to deliver against a client&#39;s mission depends on how quickly they can learn and adapt.</p><p> To address this, Jim Hemgen, Booz Allen&#39;s strategic talent development leader, and his learning and development (L&amp;D) team designed and launched a badging program alongside the marketplace pilot. The program aimed to develop strategic enterprise capabilities by illuminating different career pathways and the skills required to access different opportunities. To qualify for a badge, an employee needed to both earn the credential and have a manager validate that they had applied the skill on the job. This gamified learning and offered recognition and rewards to employees who invested in their own development.</p><p> The L&amp;D team engaged a large segment of the company&#39;s technical workforce in building strategic capabilities through a combination of internal badging and external certifications. In the past year, employees have earned more than 4,000 badges or certifications that are critical to the future of the business.</p><p></p><h4> Lesson 2: Data goals must be relevant to individual career goals.</h4><p> We encountered several technical challenges associated with the pilot, including data structure (establishing the right job architecture), data quality (ensuring that skills data was complete, for example), and algorithm design (how best to perform the recommendation process for talent and open职位）。</p><p> To get the complete skills data, we needed wide adoption. In reality, adoption closely correlated with the value that users expected to extract from the platform. We had a slow start as employees and managers explored the functionality and benefits.</p><p> That changed once John Grumbine, the marketplace operations leader, helped launch the Career Hub, an internal web app, in January 2023. The app served as a one-stop shop for employees to find jobs, training and development, mentors, and communities in the talent marketplace based on their skills and preferences. Employees now had a vested interest in keeping their skills and preferences up to date because that information drove recommendations for the opportunities, training, and the mentors they could access; further, it drove how they might be discovered or identified by project managers seeking to fill roles.</p><p> Launching the Career Hub app led to a substantial increase in talent marketplace adoption. As of September 2023, more than 50% of Booz Allen employees had onboarded into the Career Hub and were accessing job, learning, and mentoring opportunities.</p><h4> Lesson 3: Even change management needs to change.</h4><p> In the realm of cultural transformation, we quickly experienced four key challenges after launching the pilot. (See “Four Culture Challenges to Conquer.”)</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Four Culture Challenges to Conquer</h4><p class="caption"> You&#39;re likely to encounter these issues as you lead through the culture change related to a talent marketplace:</p><table id="Chart#" class="no-mobile"><thead><tr><th>挑战</th><th>Business Implications</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p> <strong>Managers want to keep their best resources or are concerned about becoming a net exporter of talent in an open market.</strong><p></td><td><p> Instead of leaving the team, high-performing talent leaves the organization.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> <strong>Employees are reluctant to seek out reassignment openly for fear that they will appear disloyal to their current supervisors.</strong><p></td><td><p> Engagement and performance of captured staff declines over time.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p> <strong>Project managers are reluctant to accept resources they don&#39;t know personally and to trust recommendations from managers outside of their personal network.</strong></p></td><td><p> Assembling the right team for each project is much more challenging.

In response, our team prioritized several important actions to drive the culture change we needed:</p><ul><li> Build, refine, and map out skills-based talent profiles to provide greater clarity on the work people can do or have done.</li><li> Focus (initially) on high-volume in-demand job profiles to create enough liquidity in the system that participants have the opportunity to move.</li><li> Form a small, agile, and action-oriented operations team to collaborate with subject matter experts (for example, from business leadership and talent acquisition) as different challenges arise.</li><li> Provide human-centric support in the form of marketplace navigators — people specifically tasked with helping all participants (employees and managers) follow marketplace rules and guidelines and get the most value from the platform.</li></ul><p> All of these steps can be built into a launch plan for a talent marketplace.</p><h4> Lesson 4: Momentum, motivation, and measurement matter a great deal.</h4><p> At a high level, it&#39;s important to launch several services of an integrated talent management system simultaneously in order to exceed expectations and build adoption momentum.</p><p> To effect behavioral change, leaders must deeply understand what motivates different people, as well as how the changes they&#39;re making will address people&#39;s needs. The pilot provided valuable feedback on marketplace utility, helped prioritize enhancements, and established the level of change management required to support evolving and scaling the design.</p><p></p><p> Monitoring and measuring marketplace performance helped our team try new things, fail fast, and continually enhance the marketplace&#39;s value to participants. More specifically, our metrics included the number of opportunities posted, trends within those opportunities, the level and breadth of employee interest by type of posting, the percentage of aging opportunities (those that went unfilled for a long time), and the percentage of positions填充。 This data helped us evaluate the health and strength of the platform and gave us insight into how system adjustments were influencing performance.</p><h3> Commit to Continuous Improvement</h3><p></p><p> Through the talent marketplace and our other talent system investments, we are delivering a better employee value proposition. Our employee retention improved more than 4% after the pilot. However, this journey never ends. Continuous investment in evolving talent, as well as the solution, is essential to success for the business.</p><p> Addressing obstacles that come up along the way is part of the journey and ultimately leads to a better design and better results. A talent marketplace offers important benefits in today&#39;s evolving labor market: By prioritizing employee mobility and development, companies can better adapt to the changing skill requirements and realize higher levels of innovation, collaboration, and flexibility within their workforces.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-start-smart-with-a-talent-marketplace/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Balancing Change and Continuity During a Transformation</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/balancing-change-and-continuity-during-a-transformation/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/balancing-change-and-continuity-during-a-transformation/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 15:03:53 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Carsten Lund Pedersen and Laurianne McLaughlin. <p>Carsten Lund Pedersen is an associate professor at the IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark.

Think segmentation: Marketers tend not to design a product or service for the average consumer. Indeed, polarizing brands such as Red Bull pride themselves on the notion that as many people hate their product as love it.</p><p> Yet when it comes to marketing budgets, a common but flawed practice is to use average figures touted by well-meaning researchers. Two of the most established CMO surveys that examine marketing budgets are The CMO Survey, conducted biannually by Duke University (and run by this article&#39;s second author since 2008), and Gartner&#39;s annual CMO Spend and Strategy Survey. The CMO Survey has found that 2023 marketing budgets, on average, represent 11% of revenues in the US, and Gartner has found that 2023 budgets represent 9.1% of total company revenues across North America and parts of Europe. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p> We know from experience that these averages are too often taken at face value. When budgets are lower than average, CMOs inevitably yammer for more spending power. And when they are higher than average, the CFO can find reasons to tighten the financial thumbscrews.</p><p> We argue, however, that an average marketing budget can be highly misleading for planning purposes. CMOs should heed the Monty Python film <cite>Life of Brian</cite> — “You&#39;re all individuals. … You&#39;ve all got to work it out for yourselves!” — and select appropriate peer benchmarks. To help leaders do this, we analyzed marketing budget data through a new lens.</p><p></p><h3> The Key Differentiator: A CMO&#39;s Realm of Control</h3><p> So if the average marketing budget is not correct, which size does fit?这得看情况。 First, the average glosses over systemic sector differences. As The CMO Survey shows, for example, at an average of 13.9% of revenues, B2C marketing budgets tend to be higher than B2B budgets, which average 9.3%. Taking a different view, product brands tend to have higher marketing budgets, at 11.4% of revenues, than service brands, at 10.3%. Companies with $10 million or less in sales have the largest budgets (16.8% of revenues), but this number drops to 9.5% for companies with $10 billion or more in sales. Similarly, budgets exceed 17% at companies with 50 or fewer employees, but they drop to 9.8% for companies with 10,000 or more.</p><p> But why does company size matter, and why are B2C and product brand budgets higher than B2B and service brand budgets? To examine this question, The CMO Survey asked 314 marketing leaders about the breadth of their strategic responsibilities. We found that a significant factor affecting marketing budgets is the realm of control CMOs have at different types of companies. The results highlight significant deviations in marketing budgets based on these responsibilities and entirely account for variations based on company size. In fact, the marketing responsibilities we refer to below account for over 71% of the differences between sectors. In other words, although a peer-benchmark budgeting approach might be appealing, it is also misleading.</p><p></p><p> Our research showed that in 28% of companies surveyed, marketers&#39; job descriptions did not extend beyond communications to operational responsibilities such as sales or e-commerce. And for those “comms-only” companies, marketing budgets were roughly half of the average, at 5.6%. (Almost universally, communication activities included positioning, brand advertising, digital brand promotion, PR, social media, and/or lead generation.) In B2B comms-only companies, marketing budgets stood at 5.9%, or less than two-thirds of the sector average, and in B2C companies, they stood at a meager 4% — less than one-third of the sector average. Comparisons for service (6.1%) and product brands (5.1%) tell a similar story. Surprisingly, for these comms-only brands, budgets are actually larger for B2B and service companies than for B2C and product brands — the opposite of what we see in the average analysis.</p><h3> Strategic Marketers Have the Biggest Budgets</h3><p> In companies where marketing is responsible not only for communications but also for at least one key <em>operational</em> activity — such as sales, distribution, customer service and experience, e-commerce, or customer relationship management — the average budget is higher, at about 7.6% of revenues.</p><p> As in the comms-only organizations, B2B budgets (8.1%) are higher than B2C budgets (5.7%). However, among these marketing-plus-operations companies, budgets are back to being higher for product brands (8.6%) than for service brands (6.8%), which makes sense given the potentially higher channel costs for the former. Having said that, even for this broader realm of control, budgets are still lower than the average, even at the sector level.</p><p> The real difference maker is the addition of at least one <em>strategic</em> activity, such as new products and innovation, market selection and entry, pricing, or growth, to a company&#39;s marketing responsibilities. Among them are areas that business schools have traditionally taught as marketing functions but are not under the auspices of marketing in many companies. The average budget for marketing functions responsible for communications, operations, and strategy stands at 13.4% across companies. Among these, it is now higher for B2C brands (15%) than B2B brands (11.8%) because B2C marketers tend to have a broader realm of control than B2B marketers do. Interestingly, budgets for these companies are also higher for service (14.5%) than for product brands (12.8%), perhaps due to customer experience expenditures.</p><p> Many more areas of control could be considered. When marketing is responsible for privacy in addition to the more traditional marketing functions above, overall budgets leap to 17.7% of revenues. And when managing talent is added to the mix, marketing budgets account for a whopping 23% of revenues. However, comparisons here become unreliable, especially at the sector level, because there are relatively few companies at which marketing is responsible for areas such as talent (11.5%) or privacy (9%).</p><p></p><p></p><p>这个故事的寓意是什么？ If your budget-setting process relies on averages as a benchmark or the wisdom of crowds, make sure you&#39;re using the right crowd as a peer comparison. This requires identifying a benchmark that matches the responsibility profile for your company. Our CMO Survey analysis now provides a way to do so. While the above numbers don&#39;t provide a personalized benchmark, they are far more meaningful than the broad averages typically kicked around in research reports and the popular press.</p><p> A final thought for CMOs is that it&#39;s not all about the money. Above-average budgets come with above-average responsibilities. And that is a topic for organizational design: selecting a distribution of responsibilities that fits the company&#39;s strategy and marketing capabilities.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-end-of-averages-for-marketing-budgets/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> AI Ethics at Unilever: From Policy to Process</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ai-ethics-at-unilever-from-policy-to-process/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ai-ethics-at-unilever-from-policy-to-process/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 18:00:20 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Thomas H.

Most also realize that AI has an ethical dimension and that they need to ensure that the AI systems they build or implement are transparent, unbiased, and fair.</p><p> Thus far, many companies pursuing ethical AI are still in the early stages of addressing it. They might have exhorted their employees to take an ethical approach to AI development and use or drafted a preliminary set of AI governance policies. Most have not done even that; in <a href="https://www.conversica.com/conversation-automation-resources/report/ai-ethics-survey/">one recent survey</a> , 73% of US senior leaders said they believe that ethical AI guidelines are important, yet only 6% had developed them.</p><p></p><p> We see five stages in the AI ethics process: <em>evangelism</em> , when representatives of the company speak about the importance of AI ethics; <em>development of policies</em> , where the company deliberates on and then approves corporate policies around ethical approaches to AI; <em>recording</em> , where the company collects data on each AI use case or application (using approaches such as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomdavenport/2021/05/27/the-future-of-work-now-ethical-ai-at-salesforce/?sh=312432713eb6">model cards</a> ); <em>review</em> , where the company performs a systematic analysis of each use case (or outsources it to a partner company) to determine whether the case meets the company&#39;s criteria for AI ethics; and <em>action</em> , where the company either accepts the use case as it is, sends it back to the proposing owner for revision, or rejects it.</p><p> It is only in the higher-level stages — review and action — that a company can actually determine whether its AI applications meet the transparency, bias, and fairness standards that it has established. For it to put those stages in place, it has to have a substantial number of AI projects, processes, and systems for gathering information, along with governance structures for making decisions about specific applications. Many companies do not yet have those preconditions in place, but they will be necessary as companies exhibit greater AI maturity and emphasis.</p><h3> Early Policies at Unilever</h3><p> Unilever, the British consumer packaged goods company whose brands include Dove, Seventh Generation, and Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s, has long had a focus on corporate social responsibility and environmental sustainability. More recently, the company has embraced AI as a means of dramatically improving operations and decision-making across its global footprint. Unilever&#39;s Enterprise Data Executive, a governance committee, recognized that the company could build on its robust privacy, security, and governance controls by embedding the responsible and ethical use of AI into the company&#39;s data strategies. The goal was to take advantage of AI-driven digital innovation to both maximize the company&#39;s capabilities and promote a fairer and more equitable society. A multifunctional team was created and tasked with exploring what this meant in practice and building an action program to operationalize the objective.</p><p> Unilever has now implemented all of the five stages described above, but, looking back, its first step was to create a set of policies. One policy, for example, specified that any decision that would have a significant life impact on an individual should not be fully automated and should instead ultimately be made by a human. Other AI-specific principles that were adopted include the edicts “We will never blame the system; there must be a Unilever owner accountable” and “We will use our best efforts to systematically monitor models and the performance of our AI to ensure that it maintains its efficacy.”</p><p> Committee members realized quickly that creating broad policies alone would not be sufficient to ensure the responsible development of AI. To build confidence in the adoption of AI and truly unlock its full potential, they needed to develop a strong ecosystem of tools, services, and people resources to ensure that AI systems would work as they were supposed to.</p><p></p><p> Committee members also knew that many of the AI and analytics systems at Unilever were being developed in collaboration with outside software and services vendors. The company&#39;s advertising agencies, for example, often employed programmatic buying software that used AI to decide what digital ads to place on web and mobile sites. The team concluded that its approach to AI ethics needed to include attention to externally sourced capabilities.</p><p></p><h3> Developing a Robust AI Assurance Process</h3><p> Early on in Unilever&#39;s use of AI, the company&#39;s data and AI leaders noticed that some of the issues with the technology didn&#39;t involve ethics at all — they involved systems that were ineffective at the tasks they were intended to accomplish. Giles Pavey, Unilever&#39;s global director of data science, who had primary responsibility for AI ethics, knew that this was an important component of an AI use case. “A system for forecasting cash flow, for example, might involve no fairness or bias risk but may have some risk of not being effective,” he said. “We decided that efficacy risk should be included along with the ethical risks we evaluate.” The company began to use the term <em>AI assurance</em> to broadly encompass its overview of a tool&#39;s effectiveness and ethics.</p><p> The basic idea behind the Unilever AI assurance compliance process is to examine each new AI application to determine how intrinsically risky it is, both in terms of effectiveness and ethics. The company already had a well-defined approach to information security and data privacy, and the goal was to employ a similar approach that would ensure that no AI application was put into production without first being reviewed and approved. Integrating the compliance process into the compliance areas that Unilever already had in place, such as privacy risk assessment, information security, and procurement policies, would be the ultimate sign of success.</p><p> Debbie Cartledge, who took on the role of data and AI ethics strategy lead for the company, explained the process the team adopted:</p><blockquote><p> When a new AI solution is being planned, the Unilever employee or supplier proposes the outlined use case and method before developing it. This is reviewed internally, with more complex cases being manually assessed by external experts. The proposer is then informed of potential ethical and efficacy risks and mitigations to be considered. After the AI application has been developed, Unilever, or the external party, runs statistical tests to ascertain whether there is a bias or fairness issue and could examine the system for efficacy in achieving its objectives. Over time, we expect that a majority of cases can be fully assessed automatically based on information about the project supplied by the project proposer.</p></blockquote><p> Depending on where within the company the system will be employed, there also might be local regulations for the system to comply with. All resume checking, for example, is now done by human reviewers. If resume checking were fully automated, the review might conclude that the system needs a human in the loop to make final decisions about whether to move a candidate to interview. If there are serious risks that can&#39;t be mitigated, the AI assurance process will reject the application on the grounds that Unilever&#39;s values prohibit it. Final decisions on AI use cases are made by a senior executive board, including representatives from the legal, HR, and data and technology departments.</p><p> Here&#39;s an example: The company has areas in department stores where it sells its cosmetics brands. A project was developed to use computer vision AI to automatically register sales agents&#39; attendance through daily selfies, with a stretch objective to look at the appropriateness of agents&#39; appearance. Because of the AI assurance process, the project team broadened their thinking beyond regulations, legality, and efficacy to also consider the potential implications of a fully automated system. They identified the need for human oversight in checking photos flagged as noncompliant and taking responsibility for any consequent actions.</p><h3> Working With an Outside Partner, Holistic AI</h3><p> Unilever&#39;s external partner in the AI assurance process is Holistic AI, a London-based company. Founders Emre Kazim and Adriano Koshiyama have both worked with Unilever AI teams since 2020, and Holistic AI became a formal partner for AI risk assessment in 2021.</p><p> Holistic AI has created a platform to manage the process of reviewing AI assurance. In this context, “AI” is a broad category that encompasses any type of prediction or automation; even an Excel spreadsheet used to score HR candidates would be included in the process. Unilever&#39;s data ethics team uses the platform to review the status of AI projects and can see which new use cases have been submitted; whether the information is complete; and what risk-level assessment they have received, coded red, yellow (termed “amber” in the UK), or green.</p><p> The traffic-light status is assessed at three points: at triage, after further analysis, and after final mitigation and assurance. At this final point, the ratings have the following interpretations: A red rating means the AI system does not comply with Unilever standards and should not be deployed; yellow means the AI system has some acceptable risks and the business owner is responsible for being aware of and taking ownership of it; and green means the AI system adds no risks to the process. Only a handful of the several hundred Unilever use cases have received red ratings thus far, including the cosmetics one described above. All of the submitters were able to resolve the issues with their use cases and move them up to a yellow rating.</p><p> For leaders of AI projects, the platform is the place to start the review process. They submit a proposed use case with details, including its purpose, the business case, the project&#39;s ownership within Unilever, team composition, the data used, the type of AI technology employed, whether it is being developed internally or by an external vendor, the degree of autonomy, and so forth. The platform uses the information to score the application in terms of its potential risk. The risk domains include explainability, robustness, efficacy, bias, and privacy. Machine learning algorithms are automatically analyzed to determine whether they are biased against any particular group.</p><p></p><p> An increasing percentage of the evaluations in the Holistic AI platform are based on the European Union&#39;s proposed AI Act, which also ranks AI use cases into three categories of risk (unacceptable, high, and not high enough to be regulated). The act is being negotiated among EU countries with hopes for an agreement by the end of 2023. Kazim and Koshiyama said that even though the act will apply only to European businesses, Unilever and other companies are likely to adopt it globally, as they have with the EU&#39;s General Data Protection Regulation.</p><p></p><p> Kazim and Koshiyama expect Holistic AI to be able to aggregate data across companies and benchmark across them in the future. The software could assess benefits versus costs, the efficacy of different external providers of the same use case, and the most effective approaches to AI procurement. Kazim and Koshiyama have also considered making risk ratings public in some cases and partnering with an insurance company to insure AI use cases against certain types of risks.</p><p> We&#39;re still in the early stages of <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/big-ideas/responsible-ai/">ensuring that companies take ethical approaches to AI</a> , but that doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s enough to issue pronouncements and policies with no teeth. Whether AI is ethical or not will be determined use case by use case. Unilever&#39;s AI assurance process, and its partnership with Holistic AI to evaluate each use case about its ethical risk level, is the only current way to ensure that AI systems are aligned with human interests and well-being.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ai-ethics-at-unilever-from-policy-to-process/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Rise of Exit Bans and Hostage-Taking in China</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-rise-of-exit-bans-and-hostage-taking-in-china/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-rise-of-exit-bans-and-hostage-taking-in-china/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 12:00:18 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Jack Wroldsen and Chris Carr. <p>Jack Wroldsen is an assistant professor of business law and public policy in the Orfalea College of Business at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, California.

On top of the high-level geopolitical and economic risks to consider, the growing incidence of exit bans, which prevent foreign executives from leaving China if their company becomes involved in a dispute, imposes a very individual human risk. While there has been widespread media coverage of a few cases — the exit ban placed on a Singaporean executive from US investigations company Mintz Group and the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-65061116">detention of five of its Chinese employees</a> ; the tit-for-tat <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/huawei-s-meng-wanzhou-2-michaels-what-next-china-u-n1280229">detention of two Canadian businessmen</a> in retaliation for US fraud charges brought against a Huawei executive arrested in Canada — many companies operating internationally confront the reality of exit bans and commercial hostage-taking in relative obscurity.</p><p> This risk is increasing and unlikely to abate soon. Little in the ordinary course of business is more disruptive or volatile than the detention of company executives or employees abroad. Companies operating in China should prepare for these potential scenarios in advance.</p><p></p><p> Exit bans can arise from civil business disputes as well as more serious legal entanglements. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-chinese-law-raises-risks-for-american-firms-in-china-u-s-officials-say-cf62c1a0">Recent amendments to China&#39;s counterespionage law</a> , including vague, open-ended prohibitions on possessing “documents, data, materials, or items related to national security,” could easily encompass everyday business activities in any industry, exposing foreign executives to greater risk of arrest. The <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/china-travel-advisory.html">US Department of State recently warned</a> that the Chinese government “arbitrarily enforces local laws, including issuing exit bans on US citizens and citizens of other countries, without fair and transparent process under the law.”</p><p> Someone subject to an exit ban for business reasons often receives no advance notice before being prevented from boarding an international flight at the airport. The person is typically interrogated but not given information about the reason for the exit ban or how to contest it.</p><p> Exit bans in cases of business disputes are typically lifted only after the foreigner accedes to the demands of their Chinese counterparty — which gains enormous leverage in the dispute by limiting the individual&#39;s personal freedom. Even if the foreigner is willing to spend the necessary time and money to pursue the case in court while remaining trapped in China, a Chinese court is unlikely to rule in favor of the foreign party.</p><p></p><p> Consider Henry Cai, a native of China who moved to California with his wife in the 1980s and became a US citizen. In 2012, Cai invested in a Chinese technology startup for an 8% stake and served as a director of the company. A few years later, when the startup faced cash-flow problems and defaulted on a loan, Cai traveled to China multiple times to deal with the situation. Then, in 2017, Cai was stopped at the airport and denied exit from China, at which time he realized that he had been implicated in a lawsuit filed against the company by its creditors. Six years later, he remains <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-us-exit-ban-diplomacy-11668357015">stuck in China</a> , unable to pay the millions of dollars demanded to lift the exit ban. The human, emotional, and financial toll is high, for him in China and for his wife and their two children in California.</p><p></p><p> Another example is Brian Horowitz, a California businessman who purchased gas-powered blenders from a Chinese manufacturer. After a contract dispute arose because the blenders failed to meet California air-quality standards, Horowitz traveled to China to meet with the supplier. When he attempted to return home, he was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2011-jan-28-la-fi-china-horowitz-20110128-story.html">detained at the Shanghai airport</a> ; the supplier had filed a contract claim against his company, and the court had imposed an exit ban without Horowitz&#39;s knowledge. After two weeks, his wife wired $250,000 to the Chinese supplier to allow her husband to return home.</p><p> While exit bans in the case of business disputes are legal in China, foreign executives are also at risk of falling victim to illegal commercial hostage situations. In such cases, they might be confined in a hotel room or a company facility such as an office or factory. Holding commercial hostages is punishable by up to three years&#39; imprisonment. In practice, however, Chinese <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/08/chinas-police-think-hostages-arent-their-problem/">law enforcement often refuses to</a> intervene in these situations unless violence occurs.</p><p> In one case, a senior executive of a US jewelry company traveled to China to discuss a dispute with a manufacturer over a product order and a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3692138">$650,000 payment</a> . After the executive entered the manufacturer&#39;s facility, her purse and passport were confiscated. She was then taken back to her hotel and guarded by employees of the manufacturer for five days. She escaped with the help of a US lawyer fluent in Chinese who traveled to China, helped her evade the guards, and brought her to the embassy.</p><p> Another case occurred when a US company sent two midlevel executives to visit a Chinese factory that produced goods for it. The US company had already paid the manufacturer for the goods, but its executives learned that the factory workers were refusing to release the products because their wages had not been paid for months. The workers locked the executives inside the factory and demanded payment for their release. To free the hostages and obtain the goods, the US company had to pay both the manufacturing company and the workers.</p><p> Commercial hostage-taking situations are usually resolved within days or weeks, whereas exit bans might not be lifted for months or years. Neither situation is officially tracked, and businesspeople often keep their predicaments confidential. Nonetheless, based on data from the governments of six countries (the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, and Australia) and media reports, we documented more than <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/tie.22261">100 business exit bans and commercial hostage situations</a> in roughly the past十年。 This is likely a significant undercount, given that government documentation on this phenomenon is not comprehensive, and not every case would have received media attention.</p><h3> Take a Multifaceted Approach to Prepare for the Worst</h3><p> The acutely personal nature and the geopolitical dynamics of these situations make them particularly challenging to plan for and to resolve. How much should you pay to free your colleague (or yourself) from being held hostage? How do you talk to your employee&#39;s spouse about the reasons for their partner&#39;s detention and your plan to negotiate for their return? Is it part of your job to engage with the media to bring about political pressure to free an employee?</p><p> To prepare for such a scenario, it&#39;s critical that business leaders acknowledge the risk of this happening to their employees who travel to China, in addition to becoming more informed about it — such as by establishing a dialogue with others who have experienced it. They should also develop and maintain trusting relationships with US consular officials abroad, Chinese officials and police chiefs in the cities where the company operates, federal and state government leaders in the US, members of local and national media, and applicable industry groups, such as the US-China Business Council.</p><p> Companies should preassemble a crisis team and develop an action plan that assigns specific responsibilities to key employees and advisers in both China and their home country. This plan should include external communications, such as using social media to draw attention to the plight of trapped employees. And a company should consult with its business insurer to find out whether any relevant coverage is available to mitigate the financial impact of an exit ban or commercial hostage situation.</p><p> Executives with business interests in China should also pay close attention to accounts payable, contractual obligations, and the tone of business relationships to identify potential sources of conflict or disagreement. They should try to anticipate problems before they arise and should be especially vigilant about any outstanding debts or situations where a product has been delivered but, for any reason whatsoever, has not yet been completely paid for.</p><p></p><p> If a lawsuit has been or is suspected to have been initiated, or any debts are owed to a Chinese entity, companies should avoid having employees travel to China. If such travel is unavoidable, employees should remain in frequent communication so that others know their whereabouts and schedules, and they should avoid traveling alone. If a dispute has arisen but not yet materialized into a lawsuit, and employees must travel to China, consider suing preemptively in the US, assuming that a US court has jurisdiction over the Chinese business. For example, if the US company alleges a contract breach in a US court, then the employee should carry documentation of the US lawsuit, translated into Chinese, while abroad.</p><p></p><p> Leaders must also be prepared to support and help employees and their families. A crisis team set up in advance should have a plan for communicating honestly and sensitively with employees trapped abroad and with their families, as well as with employees throughout the company. Show that you care. Be transparent and truthful. These situations are emotionally draining, disorienting, and frightening; they are also opportunities to build trust, solidarity, and a culture of care. It is more about people than money.</p><p> Of course, it&#39;s important to remain committed to helping affected employees and their families in tangible ways.

Consider Uber&#39;s head of diversity, who hosted a workplace event titled “Don&#39;t Call Me Karen” to highlight the “spectrum of the American White woman&#39;s experience” and foster an “open and honest conversation about race.” Following backlash from employees of color, she was placed on a leave of absence. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p> Or consider Stanford Law School&#39;s associate dean for diversity, who tried to “de-escalate” student protests during a speech by conservative judge Kyle Duncan. The dean tried to placate the students, who were angered by the judge&#39;s anti-LGBTQ+ views, while giving the judge the space to finish his talk. But her intervention led to a public furor due to a perception that she had prioritized students&#39; feelings over the judge&#39;s right to free speech. She, too, was placed on leave. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a></p><p></p><p> If these conversations stymie senior diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) professionals, what hope do ordinary leaders have?比您想象的要多。</p><p> We lead a research center at the New York University School of Law dedicated to issues of diversity, inclusion, and belonging. Together and separately, we&#39;ve taught tens of thousands of individuals from all walks of life to have more meaningful and effective conversations across their differences. We focus our efforts on coaching people in positions of power because they have the greatest opportunity to transform the dynamics of these interactions — to foster empathy instead of provoking fear and division.</p><p> While the people we coach struggle with many types of identity conversations, disagreements are often the most agonizing. It&#39;s relatively easy to participate in identity conversations when you and the other person are aligned. When you disagree, you&#39;re likely to be flooded with angst and self-doubt. You might wonder: <em>Am I as enlightened as I thought I was? Will people feel hurt or betrayed by me?</em></p><p> You might be tempted to respond to such angst by capitulating to whatever your conversation partner says. Yet that approach is often not desirable, because it compromises your dignity and authenticity. We believe it&#39;s still possible to disagree on identity issues, even in today&#39;s polarized and overheated political climate. The key is to do it respectfully.就是这样。</p><h3> Locate the Conversation on the Controversy Scale</h3><p> We&#39;re both in same-sex relationships — Kenji married his husband in 2009, and David married his in 2014 — and we&#39;ve participated in debates over same-sex marriage in many forums. We have never enjoyed these discussions, but we&#39;ve found one feature of them uniquely awful: Our opponents have rarely acknowledged what the debate means to us or to other LGBTQ+ people.</p><p> In a prominent work opposing marriage equality, the authors insisted that people can reject same-sex marriage “without denigrating same-sex-attracted people, or ignoring their needs.” <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> They&#39;ve taken the same position in live conversations. In a televised debate about same-sex marriage, the moderator asked one of the authors, Ryan Anderson, to explain to financial adviser Suze Orman, a lesbian, “what&#39;s wrong with her.” “I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with you,” Anderson told Orman. “The question is, what is marriage? I think that marriage is intrinsically … a union of a man and a woman.” <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p> Although it sounded diplomatic, this response didn&#39;t recognize that from many gay people&#39;s perspectives, Anderson&#39;s opposition to same-sex marriage logically meant he thought Orman was a second-class citizen. Yet in our myriad conversations on this topic, we can count on one hand the number of times the opposing side recognized that we might experience their view as a strike at our basic humanity. That approach didn&#39;t require them to change their opinion. It just required them to acknowledge how that opinion might land on the other side.</p><p> In part due to that frustration, we developed a controversy scale that plots the subjects of disagreement along a straight line. On the left are the safest subjects, where disagreement is expected or even celebrated. On the right are the most controversial subjects, where the conversation is most likely to turn ugly.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> How to Disagree</h4><p class="caption"> Locating the topic of a conversation on this controversy scale can help you frame a difficult topic at a level where respectful discussion is more likely. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAG_Yoshino_Essay_Winter_2024_Figure-1.png" alt="How to Disagree" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p> Disagreements over personal tastes are usually warm and good-natured. When friends mock us for our love of trashy TV shows, those disagreements can strengthen rather than weaken the relationship. Disagreeing over facts is also relatively comfortable, provided it really is a debate about facts (such as who, what, when, where, or how) rather than a thinly veiled debate over values (framed as “alternative facts” or “fake news” ）。 The real danger comes when the topic drifts further to the right on the controversy scale. The most intense conversations are those in which one or both sides feel that their equal humanity has been put into question.</p><p> Imagine you&#39;re a Latine proponent of a workplace diversity and inclusion initiative, and you&#39;re debating a non-Latine colleague who opposes the program. We think you&#39;ll find it uncomfortable but manageable to discuss whether the initiative has succeeded in advancing Latine representation in the workplace (facts). You&#39;ll find it harder to debate whether diversity considerations should be factored into promotion decisions (policies). And you&#39;ll find it excruciating to debate psychologist Richard Herrnstein and political scientist Charles Murray&#39;s infamous hypothesis that IQs differ among racial and ethnic groups (equal humanity). <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a></p><p> The trouble with identity disagreements is that more privileged conversation partners almost always locate the issue at different positions on the controversy scale than less privileged ones do. If you think your company focuses too much on anti-racism, you might see the dispute as a policy debate over how the organization should prioritize different aspects of its mission. Your conversation partner, an Asian American colleague, might think you&#39;re trivializing her sense of belonging at the company. She&#39;s the one, after all, who has to contend with anti-Asian bias in the workplace. You locate the issue in the middle of the controversy scale at “policies.” She locates it at the rightward extreme of “equal humanity.”</p><p></p><p> You might find that after you recognize where the other person is on the controversy scale, you&#39;ll reassess the nature of the disagreement, moving the issue closer to where they&#39;ve positioned it. But you might not, and we&#39;re not pushing you to do so. All we ask is that you explicitly acknowledge your counterpart&#39;s position. At the outset of the conversation, you might say something like, “To me this is a policy debate, but I see how it could be deeply personal for you, and I&#39;ll do my best to respect that reality when sharing my views. ” There might also be times during or after a conversation where you realize you treated the topic as a purely intellectual exercise and need to recognize the impact the discussion might have had on the other person: “I&#39;ve been bringing policy arguments to the table, but can I ask how you&#39;ve been experiencing this discussion as someone whose life might be more directly affected by this issue?”</p><p> We think you&#39;ll be shocked at how much acknowledging your relative subject positions can take the hurt or heat out of a disagreement. This holds true even if those positions seem obvious to both parties. Often, what&#39;s needed is not more knowledge but more acknowledgment of shared knowledge.</p><p></p><h3> Find Uncommon Commonalities</h3><p> In the 1987 movie <cite>Predator</cite> , the character of Dutch (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) and the character of Dillon (Carl Weathers) greet each other with what&#39;s come to be known as an epic handshake. “Dillon, you son of a bitch,” Dutch says as they walk up to each other and clasp their hands together with their hulking arms in a V-shape like they&#39;re about to arm-wrestle. They refuse to let go of each other&#39;s hand. Then the handshake turns into an actual arm-wrestling match. It&#39;s an almost parodic display of over-the-top masculinity.</p><p> The scene might have been forgotten but for a viral meme. When social media users want to show two seemingly unrelated people, groups, or concepts that share a surprising commonality, they post a picture of Dutch and Dillon shaking hands. They put one label over Dutch&#39;s arm, another over Dillon&#39;s arm, and the commonality in the middle. In one instance, revenge and ice cream shake hands over the phrase “best served cold.” The epic handshake has also spawned other attempts at highlighting unpredictable overlaps using Venn diagrams. We learn that bank robbers, DJs, and preachers share “put your hands up.” These images help us see the handshake hidden in each arm-wrestling match.</p><p> This capability is critical, and cultivating it is harder than it looks. It&#39;s conventional wisdom that offering points of agreement is an effective strategy when disagreeing with someone. But as philosopher Daniel Dennett has noted, it&#39;s particularly helpful to find points that “are not matters of general or widespread agreement.” <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a> The idea is to find uncommon commonalities that surprise you out of your defaults. Too often, people settle for the bland ones that feel like empty gestures. It&#39;s like posting the bank robbers, DJs, and preachers meme and making the commonality “occupations.”</p><p> Instead, try to find uncommon commonalities that can liberate you as well as your conversation partner and help make even the most inflammatory of subjects easier to discuss. In recent years, hordes of concerned parents have streamed into usually sleepy town hall meetings to express outrage over the conversations about race being held in their children&#39;s classrooms. One such parent is Bart Glasgow (no relation to David), a conservative evangelical Christian White man from Canton, Georgia, who spoke up at a school board meeting to oppose the hiring of a DEI administrator in his local district.</p><p></p><p> Bart and his wife, Coley, decided to speak with four experts on the subject of race. One was Carol Anderson, a professor and chair of African American studies at Emory University and author of several books, including <cite>White Rage</cite> . On the surface, Anderson and the Glasgows have little in common. Yet in their hour-long conversation, both sides made considerable effort to find points of connection. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> Bart Glasgow noted that he wrote his senior college thesis on the topic of civil disobedience, examining figures like Henry David Thoreau, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. “I think what Dr. King did was amazing,” he said. “To take that biblical principle of turning the other cheek and to show love when hate&#39;s being shown to you.” Anderson noted that her father was “career military” and described being raised in the church and in a “God-fearing” community. They all bonded over their experience of growing up with the <cite>World Book Encyclopedia</cite> in their homes and with parents who would take them “to the woodshed.” They continued by sharing experiences of being in the minority in an educational setting. Anderson, who is Black, talked about being bussed to a majority-White high school. Coley Glasgow, who is White, shared that she completed her higher education at two historically Black colleges.</p><p> This exploration of common ground paid dividends. As the conversation continued, they aired disagreements. Bart Glasgow argued against an emphasis on systemic racism; Anderson disagreed. Later, Bart advocated for school vouchers that would allow parents to move their children out of underperforming local schools, and again Anderson disagreed. Yet these disagreements were remarkably civil. When the conversation concluded, Bart said to Anderson, “I could talk to you for hours.我真的可以。” Anderson replied, “Thank you so much for being here and asking these wonderful questions and engaging in this great conversation.谢谢。我喜欢它。”</p><p> The next time you are confronted with a disagreement, try asking yourself what you have in common with your conversation partner that might surprise them. If you&#39;re debating same-sex marriage, you might point out that many people — straight and gay — think marriage is an antiquated institution. So, despite your differences, you both believe in the importance of marriage as an institution. Finding those uncommon commonalities requires a bit of ingenuity, and it might feel taxing at times. But the payoff is big: Finding them can jolt both of you out of the reflexive and unconscious sense that you are adversaries in the conversation.</p><h3>展示你的作品</h3><p>Shortly after we launched the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, we received an unnerving email from a respected colleague. She asked us to use our platform as diversity and inclusion scholars to advocate for people who don&#39;t fully vaccinate themselves or their children. In her view, excluding people from schools and workplaces for defying vaccine mandates had “troubling” implications for the values of diversity, inclusion, and belonging. She invited us to discuss the issue with her so it could be addressed university-wide.</p><p> We received this request before the COVID-19 pandemic turned vaccines into a white-hot issue. Even so, we knew this conversation might be difficult. We passionately disagreed with her perspective, but we feared that neither acknowledging her position on the controversy scale nor offering an epic handshake would suffice.</p><p> So we shared our reasoning in depth. We stated politely but firmly that we didn&#39;t believe opposition to vaccines fit within the scope of our center&#39;s work. We explained that the center&#39;s primary function was to address bias against marginalized social groups, like people of color or women. We acknowledged that some groups, like religious minorities, were mistreated because of their beliefs rather than because of their physical characteristics. But particularly as a newly launched center, we weren&#39;t eager to stretch the definition of a marginalized group to people defined by their views on a single issue. We also noted that the topic of vaccine hesitancy raised complicated medical, ethical, and public health questions outside our expertise.</p><p> We had no illusions that this approach would change our colleague&#39;s mind. But it showed we&#39;d given her viewpoint real consideration, and it also offered her an opportunity to point out where we might be wrong. She thanked us for the thoughtfulness of our response, noted that she completely understood our position, and invited us to participate in an event on a separate topic.</p><p> Our approach to our colleague&#39;s inquiry was an example of showing your work — that is, explaining a disagreement in as much detail as possible to demonstrate to the other person that you&#39;ve thought carefully about the subject. The advice to highlight points of disagreement might seem out of step with our previous emphasis on finding common ground. But you can and should do both — look for points of agreement and share points of disagreement in detail. Paint a complete picture of the facts and values on which you&#39;re basing your disagreement, any research and conversations that have informed your current thinking, and any remaining doubts or uncertainties you hold. Over your conversation partner&#39;s lifetime, they&#39;ve probably encountered many people who have reflexively opposed their views based on shoddy or incomplete work. Showing the effort you&#39;ve made will distinguish you from those opponents. It will help them respond to you rather than to all those voices from their past.</p><p> A word of caution: When showing your work, don&#39;t offer a slapdash summary of the opposing argument before immediately dismissing it. Writer Moira Weigel has likened this mistake to “the first sentence of the last paragraph” of a high school essay: “I have thought of the other side already. Do not accuse me of not having thought of the other side!” <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> Rather than taking that cursory approach, take the time to research and understand the opposing view, and then share that understanding generously before you explain why you continue to see the issue differently. Show your work to show your respect.</p><h3> Manage Expectations</h3><p> Many people have a low tolerance for disagreement in general. If a contentious identity issue comes up at a conference room table, they immediately change the subject. If they have an argument with someone, they replay the conversation in their mind for weeks. David, unfortunately, is one such person. He&#39;ll run away from voicing a disagreement to avoid conflict, then stew alone in frustration that the other person doesn&#39;t agree with him. For whatever reason, he seems to have an unrealistic expectation that identity conversations should always end in a group hug.</p><p> People sometimes ask us anguished questions along these lines: “I&#39;m an atheist and staunch liberal, but a colleague on my team at work is a conservative evangelical Christian. How can we work together despite our disagreements?” Our answer: Lower your expectations. We admit this advice probably won&#39;t make its way onto a motivational poster. But we think it&#39;s completely appropriate to scale the intensity of the passion you bring into the disagreement to the intensity of the relationship.</p><p></p><p> A cartoon by Randall Munroe shows a stick figure furiously tapping away at a computer keyboard while a voice from the other room calls out, “Are you coming to bed?” The stick figure responds, “I can&#39;t.这个很重要。 Someone is <em>wrong</em> on the internet.” <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a> Most people have enough perspective not to care fiercely about disagreements with random internet trolls. But it&#39;s worth cultivating that healthy instinct in other situations, too. Each of us would struggle if we had a major disagreement with our spouse about issues of identity. Nevertheless, we&#39;ve both supervised and advanced the careers of students who disagree with us, because the teacher-student relationship is less intense than the marital one. The same goes for colleagues, neighbors, and acquaintances. When the relationship isn&#39;t as close, the need for agreement should be lower.</p><p> You can also manage your expectations of what can be achieved in a single conversation. As with any dispute over a heavy subject, identity conflicts often aren&#39;t neatly resolved in one encounter. The first conversation might go poorly, but the second might go better and the third better still. You might need to take multiple off-ramps and on-ramps to and from a conversation before you make progress.</p><p></p><p> When people engage in conversations about identity, diversity, and justice with someone who has opposing views, we encourage them to practice the four strategies we&#39;ve described:</p><ul><li> Locate the conversation on the controversy scale. To you, the conversation might be a factual or policy debate, but to the other person, it might be a debate over their equal humanity.</li><li> Find uncommon commonalities — points of agreement that are not matters of widespread agreement.</li><li> Show your work on the remaining disagreements to demonstrate that you&#39;ve thought carefully about the subject.</li><li>管理你的期望。 Scale the intensity with which you care about the disagreement to the intensity of the relationship.</li></ul><p> Despite the examples we&#39;ve shared, you might think we&#39;re being unrealistic about your ability to disagree agreeably on matters of identity by practicing these strategies. It&#39;s true that they can&#39;t ensure positive outcomes in all conversations. But we&#39;re confident that you&#39;ll see an immediate improvement in the quality of your conversations if you follow these guidelines.</p><p></p><p> Sometimes, of course, the rift between you and the other person will be too wide. Sometimes an attempt at conversation will end without a resolution. Sometimes the relationship itself will end. As awful as that outcome can feel, it&#39;s sometimes a necessary one. We&#39;re not here to guarantee that every disagreement will end happily. Rather, we want to help you ensure that a divide is truly unbridgeable before you walk away from it.</p><p> Other times, of course, you might be surprised in a positive way. Few, if any, meaningful relationships are devoid of conflict. When handled well, moments of tension can deepen a bond. Rather than nodding along insincerely or offering fake opinions, sharing a thoughtful difference of opinion can show the other person that you value them enough to be honest with them. Moreover, by modeling how to productively disagree, you can set the tone for how others throughout your organization can navigate today&#39;s thorniest conversations.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-productively-disagree-on-tough-topics/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 1</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
