Ransbotham：</strong>混凝土生产？家畜？苏格拉底式的方法？不知何故，我们谈论这三个。在今天的节目中了解它们如何与人工智能联系起来。</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon：</strong>我是来自 Aboitiz Data Innovation 的 David Hardoon，你们正在听的是<cite>《我、我自己和人工智能》</cite> 。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>欢迎来到<cite>《我、我自己和人工智能》</cite> ，这是一个关于商业人工智能的播客。每集我们都会向您介绍人工智能创新人士。我是 Sam Ransbotham，波士顿学院分析学教授。我还是<cite>《麻省理工学院斯隆管理评论》</cite>的人工智能和商业战略客座编辑。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我是 Shervin Khodabandeh，BCG 的高级合伙人，也是我们人工智能业务的领导者之一。自 2017 年以来， <cite>MIT SMR</cite>和 BCG 一直在人工智能方面进行研究和出版，采访了数百名从业者，并对数千家公司进行了调查，了解如何构建、部署和扩展人工智能能力，并真正改变组织的运营方式。</p><p><strong>萨姆·兰斯博瑟姆：</strong>欢迎。今天，Shervin 和我很高兴 David Hardoon 加入，他在 Aboitiz 集团担任多个高级职位。大卫，感谢您加入我们。</p><p><strong>大卫·哈同：</strong>非常感谢山姆、谢尔文。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>您能先向我们介绍一下 Aboitiz 集团吗？你在哪里工作？</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon：</strong> Aboitiz 集团是一家拥有 100 多年历史的企业集团，起源于西班牙加泰罗尼亚，后来迁至菲律宾。它始于大麻业务，但现在相当多元化，从主要业务（菲律宾各地的发电和配电）到金融服务、水泥、建筑、公用事业、房地产、机场、食品、农业。我们现在正在经历一场转型，正在成为——顺便说一下，我喜欢这个词——科技集团。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong> Aboitiz 数据创新是什么？</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon：</strong>大约七年前，该银行开始实现银行服务的全部数字化。正如您所想象的那样，这会产生大量数据。您以数字方式吸引消费者的次数越多，您拥有的数字服务就越多——嗯，惊喜，惊喜——您拥有的数据就越多。</p><p>问题也随之而来，我们如何真正使用它？我们在使用它吗？充分利用它的最佳方法是什么？正如你可以想象的那样，这个问题也超出了银行的范畴，涉及到其他企业。电源有很多数据；农业、机场等，都有大量的数据。</p><p>我们生来就有一个非常切题的使命：操作数据，操作人工智能。确实如此，我们该如何充分利用它呢？</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>其中有哪些用途？</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon：</strong>我的意思是，在通常的金融方面，我们都从超个性化和金融犯罪中学习。别误会我的意思——那些东西……总是让我兴奋不已。我在新加坡的金融监管机构度过了几年美好的时光。</p><p>但让我告诉你一个奇怪的事情：水泥，一个你不会真正与数据或人工智能联系在一起的行业。我们当时与首席执行官坐下来，我们说：“看，即使在水泥领域，你也有很多数据。”</p><p>这怎么行？那么，让我向您介绍一下水泥世界是如何运作的。这对我来说是新鲜事。基本上，这就像烘焙一样。我不知道你是否烘焙，但这就像烘焙。基本上，你有混合物。你有了这些类型的配方，最终得到了具有不同类型特性的水泥。这些房产绝对至关重要，具体取决于您计划建造的内容，无论是购物中心、高层建筑、低层建筑、住宅等。</p><p>话虽如此，就像烘焙一样，你需要进行一些尝试和错误。您需要尝试这些不同的混合物，以确保它产生正确的混合物。这会导致运营开销。这会导致浪费。我的意思是，就像烘焙一样，你把这些东西放进窑里——字面意思是一个熔炉——来烘烤它。使用数据，使用来自所有设备的信息，物联网，使用人工智能，能够在面包师开始之前实际告诉面包师，或者在这种情况下，化学工程师这种混合物的输出是什么，同时保持质量控制，这绝对至关重要。顺便说一句，这不仅仅是假设。去年，该系统已在所有工厂（菲律宾约六家工厂）投入运行，提高了运营效率，减少了浪费，实现了我所说的可量化的 ESG（环境、社会） 、治理]：CO <sub>2</sub>排放量减少35万吨。这是一个关于如何使用数据的很好的、不寻常的例子。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>嗯，我可以告诉你，Sam 和我会喜欢这个。我们都是化学工程师。</p><p><strong>大卫·哈同：</strong>哦，好吧，就这样。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>实际上，当你说烘焙时，我已经获得了博士学位。在催化剂合成方面，所以我花了很多时间烘烤各种铝硅酸盐来制造催化剂。你是完全正确的：你尝试了所有这些事情。一些工作;有些不起作用。如果我有能力提前知道，我可能会获得博士学位。在十分之一的时间内。</p><p>但说真的，这很有趣。现在，如果你从个性化、网络和欺诈开始，并且你也有烘烤水泥的这个例子，那么我们必须相信你正在考虑的事情有如此广泛的组合。请告诉我们更多有关该投资组合的内容，因为您可以做的事情是没有止境的。哪些事情会让你感到兴奋？</p><p><strong>大卫·哈同：</strong>你说得完全正确。幸运的是，在一家企业集团工作，你每天醒来都会发现新的东西。所以它有两个维度。一方面——我要回到<em>操作化</em>这个术语，操作化数据和人工智能——它必须对业务有意义。所以收入、运营效率、风险管理。然后我们必须看看即将发生的事情。我们必须进行实验。但这些可能不会立即部署。就像，在农业建设者中，我们有动物；我们有猪、猪和家禽。作为这一过程的一部分，我们希望确保动物得到尽可能最好的照顾。在实验方面，我们说，“好吧，我们如何使用已经可用但可能尚未完全应用于特定环境（而不是东南亚）的技术？”因此，我们对猪使用语音识别和图像识别来帮助识别压力和检测疾病，以便向护理人员自动发出警报。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>基本事实是什么？知道这一点会很有趣。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>这是一个很好的问题。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>训练数据是什么？</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon：</strong>这真是太神奇了。这是一种非常富有表现力的动物。因此，当你真正和照顾它们的人一起去那里时，他们可以直接指着它们说：“这只动物很痛苦”，然后你就可以不断地录音。</p><p>我们会说，“好吧，这真的是相关的吗？是否有意义？”比如，我们可以和面包师、化学工程师进行对话吗？当我们处理电缆时，我们可以与动物饲养员、兽医等或电线杆工程师进行对话吗？这非常重要。</p><p>这是我在从事数据工作的整个职业生涯中意识到的一件事，就是事情失败的地方，你突然在探索科学研究方面出现了这种分歧——你知道，我来自科学世界，就像前学术界的人一样——没有真正看到了这种连通性。如果我们一直追溯到雷达发明之时，事情崩溃的原因就在于“嗯，它还不完全存在；它不存在；它不存在；它不存在”。哦，不太好用。”这是第一部分。</p><p>然后，第二个层次是看到，嗯，这是否会尽可能地真正对我们的内部用户产生影响——因为这非常重要——对于集团内的许多企业来说，这实际上是B2B，就像电力行业一样，本质上我们提供电力和批发[电力]？因此，就预测性资产维护而言，我们的内部用户至关重要。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>这真是太棒了。我的意思是，你所说的在很多层面上都很鼓舞人心。一是，让你的想象力成为极限，对吧，因为“某件事可以做得更好、更有效吗？”这个问题。你能看到拐角处吗？”那么，是的，有数据。这是您给出的所有这些例子中固有的一件事。</p><p>你从大多数人认为非常先进和有趣的事情开始，我们的嘉宾一直在谈论这些：个性化、欺诈、网络。所有这些都非常重要。然后你就去水泥了。然后你就去养猪了。然后你谈到了人类和人工智能……</p><p><strong>大卫·哈同：</strong>是的。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>这也很关键。我只是觉得这非常非常充满活力。</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon：</strong>嗯，这是人类和人工智能之间的联系。我认为有两件事必须齐头并进——必须。虽然这种情况未来可能会在某种程度上发生变化——我的意思是，谁知道即将发生什么？事情变化如此之快。但我将是第一个承认这一点的人：当我为监管机构工作时，我确实意识到了将治理与创新相结合的重要性——令人惊讶，令人惊讶。我过去经常被问到这个问题，“哦，但是你不认为治理会抑制创新吗？它让我们窒息。”我认为，我强烈反对这种观点。</p><p>我认为它不仅不会扼杀它——它会带来更多、甚至更好的创新。从本质上讲，这只是简单地拥有常识。我很荣幸能够参与这个过程并提出 FEAT 原则。这就是新加坡金融管理局的<em>公平</em>、<em>道德</em>、<em>问责</em>和<em>透明度</em>。</p><p>我记得当它出来时——我们故意让它变得非常简单——我把它展示给我们的州长、我们的总经理，他就像是，“大卫，这不是常识吗？”我只是笑了笑，然后说：“好吧，不；”即使是常识也必须......它并不总是那么常见。必须写下来。”但这很关键。那是第一。</p><p>第二，你提到的是，是的，虽然人工智能和数据可以做看似神奇的事情，但至关重要的是，这种与我们人类的结合以及我们<em>如何</em>使用它从一开始就被考虑在内。即使是现在，显然每个人都在谈论 ChatGPT，但请记住：它训练的所有数据在某种程度上都来自<em>我们</em>。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·霍达班德：</strong>是的。你不能把人类从循环中剔除，因为一段时间后，他们就会失去人类的本质。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>但我们有这样的例子。我的意思是，在某些地方这是可以的。我的意思是，我猜你们俩都不知道如何通过星星导航，除非，谢尔文，你有一些我还没有学会的技巧。我的意思是，大多数人不开手动变速箱；他们驾驶的是手动变速箱。这似乎是一项技能……好吧，也许我们这里有一两个人会这样做。但关键是，我们不必保留所有可能的技能。我们只需要了解我们应该坚持哪些。</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon：</strong>这正是你所说的：只是一些，而不是全部。但有时你会发现你看到了这样的趋势，“哦，看看它能做什么。<em>一切都</em>变得自动化。”我记得，如果我早年担任顾问 - 你知道，我曾经是一名从事人工智能的顾问 - 你会发现很多时候，潜在客户和与你交谈过的人，即使他们没有说明确地说，他们想要实现的目标是，“哦，用人工智能自动完成所有事情。”</p><p>你需要有这种自然的倾向，说：“好吧，如果它符合上下文，如果它有意义。”就像你说的，也许我想学习星空导航，因为我对它感兴趣。我想学习占星学或天体物理学或诸如此类的知识。伟大的。但你看，它现在变成了一些人开始关注的小众话题。普通公众不需要知道如何去做。但我们需要能够确定那个决策点，而不是陷入“不，现在一切，人工智能盛行”的情况。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>嗯，我的意思是，你所说的是，正在进行的对话是有价值的。持续的挑战是有价值的。我的意思是，每次对话时，即使是在苏格拉底时代，对话也是对话的提升。你正确地指出，当你说人工智能是一切的那一刻，你就没有充分发挥人工智能的作用，那么你肯定也没有充分发挥人类的潜力。</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon：</strong>好吧，你正在失去一个潜在的答案。让我举两个例子。在金融领域，我们有菲律宾联合银行等。虽然人工智能治理监管<em>还不</em>是一项要求，比方说，在菲律宾，我们已经设立了一个工作组，这是一个有趣的人员组合，包括风险官、法律人员、合规人员，然后还有营销人员、客户参与度、体验。所发生的情况是，虽然仍然有模型验证等传统过程，但从统计、数学、数据的角度来看，模型已在该工作组中呈现给我们进行辩论。因为一个模型可能会通过所有的统计测试，但如果这个模型出了问题——即使是 10% 或 5%——就会产生重大的声誉风险，或者对消费者产生潜在的影响。这场争论很重要，因为如果你只是从统计数据来看，即使是一个潜在的自动化流程，你也会错过它。</p><p>现在，有趣的是——我诚实地告诉你，到目前为止，可能十分之八的解决方案——不是数据，不是人工智能。很多时候，解决问题的关键在于流程，即人。这让我们实际上变得更加明智和理解，“好吧，我们如何使用它，我们如何参与它？我们什么时候允许”——山姆，就你的观点而言——“自动化？”当我们说“不”时，我在一定程度上保留否决权。这就是一个例子。</p><p>另一个是如果我回到我的水泥[例子]，事实上，我们从一开始就非常有意地这样做，因为我们不想让我们的同事和化学工程师认为，“哦，太棒了。你为什么需要我？你只需要把整个事情自动化就可以了。”</p><p>不。重点是，我们绝对需要它们，因为可能有我们没有考虑过的新型混合物。你仍然需要进行这样的实验。整个目标是提供信息。</p><p>它带来的结果是效率。如果我再次向另一个人挥手——当 ChatGPT 出现时，一些论坛立即问我，“这是什么意思？”我的本能反应是，我没有对解放进行冗长的解释，而是回答说：“这意味着我们每个人都可以拥有 10 个人的生产力。”</p><p>这就是这些东西的含义，这就是联系、对话、整合、增强的含义——我们现在有能力提高生产力，无论“生产力”在这种情况下意味着什么。对于某些人来说，他们可能会说，“我只想工作两个小时，但[看起来]好像我工作了一整天。”有些人可能会说：“我想工作一整天。” ……可能会有所不同。但这就是它的意义，因为现在我们能够获取所有这些数据。</p><p>我相信你们中有些人还记得，早在 2000 年，网上就有这样的表情包：“从互联网上获取信息就像从消防水龙带里喝水一样。”这仍然是事实。我们被信息和数据淹没，但这就像将其提炼成与我相关、可用的东西，我可以用它做一些事情并从本质上获得收益。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>我认为从这次谈话中可以得出一件事——谢尔文使用了<em>“苏格拉底式”</em>这个词，而大卫，你使用了<em>“对话”</em>这个词。这样做的好处是它消除了我在很多机器学习中看到的傲慢态度。机器学习似乎是关于人类教导机器。所以这就是“我们知道一切。我们让机器模仿我们，如果它们这样做了，它们就通过了图灵测试，是的，一切都是黄金。”但随后你会遇到阻力，你会说：“哦，不。机器可以教<em>给我们</em>以前从未了解过的东西。”好吧，这只是改变了方向。它仍然具有相同的方向性傲慢，但你们所谈论的事情更多地[围绕]苏格拉底和对话。</p><p>当你思考这个群体可以共同组成什么时，舍文和我从去年的研究中得到了一些结果，该结果表明大约 60% 的人正在将人工智能视为同事。我觉得这是一种关系，因为在两者之间，是的，你会发现一些可能有人不会尝试的新化合物。我不知道化学工程中福斯伯里失败的等价物是什么。你还记得福斯伯里的失败吗？他学会了一种不同的跳过高栏的方法，然后突然其他人都采用了这种技术？这种想法似乎可以从这种方法中产生。</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon：</strong>您提出这个问题实际上非常有趣。我的意思是，我很想说，“哦，是的，我们一开始就有这一切的打算，”但我会很诚实地说，我认为这更多的是一个并非完全有意为之的美好结果在某个时间点。</p><p>但我想回到那个 FEAT 原则。其中一项原则引起了很多讨论——我的意思是<em>很多</em>讨论——我们在所有人中发表了一份声明，表示我们应该让人工智能至少遵循与人类决策相同的标准。因此，基于人工智能的决策至少应遵循与基于人类的决策相同的标准。辩论非常激烈，[人们]说，“哦，不，我们应该把它提高到一个更高的水平”，等等。</p><p>但该原则的意图是，如果您现在正在使用……那么让我再次回到金融[示例]：贷款拨备。如果[你]使用人工智能算法并且你发现“哦，我们在歧视”，好吧，是的，绝对，这是需要解决、审查和纠正的问题。但请把你的马放在那里。退后一步。将人工智能排除在外。在人工智能出现之前你有歧视吗？这确实是一个问题，因为……我记得我与许多监管机构进行了长时间的辩论。也许辩论这个词用得不恰当：与许多监管机构<em>进行讨论</em>。我实际上有点反对监管人工智能，我会解释我的意思。</p><p>我并不反对监管。但当他们说“监管人工智能”时，我有点防御性。我说，“我担心的是，我们会说，‘好吧，既然人工智能现在向我展示了所有我不想知道的东西，那么我就不会使用人工智能。我们将回到之前的相同程序，猜猜看，这是同样的问题。你只是没有注意到它，因为这些信息、知识没有浮出水面。”</p><p>所以，我一直争论的是，是的，监管必须发挥作用。是的，在某些情况下，人工智能可能需要更严格的审查。但监管仍以结果为准。该规定仍然是事实，例如，这是一个歧视案件。你不应该歧视；无论您使用的是基于人类的流程还是基于人工智能的流程，这都不是重点。但我只是想强调这一点，萨姆，因为它确实可以追溯到你所说的，它现在正在教<em>给我们</em>一些我们可能有时有意识地无知，有时无意中没有意识到的东西。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>大卫，请告诉我们您的背景。你是怎么走到现在这个位置的？</p><p><strong>大卫·哈同（David Hardoon）：</strong>如果我一路回滚到最开始，我自己会笑着再说一遍，我是怎么走到现在这个位置的？拘留。我就是这样来到这里的。</p><p>我一定是，什么，14、15、16岁，我因为拘留而被送到图书馆。而且，你知道，如果你在图书馆，你就没有更好的事情可做。我拿起一本关于 Prolog 的书。不要问我为什么，在我能找到的所有书籍中，我选择了一本关于 Prolog 的书。这确实是在了解整个世界之前，我想在这种情况下，这将是基于专家的系统。我开始阅读，但我就是爱不释手。这引发了我们如何更好地获取知识的探索？我们怎样才能更好地学习呢？</p><p>这显然导致了对神经网络、人工智能的更多了解。事实上，我是最早获得人工智能计算机科学学位的两名学生之一。从这个角度来看，它确实是全新的。</p><p>我的博士学位论文是关于语义模型的，顾名思义，就是知识、有效和信息的表示和封装； [它]是关于学习音乐模式/音乐，或者从大脑模式生成音乐。如果你以这种方式思考的话，整个想法本质上是为那些不能坐在钢琴前弹奏但具有完全认知能力的人提供基于专家的系统知识。</p><p>这就是我来到这里的原因。我知道这是一次非常奇怪的旅程。但是，是的，我需要感谢我的识字老师：谢谢你把我送进拘留所。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>好的，我们有一个部分会问您一些简单的问题。在人工智能方面，您最自豪的是什么？你做过什么让你最自豪的事情？</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Where to begin? What I&#39;m most proud of is the way we&#39;ve been able to graduate — and I literally mean that — from the academic world to the industrial world.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What worries you about AI? You&#39;ve mentioned some worries today. But what worries you?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> What worries me is I don&#39;t think we&#39;re fully appreciating what we&#39;re creating. I think we need to focus head on with the realization of what we&#39;re creating and what we&#39;re seeding for possibilities, for good and for bad.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your favorite activity that does not involve technology?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> SUP: stand-up paddling. Being on the water and just paddling away. It&#39;s extremely soothing. It&#39;s actually phenomenal exercise, for those who haven&#39;t tried.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I&#39;ve tried and I&#39;ve missed the stand-up part. I&#39;m OK with the paddling, but the stand-up seems to lead to trouble. What&#39;s the first career you wanted while you were sitting in detention? What did you want to be when you grew up?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> I wanted to be an astrophysicist.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your greatest wish for AI in the future? What are you hoping we can gain from this?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> I don&#39;t know. Self-actualization? I hope we learn more about ourselves. It&#39;s already giving us capabilities. I mean, for example, I&#39;m dyslexic. Thank heavens for auto spell-checkers!</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Well, thank you for taking the time. I think that there&#39;s a lot that you&#39;ve mentioned. I think we can go back to even examples of food 100 years ago. We had a terrible food cleanliness [problem], and now we have a supply chain we can trust. Perhaps we can build that same sort of supply chain with data. Thank you for taking the time to talk with us today. It&#39;s been a pleasure.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Thank you, Sam, Shervin.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah.谢谢。</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> And maybe, if I may just add another note, I think that&#39;s really the critical thing: It&#39;s AI <em>trust</em> . It&#39;s about trust.非常感谢。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Thanks for listening.

These technologies are taking over more and more aspects of business as they seep into the collective consciousness. As Vox put it, generative AI is “ <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2023/1/5/23539055/generative-ai-chatgpt-stable-diffusion-lensa-dall-e">suddenly everywhere</a> ,” and it&#39;s poised to profoundly change daily life within organizations in many ways, particularly in the sphere of communication.</p><p> More than ever, when people receive texts, emails, or other digital messages, they have reason to wonder whether an actual human being wrote them. ChatGPT is even being used to write <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/chatgpt-is-being-used-to-write-emails-big-companies-are-embracing-it.html">custom messages</a> to individual executives on LinkedIn. In response, tools are being created to help people determine whether a message was really <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90830518/tools-to-detect-ai-generated-text-chatgpt">written by a human</a> . Some of these tools are made by the same companies whose technologies generate such text. But few people are likely to use these detectors in the short term, and even if they do, there will be a continuous cycle of AI-based text generators constantly working to outsmart the detectors.</p><p></p><p> The net result is clear: When it comes to digital communication, we&#39;re unlikely to trust most “personal” digital messages for a while to come. This is why, in working to build authentic relationships, sidestepping technology altogether has newfound power.</p><h3> Handwritten Messages Take on New Value</h3><p> Few people answer calls from unrecognized phone numbers these days. And executives are increasingly aware that AI is also being used to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/11/why-chatgpt-ai-are-taking-over-the-cold-call-salesforce-leader.html">schedule such calls</a> , which can make them feel like just another name on a list.</p><p> In an effort to connect with decision makers, I recently tried going a different route: I wrote notes by hand to several executives and dropped them in the mail. Some of these have led to very positive personal responses and meetings, and even contract discussions. These relationships are being built on <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-on-books/author-talks-susan-mcpherson-on-building-meaningful-relationships-in-business-and-in-life">meaningful foundations</a> that could lead to long-term business growth.</p><p> There have always been people who prefer to write business notes by hand, but it&#39;s never before carried such a significant connotation — that a real person has taken the time to write out a personalized message rather than choosing an easier option. And a recent study shows how powerful that can be: Researchers from business schools at the University of Maryland and Yonsei University in South Korea found that “presenting a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10949968221102306?journalCode=jnma">handwritten note</a> has a positive and significant effect on customer spending” and that “warmth underlies the key findings.”</p><h3> Humanizing Communication</h3><p></p><p> A similar principle applies to internal communication as well. Some managers now use technology for things like employee recognition and turn to generative AI to create and send complimentary messages to team members. While this may be helpful for overwhelmed and exhausted managers, it can also reduce the sense of meaning and personalization that employees may be looking for. This is why handwritten notes can be a powerful way for managers to show employees — especially <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-create-belonging-for-remote-workers/">remote workers</a> , who aren&#39;t in the office to receive such recognition face to face — their genuine appreciation.</p><p> Writing notes by hand may not be the right move for everyone — such as if someone&#39;s penmanship is particularly difficult to read. But there are other ways to personalize communication, including creating videos or voice memos tailored to a specific individual, or even leaving a voicemail if a phone call goes unanswered. Some people block off a time in their schedule and say, “I&#39;m going to keep this two-hour block open in hopes that you might want to chat. Reach out anytime within that time frame, and I&#39;ll drop whatever I&#39;m doing.”</p><p> The key is to always be on the lookout for ways to emphasize our humanity in our communications. The more we do that, the less of an interloper AI will be in our relationships — and the more authentic and rewarding they&#39;ll become.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/amid-growing-ai-humanize-communication-to-strengthen-relationships/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Four-Day Workweek: How to Make It Work in Your Organization</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-four-day-workweek-how-to-make-it-work-in-your-organization/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-four-day-workweek-how-to-make-it-work-in-your-organization/#comments</comments><pubDate> Thu, 29 Jun 2023 11:00:45 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew Barnes. <p>Andrew Barnes is the founder of Perpetual Guardian, New Zealand&#39;s largest corporate trustee company.

It would be crucial, he knew, to still deliver the same output, customer service, and profitability. He landed on what he calls the 100-80-100 rule: “We pay 100% income for 80% time, as long as we get 100% output.”</p><p> The trial made global headlines — “We stopped counting when we got over about 14,000” — and Barnes was inundated with requests for advice. He started a not-for-profit organization and began helping companies on their own pilots, providing virtual workshops, mentoring others, and networking opportunities. The results, which now include data from 91 companies and 3,500 workers, have been analyzed by a team of academics.</p><p></p><p> And those results have been universally positive. “Not only are 90%-plus of employees saying they like the four-day week — and, in fact, they really don&#39;t want to go back — but companies are seeing material benefits in productivity,” Barnes said.</p><p></p><p> Barnes talked about the experiments and their findings during <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/series/work-23-the-big-shift/">Work/23</a> , an <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> symposium held in May 2023. He wasn&#39;t able to get to all of the questions from attendees during the event, so he answers some of them below. (Questions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity.)</p><h6> Is there any research comparing a four-day workweek versus five reduced days (at six hours a day, for example)? Do the results suggest that four days is the better way?</h6><p> Both are viewed by us as four-day weeks! The clickbait is “a four-day week,” but in reality, we talk about <em>reduced hours working</em> — the 100-80-100 rule. The key is that employees get the time off that&#39;s important to <em>them</em> . In my company, we have some people who take a full day off, others who take two half days, and others, often working parents, who work compressed hours five days a week. That schedule helps with child care issues, which a single day off would not address.</p><p></p><h6> How do you measure the success of the four-day workweek from the perspective of employees and teams when it comes to productivity versus company results like revenue?</h6><p> Obviously, it&#39;s easier to see whether there&#39;s improvement in company results such as profitability and revenue. We often find that people ask how we measure employee productivity. This, of course, raises the question of how productivity is <em>currently</em> being measured. All too often, it quickly becomes clear that many organizations use time as a surrogate for productivity.</p><p> Part of our program is helping organizations develop other productivity measures so that improvements can be more clearly assessed. A key part of this is helping employees identify the unproductive parts of their day. Simply eliminating unproductive activity will, by definition, increase productive activity.</p><h6> I find that much of what fills the time outside of tactical work are personal conversations and relationship-building. Do those things diminish when you move to a four-day week?</h6><p> No. In fact, the evidence suggests that these improve. By combining policies such as quiet hours (deep work), fewer and shorter meetings, and better social facilities (in our case, a better staff breakout area), we find that staff cohesion and team-building actually increase. By reinforcing that staff members need to work together to allow everyone to achieve the objective of reduced hours of working, there is often more time for these interactions, not less.</p><h6> Gallup&#39;s US panel data from 2020 shows that employees who work four days per week have higher well-being than those who work five or six days. However, Gallup&#39;s data also shows that the <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/358346/gallup-workplace-insights-learned-2021.aspx">percentage who are actively disengaged rises</a> among those who work fewer days. Gallup says that employees who already feel disconnected from their employer are likely to drift even further away. What do you advise companies to do to address this?</h6><p> In the context of a society where many employees work from home and are therefore separated from the usual workplace culture, the impact of reduced hours working is actually minimal. It is also necessary to differentiate between the old style of four-day-week working (where only a few worked four days and most worked five, often with the former receiving lower pay) and the new model, where everyone works a reduced schedule with no reduction in pay. Companies in our trials report significant increases in engagement scores. In the case of our own company, scores increased by 40% — to levels the researchers said were the highest they had ever seen in New Zealand.</p><h6> What differences do you see in the effects of the four-day workweek on people doing different kinds of work — say, between software developers and creative workers versus salespeople?</h6><p> Obviously, there are practical differences in how the work is actually done, but the impact on employees across the companies in our various trials appears to be consistent. Employees report being more productive, more rested, less stressed, and happier. It is a thesis of mine that healthier, happier, more rested employees are more productive. Who would have thought!</p><h6> What kind of training and prep do companies do to introduce a four-day week?</h6><p> We encourage organizations to take a couple of months to plan and prepare before initiating the six-month trial. Both the preparation and trial allow organizations to flex the process to find out what works for them. The bulk of the efficiencies and improvements come from empowering staff members and creating a culture where individuals recognize that they have to work together to reduce wasted time. In my own organization and in many others, training was therefore limited and largely unnecessary.</p><h6> How do you build employee trust to successfully achieve the stated goals when implementing a reduced workweek?</h6><p> Put simply, if trust does not exist prior to the implementation of the four-day week, it is unlikely the implementation will be successful.</p><h6> We run a 24-hour operation. Have you seen this done in organizations such as this, and what is the impact on the staffing numbers? Don&#39;t you have to increase the number of employees?</h6><p> In many ways, it is easier to introduce a four-day week into a seven-day, 24-hour operation, as the organization is already running shift patterns. A reduced-hour week simply requires shifts to be reconfigured. Remember that our thesis is that productivity actually increases, so in some operations, each shift can be staffed with fewer employees.</p><p> Alternatively, in people-heavy organizations such as medical facilities, it is likely that more staff will have to be recruited. The savings here, though, come from reduced recruitment time and turnover, fewer sick days (67% fewer, according to the trial data) with reduced impact on productivity, and lower costs for expensive temporary staff. Evidence also suggests that outcomes improve.</p><h6> Have you done this work with clients in consulting industries? What kind of success have you had there? How was billable time affected?</h6><p>是的。 PR firms, legal firms, and consultancies have all moved to the four-day week. Billable hours is often quoted as an impediment, but it is simply a mechanism to allocate costs. The clients pay on value and outcomes. If you can now do the work quicker under the four-day model, just adjust the cost allocation units. The client doesn&#39;t care. A simple example: Two consultants produce an identical piece of work. One takes an hour, one half an hour. Why would the client pay twice as much for the former? In reality, billable hours get adjusted in order to align the bill with the amount the client will pay.</p><p></p><h6> What obstacles did you encounter when making the switch to a four-day workweek?</h6><p> The principal obstacle was that members of my leadership team were highly skeptical, if not hostile, and my board universally hated it. Bringing leadership on the journey and helping them to walk the talk is critical for the project&#39;s success. I have set out the usual obstacles in various papers that are on the <a href="https://www.4dayweek.com/">4dayweek.com</a> website and in my book, <cite>The 4 Day Week</cite> .</p><h6> Can you provide sample policies used by companies?</h6><p> The 4dayweek.com website has lots of helpful material, including the research and a white paper. That white paper includes the policies we introduced at Perpetual Guardian to implement the reduced schedule.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-four-day-workweek-how-to-make-it-work-in-your-organization/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 1</slash:comments></item><item><title> Communication Is at the Heart of Positive Employee Relationships</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/communication-is-at-the-heart-of-positive-employee-relationships/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/communication-is-at-the-heart-of-positive-employee-relationships/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 27 Jun 2023 11:00:12 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Ben Laker. <p>Ben Laker ( <a href="https://twitter.com/drbenlaker">@drbenlaker</a> ) is a professor of leadership at the University of Reading&#39;s Henley Business School and coauthor of <cite>Too Proud to Lead: How Hubris Can Destroy Effective Leadership and What to Do About It</cite> (Bloomsbury, 2021).</p> ]]>; </dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Communication]]></category><category><![CDATA[Employee Recruitment and Retention]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership]]></category><category><![CDATA[Skills & Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Talent Management]]></category><category><![CDATA[Workplace, Teams, & Culture]]></category><description><![CDATA[In today’s competitive job market, companies must focus not only on finding the best candidates but also on fostering positive relationships with them, starting with the first step of the recruitment process through every stage of employment.

How leaders communicate with prospective and current staff members can significantly affect their organization&#39;s reputation as a place where people want to work. After all, having a culture that incorporates transparent and open communication is essential to building trust and loyalty.</p><p></p><h3> The Importance of Communication Skills in Hiring</h3><p> According to research, oral and written <a href="https://newmanu.edu/top-5-skills-employers-look-for">communication skills</a> are among the top five most sought-after attributes in potential new hires: Employers want workers who can effectively convey their ideas, perspectives, and knowledge.</p><p> Employees with strong communication skills are able to express their thoughts and emotions clearly, making them more efficient in the workplace. Additionally, they are better equipped to manage challenging conversations or negotiations with clients or coworkers through their ability to listen attentively, provide accurate feedback, and resolve conflicts.</p><p> Good communication skills also foster a better company culture: Employees create a stronger bond when they are able to effectively communicate with one another. This not only creates a cohesive and productive work environment but also increases their loyalty to the organization.</p><p></p><p> Hiring managers should screen resumes for clear and concise writing abilities and pay attention to how candidates speak during interviews to assess their communication skills. If appropriate, they should request written work samples before an interview to assess candidates&#39; writing capabilities. Candidates who can effectively communicate their qualifications and skills in writing will likely be able to better articulate them orally during the interview.</p><p></p><h3> The Hiring Process: Clear Expectations and Open Dialogue</h3><p> All parties involved in the hiring process need to be clear and concise when conveying information. Hiring managers must clearly define expectations, roles, and responsibilities when talking to potential candidates: One study found that 48% of employees who left a job early did so because their employer&#39;s <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/study-48-of-workers-have-left-a-job-because-it-didnt-meet-expectations/551179/">expectations were unclear</a> .</p><p> Establishing an open dialogue with candidates during the hiring process is essential for building trust and gaining insight into their communication styles. By using a combination of open-ended questions, role-playing scenarios, and exercises that focus on communication, employers can better understand each candidate&#39;s approach to their work and create a foundation for a strong working relationship.</p><p> Once a new hire is brought on board, providing feedback on their communication skills can help them understand what they are already doing well and where they can improve.</p><h3> Navigating Layoffs: Transparency, Empathy, and Compliance</h3><p> In an era marked by recession fears and downsizing, how companies handle layoffs can have a profound impact on their reputation and employee morale. To maintain a positive relationship with employees during layoffs, employers should prioritize clear, honest, and timely communication. This means providing as much advance notice as possible to all employees, explaining the rationale behind the decision, and offering support to those affected, such as career counseling, resume preparation, and job search assistance. By treating employees with respect and empathy, companies can minimize negative impacts and maintain a favorable reputation.</p><p> Furthermore, organizations must comply with laws governing layoffs to ensure the fair treatment of employees and avoid legal repercussions. Employers should be aware of their state and local laws to ensure that they meet minimum notice requirements and other regulations. Consider the case of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, where the initial decision to <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/bed-bath-beyond-to-pay-out-severance-to-1300-workers-after-initially-bypassing-law/ar-AA1aKgBG">bypass severance laws</a> led to lawsuits — and thus more negative publicity for a company that had recently declared bankruptcy — followed by a reversal of the decision.</p><h3> Creating a Culture of Open Communication</h3><p></p><p> The key to fostering positive relationships with candidates and employees alike lies in creating a culture of open communication. This means valuing transparency, honesty, and empathy, no matter the stage of employment. Companies should also encourage open dialogue among all levels of the organization, providing opportunities for employees to voice their concerns and ideas. This can help to establish a sense of trust, promote a collaborative work environment, and, ultimately, contribute to the company&#39;s overall success.</p><p> In addition to fostering open communication, employers should invest in training and development programs that help employees enhance their communication skills. This benefits the individuals, contributes to a more effective and cohesive work environment, and can, ultimately, lead to greater success for the organization and a more productive work environment overall. By prioritizing communication at every stage of the employee life cycle, managers can foster a positive work culture in which individuals feel valued, supported, and empowered to succeed.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/communication-is-at-the-heart-of-positive-employee-relationships/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> It&#39;s Time to Face the Three Challenges of Learning</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/its-time-to-face-the-three-challenges-of-learning/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/its-time-to-face-the-three-challenges-of-learning/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 26 Jun 2023 11:00:08 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Lynda Gratton. <p>Lynda Gratton ( <a href="https://twitter.com/lyndagratton">@lyndagratton</a> ) is a professor of management practice at London Business School and founder of the advisory practice HSM.

But at a recent research workshop that my team and I ran with executives from over 40 companies, it became clear that organizations&#39; traditional learning models are facing pressure from the emergence of new work models. The participants identified these three learning challenges as the most acute:</p><p> <strong>1. Increased workloads have reduced learning time.</strong> Eighty-eight percent of executives at our workshop chose workload pressures as one of their top challenges. They said that many employees, particularly those managing others, feel that their workloads have significantly increased in recent years. Some shared sensitive internal data that suggests burnout has increased during that period. The net result of higher workloads is that employees not only lack the headspace for learning but also feel pressured to prioritize work tasks over learning activities. Battling this challenge will require leaders to maximize the value of any available learning time.</p><p></p><p> <strong>2. Hybrid work has increased the complexity of learning.</strong> Two-thirds (66%) of executives said that flexibility in terms of where and when employees work is an important challenge. Executives fretted that employees may not be connected in moments that matter for formal and informal learning. Managers reported that they find it more difficult to identify development opportunities for remote employees and that they fear that remote work is having a negative impact on how people share tacit knowledge. Indeed, research shows that 47% of employees are concerned about <a href="https://newsroom.poly.com/English/press-releases/news-details/2021/Poly-Evolution-of-the-Workplace-Report-Highlights-Need-for-Work-Equity-and-Total-Meeting-Equality-for-Hybrid-Workers/">missing out on informal learning opportunities</a> while working from home. Addressing this challenge will require leaders to build a robust learning strategy in a hybrid business environment.</p><p> <strong>3. A tightening labor market has brought skill shortages.</strong> Sixty-five percent of executives identified finding workers with specialized skills as a major challenge. Many of the executives we spoke with said their companies have historically looked to the external labor market for these specialty hires. However, as the market tightens, particularly for hard-to-find digital skills, the focus has shifted to boosting the skills of internal employees. Reskilling has always been seen as important, but now it&#39;s critical. Tackling this challenge will require leaders to align business strategy with expertly executed upskilling and reskilling initiatives.</p><p> While these are tough challenges to face, executives also acknowledge how important it is to solve them. Skill shortages are one reason, but there is also the significant motivational impact of successful corporate learning.</p><p> In today&#39;s volatile labor market, where employees are quick to move from one job to a more advantageous opportunity, the chance to learn something new that will be valuable in the future is a central reason why they stay. Indeed, studies show that 76% of employees say they would <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work-is-just-work">stay at their jobs longer</a> if they could benefit from learning and development support.</p><p> Moreover, in the face of growing concerns about workplace inequalities, there is a perception that <a href="https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/files/5552_en.pdf">skills-based learning</a> can help to significantly reduce them. This is particularly the case for employees who are not highfliers, who don&#39;t have a college degree or an educational certificate, or who have historically been excluded.</p><p></p><h3> How Companies Are Relearning How to Learn</h3><p> So here is the paradox: At the very time that learning is seen as a crucial part of the business strategy of many companies, those tasked with delivering on a learning agenda describe significant uphill battles.</p><p> Still, I&#39;m seeing experiments by managers who are rising to the occasion by trying out new ways of learning and new ways of delivering learning that can be models for others in similar situations. Here&#39;s how they&#39;re addressing the three essential concerns.</p><h4> 1. They&#39;re using personalization to maximize the value of learning time.</h4><p> One way of making sure every hour devoted to learning counts is by closely aligning learning with the specific needs of the learner. This kind of personalization is typically hard to deliver at scale. But experimentation with virtual and online instruction has opened up routes toward personalizing learning.</p><p> One approach is to develop learning plans, or pathways. At the Dublin-based law firm Matheson, the learning team offers 12 learning pathways (that change annually) from which employees can choose, such as the client experience or environmental, social, and corporate governance issues. Each pathway is a blend of participation in core projects and tutorials delivered by employees who are subject matter experts. One important innovation is that the pathways are available to both lawyers and business service employees. A member of the learning team told me that the approach is designed to break down the traditional siloes between those communities and embed learning into the natural flow of work.</p><p></p><p> Other organizations have approached the task of personalized learning by using AI-driven career diagnostics. Accenture developed an AI tool called Job Buddy to help employees build individual learning plans based on data about themselves, their group, and the external labor market. The tool was designed to use machine learning algorithms to suggest career paths and upskilling opportunities based on an individual&#39;s current job, skills, and experience. Following this individual diagnostic, a learning platform provided resources such as online courses, workshops, and mentoring programs.</p><h4> 2. They&#39;re leaning into the hybrid experience.</h4><p> The pandemic increased the prevalence of hybrid working and set the scene for learning to be as flexible as work is.</p><p></p><p> At global online marketplace Etsy, peer-to-peer learning has always been a priority. Zofia Ciechowska, Etsy&#39;s vice president of strategy and operations, told me that learning is viewed as an opportunity for employees and even vendors to share their knowledge, skills, or craft with the community. Employees have run courses on a vast range of topics as diverse as how to navigate the Tokyo subway system and how to make a candle. The sheer variety of courses is a reflection of Etsy&#39;s culture and mission of keeping commerce “human” by enabling people to showcase their talents and educate one another.</p><p> Crucially, in the spirit of hybrid work, Etsy&#39;s workshops are delivered both face to face and online. Employees, whatever their work schedules, are able to participate fully. This rich community-based learning program has successfully driven informal connections, piqued curiosity, and resulted in robust employee engagement scores.</p><p> The learning team said it has been fascinating to see the benefits of learning flow in both directions — for the person being taught as well as those delivering the courses. Employees get a chance to show off their passions and engage with their peers by sharing knowledge they are proud of.</p><h4> 3. They&#39;re reducing skill shortages by focusing on transferable skills.</h4><p> In the face of tightening labor markets and skill shortages, the most obvious learning strategy is to focus on reskilling current employees rather than recruiting new ones. The challenge, as many executives shared, is that this is fiendishly hard, particularly at scale.</p><p> As an international bank, HSBC is changing constantly, and reskilling is essential to delivering on its strategic plan. The bank is working to ensure that all employees are equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to grow in their careers so they can be successful now and in the future.</p><p> The bank recently rolled out a skills-based development program for internal candidates who want to pursue a career in wealth services. By spending 20% of their working time over a period of three to nine months, participants were able to identify, assess, and develop the transferable skills they needed to move into relationship manager roles in the bank&#39;s wealth and private banking services businesses.</p><p></p><p> “This pioneering program is helping us build a strategic talent pipeline for a very important part of our business,” said Laura Powell, HSBC&#39;s global head of HR for wealth and personal banking and global functions. HSBC plans to extend the program to external candidates later this year.</p><p></p><p> Only 2% of executives who were part of our research workshop on learning said they believe that instructor-led learning will be a priority for their organization going forward. Instead, 39% said that “in the workflow” learning would be more important.</p><p> What has come through crystal clear is that while some of the more traditional forms of learning are diminishing, experiments and new projects are demonstrating how significant challenges can be overcome.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/its-time-to-face-the-three-challenges-of-learning/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> How to Help Employees With ADHD Address the Challenges of Remote Work</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-help-employees-with-adhd-address-the-challenges-of-remote-work/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-help-employees-with-adhd-address-the-challenges-of-remote-work/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 22 Jun 2023 11:00:24 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Maria Hamdani, Najma Hamdani, and Maitraye Das. <p>Maria Hamdani, Ph.D., is a professor of management in the College of Business at the University of Akron.

As organizations refine their virtual work practices, it is important to ensure that they are inclusive of neurodivergent employees. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is among the most prevalent neurodivergent conditions. While some individuals with ADHD may find that remote work is well suited to their needs and gives them a greater degree of control over their work environment, others may find that remote work presents unique challenges. Remote work often lacks concrete time cues and can introduce different kinds of distractions and methods for sharing information than an in-person office setting, which can be challenging for some people with ADHD. If these challenges are not managed effectively, they can lead to a host of issues, such as burnout, anxiety, productivity loss, demotivation, and, ultimately, quitting. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p> Managers can work with employees with ADHD to implement simple strategies to better tailor remote work to their needs. Because employees may be undiagnosed or choose not to disclose their neurodivergent conditions, the five evidence-based interventions we suggest below can help foster better remote work practices to the benefit of all employees. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> But before we go into more detail about those, let&#39;s briefly discuss ADHD.</p><p></p><h3> Understanding ADHD</h3><p> ADHD stems from structural differences in brain regions and variations in cellular and neural mechanisms that pose challenges to the daily self-regulation of goal-directed behaviors. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> Consequently, executive functions such as attention, time management, working memory, response inhibition, and mental processing of rewards operate differently to varying degrees in people with ADHD. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> These executive processes work together to help translate our bigger goals, visions, knowledge, and skills into daily goal-directed actions across all aspects of our lives, including work. Some individuals with ADHD may find that their differences disrupt these goal-oriented actions, even when they possess a clear vision, knowledge, skills, and motivation. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> Though medication can help regulate concentration, inhibition, and working memory, inclusive work practices and accommodations across five daily behavior dimensions can help to unlock potential and create the conditions for success. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p> ADHD is often underdiagnosed in adults due to the misconception that it is only a childhood diagnosis or one that all children eventually grow out of. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> Gender and racial disparities in underdiagnosis introduce additional complications. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> Undiagnosed and untreated ADHD can lead to secondary anxiety and depression, as well as significant and sometimes devastating costs at both an individual and collective level in terms of lost productivity, health care expenses, unemployment, justice system impacts, and spillover costs to family members. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a> A proper ADHD diagnosis and inclusive work practices can reduce these costs and enable individuals with ADHD to live fuller work and personal lives.</p><p></p><p> Gender differences in ADHD are frequently overlooked, which has widened the diagnosis and treatment gap for women. <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a> Males are three times more likely to receive an ADHD diagnosis than females, and they are typically diagnosed at a much younger age. <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a> Many early educators mistakenly believe that ADHD is mainly a diagnosis for boys and thus under-identify it in girls. Males generally present with hyperactivity and external displays of problems (such as classroom disruptions or fighting with peers), whereas females often internalize the symptoms of inattention, exhibiting low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. This makes detection and referral more challenging among females, who may be misdiagnosed with anxiety or depression rather than ADHD. In the workplace, women with ADHD may feel overwhelmed and unsupported, and consequent low self-esteem and anxiety about deadlines or project details, or worries about making mistakes, can lead to decreased productivity, weakened performance, and missed career opportunities.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> ADHD Resources for Better Understanding</h4><ul><li> National Institute of Mental Health: “ <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/adhd-what-you-need-to-know">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Adults: What You Need to Know</a> ”</li><li> Children and Adults With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: “ <a href="https://chadd.org/for-adults/diagnosis-of-adhd-in-adults/">Diagnosis of ADHD in Adults</a> ”</li><li> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: “ <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/diagnosis.html">Symptoms and Diagnosis of ADHD</a> ”</li><li> Russell A.

Aligning virtual work practices around these suggestions can enhance the productivity of all employees. That said, neurodivergent employees often know what conditions are most conducive to their effectiveness at work and should be consulted on changes to work practices that affect them. </p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand-column"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Inclusive Virtual Work Practices to Enhance Productivity</h4><p class="caption"> In remote work environments, leaders can adopt these approaches to enhance the productivity of all employees, whether they&#39;ve been diagnosed with ADHD or not. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-06-22_Hamdani_Figure.png" alt="Inclusive Virtual Work Practices to Enhance Productivity"><br /></article></aside></div><p></p><h4> 1. Time Management and Planning</h4><p> While individuals with ADHD can effectively formulate a big goal or vision, some of them might struggle with daily minutiae, in large part due to <em>time blindness</em> , which is a skewed perception of time. <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a> This can lead to difficulty organizing activities in a timely manner to fulfill daily tasks and meet demands, along with procrastination, missed deadlines, forgotten and unfinished tasks, and difficulties with multitasking. Time management can be especially challenging in remote work models due to the lack of external time cues, such as driving to work or lunch breaks, and weaker daily supervision and accountability in these settings.</p><p> To support planning and time management, managers should work with their reports to translate big goals into daily, actionable chunks using an easily accessible daily planner. They can also create a daily accountability system, such as peer check-ins or daily progress charts. Using tangible markers of the passage of time, such as putting a clock on one&#39;s home office desk, scheduling daily reminders to start a task, and setting timers to finish tasks, followed by breaks, can help as well. Whenever possible, managers should consider offering extended deadlines to factor in difficulties with time perception.</p><p> When working with virtual teams, managers should balance meeting schedules and productivity expectations. <a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a> Think carefully about how many weekly team meetings are necessary and, when possible, use asynchronous communication to help employees perform the assigned tasks at their preferred time. Implementing a hybrid model in which people go to the office some days to attend meetings and remain home (or in a distraction-free office space) other days for focused work can be a viable option to balance productivity with meeting schedules.</p><h4> 2. Mental Organization and Working Memory</h4><p> Due to differences in their working memory, some adults with ADHD may benefit from using external tools to do simple calculations, keep multiple pieces of information in mind while solving a problem, organize their thoughts while communicating, and remember to return calls or keep appointments. To support mental organization, encourage the use of external tools that bring important information into one&#39;s visual field, such as daily checklists, Post-it notes, written instructions, color-coded visual cues, and clearly visible deadlines.</p><p> Remote work can be mentally taxing and feel overwhelming due to the speed and volume of information sharing. Having to attend multiple virtual meetings — which can incorporate a mix of video, audio, text chat, and file sharing — within a single day can be especially demanding, particularly for neurodivergent employees.</p><p> Rather than creating a competitive atmosphere where everyone vies for a chance to be heard, consider ways to make virtual meetings more accommodating and inclusive. For example, meeting organizers can formalize routines for taking turns and allowing people time to gather their thoughts before speaking; schedule pauses for questions and answers; and turn off chat features for large groups, to minimize distracting cross-talk. Sharing materials in advance and distributing notes, recordings, and transcripts afterward can also be especially helpful for those who find it difficult to take notes while simultaneously paying attention to conversations.</p><h4> 3. Self-Motivation on Prolonged Tasks</h4><p> Certain individuals with ADHD might find it tough to stay motivated and focused during lengthy tasks without immediate rewards. Managers can encourage these employees to break down larger tasks into smaller steps, complete with mini deadlines and rewards. For instance, set 30-minute or one-hour goals and celebrate each accomplishment with small rewards, such as a cup of coffee or a short stroll outside. It&#39;s important to set timers for these breaks to return to work; the <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-managers-can-help-workers-tackle-digital-distractions/">Pomodoro Technique</a> can serve as a helpful model.</p><p> To combat “Zoom fatigue,” allow for transition time in between back-to-back meetings, and provide breaks during longer meetings to regulate focus. This approach will help prevent employees from zoning out and can help them to recharge their mental energy.</p><h4> 4. Inhibition of Impulses</h4><p> Individuals with ADHD can struggle with impulse control, causing them to react inappropriately, make impulsive comments, interrupt others, talk excessively, be emotionally reactive, experience difficulty waiting, or not recognize and fix mistakes quickly. These challenges can be even more prominent in remote settings, where social cues are limited.</p><p> Employing a coaching and feedback model can increase employees&#39; self-awareness about impulsive behaviors. <a id="reflink14" class="reflink" href="#ref14">14</a> Rapport-building practices, such as the use of a workstyle preference survey, can help managers discover ways to increase productivity and minimize frustration for neurodivergent employees. <a id="reflink15" class="reflink" href="#ref15">15</a> Remember to be compassionate and give employees grace; behaviors such as zoning out or speaking out of turn aren&#39;t due to laziness or ill intentions but rather stem from differences in how information is processed.</p><p></p><p> Consider posting guidelines of best practices in a visible location to provide a clear framework for action. Similarly, incorporate productivity strategies like digital <a href=" https://chadd.org/adhd-news/adhd-news-adults/could-a-body-double-help-you-increase-your-productivity/">body doubling</a> , in which employees can accomplish tasks that they find frustrating by working alongside others through virtual coworking apps (such as Flown or Focusmate) to help maintain focus on the tasks at hand. <a id="reflink16" class="reflink" href="#ref16">16</a> In addition, encouraging regular physical exercise and calming practices in daily routines is essential to help people replenish the mental resources required for self-control and inhibition of impulses.</p><h4> 5. Attention, Concentration, and Focus</h4><p> Remote work is fraught with <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-managers-can-help-workers-tackle-digital-distractions/">distractions</a> and requires special considerations to enable increased focus. To enhance focus and minimize boredom, consider providing adjustable desks, knee chairs, wobble stools, and active seating. Schedule breaks to help people avoid zoning out, and, when they&#39;re in the office, provide access to quiet spaces to minimize distractions. Consider offering assistive technology to help with task completion, such as dictation tools, audio recording software, and noise-canceling headphones, which can help all employees with productivity in remote and hybrid settings.</p><p></p><p> Our research has uncovered additional strategies that can help reduce distractions in virtual workspaces. <a id="reflink17" class="reflink" href="#ref17">17</a> Having meeting attendees use a uniform or blurred background can help minimize background noise and decrease visual triggers. Giving employees the option to turn off their cameras (for at least some part of the meeting) can be helpful to those who may become overly concerned about or distracted by their own facial expressions. Managers should also be mindful of the flurry of information that is available during online meetings and should be OK with employees asking for clarification in order to refocus after a moment of distraction.</p><p></p><p> ADHD can affect people&#39;s ability to perform in many areas of their lives, including online work settings. Individuals with the diagnosis have different needs, ranging from not requiring any accommodations to needing reasonable personalized accommodations. The gender and racial differences in diagnosis, barriers to accessing care, and stigma have exacerbated ADHD&#39;s costs to individuals&#39; overall well-being in the personal and professional domains. By adopting inclusive work practices, organizations can better support and tap into the talents of a diverse workforce that might otherwise be marginalized and underutilized.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-help-employees-with-adhd-address-the-challenges-of-remote-work/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Focus on Skills to Grow Your Workforce</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/focus-on-skills-to-grow-your-workforce/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/focus-on-skills-to-grow-your-workforce/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 21 Jun 2023 11:00:34 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Aneesh Raman and Elyse Rosenblum. <p>Aneesh Raman is vice president and head of the Opportunity Project at LinkedIn. <a href="https://gradsoflife.org/team-members/elyse-rosenblum/">Elyse Rosenblum</a> is the founder and managing director of Grads of Life.</p> ]]>; </dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Employee Development]]></category><category><![CDATA[Employee Recruitment and Retention]]></category><category><![CDATA[Talent Acquisition and Management]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership]]></category><category><![CDATA[Skills & Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Talent Management]]></category><description><![CDATA[As the threat of an economic downturn looms, we are entering the fourth consecutive year of uncertainty and rapid change.

Three years ago, a global pandemic upended supply chains, and quarantines transformed how we work. Months later, a racial justice reckoning compelled businesses to make unprecedented commitments to <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/inclusive-hiring-to-build-better-teams-period/">building inclusive organizations</a> . Sustained remote work again challenged the status quo in the workplace and, in some cases, became a vehicle for accessibility. The ongoing tight labor market has forced companies to reconsider and adapt their efforts to attract top talent. And now advances in AI are poised to reshape the skill sets required for nearly every job in every sector.</p><p> All of these changes have brought HR to the center of C-suite conversations, with employers thinking differently about how to spot, foster, and grow talent. Rapidly, skills have come to dominate the conversation; the average number of posts mentioning skills-first-related topics on the LinkedIn networking platform roughly doubled from October 2021 to October 2022. And employers are working hard to put skills at the center of their talent strategies — from hiring to advancement — as evidenced by groups like <a href="http://www.oneten.org/">OneTen</a> and the <a href="https://www.businessroundtable.org/workforceskills">Business Roundtable</a> . As talk of a possible recession dominates many business circles, a key question hangs in the balance: How can employers maintain their growing investments in skills-first approaches to maximize a return on investment for their workers and their business?</p><p></p><p> New data from LinkedIn provides a compelling case for doubling down on skills-first efforts. The <a href="https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report">2023 Workplace Learning Report</a> revealed that Gen Z and millennial workers are the most likely to value opportunities for career growth and skill-building, even more than they value work-life balance. Findings also showed that internal mobility has become the second-highest workforce priority among C-suite leaders, with learning and development (L&amp;D) leaders reporting closer collaboration with executives than ever before.</p><p> With the youngest workers demanding skills-driven career paths and executive attention following suit, businesses that fail to maintain their investments in skills-first talent strategies will get left behind. However, there is a tendency during economic slowdowns to hunker down and revert to old, predictable patterns and playbooks. Businesses&#39; survival instincts compel many to, in essence, choose stagnation over innovation. During the Great Recession of 2008, the practice of insisting on a college degree for jobs that formerly required less education — known as <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/managing-the-future-of-work/Documents/dismissed-by-degrees.pdf">degree inflation</a> — accelerated. This backslide directly hurt businesses&#39; bottom lines through increased hiring costs and turnover rates while exacerbating an economic landscape that benefits the few and denies opportunity to many.</p><p></p><h3> Expanding Opportunities for Diverse Talent</h3><p> Today, business leaders have an opportunity to do things differently — and they&#39;re in a stronger position to expand a skills-first strategy — even if the economic outlook remains uncertain. Whether you are still struggling to get talent in the door or your hiring has significantly cooled off, there are ways to embed a skills-first approach in all aspects of your business that can drive stronger long-term outcomes even during an economic slowdown.</p><p> Finding people to fill open roles used to be a tedious, manual process. Without sophisticated ways to find and grow talent based on actual skills, the college degree became one of the few blunt instruments employers had available to verify that a candidate had certain skill sets and abilities — but it was one that <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat07.htm">left out the majority of the US workforce</a> , especially workers of color.</p><p> Today, more data is available than ever before to accurately pinpoint the skills we need and to then find the people — whether internal or external — who have those skills. <a href="https://economicgraph.linkedin.com/research/skills-first-report">LinkedIn&#39;s data</a> shows that organizations that embrace this shift and focus on skills can see an outsize impact: Organizations on LinkedIn who take a skills-first approach can expand their talent pipelines by nearly 10 times. Employers are already starting to pick up on this: Over 45% of businesses on LinkedIn are now <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/skills-new-currency-ryan-roslansky/">explicitly using skills data</a> to fill open roles.</p><p></p><p> To build the diverse, high-functioning teams that the future demands, employers must focus on skills — an approach that also has an outsize impact on diversifying talent pipelines. When employers require a college degree for a role, they automatically exclude 60% of Americans, including 76% of African Americans and 83% of Latino Americans.</p><p> Removing unnecessary degree requirements from job descriptions is foundational to skills-based talent acquisition, but it is not enough. Talent acquisition leaders must also invest in expanding sourcing channels and revising language in recruiting materials to ensure that it is inclusive and inviting. Further, interview questions and hiring processes should be anchored in the fundamental skills needed for a role on day one, not just on credentials or experience, and they should be crafted intentionally and equitably to uncover those skills.</p><h3> Investing in Learning and Internal Mobility</h3><p> While getting new hires with the right skills in the door is one way to invest in skills, there is an opportunity to renew focus on supporting current employees&#39; growth and development, especially in sectors where hiring has cooled off. The latest findings from LinkedIn&#39;s Workplace Learning Report suggest that 2023 could shape up to be a significant year for expanding upskilling and internal mobility programs, given renewed urgency to effectively redeploy talent to priority business areas. In fact, survey findings show that budget forecasts remain strong, with 41% of L&amp;D leaders expecting to have more spending power this year and only 8% expecting their budgets to decrease.</p><p> Investing in skills and skills-based career pathways for your employees now can pay off down the line. Companies have a nearly 7% higher retention rate at the three-year mark among employees who have <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/global-talent-trends">learned skills on the job</a> , according to LinkedIn&#39;s findings. According to the Workplace Learning Report, an employee who has made an internal move by their two-year mark has a 75% likelihood of staying with the company, while an employee whose role hasn&#39;t changed has a 56% likelihood of staying on.</p><p> Similar to skills-first hiring, skills-first talent management requires that companies make a set of complementary changes to existing processes and invest in new ones. A key step to driving skills-first internal mobility is defining which skills are required and preferred for a given role and how skills across roles overlap. From there, leaders can help their teams build robust career paths that empower employees to advance in their careers by building and applying the skills that align with their goals. Finally, communication and transparency across the business — and, importantly, to employees directly — about the career paths available and skills needed to access them is imperative to seeing increased rates of retention and advancement.</p><p> While momentum is building for upskilling and reskilling initiatives, there is a clear need to speed up progress. LinkedIn&#39;s findings show that 40% of companies are still in the early stages, selling their programs to stakeholders and forming their teams; 54% are at the midstage, developing and activating programs; and only 2% say they have completed a program. Four percent have not started at all.</p><p></p><p> Beyond the operational changes, fostering an inclusive, learning-oriented culture is also a core shift companies are making. Through work with leading employer clients, Grads of Life has learned that it takes more than financial investments in L&amp;D to ensure that employees from underrepresented populations stay and grow within a company. The organization&#39;s research reveals <a href="https://gradsoflife.org/equity-career-advancement-insights-from-underrepresented-employees/">disparities in both pay and promotions</a> for Black talent compared with their White counterparts. It is critical that, alongside operational changes, organizations also invest in change management and remove bias from pay and promotion systems to strengthen organizational culture. Taking a skills-based approach to hiring and retention is a significant departure from the status quo for most employers, and the implementation teams faced with putting it into practice will need guidance, training, and support to be successful.</p><p></p><p></p><p> Amid a cloudy economic forecast, CEOs are engaged in a careful balancing act between where to pull back and where to double down. Investing in skills-first approaches to bring on great people and grow the great people they already have will not just help them weather a current storm. Making skills core to your company&#39;s strategy will set your workforce up for long-term resilience in a world where all of our jobs keep changing.</p><p> Data from LinkedIn shows that skill sets for <a href="https://linkedin.github.io/future-of-skills/#explore">jobs have changed</a> by about 25% since 2015, and that percentage is on pace to double by 2027 — which means the core skills required for a job today look very different from the same job just a few years ago. And today, the new era of AI we are about to enter could accelerate this change even further, with 82% of leaders acknowledging that their employees will need new skills for a new way of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/will-ai-fix-work">working with artificial intelligence</a> .</p><p> It&#39;s now, when the seas are choppy, that the corporate leaders set to succeed in this new world of work will show how it can be done. Now is not the time to wait around for better conditions to make a change. There has never been a better time for businesses to update their thinking and rise to the challenge by focusing on a skills-based workforce.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/focus-on-skills-to-grow-your-workforce/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Social Science of AI: Intel&#39;s Elizabeth Anne Watkins</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/the-social-science-of-ai-intels-elizabeth-anne-watkins/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/the-social-science-of-ai-intels-elizabeth-anne-watkins/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 20 Jun 2023 11:00:48 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. <p>Sam Ransbotham ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ransbotham">@ransbotham</a> ) is a professor in the information systems department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College, as well as guest editor for <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> &#39;s Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy Big Ideas initiative.

Today we&#39;ve got a great guest: Elizabeth Anne Watkins, a research scientist at Intel. Elizabeth, thanks for joining us today.让我们开始吧。</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Thank you so much for having me today.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> As the world&#39;s largest semiconductor manufacturer, Intel is probably a company that most people already know, but can you tell us about Intel Labs in general and maybe your role specifically?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Just like you said, we&#39;re not always top of mind in the big discussions around AI and the AI industry and the AI field right now, but there is so much fascinating work happening inside Intel, and we have such a unique perspective on the field and a unique way of entering that field that I&#39;m really excited to bring some of that to light today in our conversation.</p><p> I just joined Intel in August of last year, and already it&#39;s been a really incredible experience meeting so many different teams. I joined Intel as a research scientist in the social science of artificial intelligence and work under Lama Nachman in Intel Labs. The group is called Intelligent Systems Research.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Elizabeth, you mentioned Intel Labs is doing some unique things with AI. Do you mind sharing with us some of the things you&#39;re working on?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> A project that I&#39;m particularly excited about is called MARIE, an acronym which stands for Multimodal Activity Recognition in Industrial Environments. So basically, I&#39;m going to start with a metaphor: Imagine that your computer could watch you put together, say, a piece of furniture that you ordered on the internet. When you got to a tough part of the manual, or you&#39;re holding a screwdriver, you&#39;re holding a piece of plywood, and you can&#39;t get back to the manual, imagine that your computer could see what you were doing, knew what the manual was going to tell you to [do], and then help you to connect those two. Imagine that your computer could actually tell you, “Hey, I think you are about to screw shelf A into bracket B,” or something of that nature. And I know that every time I have received that flat pack that they say has an armchair in it, it&#39;s a really tough time for me to get from A to B.</p><p> And it&#39;s processes like these that our people are doing inside of our facilities, where they&#39;re actually building and manufacturing the semiconductor chips. So the folks who work inside of our factories, our technicians, are doing very involved and very delicate work, handling parts and tools for all kinds of manual operations happening on the factory floor. And so all of the work that they&#39;re doing is just as complicated — sometimes even more complicated — than getting that flat pack into an armchair. There&#39;s a lot of tools involved. There are all kinds of different processes, different pieces of equipment, different sizes of equipment. And so we are building computer systems a little bit like the one that I described that said, “Hey, did you mean to put screw A into bracket B?” We&#39;re building systems to help the people inside of our factories do this kind of really careful and really complicated work.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Actually, that&#39;s a fun analogy. I mean, I think we all find flat packs challenging, perhaps, though I have to admit I kind of enjoy them. But I&#39;m sure it&#39;s much more complicated within Intel. And what I liked about that example is, I feel like so often we&#39;re talking about automation: Can we get machines to learn how to do something that humans do? That&#39;s machine learning [ML] at its core. And then we talk about augmentation and, well, how can machines help humans make a decision? This strikes me as a little bit different. This is going the next step.</p><p> So in this case, we&#39;re not trying to get the machine to assemble the flat pack. We&#39;re not trying to get the machine to assemble the semiconductor. It&#39;s still the humans doing it. And so it&#39;s the humans who are needing to learn here. That seems like pushing that a little bit further than we&#39;ve talked [about] before.</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> I&#39;m so glad you picked up on that, Sam. That&#39;s exactly what we talk about inside Intel Labs, is that the human is the expert. The human is the one who knows how to interact with these systems, and they know how to screw the bits together. And they know all of the physical and dynamic intricacies of what it takes to put these tiny and very delicate components together.</p><p> We don&#39;t want to train a computer to do that. A computer <em>cannot</em> do that. The way that this both assembly and cleaning process — because, of course, all of these processes take place within these super-clean rooms, where everyone has to wear hazmat suits and gloves … we want to support the humans who are doing it. There is no computer who could do this. It takes human judgment; it takes human expertise to do these processes in a way that is comprehensive and truly dynamic and can respond to new pressures.</p><p> If a larger piece of a machine bends in a particular way, or if a screw falls into a hole in a particular way — it&#39;s going to be many, many years before computers are able to assess and diagnose and fix these kinds of constant dynamic problems. But you know who&#39;s really good at doing that is humans. And so we&#39;re trying to center humans and center human expertise. And that points to this dual reason that I&#39;m really excited about MARIE, is that there&#39;s both a tech side and there&#39;s a human side. And on the tech side, I think MARIE is really exciting because it&#39;s multimodal. It combines a lot of different kinds of AI systems through ambient sensing. It combines computer vision, which uses activity recognition, with audio sensing, combined with natural language processing [NLP] in a way that can help build an ambient environment around the technician, ultimately to help them [with] what they do.</p><p> But before the system can help them [with] what they do, the system has to actually learn, and it&#39;s the human experts that are teaching the system how to learn and teaching the system what it needs to know. And so this is, as far as I know, a brand-new way to deploy AI systems into new domains and apply them to new problems. … We are confronting and tackling one of the big challenges of AI development, which is data collection.</p><p> You need a lot of data to get into a new domain. You need a lot of data that&#39;s labeled the appropriate way, labeled according to the kinds of problems that you&#39;re trying to solve. And so we&#39;ve kind of flipped the script: Instead of trying to get all the data we can <em>before</em> a system is deployed, we go ahead and deploy a system that then works in partnership with the experts on the ground, and they teach the system — through speaking aloud and through dynamic data labeling — they teach the system what it needs to know. And so, hopefully, the data that is going to be used to help people to do these tasks down the line is going to be produced by the very first batches of people who are using the tool.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That seems like a great analogy because as you&#39;re saying that, it reminded me of what you would do if it was a new human partner joining the project. You&#39;d go through those same steps.</p><p> Shervin and I have some research where we find that <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/achieving-individual-and-organizational-value-with-ai/">60% of the people out there are thinking of AI as a coworker</a> , and that&#39;s exactly the sort of relationship that you&#39;re describing. But it made me think of a little danger here. Let&#39;s say that when you put that system out there, it doesn&#39;t know much, and you&#39;ve got the human training them. All right; I&#39;m a human. I feel like I&#39;m a little bit annoyed. I&#39;m like, “Why am I having to work so hard to train this coworker?” How do you keep that dynamic? You mentioned there being a technical side of this project, but the social side as well. That strikes me as maybe harder on the social side than on the technical side.</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> That&#39;s precisely what I want to talk about next because that&#39;s precisely what I get to do. I get to talk to the people about what they actually think about these systems — and you are right on the money. Sometimes they do perceive it to be annoying, where they&#39;re asking, “Wait — so I&#39;m putting together this really complex instrument, and the system asks me what I&#39;m doing, and it&#39;s <em>wrong</em> ? So how am I supposed to spend time not only doing my job but also teaching this machine how to do my job?”</p><p> And so I am really gratified that I get to be the social scientist who is there right on the ground. We&#39;re still deep in development, and it&#39;s common for companies to do as much testing as they can, of course, before something is deployed and then, when the actual tenets of deployment come — things such as user experience and user interface designs — those typically come closer to the end of a development process. But here, the social science and the understanding of what people need and what people might find annoying and what they need to trust a machine that is a coworker with them is right in the DNA of the development. And so I get to consistently speak with the technicians that we are building the system for and ask them questions just like the one that you described, asking them, “Do you think this is annoying? How might this be more helpful? What are some other affordances that we can build into the system to make it more helpful for you?”</p><p> And also asking deeper questions, not just about their dyadic relationship with the system but also about their larger sociotechnical context of work. Asking about, like, “What does your schedule look like?” and, “What have your bosses said about the system?” and, “Is there a way that we could try to facilitate more productive relationships, not just with your bosses but also with your other coworkers, through this system?” And so our goal is to build a very deep understanding, not just of one task but an entire space of work, and ask how our system can help in the best way it can to amplify human potential by being a coworker for humans within this space, but also [asking], “How can it be built with an understanding of their work context in order to facilitate a long-term relationship?”</p><p> Because one of these things that&#39;s demanded by the fact that we&#39;re leaning on people to provide data and leaning on people to help us actually do the data labeling is that we need them to be engaged, and we need them to like interacting with the system, and we need them to find it trustworthy and reliable and useful. And understanding how all those goals can be achieved requires a deep understanding of social context and social habits and work habits and task flows. And so that&#39;s precisely what we&#39;re working on now.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I think it&#39;s really interesting how you seem to be thinking beyond just this project. There&#39;s the element of “OK, how do I get this particular project in place,” but underlying a lot of things you&#39;re talking about are things like, “How do we figure out the best way to introduce, essentially, a new system? How do we figure out the best way for how to transform and get to our overall vision?” And that transcends just a single project. How are you trying to pick up on those lessons?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> That is a really great question. I am really proud of our labs and some of the big bets that we&#39;re making on human-AI collaboration and how much the input and contributions and insights drawn from social science are being picked up, and have been picked up historically at Intel, throughout their research projects. As we&#39;re doing research projects and building products across verticals like education and manufacturing and accessibility, there&#39;s deep investment across the teams that facilitates and encourages conversations with folks like me — with the social scientists.</p><p> We often get these really fantastic teams in a room where we have engineers and data scientists and policy makers and social scientists, including not just me but a wonderful team — headed up by Dawn Nafus — of anthropologists, as well as another team of social scientists that has psychologists. And we all work together really closely to ensure that the products we build are not just designs to answer one problem but that they&#39;re properly engineered around what the best solution is, that we take advantage of all the different kinds of multimodal affordances that our tools can provide, and that we&#39;re deeply understanding of the social and organizational context that all of our products are going to be deployed into.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I think so often there&#39;s a transition that seems to be happening between when we were first talking about these models and tools and using data: Things were very heavily data- and tool-oriented and very heavily science-oriented. And that made a lot of sense because we didn&#39;t know how to do some of these things. And now, as a society, we&#39;re learning how to do many of these tools and model buildings. But a lot of the team you mentioned there — anthropology, psychology — these are not traditional things that we might have thought of [as] being integral to producing an AI application, but those are the ones you happened to mention. Why did you pick those? I guess that&#39;s some of your background in social science, right?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Yeah, throughout my graduate studies and postdoc work, I was always really invested in the users and in people. And I was always really fascinated by just how weird people can be and how creative and how innovative, and how folks often use technologies in ways that their developers did not anticipate and did not foresee.</p><p> And while there are some dangerous elements to that, as we&#39;ve seen in various misuse and dual-use applications, there are also a lot of really fantastic and wonderful ways that people have figured out for technology to be more suited to them in their context or to work a little bit more smoothly for them. And so seeing how Intel was different because of their history of being a semiconductor manufacturer and being deeply invested in hardware and having an ecosystem approach to the way that AI tools are deployed really showed me that they were a company that cared, just like I did, about the people who were going to be using these tools and the social structures in which these people were embedded, and building tools that could match not just the people who bought or used the tools but also the lives and the communities into which these technologies were going to be interjected.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Elizabeth, clearly a lot of your background has been coming through as we&#39;ve been talking, but could we step back for a second and ask you about how you ended up in this role at Intel Labs?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> I guess my road to this role started way back, probably at the beginning of my graduate career. After I graduated MIT and started my Ph.D. at Columbia, there was an opening for someone to contribute to a project on security and privacy behaviors among journalists. And my adviser said, “Hey, I got you an interview for this project.” And I said, “I don&#39;t know anything about security and privacy.” And she said, “Just go to the interview. I got you the interview. Just go.” And so the night before the interview, I thought, “Oh, I&#39;d better have something to talk about. PGP — Pretty Good Privacy — everyone&#39;s talking about PGP. I better download PGP so I can act like I know what PGP is.” And I tried to figure it out, and it was hard. I couldn&#39;t figure out … I went to the website and I was like, “The website doesn&#39;t really explain what&#39;s happening here. Where&#39;s the key? I download the key, but the key&#39;s also kept in a database, but I write the key on my emails? Oh, I&#39;m so … I can&#39;t do this. I&#39;m so bad at this. This is not for me.”</p><p> And I went into the interview the next day with the wonderful project lead, Susan McGregor, and I said, “You know what? This job&#39;s not for me. I tried to do PGP; it&#39;s weirdly hard. There&#39;s something about it that I just … I can&#39;t quite grok the language.” And she said, “I think that makes you perfect for this job because we are trying to figure out why security and privacy are so hard for people at work, especially journalists who are high-value targets for attack from a lot of different actors, and we are trying to figure out how we can make security and privacy protocols better for them, so it sounds like you&#39;re frustrated with how security is designed.” And I said, “Yeah, that was frustrating.” And she said, “OK, let&#39;s do some work.”</p><p> So we ended up working together for several years studying journalists. We had one particularly harrowing project studying the journalists who published the Panama Papers. And for that, they had terabytes of data. There were journalists working all over the world; none of them were colocated, and they didn&#39;t have a single breach. Never once did they have a breach and in all of that data. And so we saw that as a success story. And we said, “OK. We&#39;re always hearing the bad stories about breaches and attacks; we never hear the success stories.” And so we got to interview the journalists who contributed to the Panama Papers and talked to them about their organizational culture and how making protocols uniform across all journalists helped to instill a sense of teamwork and a sense that they were protecting each other. And seeing the power of culture and shared mission on behaviors around something as difficult as PGP and security protocols … it was really inspirational.</p><p> And around that time, I started paying attention to facial recognition, and from there it was a short bridge over to looking at AI and asking similar questions around “Why is this hard to understand? How can we communicate it to people in a more strategic way that is more understanding of the work that they&#39;re doing and the work that they need to do? And how can we bring some transparency to these systems in a way that is meaningful and understandable for real people?”</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> One of the things interesting about that is, security&#39;s always like that. If it&#39;s a little bit hard to do, then we all tend to not do it, because it&#39;s tomorrow&#39;s problem versus today&#39;s problem. … That&#39;s something we as humans are terrible about. And you know, I think what we&#39;ve failed [at] in many ways here is not building that into the infrastructure so it&#39;s a default. And there&#39;s a lot of analogies for artificial intelligence: We&#39;re building things, and if we don&#39;t make the defaults easy to use or easy to do the right thing, then people will do the wrong thing — or people will do the easy thing or the short-term thing. And you mentioned facial recognition: What are the kinds of things that we should be building into our infrastructure so we don&#39;t propagate AI-based mistakes?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> That&#39;s a great question. Something that drives my research, both throughout my graduate career and here at Intel, is a recognition that people are the experts in their own lives and that we really need to engage with the people and with the users throughout the development pipeline in order to build not just systems but solutions, and solutions for the real problems that are happening on the ground. And as close as a company can get to including the expertise of social science and what social scientists can bring about rigorous and robust tools to study how people live and the kinds of languages they use and the kinds of values they have and what&#39;s truly important to them and what they want to protect and what they want to keep safe, as well as building in different kinds of options and different kinds of pathways into the same technology that might be used differently by people of different levels of accessibility, are all things that I would love to see the entire field take up.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That <em>sounds</em> good. I mean … much like buying low and selling high sounds great. How do companies actually do this? What steps do they need to take to make progress on these?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> That&#39;s a great question. The way that we&#39;re doing it at Intel is that we are facilitating conversations between our technical teams — people who are building really amazing systems around robotics and accessibility tools and educational tools — and embedding social scientists across all these teams so that we can ask some questions around “Hey, what are the presumptions of this system? Have you talked to teachers? Have you talked to the folks who are going to be using this robot on the ground? What are your conversations like with the people who are going to be served by these solutions?”</p><p> And I&#39;m really lucky that I get to be in a place where we&#39;re embedding this expertise way back into the problem-formulation stage and into the project-formulation stage, all throughout the development pipeline. I&#39;ve also been really gratified that Intel established the ethical impact assessment process along with the Responsible AI [Advisory] Council. And so this is a process for robustly and rigorously building into the development pipeline that teams all across Intel and across all business units [use]. This is a way to inject the expertise, not just of social scientists but everyone who sits on the Responsible AI [Advisory] Council, including engineers and policy makers and folks from legal and folks from standards, and facilitate conversations with this multidisciplinary Responsible AI [Advisory] Council with development teams through their submission of the ethical impact assessment.</p><p> And the ethical impact assessment is a way for us to put values into practice and ensure that values around human oversights and human rights and privacy and safety and security and diversity and inclusion — these are ways for us to make sure that those values are built into the tools that Intel BUs [business units] are putting together across the organization.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> OK, we have a segment where we ask our guests a series of five rapid-fire questions. Just answer the first thing that comes to your mind. First: What is your proudest AI moment?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Oh, goodness.这是一个很好的问题。 I am really proud of being able to represent the voices of the technicians who we have on the floor to these teams of engineers and data scientists who are building these systems. And because of the process that Intel has built, where I get to sit with the engineering teams who are building the computer vision and the action recognition and the NLP and choosing the phrases in the semantic frames around tasks and about how tasks are built and how they can be recognized, being able to do the interviews that I do with technicians to ask them about their concerns when this technology is introduced, what we can do to make sure that their concerns are addressed, asking what they need to know around transparency, what they need in order to trust the system, all in the service of enhancing the work that people are doing.</p><p> The fact that I get to grab that information and deliver it consistently to the engineers and to see how quickly they respond. Like, “Oh, well, we can build this and we can build that. And what if we built this into the UI? And what if we built this into the dialog?” It&#39;s such an incredibly compelling process, especially after coming from academia, where I would write a paper and then it would take a year to get published. And then …</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Oh, a year sounds fast.</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Right. If I were lucky, it would take a year. I think my longest record was maybe 3½ years it took to get published.我不知道。 What&#39;s your record?</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Uh, 10. So …</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Ten!</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Yeah. Let&#39;s don&#39;t talk about it though, because I&#39;ll get all sad.</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Oh, no.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So you mentioned concerns that people have. What worries you about artificial intelligence?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Well, one of their biggest concerns, when I started talking to the technicians, was that they were going to get replaced.</p><p> I said, “OK, let&#39;s have a conversation. What do you think this is for?” And they said, “I&#39;ve seen the news. I know you&#39;re trying to build a robot just to do exactly what I do, so I figure I&#39;m training my replacement.” And I thought, “Oh, no! That&#39;s terrible.” And I got to have a lot of conversations with our technicians where I got to say, “That&#39;s <em>not</em> what we&#39;re doing. We are not trying to replace you. You are the expert. We need you. In fact, we need you to teach the system so that the system can go and help other people like you. So by you training the system, you&#39;re actually helping a lot of other folks in Intel fabs [semiconductor manufacturing plants] across the planet, and you are ensuring that they get help in the way that you would like to get help.”</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Some research that Shervin and I were involved in a couple years ago focused entirely on this <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/expanding-ais-impact-with-organizational-learning">organizational learning</a> aspect that you were alluding to — that this is a way for everyone to learn more quickly and to spread knowledge.</p><p> What&#39;s your favorite activity that does not involve technology? What&#39;s <em>not</em> AI going on in your world?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Well, there&#39;s so much happening recently, it seems tough sometimes to figure out what&#39;s AI and what&#39;s not.</p><p> [In] my personal life, I do a lot of baking. It&#39;s been a while since I made a loaf of bread. I do a lot of cooking. I am very lucky to live with my husband in the city of New York, and so we do a lot of exploring — in fact, just getting outside. That&#39;s probably the biggest non-AI activity, is walking outside on our own two feet and looking around with our own eyes. And that always feels very refreshing.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What&#39;s the first career you wanted when you were young? What did you want to be when you grew up?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> I wanted to be an artist, and it has been a topsy-turvy winding road. I did my undergrad at UC Irvine, and I studied video art.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What&#39;s your greatest wish for AI in the future?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> There&#39;s so much that AI can do that humans cannot, but there&#39;s also so much that humans can do that AI cannot. And I think a big challenge, at least for me, and I hope the people with whom I work going forward for the next few years, is going to be figuring out exactly what that balance is and how can we systematize “What do people really need help with that AI systems can do?” but with a really thorough understanding of what it is that people do and how they do it.</p><p> Now that the AI systems are becoming so advanced, but oftentimes in a lab or in a vacuum, as they mature into the real world, I think it&#39;s really exciting what they can do, but we&#39;re facing a lot of work in getting them there. And I think it&#39;s going to be other social scientists and multidisciplinary teams like the ones that we have at Intel all working together to make sure that these systems can really be deployed as solutions.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That&#39;s a good cap for the episode. Thanks for talking to us. I think one of the things that has come through [is], you&#39;re talking about projects and things you&#39;re working on, but you&#39;re also giving us a hint about what&#39;s going to happen in the future as we move off of the, let&#39;s say, tool-focused “Can we get the ML right? Can we get the model right? Can we get the data right?” You&#39;re talking a lot about what happens next, what happens once we check off some of those check marks — what are those checks? And I think a lot of people can learn from that. Thanks for taking the time to talk with us today.</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Oh my gosh, it&#39;s been such a pleasure.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Thanks for listening. Next time, Shervin and I speak with David Hardoon from Aboitiz Data Innovation. We&#39;re once again talking about chemical engineering, so you won&#39;t want to miss this one.</p><p> <strong>Allison Ryder:</strong> Thanks for listening to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> .

It&#39;s an obvious concern because generative AI can create the types of outputs that the industry uses — text (in the form of stories, scripts, ad copy, and reviews), marketing campaigns, and moving and static images. Segments of the industry are facing economic pressures, which increases the demand for productivity and less-expensive “product.” And a high percentage of current entertainment is derivative of past content, which makes it well suited for generative technologies that are trained on … past content.</p><p> It&#39;s still early days for generative AI-created entertainment, but it&#39;s clear that something big is happening. A recent <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-chatgpt-hollywood-intellectual-property-spongebob-81fd5d15"><cite>Wall Street Journal</cite> article</a> noted that widely available AI tools can suggest storylines, character arcs, and dialogue; it even includes an interactive module that lets readers see for themselves how easily ChatGPT can write a basic script when given a few prompts. The article also raises questions about image intellectual property: “If a user prompts an AI tool to build a new character influenced by say, SpongeBob, should the original creators have to grant permission? Who owns it? Can the new work itself be copyrighted?”</p><p></p><p> Generative AI was used in <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/05/05/runway-generative-ai-chatgpt-video">making the 2022 film <cite>Everything Everywhere All at Once</cite></a> , and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oscars-2023-everything-everywhere-all-at-once-most-awards/">we know how that turned out</a> . Tom recently wrote about the use of generative AI to create <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomdavenport/2023/03/13/cuebric-generative-ai-comes-to-hollywood/">movie and TV backdrop images</a> . There are already generative AI systems that can create videos, although they are short and relatively primitive. AI is being used to provide data-driven predictions about <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/democratizing-data-in-hollywood-jumpcuts-kartik-hosanagar/">how unusual storylines will land with viewers</a> .</p><p> So, what does this mean for the industry? There are many different components to this question, as a new <a href="https://variety.com/vip-special-reports/generative-ai-entertainment-a-special-report-1235564989/">report from Variety Intelligence Platform</a> suggests. In May, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) went on strike, primarily over film and TV writers&#39; <a href="https://time.com/6277158/writers-strike-ai-wga-screenwriting/">income from streaming services programming</a> , but it also demanded that production companies “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/29/business/media/writers-guild-hollywood-ai-chatgpt.html">regulate use of material produced using artificial intelligence</a> or similar technologies.” Because there are so many uncertainties about what will happen when and how with the technology, we spoke with two experts on the topic. Both are based in — not surprisingly — Los Angeles, and both are involved with centers at the University of Southern California (USC). However, they don&#39;t work together, and they have very different approaches to the technology.</p><p></p><h3> Resolutely Against Generative AI</h3><p> Jonathan Taplin is director emeritus at the <a href="https://www.annenberglab.com/">Annenberg Innovation Lab</a> at USC. He&#39;s had a long career in the entertainment industry and was previously a tour manager for musicians, including Bob Dylan and The Band. In addition, he&#39;s been a film producer, a banker, and a writer. His latest book, <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jonathan-taplin/the-end-of-reality/9781541703155/?lens=publicaffairs"><cite>The End of Reality: How Four Billionaires Are Selling a Fantasy Future of the Metaverse, Mars, and Crypto</cite></a> , will be released in September. As you might infer from the title, he&#39;s not a fan of how big tech firms&#39; generative AI tools are being developed or promulgated.</p><p> “The way they train their models is by ingesting everything on the internet, with no concern for copyright,” Taplin told us. “Google has a music-generation AI trained on every audio file on YouTube. You can issue a prompt like &#39;Write me a song that sounds like Taylor Swift, sad ending, up-tempo,&#39; and the resulting song sounds somewhat like her. Someone could include it in a video game or a bar scene in a movie for free.” Generative AI could do the same kind of repurposing with video content owned by the studios, he added.</p><p> Taplin&#39;s primary concern is that generative AI will replace some of the work done by human writers, artists, photographers, and other creative professionals in the arts and entertainment industry. He also believes that it will exacerbate problems that are already bringing the film and TV industry down. “The biggest problem in the movies is too many formulas. There is a lack of originality, and that&#39;s why the industry isn&#39;t performing,” he said. Generative AI, he added, is only capable of producing even more formulaic content and will make the predictability worse. “Entertainment relies on new ideas, and this technology can&#39;t produce them,” Taplin added.</p><p> He said he&#39;s concerned that generative AI will continue to reduce the number of performers who can make a living in their fields. The majority of entertainment revenue already goes to a very small percentage of artists. This is the <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2014/03/05/toponepercent/">reality for musicians</a> , especially on <a href="https://themusicnetwork.com/few-artists-generate-most-streams/">streaming services</a> , and is echoed in Hollywood in the huge <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/655480/all-time-top-grossing-actors-box-office/">box office revenues</a> generated by a handful of leading actors in blockbuster films. When you get an “algorithmic economy,” Taplin said, “the algorithms narrow the funnel, with outsize paychecks for a few.” He&#39;s hopeful that a collective licensing regime — similar to what&#39;s in place for music sampling — will emerge to protect artists when their content is used to train generative AI.</p><h3> Embracing Generative AI, With Some Concerns</h3><p> Yves Bergquist is director of the AI &amp; Neuroscience in Media Project at USC&#39;s <a href="https://www.etcenter.org/">Entertainment Technology Center</a> , which is funded by Hollywood studios. You can guess that his opinion of generative AI is probably much more favorable than Taplin&#39;s. It is, although he said he does have some concerns about AI&#39;s potential effects on the media and entertainment industry: “It&#39;s a completely revolutionary technology” characterized by misinformation and “some insanity.”</p><p> We asked Bergquist whether movie studios would embrace generative AI. Parts of them are already doing so, he said. “Some groups within the studios are highly technologically savvy, such as the chief technology officers and all of the visual effects artists and technicians. They are very sophisticated and are already working with generative AI companies. The studios do a lot of the postproduction work in films — particularly in animation — and there is a lot of pressure to bring costs down. The postproduction companies have a software development culture, so they will embrace generative AI.”</p><p> He also believes that many production companies will embrace the technology because they are already shooting on large LED-based screens and will need generative images for them. Bergquist said he expects that tools offering virtual actors and voice synthesis will be most aggressively adopted by short-form creators who distribute their work on TikTok or YouTube and by video game producers. “Streaming channels, digital ads, games — that&#39;s what kids watch these days,” he noted. “The media industry no longer has a monopoly on entertainment.” Makers of hardware (such as cameras) are experimenting with generative in-camera visual effects as well.</p><p></p><p> The business side of traditional movie studios is sometimes more reluctant to embrace AI, Bergquist observed, simply because they don&#39;t have the same kind of culture of data or software. “It&#39;s being bolted onto organizations and people who aren&#39;t ready,” he said. Even the new streaming studios, like Netflix and Prime Video, have experienced a lot of growing pains in their AI journeys.</p><p> Bergquist said that before the WGA strike started in May, many screenwriters told him that they view the likes of ChatGPT as a “great creative assistant tool” but not something that will replace human writers. “It&#39;s good at brainstorming ideas, but it will output only average content,” Bergquist asserted. “It&#39;s nowhere near capable of the symbolic abstraction necessary for script development, and it can&#39;t output a script with narrative structure and character arcs.” At least not now. Future language models with higher levels of intelligence and new paradigms for AI might be able to do so.</p><p></p><p> Bergquist thinks generative AI will have enormous effects not only on entertainment but also on education. He believes that schools, including the School of Cinematic Arts at USC, need to quickly ramp up their teaching to keep pace with the frenzy of new generative AI tools that are released nearly every week. Bergquist is preparing courses himself on the technology for the Society of Motion Pictures and Television Engineers, an organization that represents technologists in media.</p><h3> Are Both Experts Right?</h3><p> Although Taplin and Bergquist seem to have very different views on generative AI, they might both be right about its impacts. Economic pressures may entice the industry — at least some sectors of it — to embrace these new tools. Generative AI will lead to dramatic changes in production and postproduction, distribution, and intellectual property ownership. The technology may not be good for traditional artists and the companies that employ them, but it is likely to lead to significant changes in the industry over the next few years — hopefully some for the better along with some for the worse. Perhaps the only purely good news is that neither expert expects that humans will be entirely replaced anytime soon.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-impact-of-generative-ai-on-hollywood-and-entertainment/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Recapping Work/23: The Big Shift</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/recapping-work-23-the-big-shift/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/recapping-work-23-the-big-shift/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 15 Jun 2023 11:09:56 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[MIT SMR Editors. ]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Career Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Employee Development]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video]]></category><category><![CDATA[Webinars & Videos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Workplace Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Diversity & Inclusion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Organizational Behavior]]></category><category><![CDATA[Remote Work]]></category><category><![CDATA[Skills & Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Workplace, Teams, & Culture]]></category><description><![CDATA[Download the Event Summary Download (PDF) The pandemic irrevocably changed the how, why, and where of work.

Nalbantian, Workforce Sciences Institute</h5><p> Even organizations that specifically focus on advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) struggle with improving representation in a sustainable way. Nalbantian outlined ways companies are tackling the obstacles women and people of color continue to face — obstacles that are often due to situational factors, such as the roles people are in or whom they report to.</p><h6 class="work23-timestamp"> Section time stamp: 1:02</h6><hr /><h4 class="work23-title" id="berwick"> The Why, What, and How of Skills-Based Talent Practices</h4><h5 class="work23-speaker"> Beth Berwick, Grads of Life</h5><p> More jobs than ever now require a four-year college degree, including many that never did in the past. But that criterion excludes 64% of the population — including 76% of Black Americans and 80% of Latinos. Berwick is among those calling for a retreat on the degree requirement. She explained how organizations can instead hire effectively based on the skills they need.</p><h6 class="work23-timestamp"> Section time stamp: 33:24</h6><hr /><h4 class="work23-title" id="smith"> The New World of Accessing Talent</h4><h5 class="work23-speaker"> Mike Smith, Randstad Enterprise; David Kiron, <cite>MIT SMR</cite></h5><p> Companies are changing how they approach and apply technology to find the people they need. <cite>MIT SMR</cite> &#39;s Kiron and our presenting partner&#39;s chief executive discussed the ways that innovative organizations are designing their own talent pools, building their talent brands, and expanding DEI initiatives beyond their own boundaries.</p><h6 class="work23-timestamp"> Section time stamp: 54:44</h6><hr /><h4 class="work23-title" id="dervin"> Flexible <em>and</em> Effective: Leadership Strategies for the Hybrid Workplace</h4><h5 class="work23-speaker"> Julie Dervin, Atlassian; Brian Elliott, Future Forum; N. Sharon Hill, George Washington University School of Business; Abbie Lundberg, <cite>MIT SMR</cite></h5><p> It&#39;s possible to have a healthy workplace culture and high performance in a hybrid workplace; it just requires a deliberate management approach. The speakers in this session expanded on their research and their real-world experience configuring hybrid work arrangements and discussed how to get to the right mix of worker autonomy and organizational alignment.</p><h6 class="work23-timestamp"> Section time stamp: 1:07:11</h6><hr /><h4 class="work23-title" id="kellerman"> Thriving in the New World of Work</h4><h5 class="work23-speaker"> Gabriella Rosen Kellerman, BetterUp; Martin Seligman, University of Pennsylvania; Elizabeth Heichler, <cite>MIT SMR</cite></h5><p> Workforce well-being is an urgent issue for leaders who recognize that stress is driving out talented workers. The speakers, who coauthored the book <cite>Tomorrowmind</cite> , detailed the skills that help individuals flourish in pressure-filled work environments, including <em>prospection</em> — the ability to imagine our options, plan for the future, and restore our agency.</p><h6 class="work23-timestamp"> Section time stamp: 1:42:29</h6><hr /><h4 class="work23-title" id="gigliotti"> How to Deliver Career Development for All</h4><h5 class="work23-speaker"> Tony Gigliotti, UPMC; Lani Montoya, Pernod Ricard North America; George Westerman, MIT Sloan</h5><p> The speakers in this session outlined how forward-leaning companies are helping all employees — not just a select few — chart rewarding career paths. They explained that companies are doing it by providing ways to learn and practice new skills and by delivering rich feedback. Companies are also making pathways visible, showing opportunities at and above an employee&#39;s current level.</p><h6 class="work23-timestamp"> Section time stamp: 2:13:11</h6><hr /><h4 class="work23-title" id="altman"> An Integrated Approach to Workforce Ecosystems</h4><h5 class="work23-speaker"> Elizabeth J. Altman, UMass Lowell; David Kiron, <cite>MIT SMR</cite></h5><p> The speakers&#39; research, featured in the book <cite>Workforce Ecosystems</cite> , found that most leaders consider their workforces to be broader than full-time employees, encompassing gig workers, professional services firms, and even technologies like customer service chatbots. Altman and Kiron explained what it takes to coordinate and successfully manage that expanded workforce.</p><h6 class="work23-timestamp"> Section time stamp: 2:49:49</h6><hr /><h4 class="work23-title" id="barnes"> The Four-Day Workweek: How to Make It Work in Your Organization</h4><h5 class="work23-speaker"> Andrew Barnes, 4 Day Week Global</h5><p> Barnes has had a front-row seat at the world&#39;s largest trial of what happens when you scale back the workweek from five days to four.
