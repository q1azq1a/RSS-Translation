class="attribution">丹尼尔·赫茨伯格/theispot.com</p></figcaption></figure><p>帮助管理者和高潜力贡献者培养更好的领导技能可能是建设组织能力的关键部分，但对于许多公司来说，领导力发展计划还远远不够。那些负责选择此类计划的人往往很难证明他们的支出如何对参与者的个人能力或集体成果产生了重大、持久的变化，但运营高管却继续为这些努力提供资金，而无需承担此类责任。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a>结果是：一个巨大的领导力发展行业，其中很少有人区分蛇油和有效的治疗药水。</p><p>我们对世界各地几十所商学院的领导力发展项目（LDP）的审查揭示了这些项目的典型缺陷。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a>我们调查的项目主管很少能够确定他们的领导力发展产品的设计和评估如何始终符合预期影响的科学标准。例如，大多数人 (70%) 表示，他们满足于对项目的积极反应或所获得知识的证据，而不是记录参与者能力的提高，至少在短期内 (63%)。没有人将他们的计划与参与者的职业轨迹、追随者的态度或绩效、或团队或组织层面的成果的变化联系起来。</p><p></p><p>同样，我们最近对 46 名人力资源高管的采访显示，他们对自民党的选择很少受到有效性证据的强烈指导。相反，大多数人承认，他们在信息有限的情况下做出了这样的决定，通常根据项目的“外观”（例如设计良好的网站）或教师的魅力等因素投入大量资金。正如一位高管指出的那样，领导力发展决策似乎类似于在线约会行业，向左或向右滑动更多地基于外观而不是实质。</p><p>这个问题并非不可避免。通过多年研究领导力发展、开发和交付项目以及与爱立信、微软、飞利浦、红十字会和西门子等组织的首席人力资源官和首席学习官的合作，我们得出了一个简单的前提：领导力发展需要关注三个核心要素——项目的愿景、方法和影响——以及它们之间的整合。</p><p>只需提出几个关于程序的好问题，并仔细解析答案，就可以阐明每个元素的设计以及与其他元素的协调程度，并导致显着更好的决策。本文将解释高质量计划的要素，并概述领导者和计划制定者在确定自民党有效性时应提出的问题。</p><h3>坚实的计划是三条腿站立的</h3><p>领导力发展计划从根本上应该关注参与者的成长。有效的方法将增加参与者的知识、技能或能力。对自民党的任何评估都应从其<em>愿景</em>开始：该计划旨在培养参与者的哪些能力或素质，为什么这很重要，以及它将如何满足特定的发展需求。</p><p>一个好的项目会有非常具体的目标——例如，参与者将发展他们的领导身份，或者提高他们的情商或在压力下批判性思考的能力。并且它将清楚地说明其所依据的基本思想或证据。如果程序开发人员无法告诉您他们的具体愿景是什么，为什么它适合您自己组织的需求和目标，以及它所基于的原则，那么就没有理由认为您会获得有意义的结果。</p><p>如果您没有有效的到达目的地计划，也没有理由认为您会到达理想的目的地。这就是为什么要评估的第二个关键维度是领导力发展计划的<em>方法</em>。这包括课程（例如，参与者将研究说明性案例并学习战略分析的有效技术）和教学/学习方法（例如，参与者将讨论和辩论、进行体验式练习以及建立自己的模型）。</p><p></p><p>自民党评估的第三个组成部分是其<em>影响</em>——参与者和其他利益相关者的预期结果。值得选择的项目可以阐明参与者将如何改变。这最终关系到项目是否能够清楚地解释其预期结果，包括如何评估这些结果。</p><p>我们的经验表明，大多数计划购买者至少会询问有关他们正在考虑的自民党的愿景、方法和影响的隐性问题。然而，我们断言，他们经常提出错误的问题，或者当他们提出更好的问题时，他们太容易满足于不满意的答复。 （请参阅“提出正确的问题”。）由于预算、时间或进行运营变革的权力的限制，他们会被那些承诺简单、新颖、舒适以及参与者高评价的项目所吸引，这是可以理解的。</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>提出正确的问题</h4><p

（参见“一家公司改善领导力发展的方法”。）但是许多计划都缺少这种一致性。考虑一个承诺培养“具有卓越情商技能的领导者”的计划，该计划首先评估参与者当前的能力，然后提供如何改进的想法。这些组件是错位的，因为该方法不太适合行为技能发展的愿景。更强大的产品将让参与者反复尝试实时评估和管理自己和他人的情绪，并在此过程中提供指导性辅导和纠正。同样，询问参与者是否喜欢情商计划或认为自己有所提高，也无法以与提高技能的愿景相一致的方式评估影响。更有效的评估将使用多源评级来记录项目前后的情商行为能力。

<a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a>一些 LDP 提供商（例如咨询公司 Mercuri Urval）拒绝与不从需求分析开始的组织合作，该分析确定与公司背景和战略相关的领导力挑战，因为这是展示 LDP 投资回报率和影响力的关键。</p><p><strong><em>而不是问</em>“他们是否有动力参加？”<em>问</em>“他们是否有动力运用所学知识？”</strong>我们中的大多数人并没有动力去看医生，因为我们觉得看医生很有趣。只有当我们认为它们有助于保持我们的健康或使我们恢复健康时，我们才会去。也就是说，我们的动力不是来自经历本身，而是来自我们收到的建议和治疗的效用。</p><p>我们相信，同样的逻辑应该适用于选择自民党，但我们已经看到，选择节目往往更多的是因为其娱乐价值而不是其实用性。应根据参与者参加该计划后能够做什么的预期来选择计划，而不是根据主要旨在吸引他们参加的功能来选择。</p><p></p><p>当然，参加的动机是相关的——但它与随后使用所学知识的动机（即<em>迁移的动机）</em>不同。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a>这来自于与参与者的目标或问题充分相关的编程，以便有目的地回忆并在随后的情况中应用。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a>这就是为什么将学习和发展直接与在职经历联系起来如此强大，尽管它比课堂学习更具挑战性。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p>简而言之，领导力发展计划的教训是：根据参与者在参加后能够做什么和有动力做什么的证据来选择计划，而不是根据他们参加活动的兴奋程度来选择计划。告诉参与者该计划将如何有助于解决他们关心的事情，并确保该计划明确地这样做。当参与者（如患者）相信他们接受的治疗会减轻他们的痛苦或促进他们的健康时，他们就会有动力继续参与。</p><p><strong><em>而不是问</em>“这足够容易吗？”<em>问</em>“它的复杂程度适当吗？”</strong>当您坐上飞机时，您是否希望飞行员的培训轻松便捷？当然不是。您希望它足够严格且适当复杂，以便飞行员知道在飞行中遇到意外天气或遇到设备故障时该怎么做。您希望监督飞机飞行路线的空中交通管制员也是如此。您希望他们的培训旨在让他们熟练地运用所学知识，而不是最大化其他目标。相比之下，领导力发展计划往往旨在最大限度地为参与者提供便利，或最大限度地减少对更重要工作的干扰。</p><p>有效学习的科学清楚地表明，努力学习会更深入、更持久。 <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a>这意味着，如果您希望参与者将他们所学到的内容可靠地编码到长期记忆中，并能够在各种相关环境中可靠地检索和使用他们所学到的内容，那么您需要做参与者和参与者都同意的事情。教育工作者发现实时的吸引力较小。这包括将学习间隔开，而不是将其集中到一个块中；将新主题贯穿始终，而不是坚持单一主题，直到参与者掌握为止；并改变练习条件。这些技术可能会使自民党的运行变得更具挑战性，但它们对于支持最终目标至关重要：持续的学习迁移和改进的结果。 <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a></p><p>事实是，如果某件事足够重要，值得大量投资，那么它也可能足够复杂，必须优先考虑效率而不是易用性。</p><p><strong><em>而不是问</em>“参与者会感到舒服吗？”<em>问</em>“即使参与者感到不舒服，他们会学习吗？”</strong>对参与者舒适度的关注似乎指导了太多项目的设计。原因很清楚；在项目结束后立即进行的满意度调查中得分不佳的项目可能不会再次获得资助。然而，荟萃分析研究证据表明，喜欢教育经历和从中学习之间，或者短期满意度和所学知识的迁移之间通常不存在显着关系。 <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a>我们从经验和文献中都知道，成长来自于严峻的考验和磨难的经历，而不是来自当下的舒适。</p><p></p><p>例如，人们已经确定，发展涉及走出一个人的舒适区——面对而不是回避具有挑战性的经历——而更高强度的练习（例如，对身体或情感的负担更大）会带来更大的进步（只要它在之前停止）。过载点）。我们还从心理学中得知，避免或尽量减少不适的持续时间或强度实际上会干扰学习新模式和替换旧模式。 <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a>简而言之，你无法通过躲避公众演讲或挑战人际交往来克服这些厌恶情绪；你可以通过在支持性的学习环境中面对他们来做到这一点。这与认知行为疗法的核心是一致的：为了可持续地改变你的行为，你必须浮现、挑战、重新解释和取代当前与困难情况相关的无益的想法和感受。这并不容易或不舒服，但它是有效的。</p><p>这就是为什么 BOLD（超越户外领导力发展）公司致力于通过让参与者在具有挑战性的荒野探险中超越他们的舒适区来推进传统的户外训练。在新奇、高压力的高压环境中，鼓励参与者尝试新的行为，以建立或磨练领导能力。 BOLD 设计体验的目的是创造更深刻、更持久的幸福感，这种幸福感来自自我成长，而不是与享受体验本身直接相关的即时但转瞬即逝的幸福感。 <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a>事实上，由于所经历的成长，长期满意度得分通常非常高。</p><p><strong><em>而不是问</em>“我们会改变参与者的内心和想法吗？”<em>问</em>“我们会看到参与者的行为方式发生变化吗？”</strong>这是我们警惕的另一个指导信念：如果你改变人们的想法，你就会改变他们的行为。这听起来不错，但至少存在两个问题：改变行为指导信念非常困难，而且态度和行为之间的联系一般来说并不那么牢固。如果这听起来有悖常理，请考虑一下，人们相信锻炼对他们有好处、他们对健康的渴望，甚至他们每天锻炼 30 分钟的意图，往往并不能可靠地实现预期的行为——真正的锻炼。</p><p>有充分证据表明，到了成年后，人们看待世界的方式差异很大——例如，他们如何优先考虑不同的价值观，以及他们对不同信仰的支持程度如何。成年人的态度是根深蒂固的，而且太难以改变，短期干预不可能改变它们。</p><p>即使改变态度很容易，数十年的研究表明，这转化为持续的行为改变的可能性很小。一般来说，态度不能很好地预测相关行为。只有当人们有意识地建立具体的行为承诺和问责流程并努力形成新习惯时，他们的联系才会变得更加可靠。其他研究表明，将价值变化视为行为变化的理想产物（而不是其原因）是有用的，因为我们对所做事情的理解会影响我们的信念。 <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a></p><p>研究组织多样性、公平性和包容性的学者们非常清楚，专注于 DEI 信念或态度的领导力项目可以使日常行为基本保持不变。即使项目对态度显示出明显的积极影响，对行为的影响也往往有限。无论这反映了将态度改变与行为改变联系起来的普遍挑战，还是另一种可能性——人们经常拥护不反映他们实际信仰的价值观，也许是因为他们知道社会接受的立场是什么——结果都是一样的。改变人们的说法很少是自民党的最终愿景，而且往往不能很好地反映他们随后的行为方式。那么，为什么不衡量更重要的事情呢：人们在制定发展计划后会采取哪些不同的做法。</p><p><strong><em>而不是问</em>“我们如何证明支出的合理性？”<em>问</em>“我们只会花我们认为合理的钱吗？”</strong>那些经营任何规模的运营单位的人与风险投资者和信贷员类似：他们对（再）投资不合理的机会不感兴趣，因为他们自己的结果取决于他们投入的回报。因此，自民党投资回报率的坚实案例。例如，传播顾问南希·杜阿尔特 (Nancy Duarte) 建议，如果您认为推销辅导对于销售人员来说是一个有价值的发展领域，那么您的计划应包括一项计划，用于跟踪参与者在计划期间开发和练习的推销内容随后如何使用以及它们是否会增加合同续签或新销售。 <a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a>或者，如果您正在聘请合作伙伴来实现自民党，请坚持要求其对其成果进行投资。以印度咨询公司五大湖管理学院为例：它采用按绩效付费的收费结构，其中一定比例的薪酬与项目结束后参与者的明显变化直接挂钩。</p><p>对于那些从事领导力发展的人来说，这是一个更具挑战性的想法：如果你不能提出令人信服的投资理由，就不要花分配给你的钱。用预算金额产生平庸的结果并不意味着未来的投资；相反，它会强化怀疑者的信念，即回报不值得付出代价，从而破坏了这一点。因此，如果您知道只有两倍的分配才能获得有意义的结果，请考虑制定一个令人信服的解释，解释为何每隔一年运行一次该计划。拒绝花掉你拥有的钱可能会让人觉得有风险，但这样做的勇气可能会激发对领导力发展的长期支持。</p><p>这并不意味着唯一有用的投资是那些可以直接立即与财务结果挂钩的投资。这显然是对人类发展的一种有限的看法，它忽视了员工成长和福祉与个人和组织目标间接相关的无数方式。但这并不能排除对严谨思维和合理衡量的需要，而这对于良好的领导力发展至关重要。</p><h3>与程序开发人员合作以获得更好的结果</h3><p>打破资源浪费的循环和领导力发展计划令人失望的结果并不能仅仅依靠买家对计划进行更严格的评估。除非主要利益相关者在事后停止相互指责并开始预先进行建设性合作，否则这种情况不太可能发生。所需要的是发起领导力发展的高级管理人员与选择、管理和交付领导力发展的人力资源人员和/或项目开发人员之间建立更牢固的合作关系。如果没有对方的支持，任何一方都无法协调愿景、方法和影响力。</p><p></p><p>在健康的伙伴关系中，双方都有席位，同意承认自己对现状和应有的责任，并同意在事情不顺利时做出改变。例如，领导力发展人员可能会更加强烈地反对方便的交付时间表的要求，并拒绝关注项目满意度分数。他们可以致力于更好地将规划及其结果与关键组织目标联系起来。就运营高管而言，他们可以不再抱怨开发让参与者离开“真正的工作”太久，而在评估项目时开始超越短期结果。同样，高级领导人可能会停止将自民党的资金与短期运营结果挂钩——这是一种常见的做法，它可能会花费更多的时间根据可用资源调整计划，而不是花在如何以最佳方式、明显地满足参与者的需求上。当人们在工作中采用新行为时，领导者可以通过积极认可和经济奖励来支持所学知识的迁移。</p><p></p><p>人们早已不再对领导力发展计划抱有更多期望。我们知道要问的问题和期望的答案。最需要的是关键决策者采取行动的集体意愿。</p><p></p>

实际上，所有这些听众都听说过人字形，但他们可能不知道的是AI在雪佛龙的所有价值链中普遍存在的程度。因此，也许告诉我们一些有关您的角色以及在雪佛龙的AI的使用方式。</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong>也许谈论我的角色……它始于三年前。我是雪佛龙（Chevron）的第一任数据官。这并不意味着我们（尚未一直在处理）很长一段时间的数据，但是需要更多地专注于数据开始出现，因此，我的任务是传播数据 - 驱动的决策，当然也包括任何类型的数据科学/分析。看到它随着时间的推移而增长是非常非常有趣的。</p><p>我们在很多地方都使用人工智能。我们使用机器人的某些领域——例如今天的储罐检查——你可以想象，如果有人参与，那是非常麻烦的。现在我们用机器人来做这件事。我们基本上将人类从这些狭窄的空间中夺走，这是计算机视觉的结合 - 拍摄图像，比较图像 - 并[对该坦克和该设备的状态如何进行预测。生锈了吗？是否需要维护？我们是否需要以非常预测的方式处理它，以便将来以更可靠和安全的方式运行？</p><p>另一个例子是，当我们谈论压缩机或任何类型设备中的传感器时，过去我们当然会安装它们，但这些传感器和数据收集的价格大幅下降，我最近才看到……实际上，它是一个已经创建的公民开发应用程序，因为这些传感器必须安装，安装时基本上是拿一个二维码，一键点击就可以将地理空间位置添加到传感器中，然后您可以在地图上看到您的设施中安装的所有这些传感器，因此您实际上可以看到……正在发生的事情以及该设备是否实际工作以及已在那里盘点哪些传感器。因此，我们在这里结合了计算机视觉、利用公民发展，然后，当然，以机器学习、基于人工智能的方式使用传感器来进行预测及其工作方式。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我知道你们做得很好的一件事就是数字孪生。也许你可以对这个例子发表一些评论。</p><p> <strong>Ellen Nielsen：</strong>数字孪生是我们使用它的众多例子之一。是什么触发[一个]进行数字孪生？一是，你可以想象我们有人在现场，所以我们想让他们的生活更轻松、更安全。这意味着我们收集的有关现场资产以及如何操作它们的数据和信息越多，将有助于实现更安全、更可靠的运营。这是一个触发因素。</p><p>第二个触发因素是，您可以根据物联网，[工业]物联网设备，感官……收集大量信息，然后将其输入另一个信息库中，您可以在这些信息中推动这些资产中的预测性决策。因此，通过数字孪生，我们基本上希望同时服务于这两点：我们希望变得更安全、可靠，但也希望我们所做的事情更具预测性，从而提高效率并在正确的时间做正确的事情。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>您能为我们提供一个使用数字双胞胎的地方的特定例子吗？这对安全有何帮助？这对提高效率有何帮助？</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森：</strong>如果你采用数字孪生，那么你基本上可以“数字孪生”一个设施，一个炼油厂……所以在炼油厂中，你可以想象有很多管道，有很多设备，有压缩机，还有发电机——有些东西非常机械地工作，人们必须维护它们才能生产出产品。</p><p>当你看到从产品进来或材料进来到产品出来的价值链时，这之间的一切都经过这个炼油厂。如果一切都实现了数字孪生，您就可以更好地规划、更好地运营。您知道事情何时发生。您可以更好地预测如何获得更好的输出。这基本上就是我们在运营的炼油厂或设施中的工作方式 - 真正查看信息的流程和数据驱动的决策。</p><p>我们总是用信息来推动决策，你知道吗？过去，信息更多地存在于经验丰富的人的头脑中，当然，有时会通过设备信息进行增强，但可能更多的是手动收集或将东西放在一起，而通过数字孪生，我们可以信息触手可及，推动这一目标的实现。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>这是一个很好的例子。我想长期听众都会知道我和谢尔文都是化学工程师。但是您可能不知道 - 好吧，我不再是化学工程师，部分原因是我被模拟化学过程的想法所吸引。我们发现我们不必构建一些过程来测试某些东西。我们可以在计算机上构建它并进行测试。你知道，那是很久以前的事了，那时候的工具真的很丑陋。我猜想您比这更复杂 - 或者我希望您比这要复杂得多。</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong>我认为这是一个总是不断发展的空间，但我对机会感到非常兴奋。我可以想象，您知道，当您有催化剂或必须测试原材料时，您必须用生产负责人进行计划，必须停止生产，您必须进行实时测试。那带走了输出。</p><p>现在，您可以以一种更有效的方式模拟规格，而不再进行身体进行。我也曾在过去的公司中，在过去的公司中，我们不得不一遍又一遍地测试事物，甚至在实验室中进行物理测试。我认为[这些时代大多是]结束了。它变得越来越多地模拟了。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>艾伦，您能给我们另一个例子，也许是在探索或提取的情况下，或者在没有数据和AI的情况下曾经是相当体验，昂贵且危险的东西吗？</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong>我认为我们也有一个很好的例子，实际上是从去年年底（]年底）发布的。当您考虑石油和天然气时，您会考虑一下，如何从水库中获得更多？您想从水库中获得最大的收益，并以一种非常有效，负责任的方式做到这一点。而且，通过收集数据，您可以想象，如果您没有计算机电源，而不是以数字方式的数据，那就很麻烦了。我无法想象人们过去是如何做到的。他们可能正在打印物品并将其放在上面，并提出基于假设的经验 - 当然，他们获得了很多经验。现在，我们使用机器学习，算法来做到这一点。我们了解岩石成分是如何的。我们甚至创建了一个“ Rockopedia”，以了解什么是不同的岩石条件和构图，以便我们每天都可以在需要时利用这些数据。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>是的，我认为有一个更大的主题，随着这些技术的出现，天空的限制是极限，所以问题是，您还能应用它，您还能处理什么？而且我认为这使我提出了有关任务和目的的问题，因为显然有大量数据。显然有很多工具。用例是由任务驱动的，以及我们想对此做些什么。</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong>是的。实际上，我将其链接在雪佛龙（Chevron）上，将其与我们的战略联系起来。我们进行更高的回报，并安全地降低碳。这是我们的指导原则：我们所做的一切当然都应该使公司成功，公司的影响，但在低碳环境中也是如此。我们知道几十年来世界（看起来）不同。我们照顾甲烷，照顾温室[燃气]排放，总体上照顾了碳足迹。因此，这是我们总是要解决的问题。数据和人工智能在我们的运作方式和安全操作方式中发挥作用，但也发挥了作用。安全是雪佛龙价值系统的重要组成部分。当您思考未来并考虑AI，机器人和数字双胞胎以及所有这些时，我们可以帮助我们的员工以更安全，更加可靠的方式以及以新的方式来帮助我们的员工来做更安全，更加可靠地完成工作将来。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我对雪佛龙或主要是工程和科学公司的公司对我来说是什么有趣的是，当AI投入生产中以增强工人，工程师和科学家正在做出的一些决策和一些见解。但是，作为工程师，作为这些植物的运营商，我可能不太同意。我不知道这是否引起共鸣：您如何使科学家和工程师使用这些工具感到舒适？</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong> MM嗯。我认为这实际上是有帮助的，因为工程师的心态非常合乎逻辑，他们了解科学，而且我们有很多科学人员。因此，当您谈论数据科学及其背后的事物时，我们有很多人对学习数据科学非常感兴趣，我们也会说我们已经开始提供教育。所以我想，“我从哪里开始？”您从学习开始：“嘿，我不明白。”这是一种典型的工程思维方式：“我不明白；我想了解它。我正在寻找&#39;它告诉我什么？它如何影响我的解决方案？&#39;”</p><p>我们已经有一段时间的数字奖学金计划了。实际上，我们与麻省理工学院（MIT）一起做这件事，在那里我们有一年的同伙，而他们并没有从一个部门出来。他们确实从整个公司中脱颖而出，一年内经历了设计工程硕士的经历，这确实是一件艰难的事情。但是他们回来了，了解新技术，理解……我们如何以不同的方式使用它。他们是第一个回到正常环境中的人，影响着其他人从知识中参与并冒险进入不同的事物，也许他们以前从未尝试过。因此，这是影响文化的一件事。</p><p>第二件事：在数据科学领域，我们开始与赖斯大学合作。我们还有一个六个月的计划，整个公司也在整个公司中，不仅让人们了解数据科学的含义，而且还将其带回了环境。因此，他们没有完全离开自己的角色。他们在六个月，七个月内走了，然后以最佳方式返回公司：“嘿，可能有可能？”</p><p>最后一件可能是最广泛的方法，因为我们称其为<em>公民发展</em>。我们认为，随着AI的发展，公司中的许多人现在将事情掌握在手中。我们刚刚看到AI世代现在掌握在……每个想要它的人的手中。总体而言，借助这种公民发展，我们希望将这项技术变得容易得多，这对许多人来说已经变得容易得多，以便他们可以使用它。而且，当然，他们需要数据的数据，这就是为什么我们在这些系统中提供数据的原因，以提高自我效率。因此，我想说的是一种三个统一的方法来影响文化，领导力，我们在AI公民发展中确实有很好的使用案例。我们还在公开谈论它的某些用例。我认为那是文化作品。进入公司的每个动脉需要一段时间，但是我觉得公司现在真的很兴奋才能走这条路。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我喜欢您所说的是，[您]实际上是在公司的主要工程和科学文化上加倍，并使这是科学与工程和AI之间的跨学科合作，而不是任何一项这些互相替代。这是<em>一个</em>，不是一个<em>或</em>。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>您是否有一个特定的例子，有人去了这些七个月的计划或数字学者计划之一，并带回了一些改变的东西，这有所不同？</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong>是的，绝对。因此，我们有很多，因为我认为我们已经两三年了，当然，它们将其带回并解决了一些问题。有时我们甚至可以实习。两三个星期后，他们认识到他们可以解决一个计划问题（他们正在咀嚼……这很复杂，但是有了新的观点，数据和人工智能，结果确实令人惊叹。</p><p>实际上，我们也有人会影响我们领域的规划 - 现场开发 - 创造了一个低代码的环境，这确实爆发了，这确实改变了我们的工作方式。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>就使公司提高生产力，更高效，确保安全性，确保它对人，社区以及各种形式的环境和物种有益，什么是具有挑战性的？有什么难的？</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong>我想说肯定有一些具有挑战性的部分。这是一项早期技术，尤其是AI一代。事情进展很快。因此，具有挑战性的是，您今天所做的一切可能会在三个月内有所不同。具有挑战性的部分是，您无法像过去一样工作的方式工作。您必须更快地旋转。这不是您构建解决方案。我认为一家公司告诉我他们建立了一个解决方案，六个月后，如果他们现在再次建造它，他们将完全不同。因此，您必须观看何时 - 我称之为将鸡蛋放在篮子里。您必须考虑哪种用例的正确时机是什么，并弄清楚了这一点，因为当技术仍处于这种发展阶段时，您不想将自己锁定。这是我们观看的东西。</p><p>然后，第二件事是，在生成AI中并不是在安全性或以正确方式处理数据方面的所有内容。那只是……技术还没有准备好。还没有解决方案。您可以构建一种沙盒或一种围栏的环境，但是您必须自己围起来。而且我认为高度标准（如微软等）等等，我认为他们还在努力在其正常景观中调整这些用例，在那里您可以拥有授权过程，您有多余的过程，如何管理和以正确的方式管理这一点。我想这仍然是缺少的。</p><p>我非常希望这将非常快地关闭，但是今天，您必须采用不同的技术。如果它是矢量数据库 - 我们在这里讨论一些技术技术语言 - 并非所有人都准备在非常安全的规模上使用它。而且，您必须想象，如果您有一家公司，则可以根据可以共享哪些信息，不应共享的信息等等。这是我们认为是一个挑战。</p><p>我想提到的第三个挑战是政策制定者。因此，我们与负责任的AI非常紧密地遵循这一点。我们是负责人AI研究所的成员，非常仔细地观察那里发生的事情。什么样的政策即将来临？我们如何将其负责任地纳入我们的操作中，并将其纳入我们的AI模型的生产中？当然，这就是进化。这不是您可以购买和运行的东西。而且，是的，我们将看到公司如何填补这些空白。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>艾伦，您可以评论生成AI，以及是否以及如何使用或计划使用它？</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong>是的，绝对。从两年左右的时间开始，我们就一直在跟随生成的AI，也许更长一些。我们对发展并不感到惊讶。也许您可以说：“好，何时chatgtp来了？”对于每个人来说，这也许是一个惊喜 - 它来得如此之快。但是我们正在观看这件事，并且已经在一种创新的沙箱环境上做了一些用例，以了解这将是什么。当它问世时，我们说：“好，这是新技术。我们想了解它。我们将其放在人们的手中，然后使用它，然后理解“我们使用什么来使用它，以及它如何共鸣？”</p><p>在5月/6月，我们决定将一个更加专注的团队放在这些活动上，现在我们有数百个用例中的用例，我们将其与最杰出的案件相提并论，并接近它们。但是，我想说的是，我们确实是最重要的是，我们确实是在做什么，并让真正的超级聪明的人在做这件事。</p><p>我可以告诉你我自己的用例。我用它写下来。您可以谈论与主管或团队一起写出您的绩效协议。您需要检查演示文稿或文档，以真正优化写作。我知道我的团队正在使用它，因为我们正在考虑产品开发，产品管理和投资组合管理。因此，在过去，他们花了更长的时间来写下他们的思想，我与我的一位团队成员交谈，她说：“过去，过去，我花了一两个星期。现在我需要一个小时才能完成这项工作。”因此，在空间中使用chatgtp有很多效率。</p><p>当我们研究其他示例时，您可以想象我们有知识数据库。我们对系统工程和其他信息的知识非常广泛。过去，如果您想知道该发电机的工作原理，则必须在搜索标准中键入，然后最终找到该文档，并且必须阅读文档。否则该文件还不够；您需要另一个文档。好的，您可以找到第二个文档，然后基本上完成答案，然后返回并基本上执行。</p><p>我们创建了一个聊天系统，您可以[更轻松地]与此类信息进行协作，并更快地弄清楚这一点。因此，这可能是两个 - 也许还有一个关于每天的事情，还有一个可能与我们在系统方法中的工作方式有关。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>如果我结合了您的一些想法，我会发现一些困难。因此，您是在谈论公民开发人员以及将许多这些工具掌握在人们手中的想法。然后，后来，您是在谈论尚未属于基础架构的安全和政策问题。从历史上看，安全总是遵循功能。我们首先关心功能，然后我们关心安全性。因此，我们结合了公民开发商中工具的广泛扩散，基础设施护栏或政策，然后担心无法快速遵循。这些似乎可以粉碎在一起并造成很多紧张。您如何导航？</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong>是的，我想说的也许我们必须谈论AI，然后再谈论AI。因此，当我谈论政策制定者时，这更多是生成的AI观点。</p><p>当您考虑公民发展时，我们会在盒子里有模型或算法。我们已经证明了[他们]；我们已经确保了[他们]。他们遵循了审查过程。我们根据负责人的AI检查了他们。因此，他们准备用于任何想要使用它的公民开发人员。因此，它们是安全和安全的，实际上它们在我们安全的环境中。因此，您已经可以从那里开始并确保它安全。但是，AI代的新技术具有这些大型语言模型及其背后的数据，大型语言模型在其中学习，这可能还没有准备好将其置于公民发展的角度。因此，为了清楚这一点，当我谈论公民发展时，所有的东西 -

后来，采购和供应链。我认为整个职业生涯的大红线是数据部分，但当然以不同的方式。因此，可以说，当我冒险进入供应链时，您会处理第三方购买的公司的大量资金。您如何组织？而且，关于您如何做到这一点，有很多数据，思考和战略思考。我会说我是学习者。我是一个谦虚的学习者。我喜欢为公司的最好成绩拥抱新事物和非常多样化的观点，而只是巧合，也许我扮演了这个角色，因为五年前我加入雪佛龙时，我开始在采购领域，因为我有采购还有一个数据数字腿，我会称之为。</p><p>我们立即解决了数据，因为数据不足以推动这些决定，也许头两年证明我是正确的。我也很相信数据和人工智能将在我们周围。因此，这是一个令人兴奋的空间，可以学习并了解下一步将要发生什么。</p><p>所以我很高兴能在那里。实际上，一位前高管说，当我对他说 - 不是在雪佛龙时 - “我在职业生涯中拥有的所有机会我都很幸运，”他说：“艾伦，你并不幸运。”所以他给了我一本书。您基本上可以调节自己的道路，因此即使您认为它不在您的直接轨迹上，但它确实可以增强您的技能以及如何连接点。我喜欢连接点，这就是为什么我享受这个角色的原因。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>这是一个很棒的故事。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>好的，这是我们提出的一系列快速射击问题。只需告诉我们您想到的第一件事即可。</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong>也许这是一个速度约会的问题。好的。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>您现在认为AI最大的机会是什么？</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong>卫生保健。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>关于AI的最大误解是什么？</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong>取代人类。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>您想要的第一个职业是什么？长大后想成为什么？</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong>我不想坐在桌子上。我失败了。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong> AI经常在我们的日常生活中使用。什么时候有太多的AI？</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong>如果它引导我朝着错误的方向引导并以不基于真实事实的方式影响我，我会说太多的AI会。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我的车上已经有太多的AI，因为我无法打开车库，因为它认识到我的位置以及必须打开的东西，如果它不起作用，我将无法进入。</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong>我喜欢这个。我们在这里有一个非常聪明的家，那里有各种语音识别电子设备，车库门开启器，洒水装置，起动器等。但是，我要说的是，提高效率有很大的帮助，如果网络降低，现在真的很难，您知道吗？</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>是的。所以最后一个问题：您希望AI现在不能做什么？</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong>嗯；治愈癌症。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>很好。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>似乎每周都有一个新的AI事情可以解决癌症的标题，然后您回头看，似乎都没有浮出水面。我并不是说我们应该退出尝试，但这总是一个例子，似乎从来没有完全到达那里。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>但这也是一个随机过程，对吗？我的意思是，如果您对此进行了足够的试验，对吗？由于人工智能和我们的实验能力，我们肯定会尝试更多的事情。</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong>我可以回答可能略有不同吗？因此，我认为另一件事是AI可能无法做的事情，这真是太好了，这确实可以帮助我们解决气候过渡，这是我们在这个星球上遇到的气候问题。我认为这在这里和那里有所帮助，但是如果可以帮助更多，那将是很棒的。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>是的。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>不过，与此同时，我认为我们可以退位，只是希望这些机器也能解决我们创建的问题。我认为这将使我们俩共同努力。没关系;那是希望的一部分。</p><p>您对人工智能有什么兴奋吗？您现在最兴奋的下一件事是什么？</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong>嗯，好问题。我认为我们想改善生活，我认为我现在住的地方，我们非常荣幸。我们已经有很多方面的AI过剩了吗？我们只是在我们的智能家园和汽车等中谈论了这件事，但这对世界上的每个人都不重要。如果这些进步和这些好处将[更广泛地]可用，那将是很棒的。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>是的，您没有问我，山姆，但我完全同意。我的意思是，我认为，当您仅考虑教育以及它对贫困社区和国家的影响时，他们就不再需要学校设置了。您可以做很多事情，并帮助许多人只是学习，发展和建立技能，这些技能通常会依靠基础设施，身体人员和老师等。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>您会认为我会受到威胁，但我一点也不。我的意思是，我认为这是我们最大的机会。我们有很多人……我的意思是，我们只是无法通过教育计划来吸引他们，而我们拥有的教育计划并不是特别快速或快速的。而且，如果我们能够解决这个问题并从大脑中获得更好的资源，那将是一个巨大的胜利。</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong>嘿，山姆，我可以问你一个问题吗？我知道我现在已经转过身了，但是如果您认为知识的保质期正在减少，对，有一些最近的文章，您今天学到的东西也许价值四到五年，然后是过时的。那么，您认为这将如何在教育系统中发展？</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>这很大，因为我考虑了这一点。我的意思是，我教机器学习和AI课，我敏锐地意识到，除非他们在学期毕业，否是短暂的。我们已经看到了这一发展的速度。我认为这促使我们退后一步并更高。如果我们进入教学工具，教授如何单击“文件”，如何单击“新”，如何单击“打开”，如何单击“保存”，那是非常低级别的技能。当我们考虑我们应该教什么样的东西时，我的意思是，我的大学是一所文科大学，我认为这很重要，因为如果我们考虑在文科世界中教授技术技能，我认为这是一件大事。我们拥有21世纪最性感的工作是数据科学。 [关于]下一个，[[]对我来说尚不清楚数据科学涉及。并不是说数据科学并不重要。它正迅速被商品化。</p><p>因此，我们拥有诸如哲学之类的东西，这些东西变得越来越重要，道德规范，随着数据科学的成本下降，这些事情变得越来越重要。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>语言学。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>语言学，是的。就这样吧。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>大语言模型，正确。精彩的。艾伦，非常感谢你。这是如此有见地，我们感谢您的时间。</p><p><strong>艾伦·尼尔森（Ellen Nielsen）：</strong>是的，谢谢。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>感谢您的调整。在我们的下一集中，我和Shervin与[MARS]毅力机器人操作的首席工程师和NASA喷气推进实验室的副经理Vandi Verma一起冒险使用AI。请加入我们。</p><p><strong>艾莉森·莱德（Allison Ryder）：</strong>感谢您听<cite>我，我自己和AI的话</cite>。我们相信，像您一样，关于AI实施的对话不会开始并停止此播客。这就是为什么我们专门为像您这样的听众创建了一个专门为LinkedIn创建组的原因。它称为领导者的AI，如果您加入我们，您可以与表演创作者和主持人聊天，提出自己的问题，分享您的见解，并从<cite>MIT SMR</cite>和BCG获得有关AI实施的宝贵资源。您可以通过访问<a href="https://mitsmr.com/AIforLeaders">MITSMR.com/aiforleleders</a>访问它。我们将在展示笔记中放置该链接，我们希望在那里见到您。</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/digital-twins-and-simulation-for-safety-chevrons-chevrons-ellen-nielsen/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>为您的员工打造更好的盟友</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/make-better-allies-of-your-wortforce/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/make-better-allies-of-your-workforce/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 04 Dec 2023 12:00:22 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Ayse Karaevli and Serden Özcan. <p>Ayse Karaevli是公司管理与变革的主席，SerdenÖzcan是北海邦管理学院的创新与公司转型主席。</p> ]]>; </dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Employee Communication]]></category><category><![CDATA[Employee Engagement]]></category><category><![CDATA[Labor]]></category><category><![CDATA[Boards & Corporate Governance]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership]]></category><category><![CDATA[Organizational Behavior]]></category><description><![CDATA[Neil Webb/theispot.com The Research The authors used ESG data from Refinitiv to analyze workforce controversies in Germany’s top 50 companies that were significant enough to gain media attention over the past 10 years.

毕竟，他们依靠它来生计以及通常的未来安全。但是，我们样本中最少的劳动力争议的公司认识并利用了员工利益与组织的利益之间的固有联系。这些公司的领导者努力确定共同的目标，并专注于如何以解决管理层和员工关注的方式实现这些目标。他们没有将潜在的冲突作为两个相对方面的谈判，而是构成了要解决的联合问题之类的情况。在这样做的过程中，他们为寻找解决方案创造了共同的所有权和责任感。</p><p>此外，这些公司偏离了使人力资源高管主要负责与员工沟通的传统做法。在我们研究的公司中，首席执行官和首席财务官直接与雇员董事会代表互动，以解释潜在有争议的决定背后的理由，然后再向整个董事会提出这些决定。艾迪达斯（Adidas）的前首席执行官赫伯特·海纳（Herbert Hainer）兼美国和欧洲几位公司董事会主任赫伯特·海纳（Herbert Hainer）表示，首席执行官的开放和透明沟通可以为员工提供更广泛的决策背景，并帮助他们与公司目标保持一致。</p><p> Wold-Turbine Maker Nordex董事会主席，半导体制造商Infineon Technologies董事会主席Wolfgang Ziebart建议强调，如果董事会成员，C套件领导者和员工代表仅专注于自己的团体权利和议程，则强调潜在的后果。他观察到：“从长远来看，每个人都会失去。”</p><p>工业工程和钢铁企业企业集团蒂森克鲁普（Thyssenkrupp）的重组工作表明，当缺乏连贯的沟通策略时，会产生影响。 2019年，为了应对Thyssenkrupp竞争的行业的全球变化，首席执行官Martina Merz制定了一个雄心勃勃的计划，该计划需要出售三个核心业务：电梯制造，海洋系统和钢铁。经过深入的讨论，董事会和雇员代表同意了该计划。</p><p> Thyssenkrupp在2020年以204亿美元的价格剥离了电梯业务。随后出售钢铁部门的努力失败了。尽管管理层探索了两年多的钢铁和海洋部门的一系列选择，包括销售，政府股权合作伙伴关系以及首次公开募股（IPO），但他们从未向董事会提出过混凝土计划。</p><p>这种歧义阻止了员工代表评估和解决工人的担忧，他们的挫败感引起了董事会的共鸣。在2023年3月的备忘录给Thyssenkrupp的100,000名工人的备忘录中，员工代表批评管理人员缺乏视力和浪费时间。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a>一周后，梅尔斯辞职。四个月后，首席财务官宣布了他的合同到期时离开的意图。</p><p> Thyssenkrupp的员工没有抵制重组。相反，他们希望看到该公司成功适应其行业的变化。他们支持最初的计划，即使成千上万的工人将受到影响 - 仅在钢铁部门就有26,000名。他们没有撤回对目标的支持。管理层未能交流并让员工引起了争议。</p><p>相比之下，当金融服务提供商Allianz改变了其核心业务模式时，公司领导者确保了员工被理解并被变更及其时机背后的原因所说服。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p>组织中各个级别的领导者都参加了沟通工作，包括全球业务转型和战略劳动力计划的负责人，30个国家 /地区的安联公司的首席执行官以及这些公司内运营实体的领导者。他们解释了转变对员工的意义，包括新的商业模式下的当前和未来角色。他们还为变更过程以及具体里程碑以及如何评估它们提供了时间表。</p><p></p><p>这种方法使公司领导者能够在安联董事会上获得员工代表的重要支持，事实证明，这对于成功推出了重新配置的组织，产品和服务至关重要。</p><p>当公司与员工进行交流并使他们参与有关敏感问题的决策时，即使一项计划没有成功，他们也会获得信任。欧洲最大的工业制造公司西门子的长期雇员总监哈拉德·克恩（Harald Kern）讲述了西门子流动性与飞机制造商庞巴迪（Bombardier）之间提议的合并。西门子的雇员代表发现，要快速理解管理层的意图并预期公司及其劳动力的影响是挑战。为了帮助他们了解合并决策背后的动机，管理层通过行业分析师的见解补充了公司信息。</p><p>最终，外部因素阻碍了合并。但是克恩说，管理层致力于开放对话和共享资源巩固员工对西门子领导人的信任。</p><p></p><h3> 2.培养包容性决策过程</h3><p>公司领导者通常将结果优先于他们如何实现。但是，我们发现，在做出决策时采取故意措施包括员工的公司经历的劳动力争议较少。</p><p> 2020年，西门子脱离了其能源业务，该部门拥有近100,000名员工，占公司销售额的40％。在董事会决定的初步讨论中，员工代表提出了在这种不确定情况下的典型问题，例如潜在的工作不安全感和对员工角色的变化。管理层不仅应对这些问题，而且还分享了有关能源部所面临的战略和财务挑战的信息。随着员工获得更深入的洞察力，他们开始将衍生产品视为最可行的解决方案，并且在此过程的后期阶段发生冲突的潜力大大减少了。西门子能源委员会总主席罗伯特·肯斯博克（Robert Kensbock）表示：“虽然有风险，但增长机会超过了他们。” <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p>从一开始就吸引员工，西门子的管理层不仅获得了支持，而且还获得了对业务运营的更深入的见解。员工提出了提高效率并将这些节省成本节省的建议。</p><p>此外，他们建议并倡导一种专门将石油和燃气轮机建造为创新中心的植物的转化，该植物将着重于使用可再生能源开发植物的发电和传输技术。 IPO之后，该工厂引入了开拓性的创新，该创新获得了西门子的能源国家的好评，并将公司定位为可再生能源行业的领导者。 <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a></p><p></p><p>在我们研究的情况下，董事会的行为从主席开始，都为员工的参与定下了基调，并确定了如何收到它。董事会主席积极邀请员工批评管理计划，保持开放的思想并寻求了解他们的观点时，员工更有可能接受，理解和有效地应对重组过程的挑战多个行业的公司。另一位受访者曾在多个德国董事会任职，并且是高盛国际（Goldman Sachs International）的非执行董事，他强调，所有股东代表都应该接受这种方法，而不仅仅是董事会主席。</p><p>此外，我们的访谈表明，劳动力争议最少的公司的董事会椅子采取了步骤，以确保所有员工都感到舒适和受人尊敬，并且他们的贡献都得到了平等的重视。我们的受访者确定了在董事会席位的公司中的几种有效实践，包括以下内容：</p><ul><li>按字母顺序安排董事的座位，以防止轻松识别其作为股东或雇员代表的各自角色。</li><li>或者，定期旋转座位，以便员工代表在每个董事会会议上坐在不同的股东董事旁边。</li><li>教练新员工代表，以便他们感到舒适，并学习如何在董事会审议期间有效。</li><li>将股东主任指导为指导员工董事会技能的发展。</li></ul><p>董事会椅子可能会走得更远，要求每位股东董事每三到六个月与两名雇员代表共进午餐或晚餐，从而为董事会外的非正式讨论创造机会。我们采访的一位董事会主席举行了社交活动，例如假日晚餐，以营造更具包容性的氛围。我们的访谈表明，这些做法可以改善董事会成员的社会凝聚力，否则他们自然不会花时间作为个人认识。</p><p>根据空中客车公司执行董事的斯蒂芬·吉科夫（Stephan Gemkow）的说法，当董事会承诺将员工纳入关键决策时，整个决策过程变得更加协作。主席并没有围绕由股东成员或管理层的优先事项构成僵化议程的董事会活动，而是主席成为一名主持人，他们鼓励开放讨论，邀请各种观点，并培养所有成员积极贡献的环境。 Gemkow说，必须采用这种方法，以发现针对复杂战略问题的创新解决方案，例如如何解决重组期间的裁员。</p><h3> 3.赋予员工战略责任</h3><p>我们的研究表明，劳动力争议较少的公司通过在正式委员会和非正式渠道中赋予员工代表的战略角色和责任来缩小员工，领导和股东代表之间的权力差距。</p><p>董事会委员会是行动所在的地方。成员对其领域中的问题进行严格研究和分析，与组织中的关键人物会面，并制定全体董事会采取行动的建议。他们有权塑造董事会的议程并影响其决策。</p><p>在德国公司治理的框架内，董事会在任命雇员代表为委员会时具有实质性的自治权。我们发现在董事会委员会任职的员工代表的比例与公司面临的劳动力争议数量之间存在直接关系。</p><p>在过去五年中没有劳动力争议的公司中，平均有70％的员工代表参加了董事会委员会。相比之下，在此时间范围内面临五个或更多争议的公司包括平均只有38％的雇员代表参加了董事会委员会。此外，当员工代表被分配到战略委员会委员会（例如财务或技术）外，除了主要关注员工或非政策事项的雇员委员会时，公司也经历了更少的劳动力争议。</p><p>在我们的分析中得分最高的公司（具有最少的劳动力争议）包括物流提供商DHL，电信运营商Deutsche Telekom和软件制造商SAP。在所有三家公司中，绝大多数员工代表在董事会委员会任职：DHL的80％，SAP的89％，Deutsche Telekom的100％。他们还是战略委员会的成员，例如财务和投资，技术与创新，战略和可持续性，除了狭义的审计和人事委员会外。</p><p>相比之下，在我们的研究期间，大众汽车和汉莎航空是劳动力争议最多的公司之一。在大众汽车公司，只有一半的员工代表在董事会委员会任职，而在汉莎航空，有40％的员工代表这样做。此外，在每家公司中，员工代表主要在诸如审计之类的战略委员会中任职。 <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p>当员工代表在更多人数和更广泛的委员会中任职时，他们对公司的整体战略和财务要求有深刻的了解。它们不仅可以有效地影响决策，而且还可以承担更大的责任。</p><p>这种安排通过促进透明度和客观性来促进健康的制衡。他们还确保股东董事从员工那里获取有关管理决策可能在考虑管理决策的长期影响的第一手信息。 Specifically, employee representatives can alert external directors to critical risks from supply chain disruptions, production inefficiencies, investment backlogs, and employee turnover trends.</p><p> Employee and shareholder representatives we interviewed said that employees, when empowered with strategic responsibilities, can also help companies address long-term goals such as integrating sustainability into corporate systems and processes and maintaining continuity in leadership succession decisions.</p><p> For example, at Bayer, employee and shareholder representatives have equal representation on the committee that oversees key performance indicators and executive compensation, including the CEO&#39;s. Employee representatives have influenced the inclusion of incentives to encourage top executives to pursue sustainability goals. In 2021, the committee recommended that 20% of the CEO&#39;s compensation be based on progress toward six goals related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, including providing support for sustainable agriculture and the health and well-being of women globally, and addressing climate change through emissions-reduction or -offset initiatives.</p><p> The Siemens board goes further. It facilitates meetings between employee representatives and managers two levels below the C-suite who are being considered for executive roles. This practice allows employee representatives to evaluate the capabilities and profiles of potential future leaders, assess their alignment with the company&#39;s values, and establish a foundation for collaboration with them in the future. Importantly, this initiative sends a strong message to employees that they are valued partners in shaping the company&#39;s future leadership.</p><h3> Many Ways to Include Employees</h3><p> There are multiple avenues for companies to integrate employees into strategic decision-making, even when they don&#39;t have a formal structure for doing so, such as employee representation on the board. Below, we suggest some alternative approaches for executing each of the three strategies.</p><p> <strong>Committees and task forces.</strong> A committee or task force that includes employees and management can be pivotal to operationalizing our first two strategies — identifying mutual goals and interests and fostering inclusive decision processes. When a company has a defined project or problem to solve, such as deciding the fate of a business unit, such groups enable employees to communicate their concerns and suggestions directly to company leaders. In addition, the CEO and CFO get an opportunity to clarify the strategic and financial logic behind crucial decisions.</p><p> Committees should include both the senior executives who are responsible for formulating and implementing the plans under discussion and employees who represent the units most likely to be affected. The employees should be selected by their peers to ensure that they reflect the perspectives of those who are closely linked to the outcomes of leaders&#39; decisions.</p><p> Ideally, leaders will involve employees from the start of their deliberations. In this way, they demonstrate to the entire organization both the value of the committee and their commitment to inclusive decision-making. This will signal that employees are at the table and in the game.</p><p> <strong>Engagement with board members.</strong> Employees can be invited to board meetings or retreats to foster more inclusive decision processes. Doing so can expose external directors to perspectives and information that they might not get from company leaders.</p><p> For instance, at a regular board meeting, key employees can share the operational and cultural integration issues their peers are experiencing after a merger. At a special board meeting or retreat, employees from across the organization can share their insights and expertise on broader topics. If, for example, the board is meeting to explore opportunities for automation, employees can weigh in on the practicality and applicability of proposed initiatives and recommend solutions for affected roles.</p><p> <strong>Employee advisory groups.</strong> Employee advisory groups provide a way to give employees strategic responsibility. Unlike committees and task forces, advisory groups are designed to function over the long term. They typically focus on broad organizational issues, including how employees feel about the company and their jobs. Because these groups play a role in helping their organizations respond to the values, concerns, and aspirations of the workforce, they can be charged with developing and recommending solutions for both ongoing concerns and the future direction of the company.</p><p> For example, a digital transformation advisory group that includes IT, marketing, and operations employees can continuously assess the impact of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, oversee the implementation of digital initiatives, and advise on digital strategy, thus ensuring that the organization remains nimble and competitive.</p><p> Similarly, an advisory group of employees from business areas that are adept at environmental compliance and sustainability practices can guide the organization&#39;s approach and initiatives in those areas to ensure compliance with ESG standards.</p><p> When the board takes the recommendations of employee advisory groups seriously and incorporates them into decisions, employees become more empowered, and their perspectives become embedded into their company&#39;s long-term objectives.</p><p></p><p></p><p> Our analysis of leading German companies shows the benefits when board directors and company leaders are open to employee input into strategic decisions and are willing to give them an influential role. They can not only more effectively address workforce and labor issues but also, by tapping into employees&#39; interests in the long-term success of the business, gain insights that make them more resilient.</p><p> Employees&#39; participation on committees, task forces, and employee advisory councils, and engagement with board members can help companies foster stronger relationships between directors or corporate leaders and their workforces while gaining the benefits from the insights that employees bring to corporate decision-making and governance 。</p><p> Organizations that embrace these practices can cultivate collaborative, equitable, and inclusive decision-making at the highest levels.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/make-better-allies-of-your-workforce/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>大型语言模型的工作限制</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-working-limitations-of-large-language-models/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-working-limitations-of-large-language-models/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 12:00:16 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Mikhail Burtsev, Martin Reeves, and Adam Job. <p>Mikhail Burtsev, Ph.D., is a Landau AI fellow at the London Institute for Mathematical Sciences, former scientific director of the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, and author of more than 100 papers in the field of AI.

Subsequently, investors poured over <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/venture-capital-funding-plunges-globally-first-half-despite-ai-frenzy-2023-07-06/">$40 billion into artificial intelligence startups</a> in the first half of 2023 — more than 20% of all global venture capital investments — and companies from seed-stage startups to tech giants are developing new applications of the technology.</p><p> But while LLMs are incredibly powerful, their ability to generate humanlike text can invite us to falsely credit them with other human capabilities, leading to misapplications of the technology. With a deeper understanding of how LLMs work and their fundamental limitations, managers can make more informed decisions about how LLMs are used in their organizations, addressing their shortcomings with a mix of complementary technologies and human governance.</p><p></p><h3> The Mechanics of LLMs</h3><p> An LLM is fundamentally a machine learning model designed to predict the next element in a sequence of words. Earlier, more rudimentary language models operated sequentially, drawing from a probability distribution of words within their training data to predict the next word in a sequence. (Think of your smartphone keyboard suggesting the next word in a text message.) However, these models lack the ability to consider the larger context in which a word appears and its multiple meanings and associations.</p><p> The advent of the latest neural network architecture — transformers — marked a significant evolution toward modern LLMs. Transformers allow neural networks to process large chunks of text simultaneously in order to establish stronger relationships between words and the context in which they appear. Training these transformers on increasingly enormous volumes of text has led to a leap in sophistication that enables LLMs to generate humanlike responses to prompts.</p><p> This ability of LLMs hinges on several critical factors, including the model&#39;s size, denoted by the number of the trainable weights (known as <em>parameters</em> ), the quality and volume of the training data (defined by number of <em>tokens</em> , referring to word or subword units), and the maximum size of input the model can accept as a prompt (known as its <em>context window size</em> ). Every parameter in a model encapsulates some information about a relationship extrapolated from the training data, so a model with a larger number of parameters tends to be more knowledgeable and nuanced. (OpenAI&#39;s GPT-3, for example, has 175 billion parameters.) The volume of the training data also significantly influences the model&#39;s ability to generalize, with larger data sets offering more diverse representations of semantic relationships and facts. (GPT-3 was trained on approximately half a trillion tokens.) The size of the prompt that the model can accept also plays a role in its accuracy. (GPT-3 has a context window of 2,000 tokens.) The more detailed the context, the more accurate the model&#39;s prediction is.</p><p> In response to a prompt, the LLM draws on the relationships established by its training to generate a continuation of the text, token by token. Each step entails forecasting the probabilities of the next token based on the context provided, and the algorithm selects the token based on these probabilities. The degree of randomness in this selection is modulated by the model&#39;s <em>temperature</em> setting. Higher temperatures produce more “creative,” or unlikely, selections, whereas lower temperatures produce more predictable responses. To improve the accuracy of an LLM&#39;s responses to specific prompts and limit its ability to produce inappropriate, irrelevant, or toxic responses, pretrained models can be fine-tuned through techniques like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/25/technology/chatgpt-rlhf-human-tutors.html">reinforcement learning from human feedback, or RLHF</a> , which has been employed to fine-tune models like ChatGPT.</p><h3> Four Important Limitations of LLMs</h3><p> Based on this understanding of how LLMs work, we can examine the false impressions they might create as we apply our human intuition to seemingly human output.</p><h4> 1. Limitations of Reasoning</h4><p> <strong>Prompt:</strong> <em>According to the cabbage-growers&#39; union report for 2007, 80% of cabbages collected were heavy (over 0.5 kg), 10% of cabbages were green, 60% were red, and 50% were big (having a diameter of over 10 cm). Which of the following statements must be false?</em></p><ol><li> <em>All red cabbages weren&#39;t big.</em></li><li> <em>30% of red cabbages were big.</em></li><li> <em>There were no cabbages that were both green and big.</em></li><li> <em>Half of the cabbages were small.</em></li></ol><p> <strong>LLM response:</strong> <em>The statement that must be false is 4. Half of the cabbages were small.</em></p><p> The correct answer would be that Statement 1 is false — at least some red cabbages must have been big.</p><p> Contrary to the impression they might create, LLMs are not built for complex reasoning. For example, studies have found that GPT-4, OpenAI&#39;s most advanced LLM, could correctly <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/over-just-few-months-chatgpt-232905189.html">verify a number as prime</a> in only 2.4% of cases, with similar weaknesses in the prediction of visual patterns. Other research has shown that <a href="https://owainevans.github.io/reversal_curse.pdf">LLMs</a> fail to understand relationships between words in the training data set: For example, GPT-4 can correctly answer the question “Who is Tom Cruise&#39;s mother?” (Mary Lee Pfeiffer) but cannot infer the answer to “Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer&#39;s son?” — with the model correctly answering questions like the former 79% of the time, compared with 33% for the latter.</p><p> Essentially, LLMs learn only to <em>verbally simulate</em> elementary logical rules but do not possess the skills to chain them together for producing and verifying complex conclusions. Moreover, LLMs are prone to error accumulation in multistep logical reasoning because the model&#39;s fundamentally probabilistic nature means that every step has a nonzero chance of an error. Finally, LLMs cannot always outline the “chain of thought” that led to a conclusion, making it difficult for humans to determine whether or where an error occurred.</p><p></p><p> A recent field experiment conducted with more than 750 Boston Consulting Group consultants highlighted the real-life implications of this limitation. Participants using GPT-4 when trying to solve a simple business problem got the answer wrong 23% more often than the control group that did not have access to an LLM — because <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/how-people-create-and-destroy-value-with-gen-ai">GPT-4 not only often got the answer wrong</a> but provided such a persuasive rationale for its solution that users accepted it at face value.</p><p></p><h4> 2. Limitations of Knowledge or Expertise</h4><p> We asked an LLM to provide us with five papers in peer-reviewed academic journals on the feasibility of nuclear fusion, with paper titles, the year of publication, and the names of the main authors. The LLM returned five results, of which two were news articles, not peer-reviewed papers, and one was a paper that does not exist.</p><p> The knowledge of an LLM is dictated by its training data. If the data lacks specific domain knowledge, has insufficient instances of a particular concept, or is not up to date, the LLM might fail to surface relevant knowledge in response to a prompt. Similarly, LLMs might reproduce errors present in the training data. Finally, the models could create errors by “hallucinating” statements that were not in the training data. Researchers who tasked ChatGPT with generating treatment plans for a variety of cancer cases found that one-third of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-generates-error-filled-cancer-treatment-plans-study-2023-8">LLMs&#39; responses contained incorrect information</a> — often mixed with correct indications, and plausibly articulated in a way that made it difficult for a layperson to identify what was accurate. In another high-profile example, two lawyers and their firm were fined after submitting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/23/two-us-lawyers-fined-submitting-fake-court-citations-chatgpt">fake citations</a> generated by ChatGPT in a court filing: The LLM had hallucinated six legal cases, including judicial opinions and quotes.</p><p> Finally, limitations of knowledge can also lead to a lack of consistency, with LLMs responding to the same prompt asked at different points in time in contradictory manners. For example, Iowa educators used ChatGPT to determine the <a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/iowa-chatgpt-book-ban/">appropriateness of books for their school&#39;s library</a> to comply with a new state law. They fed the LLM a list of all of the library books and asked it to point out those that contained content that violated the law, which resulted in the removal of 19 titles from the library. However, when journalists later queried ChatGPT on those 19 titles, it suggested that only four of them contained content inconsistent with the law.</p><h4> 3. Limitations of Understanding</h4><p> <strong>Prompt:</strong> <em>There is an apple inside a blue box. There is also a red box inside the blue box. The red box has a lid on it. How can I get the apple?</em></p><p> <strong>LLM response:</strong> <em>To retrieve the apple from the boxes, you can follow these steps:</em></p><ol><li> <em>Open the lid of the red box: Since the red box is inside the blue box and has a lid on it, you need to open the lid of the red box first.</em></li><li> <em>Remove the red box from the blue box: Once the lid of the red box is open, you can take out the entire red box from the blue box.</em></li><li> <em>Open the red box: After removing the red box from the blue box, you can open the red box to access its contents.</em></li><li> <em>Retrieve the apple: Finally, you can reach inside the red box and take out the apple.</em></li></ol><p> ChatGPT failed to understand that the apple is not inside the red box.</p><p> An LLM might not “understand” the prompt it is given. Lacking adequate context, it might falter, and its outputs might become disjointed or incoherent. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02312">Researchers analyzed ChatGPT&#39;s responses</a> to more than 500 human-submitted questions on the online software engineering forum Stack Overflow. They found that 52% of the model&#39;s responses were inaccurate, with more than half of those errors resulting from ChatGPT not understanding the concept or the details of the question, or focusing on the wrong part of the problem. This means that an LLM might not even be marginally helpful when users lack sufficient knowledge of a problem to supply good prompts.</p><h4> 4. Limitations of Planning and Execution</h4><p> LLMs can output clear step-by-step guidance for a requested task, creating the impression that the model can plan practical solutions. But given LLMs&#39; limited reasoning ability and limited understanding of tasks, suggested actions can be impractical or naive. For example, when asked to create a plan for <a href="https://fortune.com/recommends/mortgages/i-used-chatgpt-as-my-financial-planner/">saving toward home ownership</a> , ChatGPT provided some generally solid financial advice but did not account for potential changes in income or interest-rate shifts. Moreover, it does not consider human fallibility: It neither questions the realism of goals nor the user&#39;s belief to be aware of their exact spending habits.</p><p> For businesses, all of these limitations can undermine reliability; one cannot be sure that information provided by an LLM is complete, relevant, feasible, or true. Given these limitations, LLMs certainly cannot be counted on to make critical decisions or execute plans autonomously. However, delegating mundane tasks might still seem appealing — for example, those involving programmatic interactions with existing IT services, like web browsing and scraping, or social media monitoring and messaging. Indeed, Auto-GPT — an open-source application powered by GPT-4 that chains together LLM outputs to autonomously execute user-set goals — has allowed enthusiasts to create a number of impressive automation demonstrations, including <a href="https://lifehacker.com/you-can-try-auto-gpt-the-next-generation-of-chatgpt-r-1850343691">conducting research on products</a> , coding web pages or apps, and even <a href="https://dataconomy.com/2023/04/19/best-autogpt-examples-use-cases/">ordering pizza</a> . However, AI researcher Jim Fan suggested that the working demos are <a href="https://twitter.com/DrJimFan/status/1647616587199815684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1647616587199815684%7Ctwgr%5E53a5539ffd940932a855d641438099af4aa992a5%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2023%2F04%2F22%2Fwhat-is-auto-gpt-and-why-does-it-matter%2F">“heavily cherry-picked”</a> — with research on autonomous agents indicating that, in realistic environments, they <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.13854.pdf">achieve success rates of only around 10%</a> .</p><h3> Overcoming the Limitations</h3><p> Rather than simply restricting applications of LLMs to routine cases where their limitations do not apply or mistakes are not critical (such as generating new product ideas for further consideration), businesses should design all of their implementations with the limitations in mind — by complementing them with human oversight and other technologies.</p><p> Keeping humans in the loop is critical as businesses integrate LLMs into their operations. This should include validation of AI-generated outputs in order to enhance the confidence placed in the technology. It could also be extended to having experts translate business problems into prompts for the AI, and ensuring that the information provided by the model is adequate by appropriately tailoring the context and nuance fed to it.</p><p> Beyond thinking about how to craft the optimal system of humans and AI, businesses should also explore complementary technologies that can address the limitations of LLMs. In this fast-moving space, new innovations are being made constantly that promise to enhance the technology&#39;s capabilities, so continuously updating your understanding is also crucial.</p><p> For example, to enhance <em>reasoning</em> capabilities, researchers are exploring <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.07697.pdf">augmenting LLMs with reasoning engines</a> that encode domain-specific information into <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.01157.pdf">knowledge graphs</a> representing relations between specialized concepts and facts. Researchers are also training specialized models to assess the logical coherence between premises in the prompt and the LLM&#39;s output. To augment <em>knowledge</em> and <em>expertise</em> , LLMs are being trained on domain-specific databases — such as <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-can-help-doctors-and-hurt-patients/">Google and DeepMind&#39;s Med-PaLM model</a> , which has been shown to significantly outperform general-purpose LLMs on the United States Medical Licensing exam. LLM reliability might also be improved through reinforcement learning with <a href="https://github.com/opendilab/awesome-RLHF">feedback collected from human experts</a> . LLMs can also improve their understanding of a user&#39;s initial prompts by being programmed to ask clarifying follow-up questions before providing an answer.</p><p></p><p></p><p> The promise of LLMs&#39; near-universal applicability means that businesses are right to be excited about exploring this powerful new technology. However, these models&#39; uncanny ability to generate humanlike text outputs can easily lead us to ascribe to them capabilities that they do not possess. A proper understanding of their limitations should guide the manner and context in which they are implemented.</p><p> Businesses should be particularly wary in areas where logical reasoning is involved, facts are important, replicability is crucial, or the stakes are high. In these situations, companies need to explore using complementary technologies that address the limitations of LLMs — such as knowledge graphs, reasoning engines, and specialized domain models — and ensure that there is appropriate human input and oversight.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-working-limitations-of-large-language-models/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Leading in the Age of Exploding Transparency</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/leading-in-the-age-of-exploding-transparency/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/leading-in-the-age-of-exploding-transparency/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 12:00:19 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Melissa Swift. <p>Melissa Swift ( <a href="https://twitter.com/meswift">@meswift</a> ) leads Capgemini Invent&#39;s Workforce &amp; Organization practice for North America.

And it&#39;s only noon.</p><p>欢迎在超透明的世界中发挥领导作用。弗兰克是虚构的，但他面临的挑战是真实的。 The hoary cliché is true: Information flows today at the speed of light … and it&#39;s moving far too fast for many leaders to grapple with.无论是社交媒体渠道公开公司的脏衣服（甚至展示“干净内衣”信息——不是诽谤性的，但并不打算被广泛看到），还是内部技术系统将一系列脱离语境的数据扔到屏幕上，让那些不准备解释这些数据的人，技术正在严重侵蚀领导者自职场诞生以来就享有的信息优势。</p><h3> Goodbye Watercooler Grumbling; Hello QuitTok</h3><p> Knowledge is power — and today, everyone seems to have it.</p><p> Unfortunately, greater availability of information on <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/why-pay-transparency-regulations-are-a-strategic-management-opportunity/">workforce issues like pay</a> , layoffs, or diversity, as well as business performance metrics at the micro and macro scales, means that the average worker is getting hit with more bad, or at least uncomfortable, news. For leaders and employees alike, this is prompting tough conversations that create a meaningful source of stress: I hear from clients over and over that even the most seasoned leaders often struggle to engage in these challenging conversations, causing both parties to walk away more unsettled than当他们开始的时候。</p><p> Today, leaders&#39; actions are immediately discussed across internal and external platforms in writing and on a massive scale. The internal messaging app Slack alone boasts 300,000 messages sent <em>per second</em> , and 145 million people log onto Microsoft Teams for similar discussions each day. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> Fifty-five million people use company feedback platform Glassdoor every month, and 774 million are on LinkedIn to talk about work. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> Social media content tagged with the #QuitTok hashtag had been viewed an astounding 41 million times as of April 2023. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> The days when reactions to strategic leadership decisions were confined to a bit of watercooler grumbling are long gone.</p><p></p><p>那么，在一个人人都知道一切并无时无刻不在谈论的世界里，领导者如何才能保持理智和高效呢？ What can organizations do to ensure that appropriate signals pop through a cacophony of noise, and that the noise doesn&#39;t challenge the well-being of everyone they employ, from the top down?</p><p></p><h3> Four Practical Strategies for Leaders</h3><p> Here are four pathways to sanity and clarity in a hyper-transparent world.</p><p> <strong>1. Ease leaders&#39; burden by dialing up the right kind of organizational honesty.</strong> It might seem impossible to stanch the flow of difficult conversations — but a client illuminated a simple strategy for me recently: “It&#39;s easier for our leaders when we&#39;re more honest. That way, they just don&#39;t have to have as many tough conversations.” There&#39;s such truth to this statement. If people will see the reality of a given situation anyway, communicating about that reality from the jump means that individual leaders won&#39;t have to scramble and backpedal when confronted by their teams.</p><p> Now, does this entail communicating every single detail of every situation to every audience?绝对不。 What it does mean is changing the frame of every communication from “What is it that we want people to believe?” to “What are the basic facts and pieces of context that people will need to make smart decisions in this situation?” This changes the nature of the information cascade.</p><p> In the old model, leaders would be equipped with a static set of messages that the organization assumed would travel undisturbed into teams&#39; hands and be acted upon unquestioningly (or at least politely).在新模型中，组织更专注于为一系列新出现的事实建立背景——隐含的理解是，具有挑战性甚至矛盾的信息可能会不请自来。 The goal shifts from imposing a set of ideas to creating a discussion that minimizes interpersonal friction and maximizes productive action, even when there&#39;s disagreement or the information is evolving.</p><p> <strong>2. 在“同一个世界”的基础上重新构建沟通——结束内部/外部的区别。</strong> It&#39;s often said that we live in a world of context collapse, where information travels instantly through seemingly disparate circles of communication that would have been disconnected or at least time-sequenced in the past. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p> Leaders used to have the luxury of communicating internally in steps before taking the message to select outside figures in a thoughtful progression. Today, once something happens, they can reasonably assume that it will be known internally and externally in short order, across a broad array of audiences. To address this reality, many organizations have merged internal and external communications functions, or have tasked heretofore externally focused communications departments with ensuring consistency in messaging to internal stakeholders as well. Shaping communications in a unified manner not only creates stable messaging in a leak-prone world but also generally raises the standard of internal communications efforts — as internal messages are pressure-tested with the same rigor as statements released to the outside world.</p><p>即使组织没有相应地重组其沟通职能，个别领导者也可以努力确保他们的信息在内部和外部受众之间保持一致。虽然这是一项值得尝试的做法，但它可能是一种微妙的平衡行为：领导者面临着模仿社交媒体帖子等语言的挑战，同时敦促他们的同事和主管确保发布足够的信息来满足好奇的内部利益相关者的需求。</p><p> <strong>3. Go “back to the future” on basic communication skills — but add 21st-century emotional intelligence.</strong> Although the hyper-transparent world is the outgrowth of a host of quickly evolving technologies, the ultimate leadership superpower in this context is a distinctly low-tech one: being able to speak or write a simple, clear sentence. Like a bell cutting through the chatter in a crowded town square, leaders with excellent basic communication skills are simply better at making themselves heard through the noise. Pithy verbal communications are particularly demanded in situations where a stimulus is coming through quickly and frenetically (such as via social media or internal chat channels) and information might range from somewhat to completely inaccurate. We need the ability to shout “Freeze!” and have everyone stop and think.</p><p></p><p> Leaders who have historically been allowed to hem and haw or bloviate at length will find themselves quickly overrun by the punchiness of contemporary communication streams — whether or not those streams are true or helpful to business progress. All of that said, being factual and logical isn&#39;t enough on its own. A great sentence is as it ever was (the classic writing guide <cite>The Elements of Style</cite> holds up pretty well after more than 100 years), but science has taught us a great deal about how people absorb information. For instance, information that triggers an emotional response is more likely to be reposted on social media, causing it to often circulate faster and more broadly. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> Leaders who were taught to communicate coolly and unemotionally might find that their messages don&#39;t move through the organization as fast as peers&#39; more emotionally inflected statements.</p><p> In a hyper-transparent world, we might even want to look to the neuroscience findings that caution us that separating rational and emotional thinking is a false dichotomy altogether, and thus, we should stop trying to craft completely emotionless leadership messages. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p> <strong>4. Build your judgment muscle — and your team&#39;s.</strong> Let&#39;s take as a given that the transparent nature of the world and workplace will only increase from here on out.在这样的环境中，你快速而明智地决定如何处理一条信息的能力（你的判断）成为生存和成功的关键工具。 Leaders will want to consciously work on this skill themselves, but given that they cannot be in every one of a multiplying set of conversations all the time, they&#39;ll also want their teams to get better at judgment.几年前，我曾工作过的一家银行开始为一线员工提供一些与以往为高层管理人员保留的领导力发展机会相同的机会，其基本原理是，随着信息的可用性增加，这些员工也会获得同样的机会。过去，这些呼叫需要在链条上的许多步骤中进行。</p><p> There is huge value in being able to trust your team to do the right thing, even when confronted with strange and conflicting information, when you&#39;re not around.在这方面，练习情景规划是一个有用的工具，即使对于那些可能没有天生具有强烈判断力的团队成员也是如此。对于团队练习评估信息的准确性以做出更好的决策也很有帮助。 That&#39;s a critical skill in a world in which generative AI is emerging.</p><p></p><p></p><p> When leaders have some practical strategies in hand, leading in a hyper-transparent world doesn&#39;t have to feel like piloting a rickety spacecraft through an asteroid belt of conflicting, incomplete, and often emotion-laden information. We might all sometimes have a version of Frank&#39;s morning, but we can also have Frank&#39;s afternoon – where he cleared his calendar and started focusing on having the right discussions with the right folks, inside his company and beyond.</p><p> Six months later, someone posts about Frank&#39;s company on a social media channel: “Management is not perfect, but they try to be pretty honest, which I totally appreciate. They&#39;re really working on doing the right things, and you can see it day to day.”</p><p> Frank likes and shares the message.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/leading-in-the-age-of-exploding-transparency/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>为未来的工作构建神经多样性人才管道</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/building-the-neurodiversity-talent-pipeline-for-the-future-of-work/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/building-the-neurodiversity-talent-pipeline-for-the-future-of-work/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 28 Nov 2023 12:00:27 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Maureen Dunne. <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maureen-n-dunne-ph-d-a2609a45/details/experience/">Maureen Dunne</a> , Ph.D., is a globally recognized neurodiversity expert and the former president of the Illinois Community College Trustees Association, the third-largest consortium of community colleges in the United States.

Its origins are varied — demographic variables such as an aging population and early retirements, the tragic loss or persistent absence of many workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a historic drop in immigration, among others — but the numbers are now too large忽略。 At the end of last year, there were approximately two job vacancies for every available worker, expanding the labor gap to around 10 million workers. Political economist <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/09/20/american-post-pandemic-labor-shortage-explained/">Nicholas Eberstadt framed it</a> this way: “Yes, the United States has a Depression-scale work problem.”</p><p> Meanwhile, an estimated 30% to 40% of neurodivergent adults are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/20/-neurodivergent-workers-help-companies-meet-the-demand-for-talent.html">currently unemployed</a> . Unemployment rates for college-educated autistic individuals might be <a href="https://www.benefitnews.com/news/how-to-create-equitable-workplace-experiences-for-autistic-talent">as high as 85%</a> . An estimated 50 million people in the United States and <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/diversity-inclusion/inclusivity-minute/2022/neurodiversity">15% to 20% of the global population</a> fall under the neurodivergence umbrella today.</p><p></p><p> The neurodiversity paradigm advocates for a strengths-based approach to understanding, including, and valuing neurodivergent individuals with cognitive typologies such as autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia, dyscalculia, synesthesia, and dyspraxia, to name a few. Far too many neurodivergent people are falling through the cracks. This failure is not just a question of ethics. The paucity of successful and authentic neurodiversity-inclusive pathways in higher education, our workplaces, and our communities has tangible implications and hampers the success of organizations everywhere. With so many job openings unfilled and so many possible candidates unfulfilled, the theoretical win-win solution to these imbalances is certainly worth exploring.</p><h3> Cognitive Diversity and the Workplace of Tomorrow</h3><p> Harnessing the potential of neurodivergent individuals could help employers build a more future-ready workforce. Creativity, lateral (or nonlinear) thinking, reverse engineering to solve problems, complex visual-spatial skills, systems thinking, intuitive insights, hyperfocus, and multisensory pattern recognition — distinct areas in which neurodivergent candidates might excel — all stand to become increasingly important as artificial intelligence embeds itself into our daily lives.</p><p> Neurodivergent leaders already occupy top positions in every industry, including the military, though many are reluctant to disclose their status. There is ample evidence to suggest that these same individuals — when situated in an effective and suitable working context — can perform as well as or even better than their neurotypical peers in a range of positions. According to James Mahoney, head of the Autism at Work program at JPMorgan Chase, an internal study found that autistic employees — when correctly onboarded — demonstrated <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/behavioral-competencies/global-and-cultural-effectiveness/pages/viewpoint-how-to-become-a-champion-for-employees-with-autism.aspx">up to 140% greater productivity</a> than neurotypical peers hired for the same positions.</p><p></p><p> No two neurodivergent people are the same, and it is important to value the richness and diversity of all kinds of minds, given that different individuals exhibit their own unique strengths and challenges. That said, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that there is a correlation between different divergent neurotypes and uncommon skills, such as a heightened capacity for originality or innovative ideation. The results of numerous studies suggest that neurodivergent cognition is positively correlated with enhanced creativity and innovative thinking and that autistic people are less prone to cognitive biases and <a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/autistic-people-challenge-preconceived-ideas-about-rationality">more consistent in making rational decisions</a> than the general population. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> These unique perspectives and skills are inherently valuable to employers on an individual level while providing additional group-level value as a critical hedge against groupthink.</p><p></p><h3> The Community College Talent Pipeline</h3><p> A large percentage of neurodivergent individuals begin their higher education journeys at community colleges; one 2015 study found that of those with autism who attend college, as many as 80% enroll in a community college. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> Efforts to bring the neurodivergent into the business economy should begin at — or at least in partnership with — these kinds of institutions and could be a game changer in crafting neurodiversity-friendly employment opportunity pathways.</p><p> This might be especially true given the tone set by the US Supreme Court&#39;s recent ruling on <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-outlawing-collegiate-affirmative-action-will-impact-corporate-america/">diversity in college admissions decisions</a> , which stands to disproportionately strip diversity from elite university student bodies. Companies committed to the notion that diversity of all kinds is a priceless asset might need to think more creatively about where that diversity can be found.</p><p> The burden then falls on expanding opportunity pathways for students at community colleges. During my time as president of the Illinois Community College Trustees Association, we looked to incentivize collaboration between community colleges, local and regional economic development organizations, and employers. The first statewide Future of Work committee was designed to facilitate direct industry partnerships with employers to create new opportunity pathways for students, communities, and businesses and to facilitate conversations about emerging industries and careers.</p><h3> Building Bridges With Industry</h3><p> Pound for pound, the community college system is our most efficient means of producing qualified candidates to meet the needs of the largest end user of the education system: the corporate economy. However, employers will be able to tap into the full depth and breadth of this talent pool only if neurodiversity-friendly opportunity pathways are cultivated and sustained from the outset.</p><p> Community colleges already serve as powerful partners in meeting the needs of local employers. If they provide wraparound supports such as mental health support, specialized tutoring, time management tools, executive function coaching, and peer navigators, neurodivergent students will be far more likely to navigate a path toward degree completion and subsequent employment.</p><p> Apprenticeships, paid internships, and job-shadowing opportunities with community employers also play critical roles in bridging gaps between earned skills and successful employment. Many community colleges offer an apprenticeship “earn and learn” model, such as the Project Hire-Ed Apprenticeship Program at the College of DuPage, where employers pay for students&#39; tuition to help shepherd them toward learning new skills while they develop on-the-job experience working in a related role.</p><p></p><p> Cybersecurity offers a good example of a target industry for such programs, given the pervasiveness of neurodivergent people working in the field. Per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, information security analyst jobs are expected to grow by <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/information-security-analysts.htm">32% from 2022 to 2030</a> . Community colleges around the country, including the City Colleges of Chicago and Nassau Community College, offer more affordable cybersecurity certificate programs that position candidates on a career path with immediate local demand. Competency-based education, such as the welding technology program at Lewis and Clark Community College, represents a similarly attractive framework with flexible options for learners with diverse needs, paving a path to earned credits through skill mastery.</p><p> The neurodiversity movement has raised awareness of the talents of neurodivergent job seekers and developed stronger collaborative initiatives between postsecondary education and industry. For example, Bloomberg has reported that US intelligence services have started to look to the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-18/people-on-the-autism-spectrum-may-be-ideal-for-some-ai-work#xj4y7vzkg">neurodivergent community</a> to supercharge their machine learning and cybersecurity practices. Companies in completely different sectors are following suit after witnessing the likes of <a href="https://businesschief.com/human-capital/top-7-companies-hiring-and-nurturing-neurodiverse-talent">EY, JPMorgan, Microsoft</a> , and other high-profile firms harness the advantages of prioritizing diversity of thought.</p><p> These efforts provide a road map. Collaborations between industry partners, economic development associations, and community colleges that leverage neurodiversity-friendly wraparound support programs, apprenticeships, paid internships, and job-shadowing initiatives represent a new feature in the labor market ecosystem. By leaning into this trend, we have the opportunity to cultivate a work-ready neurodivergent talent pipeline capable of challenging outdated, unproductive assumptions about what a qualified candidate looks like.</p><h3>在办公的地方</h3><p>To truly capitalize on the neurodivergent talent pool, job placement coordinators and employers must implement the right processes. On the employer side, human resources departments should review recruitment and hiring practices, with a strong emphasis on inclusion. They should also work to further institutionalize onboarding strategies for both colleagues and management that promote a deeper understanding of how to support neurodiverse teams.</p><p> On a practical level, this might entail mentoring neurodivergent personnel during onboarding — providing clear success metrics, avoiding ambiguity, and allowing universal access to noise-canceling headphones and other accommodative tools and practices. In addition, some neurodivergent people are much more productive in familiar environments, so demonstrating an openness to hybrid or remote workplace protocols could signal a more receptive attitude toward their needs.</p><p></p><p> But these steps have little impact when an organizational culture fails to embrace psychological safety, trust, anti-bullying policies, and clear communication standards. In other words, no matter how much sunlight and water you make available, a garden won&#39;t grow in toxic soil. The stakes are high, and the payoff is potentially huge for forward-looking organizations willing to embrace authentic neurodiversity inclusion and belonging. But a cosmetic effort will have little impact.</p><p> By combating stereotypes; permitting flexible, results-driven work arrangements; and fostering welcoming organizational cultures where people don&#39;t feel the need to mask their cognitive differences, we can start to collectively harness the full potential of our neurodiverse workforce.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/building-the-neurodiversity-talent-pipeline-for-the-future-of-work/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>数据科学中连接器角色的兴起</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-rise-of-connector-roles-in-data-science/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-rise-of-connector-roles-in-data-science/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 27 Nov 2023 12:00:38 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Thomas C.

Even for those that succeed, progress is often slow and expensive.为什么？ Organizational gaps between teams are wreaking havoc with the ability to develop, apply, and scale data science projects. A new type of role is needed to bridge these gaps.</p><p> Let&#39;s not minimize the many aspects of data science that can trip a company up — from defining the right business problem to developing a solution and then supporting it properly. However, our diagnosis of the situation, researched in part with our colleagues Roger Hoerl and Diego Kuonen, shows that many companies struggle less with the solution and more with the organizational issues.</p><p></p><p> We&#39;ve identified three root causes for this. First, data science has been <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/06/your-data-strategy-needs-to-include-everyone">“bolted on” to the organizational chart</a> . This might have been acceptable a generation ago, when data science was reserved for relatively few problems, but it needs to be built in now that data science matters to every team.</p><p> Second, data science aims to improve day-to-day operations and decision-making, and that means disruption. But most line managers strive for control, predictability, and no surprises. Given that disruption and control are polar opposites, there is a far greater-than-normal tension between line management and data science.</p><p> Third, many companies seem to expect data scientists to do it all: magically understand the business and all its nuances, deal with data quality issues, and convince recalcitrant managers and staff members to change their long-cherished processes. Many data scientists prefer to simply create better algorithms, which means those other tasks often receive short shrift.</p><p> There is no minimizing these issues — they are deep, structural, and often political and may well demand additional management strategies. Here, we will address one critical aspect of the organizational problem, namely the gaps between the various departments that inhibit the development and deployment of data science models.</p><h3> Closing the Gaps With Connectors</h3><p> The obvious way to close organizational gaps is to fill them with people. We generically call people in these roles <em>connectors</em> . For some time, companies have assigned people who have job titles such as systems analyst, business analyst, coverage officer, and systems engineer to close gaps between business and technical departments. They&#39;ve also tried to close gaps that crop up in data science projects, labeling the people tasked with doing so data wranglers, data engineers, purple people, and translators.</p><p> While many such efforts have helped move data science projects along, it often feels like an elaborate game of whack-a-mole: Close one gap, and another pops up. Also, these efforts alone don&#39;t resolve some of the related issues:</p><ul><li> Line managers and data scientists often don&#39;t understand each other. This makes it particularly difficult for both parties to agree on the problem to be solved and for data scientists to obtain and understand the nuance in needed data.</li><li> Implementing a model requires extensive changes within the business: redesigned processes, training on how the models work, and upskilling to run them.</li><li> The two sides might not see eye to eye on IT infrastructure decisions, such as those related to technical debt.</li></ul><p> For those reasons, we recommend that companies approach the issue in a more disciplined manner, following these three steps.</p><p> <strong>1. Define the data science project process and identify the people involved.</strong> While the specifics might vary, the process should start with framing the problem and understanding the business context and end with monitoring/updating the new model in production. The critical work: identifying who, outside the data science team, must be involved in each step.</p><p> For example, when framing the problem and selecting a project, companies want to involve both senior leaders and middle managers whose teams will be affected. When it&#39;s time to obtain and prepare data, business domain experts who understand the data nuances and IT professionals who prepare data should be in the room. When developing the model, external software providers should be consulted. When it&#39;s time to insert the model into processes, business and process analysts, managers of the affected processes, trainers, and change professionals should all be involved. Finally, as an organization deploys the model into the IT infrastructure and then monitors and updates it, IT professionals, people building the data pipes, and supply chain managers should contribute.</p><p> <strong>2. Evaluate where connectors can help.</strong> Essentially, this step aims to clarify the gaps. Ask, “Are all of the people involved fully connected — that is, do they understand their roles, and is there sufficient communication such that work gets done in a reasonably effective manner?”</p><p> We find that most often the answer is “no.” Indeed, we find that connectors are often essential in the following ways:</p><ul><li> Framing the problem to be solved with data science: For example, executives might have heard some of the hype surrounding AI but lack a deep enough understanding of what problems it can help solve, or the technology&#39;s potential across the organization.</li><li> Translating between business and technical people — an age-old gap that has yet to be closed.</li><li> Dealing with data quality issues.</li><li> Communicating requirements, progress, and issues within the team — in other words, tying the many pieces of a data science project together and being the connector between diverse teams.</li><li> Keeping track of progress toward the overall goal of deployment and organizational change when nobody else sees the big picture.</li></ul><p> <strong>3. Clarify specific roles for connectors and put them in place.</strong> This step is generally straightforward for individual projects. We recommend that companies also consider having connectors between the entire data science program and the rest of the business. There is a <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/to-succeed-with-data-science-first-build-the-bridge/">natural tension</a> between line managers, who work hard to establish a measure of control in their everyday work, and data science professionals, who aim to disrupt things.</p><p></p><p> Left unchecked, this tension makes it extremely difficult for a data science team to establish itself within a company. Connectors at the program level aim to ease this tension: They help senior business leaders understand both the potential and challenges of data science, help data science leaders understand the top problems facing the business, and establish a portfolio of data science projects that aligns with business需要。</p><p></p><h3> What Companies Are Trying Now</h3><p> Given that building the organizational capabilities to succeed with data is so important, we are delighted to see companies experimenting and enjoying success with a wide range of connector roles. For example, Regions Bank and many other organizations make use of data product managers, who take an end-to-end perspective. Forty percent of organizations now take a data product management approach, according to a recent <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/data/cdo-report/">survey of chief data officers</a> .</p><p> Gulf Bank in Kuwait has created a network of data ambassadors to lead quality and data science projects at the department level. The Federal Statistical Office of Switzerland employs a “data science bridge” to coordinate its many statistical functions. Kroger&#39;s data science subsidiary, 84.51º, has a set of what it calls solution design consultants — people with business backgrounds who mediate between data scientists and business stakeholders. (84.51º refers to the longitudinal location of the subsidiary&#39;s Cincinnati office, and like early purveyors of longitude maps, the company makes sense of complex data problems.) Kroger&#39;s 84.51º also uses technology in the form of machine learning operations tools to monitor the status of data science projects from inception to ongoing management and keep all parties informed. Many other organizations have also adopted such connector roles and tools.</p><p> Let&#39;s examine the work at Regions Bank and the Federal Statistical Office of Switzerland in more detail.</p><h4> Data Product Partners at Regions Bank</h4><p> Manav Misra, chief data and analytics officer of Regions Bank, observed that many data science projects were not being successfully implemented, so he established the concept of <em>data products</em> and the new connector role of <em>data product partner</em> to manage them.</p><p> Misra defines a data product as an end-to-end software solution to a problem that the business has. “A data product leverages data and advanced analytics heavily in order to deliver that solution,” he said. Data product partners function as both data product managers and partners with the business who bring products to fruition and manage them over time.</p><p> Each data product partner is assigned to a particular business or support unit of the bank and attends staff meetings with their business partners in order to better understand their priorities. Most partners come from the business side of the bank, though some also have analytics backgrounds.</p><p> The job of the data product partner includes understanding what the business unit and end users need and starting the development cycle with a minimum viable product. During the early stages of the process, data product partners serve as bidirectional translators, connecting the opportunities of analytics and AI with business needs. At the later stages, they are responsible for assessing how the complete solution is adopted and used, monitoring how well the user interface is working, keeping track of how many people use it, and ensuring that the product delivers or exceeds the value promised in the original business case.</p><h4> The Data Science Bridge in Switzerland</h4><p> The Federal Statistical Office in Switzerland recognized that it needed to improve its core data science processes if it was to meet the growing needs of the Swiss government, so it created a data science competence center, a type of center of excellence. To make sure the competence center was fully connected to the rest of the Swiss government, leaders staffed a “data science bridge” — a group of connectors specifically charged with <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-data-science-management-process/">managing six high-level processes</a> :</p><ul><li> Driving collaboration.</li><li> Developing human capital.</li><li> Ensuring data quality.</li><li> Managing the project portfolio.</li><li> Ensuring a positive business impact.</li><li> Ensuring a human-centric and trustworthy application of data science.</li></ul><p> The bridge is paying real dividends. It has facilitated communities of practice in the customer base, helping people become more effective users of data tools and reports and encouraging them to exchange their experience with data science and AI, based on a common language and understanding. The bridge is reducing chaos in the six processes listed above.</p><p> Moreover, “most important decisions are taken on the bridge,” noted Kuonen, who serves as an adviser to the Swiss government on data science. (Kuonen is also head of Statoo Consulting, a Switzerland-based consultancy, and professor of data science at the Geneva School of Economics and Management at the University of Geneva.) Kuonen believes that the bridge will deliver more value as it matures.</p><h3> Connector Management Challenges: Five Questions to Ask</h3><p> Despite the apparent advantages of connectors, managing them presents some tough issues. In some respects, connectors operate in “white space” in the org chart, where management is always tough. For example, companies have not had much luck managing data stewards as they seek to align the definitions of various data elements across a company.</p><p> Companies should think through the following questions as they define their connector roles. The answers will vary by organizational circumstance, but some patterns are beginning to emerge.</p><p></p><p> <strong>1. Where should connectors sit, organizationally?</strong> Most commonly, connectors sit under the chief data and analytics officer or the data science organization, but they are sometimes found in business-side groups. If the company has been successful at matrix management for other roles, connectors could report to both areas.</p><p> <strong>2. How should companies attract, evaluate, and retain connectors?</strong> As data expert <a href="https://tdan.com/how-to-find-the-right-tweener-for-your-organization/31029">Theresa Kushner has pointed out</a> , connector roles are challenging, given that they require knowledge of both the business and data, as well as considerable soft skills. There are now several hundred analytics and data science degree programs in business schools, which are a good place to recruit connectors. Organizations putting together a team of connectors often ask business leaders to evaluate candidates for such roles; Procter &amp; Gamble, for example, asked leaders to identify one “breakthrough business result” that each candidate helped to achieve. Retention will depend in large part on offering these hires a viable career path.</p><p> <strong>3. What is the connector career path?</strong> Experienced technical people may very well recognize the need for connectors but fear that if they take such a role, they will lose their technical edge. Experienced business people might not want to fall off their current career path within their business unit or function. In the short run, companies should establish roles of increasing responsibility in the data science organization, such as senior and well-compensated data product managers. We believe that in the long run, many organizations will want every senior executive to have data science experience in their background.</p><p> <strong>4. Is more than one type of connector needed?</strong> Since some connecting is performed at very high levels, while other connecting is focused on the detailed technical level, the logical answer is “yes.” But a company might not be able to afford to hire more than one for a project, so some companies are asking data product managers to play a lower-level connector role as well. Other organizations ask connectors to play their roles across two or more projects at once.</p><p> <strong>5. What exactly are a connector&#39;s responsibilities?</strong> Since connectors might have the best overall view of a project, it is common to charge them with managing it end to end (as in the role of data product manager). This is appropriate if connectors are experienced and if they understand and value the technical roles on a data science project. If they don&#39;t, their connector responsibilities should be more circumscribed, such as translator roles that don&#39;t involve end-to-end responsibility for project success.</p><p> More detailed answers to these questions will emerge for your organization over time.</p><p></p><p> In our work with companies that have successfully employed connector roles, the software vendors and data science leaders involved have told us that the deployment percentage of data science projects has increased as connectors have proliferated. We believe that this is an important and ongoing set of roles that needs further institutionalization in almost every large company. Otherwise, data science might become a dismal science with a low deployment percentage and a poor record of improving business performance.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-rise-of-connector-roles-in-data-science/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>问三阴：我怎样才能说服自己我属于领导者？</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ask-sanyin-how-can-i-convince-myself-i-belong-in-leadership/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ask-sanyin-how-can-i-convince-myself-i-belong-in-leadership/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 22 Nov 2023 12:00:10 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sanyin Siang. <p>Sanyin Siang is a CEO coach and leads the Fuqua/Coach K Center on Leadership &amp; Ethics (COLE) at Duke University.需要建议吗？ Send an <a href="mailto:asksanyin@mit.edu">email to Sanyin</a> .</p> ]]>; </dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Leadership Advice]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership Development]]></category><category><![CDATA[Managerial Psychology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Team Dynamics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership Skills]]></category><category><![CDATA[Managing Your Career]]></category><description><![CDATA[Dan Pinnolis/MIT SMR &#124; Getty Images I have just moved up to an executive job, and while I know I’m ready, I don’t feel very confident in front of my team.

I was the first in my family to go to college and still carry the feeling of having to prove I belong, even though I have a track record of accomplishments at this company. How do I tamp down the impostor syndrome and feel like a leader?</p><p> Don&#39;t beat yourself up for experiencing impostor syndrome. Some self-doubt is normal when taking on a more senior role. Instead of trying to banish it, you can transform it into something powerful as you build new relationships with your team members.</p><p> Impostor syndrome is seen as concern about our capabilities, but I think that concern arises from whether we feel that we belong in a particular space. Insecurity about being seen, included, and accepted is a relational issue that others on your team likely also feel at times.</p><p></p><p> One of the best antidotes for impostor syndrome, especially for someone in a leadership position, is to build a sense of belonging and community. By creating connection and fostering inclusion for others, we can also create a greater sense of belonging and confidence for ourselves. There are three practices that managers can use to increase inclusion and inspire confidence among their team members.</p><p> <strong>Acknowledge contributions.</strong> It can take courage for people to speak up in meetings. But when we fail to adequately recognize the speaker, or adopt their idea without giving credit, they might leave the meeting feeling unheard or unappreciated. Make a habit of acknowledging people in the moment: “That&#39;s a new idea — thank you,” or “To build on Tom&#39;s idea … ,” for instance. Managers can and must create an atmosphere where team members feel their contributions are welcome.</p><p> <strong>Make good introductions.</strong> Build a sense of belonging by introducing people with some comments about their strengths, expertise, and history. Good introductions help others know the role the person plays and the value they bring, but they also reinforce the person&#39;s sense of self and confirm their ownership of their responsibilities. As a leader, it can be especially meaningful to introduce members of your team in this way to people outside the company. It shows respect for them and confirms that they matter.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Emphasize superpowers.</strong> I believe everyone has one inimitable and intrinsic gift — their superpower — and it&#39;s important to acknowledge a person&#39;s superpower when you see it in practice. These abilities are often invisible, undiscovered, or minimized by the individual. Many of us don&#39;t recognize them in ourselves until a perceptive leader or colleague points them out. Helping employees see their gifts can quiet the inner voices telling them they don&#39;t belong.</p><p> The leaders who experience impostor syndrome most acutely are often those who came to the role from less privileged backgrounds, have followed a nontraditional path, or are from underrepresented demographic groups. Those experiences can build our awareness of our own vulnerability and an understanding of the limits of what we&#39;re able to control on our own — that is, humility. Add genuine empathy for team members to those qualities, and guess what: You possess the traits of the kind of leader who can be most effective in these challenging times. And you&#39;ll be embraced for your leadership by your team.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ask-sanyin-how-can-i-convince-myself-i-belong-in-leadership/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Diversity Nudges</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/diversity-nudges/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/diversity-nudges/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 18:00:29 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Paola Cecchi-Dimeglio. <p>Paola Cecchi-Dimeglio ( <a href="https://twitter.com/hlspaola">@hlspaola</a> ) is the faculty chair of the Executive Leadership Research Initiative for Women and Minority Attorneys and a senior research fellow at the Center for the Legal Profession at Harvard Law School.

These interventions are often small, easy to implement, and inexpensive, but when they are applied to choices, processes, and organizational levers in the attraction, recruitment, onboarding of people and along the employee path cycle, they can help make a workplace more diverse和包容性。</p><p></p><h3> Nudges That Attract Diverse Talent</h3><p> The conversion rates (CRs) at one e-commerce giant were below target within certain segments of shoppers, including lower-income people of color and middle-income LGBTQIA+ people. Meanwhile, the company&#39;s primary competitor had successfully hired more women, Black and Latine people, Pacific Islanders, and LGBTQIA+ persons in marketing, behavioral analysis, and other roles, and their diverse perspectives were translating into higher CRs.</p><p> The company launched a major campaign to attract diverse talent. It engaged a search firm that cast a national net and ran print and digital ads that highlighted the company&#39;s commitment to diversity and inclusion. Then leadership sat back and waited for those diverse candidates to appear. Views of the online job posting peaked around three and a half weeks after the advertising blitz but flatlined by the seventh week. Fewer than 11% of site visitors applied for a position. Only three applicants were interviewed; two received offers, one of which was declined. In other words, if you build it — with impressive resources and at great expense — they still might not come.</p><p> As this company discovered, it is not enough to simply gain the attention of the potential candidates you seek to attract. Converting appropriate talent to applicants and candidates requires additional outreach and cultivation. Individuals from underrepresented demographics — including people of color, those who identify as LGBTQIA+, and people with disabilities — often have fewer contacts at competitive employers and know fewer people who can help them navigate the application process. Organizations that want to increase diversity can attract more candidates from underrepresented groups by using nudges — modifications in the language and content presented in the talent acquisition process — in ways that help generate a diverse candidate pool, maintain the pool throughout the process, encourage top candidates to accept job offers, and help keep them onboard.</p><p></p><p> Nudges can help build trust and reduce information asymmetries early on. In one such intervention, a company displayed the numbers of women and underrepresented individuals among its leadership, as well as its diversity and inclusion goals and a timeline, beside an online job posting. A video at the bottom right of the screen featured the CEO speaking about his commitment to inclusion and diversity. This intervention increased the percentage of women and underrepresented groups that applied by 22% in the short term and 18% over the long term. Candidates from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds rose by 17% overall. And, importantly, the conversion rate from applying for a job to accepting a position rose by 8 percentage points.</p><p> Nudges that enhance familiarity with a potential employer can help maintain the applicant pool throughout the process. For example, even if the job seeker does not personally know someone at the company, facilitating a connection can make the company more attractive. One online experiment randomly allocated 1,276 applicants to one of four conditions after they had submitted applications and before they had heard from the company:</p><ul><li> Applicants were given the opportunity to ask questions of women employed at the company while their application was in process.</li><li> Applicants were given the opportunity to ask questions of men employed at the company while their application was in process.</li><li> Applicants were given the opportunity to ask questions of a group that comprised one male employee and one female employee.</li><li> Applicants were not given the opportunity to ask questions of any employees.</li></ul><p> When women could ask questions of women employed at the company, those candidates performed better during their interviews than under any other condition. Their scores as assessed by interviewers increased by 34%. These same candidates were also more satisfied with the application process and the company&#39;s image. And those who did not receive a job offer were more likely to reapply within the next 24 months.</p><p> Along similar lines, in an online experiment at a tech firm, I randomly allocated 1,478 applicants to one of several conditions after they had submitted their applications and before they had heard from the company. Some applicants were assigned a fellow job seeker as a buddy with whom they could practice the required tasks if they were selected for an interview;有些则不然。 Of those applicants assigned buddies, some women were paired with women, some women were paired with men, and some men were paired with men.</p><p> Job seekers who were partnered with a buddy after applying experienced a 40% higher interview selection rate; the impact was particularly notable among underrepresented groups and for junior positions. Women who were paired with men received interview scores that were 9% higher than in other conditions. Candidates participating in the buddy system were more satisfied with the process, even if they were not selected for an interview or if they were interviewed but not offered a position. This increase in satisfaction was 28% for women and 29% for men.</p><p> Having a friend or acquaintance in the industry can reduce the trepidation felt by people who are seeking employment in areas that have traditionally excluded them. These candidates are seeking information: “What is it like?我应该穿什么？我应该如何准备？ What should I say or not say?如果什么 …？” Knowing takes away much of the fear, and potential employers can fill that information gap by recognizing this condition and intervening to redesign the dynamic. Balancing the exchange with information that candidates are seeking mends the divide and engenders trust. Information provided by a potential employer lets candidates decide whether the company is a good fit, whether they can see themselves working there, and whether they will be embraced by the organization.</p><p> Consider the transport and logistics industry, for instance, which is overwhelmingly male-dominated. Closing such a wide gender gap requires creativity. One company that sought to hire more women took photographs of each woman employed at the company. It then graphically illustrated the gender gap by placing the women&#39;s pictures adjacent to a blank space that represented the additional women required to close the gender parity gap. The date by which the organization wanted to hire enough women to fill in the empty space was also included in the illustration.</p><p> Not only did the company display the image and text on its website, but it also talked to all of the relevant search and recruitment firms and launched a major campaign aimed at getting women to apply. Over six months, the efforts produced a 30% increase in female applicants, including more women from underrepresented groups.</p><p> The design of job applications can also affect the number of candidates who apply. Small things like requesting information related to gender and race on applications have proved significant in previous experiments and interventions, but the placement of these requests can either repulse or attract candidates. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p> A company study that involved 320 applicants sought to determine the impact of collecting gender information at the beginning of the application, at the end, and not at all. Where gender identity was requested at the end, 7% more women completed the application than in the other two conditions.</p><p></p><h3> Nudges for Recruiting Diverse Talent</h3><p> Dropping demographic indicators from CVs can allow unbiased assessment of the candidate. At one global company, applicants were directed to enter their CVs in an online portal, which made the look, feel, and format identical for everyone. All of the reviewers saw the same thing, and all indicators of race and gender were removed. The stripped data included names, affiliations, volunteer activities associated with a religious or cultural group, hobbies, language skills, or connections to special advocacy or community organizations.</p><p> The removal of such data reduced the likelihood of bias and made job experience the primary focus of the hiring teams. Candidates were also asked to describe their workplace results and contributions. This neutral format focused the assessment process and increased the pool of underrepresented groups, in both Europe and the United States, by roughly 40% within 18 months. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a></p><p> Applying similar principles during a consulting engagement with a tech company, we used AI voice alteration to mask gender. Candidates used a tool called Gap Jumper to solve skill-based challenges without disclosing their gender, as well as a voice modulation device to anonymize gender and ethnic or racial background. The resulting increase in job offers was almost 16% for women and 18% for members of underrepresented racial groups.</p><p> After a fair and neutral process has been designed, it is still necessary to make a hiring decision. When practicing the art of hiring, a useful strategy is to change the question from “Whom should we include?” to “Whom should we exclude?” In this case, rather than struggling with criteria that indicate who should be chosen, decision makers determine who should be excluded and, from that, are able to identify a smaller group of the strongest candidates. Although this approach might seem counterintuitive in the context of seeking to be more inclusive, it forces decision makers to focus closely on core qualifications and exclude candidates who do not meet them.</p><h3> Nudges for Onboarding Diverse Talent</h3><p> At a global financial services company with multiple offices in the New York City area, several partners were celebrating the hiring of eight new staff members. The group was diverse in gender, race, and age — a mix of millennials, Gen Xers, and a baby boomer.</p><p> The millennials seemed to have no trouble finding their footing, and the Gen Xers were familiar with the organization and had many colleagues who were already part of their network. But the onboarding process didn&#39;t welcome and assimilate Carlton, a Black man in his late 50s hired at the executive level, like it had the seven others. Although he was impressively talented and skilled, Carlton had diminished access to information, and it impacted several of his assigned projects. In less than 18 months, shortly after his first performance review, he left the company for a competitor. His departure measurably damaged the company. In the short term, the cost of replacing him would range between $1.5 million and $1.75 million. In the long term, his assessment of the company as a place of employment would negatively resonate throughout his network.</p><p> The data has found a link between individuals leaving an organization after 12 to 24 months and their onboarding experience — a correlation that stands out more than any other factor in the life of the employee at the company. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> In short, get onboarding right or pay the price.</p><p> An effective onboarding process ensures that new hires are brought fully and inclusively into the organization. Small modifications enable new hires to better navigate this process and access the information and services that can help them integrate comfortably and become productive.</p><p> Like new immigrants, new employees seek information about the norms, policies, politics, and behaviors that will help them function successfully in the new setting. New hires require clarity regarding roles and expectations. They want background information about the company. They want to know how to thrive, what it takes to excel and get promoted, and what it takes to master their jobs. They also want to know what constitutes a high standard and where they should aim.</p><p> One large professional services firm nudged its onboarding process by sending a series of short videos featuring the CEO, some board members, and some members of the executive team to candidates as soon as they received job offers. These three-minute videos were aligned with company strategy and were sent each day for 15 days. They were paired with messaging about the company&#39;s commitment to diversity, what it felt like to be part of the company, what to expect if you were to make a mistake as part of a team, and how people were expected to handle such an occurrence. The videos also discussed what it meant to have equal opportunities to succeed.</p><p> In another variation, the new hires were assigned to a work project for a large client right away. The data showed that the 15 videos plus the assignment to a large project upfront resulted in improved performance among women and individuals from underrepresented groups because the interventions increased job clarity. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p> In the banking industry, an effective onboarding nudge featured stakeholder meetings at two weeks, three months, six months, nine months, and 12 months. In the meetings, the hires heard from people who had been at the organization for at least five years, who discussed problems the new employees had encountered during onboarding, how they had overcome those challenges, and their perceptions of the company as they moved through the 12-month process.</p><p> A variation of that approach used intervals of six months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months, during which stakeholder meetings took place every six weeks. The result was a higher retention rate for women and underrepresented groups 48 months after hiring.</p><p> One of the important elements of onboarding is the opportunity to create and structure one&#39;s network. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> The network brings with it access to information and opportunities for mentorship. It sets a social-emotional tone and influences how at ease a new hire will feel in the job.</p><p> One intervention at a financial institution hinged on sharing with new hires a list of 10 people that they were encouraged but not required to contact within 12 months. Each list included a mix of employees, some of whom were at the executive level. Some of the newcomers received an explanation of why they should reach out to the people on their lists, while others did not. And some participants in the experiment received email reminders to contact the people on the list at three months, six months, and nine months.</p><p></p><p> Individuals were selected for inclusion on a given new hire&#39;s list based on information that had been captured during the recruitment process. If an employee had expressed interest in a particular business unit, the list included a partner from that area. The list might also include leaders or HR contacts from cities or regions where the new hire&#39;s close family members lived. If the employee needed to relocate to take care of a parent or other family member, that essential information had already been provided.</p><p> Individuals from underrepresented groups who received a contact list, an explanation of why they should make contact, and email reminders performed better in their jobs. There was an acceleration in their network spread, which was measured along their lifetime at the company. Even 72 months later, people who had received all three elements of the intervention were still expanding their network faster than those who had not received all three elements of the intervention. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p> A large company with many offices discovered that the onboarding process at its smaller workplaces seemed more effective. People felt more integrated, and their networks were established faster than in the large offices. In contrast, at the larger sites, new lateral hires were not mixing across generations and were not building their networks.</p><p> In response, the company applied a nudge that involved the cafeteria. Employees were assigned plate colors based on the number of years they had been at the company. New people were assigned a blue plate, employees who were six months into a role got a yellow plate, and other employees had green plates. Once a week, when people dined together, people with the same color plates could not sit together. Color mixing created interaction among employees who would otherwise be invisible to one another.</p><p> The strategy made onboarding easy because people were creating new networks. The intervention led to a 34% shift in the degree of directness characterizing an individual&#39;s connections within the network. It also produced an 18% increase in “betweenness centrality,” a metric quantifying an individual&#39;s role in passing information within the network.</p><p></p><p> Throughout my research, consulting, writing, and experimentation, 10 points along the career trajectory stand out as places where specific kinds of nudges and interventions can support the goal of building and sustaining a diverse workforce. In addition to attracting, recruiting, and onboarding candidates, diversity nudges can be applied to skill-building, avoiding office drudgery, flexibility and well-being, pay equality, origination and credit, feedback and promotion, and networking and sponsorship.</p><p> To benefit an organization and become part of a company&#39;s strategic advantage, women, people of color, and individuals from other underrepresented groups must be intentionally welcomed, integrated fully into the organization, and sustained. This process should be data-driven, harnessing the potential of big data and AI to achieve sustainable inclusion. They must be purposely supplied with the same or equalizing information, connections, skills, projects, and support that are provided to others within the organization. Inequalities must be recognized, and intervening actions must be devised to nudge these conditions in a manner that creates equality and inclusivity. The companies that win at diversity are the ones that design processes that are advantageous to and level the playing field for everyone.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/diversity-nudges/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Micro Utility With Gen AI: Shopify&#39;s Miqdad Jaffer</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/micro-utility-with-gen-ai-shopifys-miqdad-jaffer/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/micro-utility-with-gen-ai-shopifys-miqdad-jaffer/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 12:00:41 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. <p>Sam Ransbotham ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ransbotham">@ransbotham</a> ) is a professor in the information systems department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College, as well as guest editor for <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> &#39;s Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy Big Ideas initiative.

I&#39;m also the AI and business strategy guest editor at <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> .</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And I&#39;m Shervin Khodabandeh, senior partner with BCG and one of the leaders of our AI business. Together, <cite>MIT SMR</cite> and BCG have been researching and publishing on AI since 2017, interviewing hundreds of practitioners and surveying thousands of companies on what it takes to build and to deploy and scale AI capabilities and really transform the way organizations operate.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Hi, everyone. Today Shervin and I are pleased to be joined by Miqdad Jaffer, director of product at Shopify. Miqdad, thanks for taking the time to talk with us.让我们开始吧。</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Thanks for having me. I&#39;m happy to be here and excited to talk a little bit about AI.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Great. We all use Shopify, but we may not know it. Can you give us a brief overview of Shopify and tell us what a director of product actually does?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Sure. So Shopify is a platform for entrepreneurs to be able to set up their storefronts online. You may have seen Shopify whenever you&#39;re going to purchase an item from a retailer. You may have gone to the checkout and seen that purple Shop Pay button, and for many of us, that&#39;s probably where you&#39;ve been exposed to Shopify. It&#39;s a way for an entrepreneur to be able to set up their storefront on the internet and for … you as a buyer to be able to transact in the fastest, simplest way possible to be able to make sure that the item arrives at your door.</p><p> In other cases, you may have seen Shopify on a platform like Shop.ai, where you might have searched for a specific event that you&#39;re putting together, a specific product that you&#39;re looking for, and tried to filter it all down across the many merchants on Shopify.</p><p> A merchant would go into Shopify and log in. There is a product section on the left, as an example. They would go into the product section, they would click “Add a new product,” and then within “Add a new product,” there is space for a title, description, and some other fields.</p><p> In terms of my role, my responsibilities are, how do we think about AI and how can it fit into that realm of entrepreneurship, and what can we do to accelerate our merchants&#39; success and progress as they build up their storefronts, sell their products, and grow as entrepreneurs?</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So how does that involve artificial intelligence? I hear a lot of “e-commerce,” I hear a lot of “connecting,” but how does that involve artificial intelligence?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Yeah, it&#39;s a great question. I think that when people are looking to start as an entrepreneur, there&#39;s a lot to it, so there are considerations of “What&#39;s the right product? What&#39;s the right price? What&#39;s the right placement? What&#39;s the right promotion? How do I set up everything with my storefront? How do I maintain what &#39;good&#39; looks like as I grow and as I advance?” What we&#39;ve seen is that AI is an opportunity to make entrepreneurship accessible for everyone.</p><p> With every business unit, we wanted to utilize AI to create more efficiency, from managing administrative tasks to supporting business operations. Administrative tasks can be as simple as creating a new product description [or] figuring out what the right subject line for an email could be. And then, the business operation side of it could be just about everything from understanding the business, figuring out the analytics of it, what questions should I ask, what&#39;s the strategy that I should employ? And we view AI as a powerful assistant that can weave itself in and out of that process.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What you&#39;re saying is, Shopify is letting the entrepreneurs focus on the actual product and their brand and all of that kind of stuff but then have Shopify be a platform for how they take that to market, how they want their brand to appear, and a lot of the back-end operations. Obviously, AI could be quite prevalent across all of those. Was AI embedded from day one as it launched?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> We&#39;ve had AI in its most traditional sense embedded since early days. We did things along the lines of fraud detection, where a transaction comes in — and it&#39;s not as easy to tell whether this is fraudulent or nonfraudulent. We&#39;ve done basic classification models to be able to determine whether something <em>is</em> fraudulent and then provide a score back to the merchant in a reasonable fashion. That&#39;s been in there from the start.</p><p> Then generative AI comes along, and there are opportunities to be able to do a lot more, and what we&#39;ve seen is, we&#39;ve created a suite of products called Shopify Magic. And the idea behind this was, how do we embed this directly into the workflows that our merchants are having to go through, and how do we make that easier to start, run, and grow your business?</p><p> We did things like Autowrite, where we can create a description for a product, create a blog, create a new page, help with the subject line of an email, create the body of an email, and look at ways, on the customer service side, to be able to provide responses for a merchant as they interact with their customer. So those are some of the early stages, but we&#39;re trying to accelerate it even more these days.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> A lot of companies are thinking about generative AI, and it seems like you&#39;ve been <em>doing</em> it for quite some time. Can you comment a bit on when you started thinking about it, prepping for it, and, I would assume, to some extent, redirecting or upscaling or reskilling some of your technical folks to be able to actually take these things to market.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I&#39;ll give you a little bit of the genesis of how we kind of started with the first thing and accelerated it even more. We have some general themes that come up every year in terms of things that we should be looking at, and one of the ones that&#39;s usually pretty prevalent on there is [that] staying on the cutting edge of technology is critical. What we want to do is try to bring as much of the latest technology into the hands of our merchants so they have every advantage possible.</p><p> And we&#39;ve always tried to do things with AI, and one of the more recent ones, even before generative AI, was product classification — so the idea of being able to determine the category of a product using its text as well as its image to be able to figure out where this belongs. It helps in channels. It helps you basically market to a wider audience and get a reasonable taxonomy set.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> When ChatGPT came out, the question was, what can we do with this technology to put it in front of merchants? And this was one where we wanted to lean in for a couple reasons. One, it&#39;s important to get this in the hands of merchants as fast as possible, staying with the cutting edge of the technology side. And the other part of it was, we actually saw that there was utility for the first time, and that utility was important to get out there and to see whether our merchants would use it and what we could learn from it.</p><p> So we started with a simple path of “What&#39;s the thing that merchants are struggling with?” And we saw them struggling with product descriptions daily. There&#39;s billions of them across Shopify, and we saw that as a wide space to work in, and we had all of the conditions around what would make a good product description. And then we felt “OK, let&#39;s get this in and see how people use it and see whether this is something that&#39;s palatable.”</p><p> So we quickly spun up a team, and we relied upon a couple different principles. Shopify generally builds off of a set of principles and allows the team to go fast. Some of the principles we worked off of were, this has to be easy, this has to be integrated into their workflow, and the merchant needs to be able to have final say as to what goes out there to represent their business.</p><p> It&#39;s a simple start. We said, “OK, let&#39;s figure out what the rules of a good product description are.应该多长？ What&#39;s the tone it should be used in? What are the types of words that will be used, and what makes it really good?” We did the basic thing of prompting against that and then said, “OK, what additional context should the merchant provide, and what should we look for to be able to help them?”</p><p> And so we said, “OK, well, they can probably list out a couple keywords about their product, and that fits into the realm of knowledge <em>they</em> know about, and the rest of it should be us. Like, this should be as simple as like pressing a button. It should feel like magic.” So apropos to that, we named it Shopify Magic, and we wanted to stick with that. All a merchant has to do is they enter a couple keywords, they pick a tone of voice, and they press “Generate.”就是这样。那是第一个版本。 We tried to ship that real quick and see what would happen, and the feedback we got was, “This is amazing. Can you do this everywhere?”</p><p> So it&#39;s like, “OK, so there&#39;s, there&#39;s some positivity here. So, what can we do next?” And so we added a “special instructions” field, and initially in our trials, we were doing things like “Add a quote from a famous celebrity that would relate to my product,” just as, like, a meme for how to try it 。 And then we saw merchants using it in different ways.</p><p> We saw them using it for language, and this was an interesting one. We introduced the ability to support eight languages, and we saw people writing translations with it, and that was expected, but it was interesting to see. And I think one of the most interesting ones we saw was, there were merchants that didn&#39;t speak English and wanted to sell to an English audience and saw product descriptions as a way to bridge that gap — unexpected, but at the same time, it&#39;s one of those things where you put the product in the hands of the user and then the user decides what they&#39;re going to use it for. And it was remarkable to see that we opened up entrepreneurship for even a small window more of people than were there previously.</p><p> And that&#39;s what kind of got the ball rolling on the AI efforts. After that, it was every team wanted a piece, every team wanted to do something, and we accelerated it in every way we could. We&#39;ve tried to systematize things from a UX [user experience] perspective; whenever a merchant sees something, they know that this is what that&#39;s going to do. And we&#39;ve also tried to look into building Sidekick, which is a first-of-its-kind AI-enabled assistant, purpose-built for commerce. And so that&#39;s kind of been the journey that we&#39;ve gone into. We have dedicated teams that are working on specific features, and then we have the entire company that is looking at opportunities of where AI can accelerate commerce.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So when Shervin and I first heard about what you were doing, I think what kind of got us excited was how pervasive this is. The effect of something like Shopify integrating artificial intelligence into its tool is huge. And I think we were talking earlier, you had talked about introducing this product in February [2023]. This is very early on in the generative [AI] days.</p><p> A lot of people are investigating generative, but this was an exciting story where you&#39;re using these tools in production very quickly. I&#39;m sure that was a little bit painful — maybe you could speak a little bit about any of the pain or difficulty you had; maybe other people have learned from that, but also at how pervasive it is. Both of those are interesting ways that people can learn from what you&#39;ve done.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Yeah. Early days came with the challenges, but I think that that&#39;s kind of the fun of it. It was interesting because this was the latest technology. There was so much utility to it, and we just wanted to get that in the hands of our users. Along the way we had to figure out things like, how do you do evaluation? What is this prompting stuff? How do you systematize this and make this make sense? What&#39;s all this RAG stuff about — RAG being <em>retrieval augmented generation</em> ? How do I bring more data into this context of a prompt, and how do I make this make sense?</p><p> And the crazy part was, every week, a months&#39; or a years&#39; worth of other technology time passes, and all of a sudden there&#39;s a new thing to try and a new thing to explore, and we didn&#39;t want to miss that ， 任何一个。 Every time something new came out, we tried, we explored. And I think that the culture at Shopify is one of exploration and one of crafters and builders. And what we tried to do is put this in the hands of people that could build, and to try things. And we also did things internally to encourage the use of AI, and we built our own kind of internal ChatGPT instance equivalent. We have it for our internal wikis for search and discovery. And what we&#39;ve tried to do is just make this into the fabric of the company.这是正常的。这是预期的。 And then, all of the risks and challenges that come with it — hallucinatory included — are things that people are familiar with. And once we got them familiar with it, then we figured out ways to work around it and to embrace it in some cases, too.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I think that&#39;s a very important point you&#39;re making because as I reflect back on my own experience and BCG&#39;s experience in this field, we&#39;re working with many companies, and many of them have the same mindset and ambition as you&#39;ve described and are putting solutions in production and are embracing it. And then there are some that are, I would say, quite reserved about this. And some of that is based on, I would say, some unfounded fears.</p><p> I mean, the reality is this is new technology and it comes with a lot of risk, and maybe a little bit more risk than traditional AI because of how pervasive it can become. But I think the mentality of waiting for all of the risks to be figured out by other people then puts you at somewhat of a huge disadvantage, because the only way, as you describe — I mean, I love how you said it — the only way to actually get ahead of these things is to start experimenting with it and getting comfortable with it.</p><p> I&#39;m sure at the board level there were some risks and some concerns. Maybe just comment on what many people thought back then versus what the reality was and put it in perspective for some of our listeners so that they understand that these risks can be mitigated versus you just stay away forever.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Yeah. One of the first things I&#39;ll say is that I want to describe who an entrepreneur is, to even put this into context. Every entrepreneur I have ever come across has the highest risk tolerance of anyone I&#39;ve ever met. They are willing to drop everything in their life to start a business, and sometimes they don&#39;t know anything except that they want to start a business. And these people are inherently risk tolerant, so our user group is very different than others. And obviously, you&#39;re going to get a spectrum of tolerances across that user base, but by nature, this is a group that is willing to dive in, take risks, and try things. And then one of the things that we observed was that they were already using it. So we already had merchants that were using ChatGPT or whatever was out there, to be able to prompt it, figure out alternatives, and use it directly into their software.</p><p> We did a brief round of research where we asked a number of merchants: Is this something that you know about? How have you used it?你用它做什么？ And many of them were like, “Yeah. Well, I mean, I just ask it everything, and so I&#39;m just getting to figure it out.” And we already saw that happening. So for us it was, “All right. Well, we already have this risk-tolerant merchant base, and the biggest concerns that we have are typically on two vectors.”</p><p> Vector one is a fear of losing control. So asking questions along the lines of “What&#39;s it going to say? What do I do if it hallucinates? Is this going to be right for me? Is it going to speak to my buyer?” So all of those initial questions and that fear of losing control was easily mitigated. So we said, “OK. Well, here&#39;s a quick fear. How do we mitigate this fear?” And we mitigate a fear of losing control by putting the control back in the hands of the user.</p><p> So the carte blanche principle was “The AI will never write without user intervention,” and so the merchant will always be able to see what the message is that&#39;s going to go out there. So all of the hallucination risk, all of the “What&#39;s it going to do?” risk is gone because now it puts control right back in the hands of the user.</p><p> The second risk is around whether it&#39;s factually accurate or not, and that&#39;s typically one that a lot of people come across. The way that we&#39;ve tried to manage that is, the person that knows the most is the person selling the product. The thing that they know the most about is their product, and that&#39;s what they&#39;re trying to talk about, and they&#39;re trying to talk about <em>their</em> brand. And so that one didn&#39;t feel as risky for us either because it was going to be up to the merchant to decide how they were going to be represented in a factual way.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> You talk about this in such a matter-of-fact way, but when you think about the actual key word here, it&#39;s the <em>user</em> , which is actually, when you think about it, Sam, a lot of our work around human and AI versus just human alone or AI alone. Thanks for talking about that. That&#39;s very key.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> One of the things I really like, too, is you keep using the word <em>utility</em> . A lot of the examples that Shervin and I talk about, we&#39;ll ask people for an example, and they&#39;ll bring out some AI-heavy application that they&#39;ve implemented that crosses lots of parts of their organization and it&#39;s a big deal, and those are great. But the utility you&#39;re talking about seems like micro utility. And so, what I mean by that is that, as you mentioned, people may have already been going out to some large language model and generating some text and then pasting it into Shopify.</p><p> Your incremental utility here was saving them some back and forth between those two tools, but also then incrementally making it work better within your tools and within your context. And I think that&#39;s exciting, when you think about how all those tiny pieces multiply by the billions. And that&#39;s a different story than what Shervin and I see sometimes, which is, “We have a big system which has a big utility, and there may be not so many users of it.”</p><p> I want to come back to something that you mentioned earlier — and maybe I just picked up on your tone of it — but you were talking about fraud detection and these somewhat traditional uses of artificial intelligence. That feels like an oxymoron now, but you said, “Oh, yeah. We&#39;re using it for fraud. We&#39;re using it for back-end business optimization and these sorts of things.耶耶耶。 We do all that stuff, but here&#39;s the really cool stuff.” It seems really exciting that you&#39;re able to stay forward.下一步是什么？</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> It&#39;s a great question. I think the hope for us is that we want AI to lower the barrier of entry for entrepreneurship, period. And I think the idea for us is, let&#39;s look at everything that&#39;s on the space. So we did something relatively recently about image generation. And we saw this as “OK, well, we can lean in here, too. There&#39;s different modes of operating that we can play with.” So we release the Hugging Face pipeline, and the idea behind this was “Let&#39;s put this out into the market, let&#39;s see how people are going to use it, and let&#39;s do it in a way that&#39;s going to be innocuous.”</p><p> The idea behind it is you upload a product image, and then you pick what background needs to be switched out. And some of this, there&#39;s some fun stuff behind the scenes of uplift, upscaling the image, figuring out the right mask for it, making sure that the reflections and shadows are going to be good, and then generating all sorts of backgrounds that make sense in the vein of commerce. And what we see from this is the ability to explore in a different way. What we&#39;ve tried to do with AI, and to your point about the risk tolerance of our user base, it&#39;s not meant to be something that is just disruptive to their existing workflows. Many of them — especially established ones — have existing workflows where they do everything in their specific way, and that&#39;s what works for them.</p><p> All we&#39;re doing is, for anyone that needs that extra push or needs that extra piece, there&#39;s a button to click, a way to invoke this, and it is their choice to make on that. And, Shervin, I like some of the stuff that you were talking about in terms of putting the user in place, and our adage has always been that this is meant to be something that augments and isn&#39;t a replacement. So this is always going to be something that helps a user be the best version of themselves.</p><p> And with image generation, we see the opportunity for them to holistically change their storefront if they want to. If they have a Thanksgiving sale coming up and they want to be able to change all the backgrounds to be fall themed, it&#39;s a quick, easy move for them to do. Their product stays at the forefront, their branding stays at the forefront, but they can merchandise just for the specific event — if it&#39;s Thanksgiving, if it&#39;s Christmas, if it&#39;s New Year&#39;s, whatever it might be. Something that would require additional photo shoots might be a lot easier to achieve now than [it was] previously.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Exactly. Let&#39;s just remember how complex and unnecessarily process-oriented something like this would have been, you know, a few years back, where you have just agreeing on the background and the photoshoot and the look and feel and impact on brand and all of that, and now you&#39;re putting it all in the hands of the merchant.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> For us, it was really important that many people across Shopify were using this, asking the right questions, pushing the boundaries, and understanding some of the nomenclature around it. When I say “hallucination,” I can almost guarantee that 99% of Shopify knows what that means and how that happens and [how] that works. And that makes the conversation much different every time you go toward product development, because it&#39;s not bringing it up and relitigating it every single time. It&#39;s people trying a solution around the normal problems that come up with this technology.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> If I squint, I kind of see something developing over this market of artificial intelligence. You alluded to it with the ease of transfer learning. You&#39;re able to take these existing models and augment them slightly, and I see that as an improvement over the past decade from “Oh, yeah.当然。 You can download these tools and build them yourselves” to “Hey, no, you can take what we&#39;ve done and what we&#39;ve trained our GPUs and burned up our GPUs on and incrementally burn up a little GPU on your own but then move forward.” I think that&#39;s a dynamic that&#39;s happening in this market here.</p><p> But let me go darker here and talk about another dynamic. Is there, let&#39;s say, a race toward mediocrity? And I think that&#39;s a little charged way of saying it, but if all of your users in Shopify are using the same tools to generate the same sort of product descriptions, isn&#39;t that going to lead to a sort of vanilla feeling of all product descriptions? How do we push back and get beyond that? It&#39;s great that we get everybody to mediocre well; how do we get people distinctive? Where do we build off of that? How do we make that beyond mediocre?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Yeah. The problem you&#39;re talking about is a local maxima, effectively, right? So everyone moves toward this standard, simplistic, homogeneous, boring thing. And what we&#39;ve looked at is that all of the tools that we provide will get you started. The idea is not to be “This is the finish line.” The finish line is the merchant. The finish line is their product. The finish line is their brand and being able to represent accordingly. For many cases, this is about getting you something, which is better than nothing, and getting you started and thinking.</p><p> We had one merchant that really described it well for me. He wanted to set up an outlet store for some of the overstock inventory that they had, and they had 3,000 SKUs that they wanted to put together — 3,000 different products that they wanted to put on this initial outlet store. And what he said to me was, “Typically, what I would have done is I would have hired a team, we would have taken three months to get this thing spun up, and we would have tried to put it together.” And he said, “I spent the weekend by myself, and I just used your generation feature. It got me started. I made a couple changes. And in three days, I had an outlet store stood up and ready to go for all my products. And I made the changes necessary. I don&#39;t like the style that you had, so I gave it some specific instructions, and it got to what I wanted.”</p><p> And I think the idea is flexibility within the framework. So provide a framework, let them get started, but give them all the flexibility in the world to do what is appropriate for their business and for them to be able to differentiate to their audience. And I think the key is, every audience is different, and nobody understands that better than the merchant themselves. The idea is capability and augmentation, not replacement.你是对的； there could be a point of local maxima for people. But we want to leave every escape hatch possible so that they can get out of that.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> One thing I want to stick back to, and you&#39;d alluded to it, was the deterministic versus stochastic nature of this. That seems really difficult to work with [from] a production standpoint — that you&#39;re using tools that have stochastic outputs, but you&#39;d like to have a “defined, tested, refined” process. And those two things seem antithetical to me in many ways.你怎么处理那件事呢？</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Part of it is, there needs to be a risk tolerance built in. So there needs to be almost an expectation that the system will fail and that the user needs to have a way to be able to work through that failure. So product description is a great one. We actually see that it takes multiple generations before the user is happy with what they have in front of them. So with that in mind, you have to allow for that second, third, fourth, fifth generation to take place with no effort whatsoever.</p><p> And so that&#39;s an error case that we know is going to happen, so we plan for it. So there&#39;s this “Regenerate” button right there; it presents multiple options. In other cases, we will try to present as many options as we possibly can to make it easier. So subject lines: You get three options to choose from. You can change it.做任何你想做的事。 Then, the other part of this is that we understand that technology is going to change, and the way that people use it is going to change, and their expertise level is going to change.</p><p> So there are people that are going to try and break the system, and there are people that are going to try and work around the system. It&#39;s important that we plan for that scenario, too. So every risk and every failure case has to be considered upfront. And then you almost do it in a fun way, and the one that is typical is prompt hacking, where people are trying to figure out what the prompt was that was used for this. In most of those cases, you do the best you can, but you expect that the prompt will get out there. So you write the prompt in a way that, when it gets out there, it&#39;s like, “Hey, you found me.那太棒了！ You want to apply for a job or something?” There are lots of different ways to like think about this.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Your human in the loop solves a lot of this too.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Correct.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Your whole design philosophy, it really addresses, I think, a lot of the backstops, a lot of the stochastic nature too. Can you give us a bit of your background? How did you get to your role?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I started out as an engineer. I think since I was, like, 12 years old I was programming and trying to figure out how to make the computer do what I wanted it to do. And I took an initial role as an engineer and was introduced to product management in what was then meter data management. So it was like big data for utilities had just come out. I got to work in that space, and then I moved into document classification, then ad tech, and then retail data platform management.</p><p> I&#39;ve always been adjacent to data, and at Shopify, my journey had been [to] build our infrastructure and data platforms, work on our machine learning platforms, and figure out what needs to be built there. And I always had one toe in the machine learning/AI pool at all times. Then I had teams that were focused on the analytics side of it and what merchants were going to experience and how they were going to understand their business. And the mandate was always like “How do I optimize my business with data?” And we looked at opportunities with ML, we looked at opportunities with AI. And then, when generative AI came out, it was just the next step along the way.</p><p> So it&#39;s by luck, by accident, by design — who knows? But I&#39;ve always been in data for the last 15, 20 years, and this was the next step.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> OK. Time for five questions. Miqdad, do you know what that is?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I do not.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> OK.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I mean, I know what five questions are, but …</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Good! So we&#39;re going to ask you five questions rapid-fire style. Just tell us the first thing that comes to your mind.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Sure.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What do you see as the biggest opportunity for AI right now?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I think the biggest opportunity is solving cold start for many people. What I mean when I say “cold start” is looking at a blank screen and not knowing what to do, whether it&#39;s how to navigate a system, write a thing, or whatever it might be — just that unknown moment. I think that&#39;s where AI steps in and does the biggest [benefit].</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I love that. What is the biggest misconception about AI?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> That it will take over. I think that there&#39;s a long way to go. It&#39;s an augmentation, not a replacement, and I think it&#39;s the same as when Photoshop came out. Designers got much better and much more creative, and I think this will raise the bar for everyone in terms of what they can do.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Is there such a thing as too much AI? When is there too much?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I think it&#39;s too much when the user is out of the loop. I think the user needs to have a stronghold in how they use AI and how they interact with it. I think this is not about replacing, and I think this is a matter of augmenting and helping the user be better.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What was the first career you wanted?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I wanted to be a doctor, but I faint at the sight of blood, so that didn&#39;t work out so well.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What is the one thing you wish AI could do that it cannot do right now?</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> I wish we could incorporate all of the modes of a user wanting to interact, whether it be a combination of voice, facial expressions — just to be able to get that semantic meaning behind the scenes that words can&#39;t do by themselves 。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Wonderful.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> We really appreciate the idea that what you&#39;re doing is using generative AI right now, just barely after it got started. I think a lot of people are wringing their hands and wondering how to use these technologies, and what you&#39;ve shown is a great example of how people can get real utility from this tool right now. Thanks for taking the time to join us today.</p><p> <strong>Miqdad Jaffer:</strong> Thank you so much for having me, both.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Thanks for listening.
