<a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p></p><p>在拥有世界四分之一人口的南亚，种姓偏见可能会给个人和组织带来灾难性的后果。例如，2023 年 6 月，印度时尚零售商 Lifestyle International 的员工 Vivek Raj 在录制一份指控<a href="https://www.thequint.com/south-india/vivek-raj-dalit-bengaluru-employee-lifestyle-dies-caste-discrimination">工作场所种姓歧视</a>的声明后自杀身亡。在另一个案例中，印度食品配送公司 Zomato 因<a href="https://www.thequint.com/opinion/zomato-ad-kachra-lagaan-caste-marketing-teaching-moment">2023 年的一则广告</a>强化了贬义的种姓刻板印象而遭到公众强烈反对。</p><p> Alphabet、亚马逊、苹果、戴尔和 X（前身为 Twitter）等跨国公司已经认识到这一问题的重要性，并在其公司政策中解决了基于种姓的歧视问题。超过 20 所美国大学也将种姓与种族、性别、宗教等一起纳入其政策中的受保护类别。</p><p> 2023 年 2 月，西雅图市通过了一项法律，禁止种姓歧视。加利福尼亚州立法机构通过了一项类似的法案，但于 2023 年 10 月被州长否决，州长表示该州现行法律已禁止基于种姓的歧视。这些立法工作符合印度等种姓制度国家的法律，印度宪法禁止种姓歧视，并保证在公共教育、就业和政治职位上对低种姓个人采取平权行动。</p><p>世界各地的管理者都需要了解这些问题，以帮助保护南亚裔员工免受基于种姓的歧视、欺凌、不文明和骚扰，并避免工作场所此类行为可能导致的法律风险。管理者还可以通过解决种姓对招聘、企业社会责任、信息共享和网络等活动的影响来改善个人及其组织的福祉和绩效。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a></p><h3>什么是种姓，为什么它相关？</h3><p>种姓制度的基本假设是人类生来就是不平等的群体。这种不平等的表现是，在人为定义的等级制度中任意地为不同群体分配不同程度的纯洁性和价值，赋予其中一些人社会强制的权利和特权，包括从事某些职业的权利。</p><p></p><p>种姓是一个复杂的系统，由跨宗教的数千个群体和亚群体组成。一般来说，在信奉印度教的人中，婆罗门处于等级制度的顶端。他们的职业传统上包括宗教职责和知识职业，如记录保存、科学和教育。等级制度中的下一个是刹帝利（Kshatriyas）（传统上担任军事角色），其次是维西亚（Vysyas）（商人和贸易商）和首陀罗（Shudras）（工人和劳工）。在信奉其他宗教的人中也存在类似的群体和亚群体。例如，<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4357934">在南亚穆斯林中</a>，有高种姓（阿什拉夫，由赛阿德人、谢赫人、帕坦人和莫卧儿人组成）和低种姓（阿吉拉夫，由工匠和其他工人组成）。在信奉锡克教的人中，有贾特人和卡特里人等高种姓群体。同样， <a href="https://scroll.in/article/876000/is-the-caste-system-deep-rooted-among-christians-in-india-a-kerala-bishop-stirs-up-a-hornets-nest">南亚基督教会也</a>围绕不同的种姓身份形成。</p><p>达利特人不属于上述群体，而且远低于上述群体。他们被那些遵循种姓制度规范的人认为是低等和不纯洁的，甚至达到了非人类的程度，并被降级到涉及清理粪便和处理死者等活动的职业。跨宗教的达利特人被污蔑为“<a href="https://baws.in/books/baws/EN/Volume_05/pdf/14">贱民</a>”，因为其他种姓历史上仍然普遍存在避免与他们进行身体接触和空间接近的做法。</p><p>阿迪瓦西斯（原住民，意为第一批居民，或更一般地说，原住民）是种姓制度之外的另一个群体，他们历史上居住在远离城市的森林或山区，经常被<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02757206.2023.2204866">污蔑为亡命之徒</a>。</p><p>尽管今天每个群体的个人从事的职业与种姓分配给他们的职业不同，但个人的种姓仍然是他们可获得的社会和职业机会的重要决定因素。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><h3>种姓如何塑造组织</h3><p>种姓可以通过几种不同的方式塑造组织的内部环境。公司聘用的人才库可能不具有种姓多样性，部分原因是几代人以来获得教育和其他资源的机会存在差异。种姓决定了获得资本和有价值的商业关系的机会。研究表明，家族企业依靠基于种姓的网络来共享知识和资源，并对市场和行业施加控制。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a>穿过南亚的价值链复制了种姓等级制度，高种姓个人控制着价值链中的重要活动（例如设计、研究和营销），而低种姓个人则被降级到价值较低的活动（例如产品组装和销售）。制造业）。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a>高种姓个人对教育、监管、立法和行业机构等机构的过度控制也塑造了组织运作的环境。</p><p>种姓也会影响组织的运作。招聘人员和经理可能会在招聘和晋升决策中引入偏见，甚至在最高管理层层面也是如此。这种偏见可能是显而易见的，例如对某些种姓背景的个人进行刻板印象；或隐含的，在诸如用熟悉的口音说英语或遵守某些社交礼仪等标记上的权重，即使它们与工作无关。种姓刻板印象也会影响工作分配，例如当高种姓个人晋升为管理职位时，而低种姓个人则被降级到低端工作，例如<a href="https://scholarcommons.scu.edu/soc/67/">IT 部门的</a>数据输入和编码或跨部门的清洁工作。</p><p>种姓也往往会影响工作场所的互动。例如，低种姓个人可能会因谩骂或排斥等行为而遭受骚扰、欺凌和不文明行为，或者面临不安全或有辱人格的工作条件。在一项关于美国种姓歧视的研究中，25% 的达利特受访者表示曾遭受过身体或言语攻击； 67% 的人表示他们在工作中受到不公平对待，60% 的人表示经历过基于种姓的贬义言论和笑话。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><h3>为什么种姓会带来独特的挑战</h3><p>种姓主要以<em>身份</em>、<em>资源</em>、<em>网络</em>和<em>文化</em>的形式间接运作。一个人的种姓并不从其生理特征中明显看出，但可以根据这四个维度来推断并塑造他们的感知优点。这种对优点的看法，而不是他们的种姓，可以被视为影响他们的决策和行动的基础。 （参见“种姓的间接标记”。）以下是种姓在每个维度中的体现方式。</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>种姓的间接标记</h4><p class="caption">种姓通常不是直接明显的，但可以根据个人的身份、资源、网络和文化来确定。这些维度共同塑造了对个人优点的看法。因此，工作场所的种姓歧视并不总是显而易见的，而是可能表现为难以识别和解决的偏见、成见和排他性做法。 </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAG_Bapuji_RF_Winter_2024_Figure-1.png" alt="种姓的间接标记" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p></p><p><strong>身份。</strong>对于许多来自南亚的人来说，种姓是一个人身份不可分割的一部分。种姓是与生俱来的，被视为一个人祖先的象征。种姓身份通过诸如种姓内婚（种姓内的婚姻）等做法得到进一步强化，其目的是保持种姓的纯洁性。印度人（包括美国的印度裔人）中近 95% 的婚姻发生在同一种姓内。 <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a>甚至一家美国公司开发的<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-02-11/caste-system-of-india-and-south-asia-in-australia-dalit-rights/13135622">南亚约会应用程序</a>也允许用户过滤高种姓群体以寻找匹配对象。其他一些婚介服务提供商也为种姓内的婚姻提供便利。</p><p>一个人的种姓身份通常反映在他们的名字中。许多南亚姓氏（例如 Bhatia、Kamble、Khan、Sharma 和 Yadav）都可以作为种姓的标志。没有能显示种姓的名字的南亚人可能会面临探究性问题和排斥，因为种姓身份决定着资源的可用性、网络和文化亲和力。</p><p><strong>资源。</strong>有形资源，如现金、资产和投资，按照种姓分布是不平等的。由于种姓之间拥有和积累资产的权利和机会的历史差异，这种不平等随着几代人的发展而加剧。研究发现，在印度，高种姓个人在前 50% 富裕人群中的比例过高，占总财富的 90%，而低种姓个人在印度最底层 50% 个人中的比例要高得多。财富方面。 <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a></p><p>高种姓社区的成员往往有更多的机会获得经济资本以及随之而来的优势，例如能够进入精英私立学校，这使他们有更多机会进入知识职业。例如， <a href="https://theprint.in/india/education/diversity-deficit-in-iims-iits-just-23-sts-and-157-scs-in-9640-faculty-posts/191246/">印度管理学院（印度政府建立的顶级商学院）中只有 6% 的教员</a>来自占印度人口<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/decoded/2021/06/29/measuring-caste-in-india/">绝大多数</a>（据一项估计为 69%）的低种姓。其他高等教育机构也存在类似情况。</p><p>这些资源差异也影响了谁可以从南亚移民，高种姓的人发现更容易移民到东道国并在东道国定居。例如，近90%的印度裔美国居民来自高种姓。 <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p><strong>网络。</strong>种姓构成了促进经济交易的正式和非正式社会网络的基础。某一种姓的成员更有可能雇用具有相似种姓背景的人、与之开展业务并向其提供财务和非财务支持。种姓内通婚的长期做法是形成这些网络的一种方式。</p><p>种姓还通过其他形式的空间和社会隔离来塑造网络。研究表明，印度许多城市都存在基于种姓的隔离，部分原因是历史因素使每个种姓居住在城市或城镇的特定部分，部分原因是个人更喜欢与自己的种姓人相邻居住。自己的种姓。 <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a>社会隔离的发生是由于种姓规范如何塑造种姓之间的互动而产生的。例如，遵守此类规范的高种姓个人可能会避免与达利特人共享空间或用餐。</p><p>南亚和全球范围内都存在正式和非正式的基于种姓的协会。此类协会可以明确基于种姓，例如北美婆罗门协会（Brahman Samaj of North America）向所有婆罗门开放，而 Pravara Vedika 仅向某些婆罗门亚群体开放。一些协会将自己描述为更广泛的“社区”或语言/文化组织，但由某些高种姓主导。例如，北美泰卢固语协会由积极支持其种姓亲属的高种姓团体 Kamma 主导；北美泰卢​​固语协会以雷迪高种姓群体为主； NRI Vasavi 协会主要由 Vysya 社区成员组成。 <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a></p><p><strong>文化。</strong>特定南亚宗教或地区的主导文化和规范通常是根据高种姓文化来定义的，即使这种文化只有少数人口信奉。这些最常反映在人们的宗教和文化习俗、饮食和口语中，这些习俗因种姓而异。例如，高种姓群体在某些形式的“古典”音乐和舞蹈方面拥有霸权，因为低种姓群体被排除在实践之外。这些艺术被认为优于低种姓个人所练习的民间音乐和舞蹈。由于高种姓个体移居国外的速度高于低种姓个体，因此这些文物通常被视为南亚文化的典型代表。</p><p>高收入国家普遍存在一种误解，认为<a href="https://www.livemint.com/Politics/dWUqT4epdPTHNAYuKYVThK/No-vegetarianism-is-not-growing-in-India.html">大多数印度人都是素食主义者，</a>这是高种姓文化定义国外规范的另一个例子。印度的一些组织和<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662520903690">高等教育机构</a>坚持素食菜单，或者为素食者提供单独的厨房和用餐空间，导致低种姓个人受到隔离、污名化和排斥。高种姓文化在电影、电视和音乐等流行媒体中的广泛表现强化了人们对南亚文化的看法。由于低种姓个人并不总是符合这些特征，非南亚管理者可能会在不知不觉中以不同的方式对待低种姓个人。</p><h3>管理者可以对种姓歧视做些什么</h3><p>种姓可以从身份、资源、网络和文化的表现中推断出来。对于南亚裔管理者来说，许多信号是可见的（例如姓氏或饮食），或者可以通过社交互动（例如居住地点或祖先职业）了解并用于组织决策。例如，研究表明，当提交两名具有相同特征的候选人的简历时，仅根据与姓氏相关的地位来选择高种姓个人而不是低种姓个人。 <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a></p><p>然而，非南亚管理者可能难以辨别种姓身份的文化线索，并且由于这是一个敏感话题，因此询问一个人的种姓是不合适的。低种姓的人可能会选择隐藏自己的种姓以融入社会并避免被排斥。那么，管理者可以做些什么来在组织中创造一个包容种姓的环境呢？</p><p>为了成功应对种姓的挑战，管理者需要采取整体方法，包括使种姓成为组织多样性、公平和包容性 (DEI) 政策和实践的一部分，通过培训提高认识，以及解决所在社会的种姓不平等问题系统性的。 （参见“组织如何解决种姓问题”。）管理者还应该在这些努力开始时采取措施，先发制人地制止阻力。</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>组织如何解决种姓问题</h4><p

class="no-desktop" /></p></article></aside></div><p><strong>明确将种姓确定为受保护类别。</strong> DEI 政策旨在促进​​各种身份的人的包容，第一步是明确将种姓确定为受保护类别。这种认可应涵盖所有相关的公司政策，包括与员工和供应商行为、公司沟通和员工招聘相关的政策。公司可以在员工行为政策中明确声明不会容忍种姓歧视，就像<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/caste-california-tech-giants-confront-ancient-indian-hierarchy-2022-08-15/">苹果</a>和<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/cobc/2021/fy22-code-of-business-conduct-english.pdf">思科</a>所做的那样，并实施协议来全面解决工作场所种姓歧视的报告。公司还可以将种姓纳入其供应商行为准则（正如加拿大零售商<a href="https://www.loblaw.ca/en/supplier-code-of-conduct/">Loblaw</a>所做的那样），以确保种姓在其整个价值链中是受保护的类别，并且供应商不会疏远或歧视低种姓个人。</p><p></p><p>有关公司沟通和社交媒体消息传递的政策还应包括有关种姓包容性语言的指导。例如，<a href="https://www.dell.com/en-in/dt/policies/social-media-policy.htm">戴尔技术公司的</a>全球社交媒体政策指出，不能容忍基于种姓的仇恨言论。托管用户生成内容的公司应扩大其服务条款，以禁止与种姓相关的歧视性语言和诽谤，就像<a href="https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards/hate-speech/">Meta</a> 、X 和<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801939?hl=en-GB#:~:text=We%20remove%20content%20promoting%20violence,Disability">YouTube</a>所做的那样，并监管间接宣传种姓的内容。为了制定此类政策，各组织可以与国际达利特团结网络等倡导团体合作，该网络发布了有关基于种姓的仇恨言论的<a href="https://idsn.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Caste-hate-speech-report-IDSN-2021.pdf">研究报告</a>。</p><p>现有的包容性招聘做法可以相对容易地适应种姓。对申请人的简历进行匿名化可以消除招聘过程中的一些种姓信号。雇主可以指示招聘经理忽略对工作不重要的候选人特征，例如口音、礼仪、就读的教育机构的状况和家庭背景。公司，尤其是在南亚设有子公司的公司，必须通过有针对性的推荐或针对低种姓候选人的招聘活动，主动使其申请人库多样化。这些人占人口的绝大多数，接触不到他们就意味着忽视了庞大的人才库。结构化和标准化的面试可以根据工作相关技能更准确地评估候选人，可以最大限度地减少面试阶段的偏见，并消除招聘中的种姓偏见。</p><p><strong>提高认识和培训。</strong>鉴于种姓是一种无形的不平等，提高人们对其的认识是解决种姓歧视最重要的方面之一。这种培训的目的应是防止种姓歧视，创造一个包容种姓的环境，并了解种姓特权和压迫的影响。</p><p></p><p>种姓培训需要解决低种姓个体普遍遭受的歧视形式，包括对他们及其领导人的<a href="https://youtu.be/wJwkIxOpqZA?si=N67lxr5AWEEF2wRQ">诽谤</a>、笑话和<a href="https://dalitdiscrimination.tumblr.com/">贬损评论</a>。例如，印度的低种姓个人经常受到基于种姓的平权行动政策的影响，例如“配额候选人”或“保留人”，这些言论贬低了这些政策的使用。培训还应扩展到支持面临此类歧视的员工。</p><aside class="callout-info"><h4>其他资源</h4><ul><li>BR

This reflects what is politically most feasible; it is hard to offer incentives at the EU level without favoring national target industries and getting into divisive politics. But regulation is unifying and has been the core of the EU&#39;s supranational toolkit. It uses the EU&#39;s market power, a market too big for global players to miss out on. The problem: It might impose unquantified and hidden costs on industry without first gaining political acceptance of that outcome. That is the background to Germany&#39;s recent wobble about protecting its internal-combustion-based car industry from the forced move to electric vehicles.</p><p></p><h3> The Power of an Industrial Strategy</h3><p> America and Europe have hugely different approaches to climate action that reflect their respective self-image and values. Where politics allow, a more balanced mix of sticks and carrots can provide the most effective incentives for companies to progress along their transition pathway. Building up the initiatives in an advertised sequence can provide strong incentives for early action, if companies are confident of the policy environment to come and motivated to position themselves for it.</p><p> Such an industrial strategy is not about picking winners and losers but about recognizing and accepting the idea of winners and losers and playing to win — or to not lose. The incentives work by creating risk that companies are motivated to avoid. The financial case for Volkswagen&#39;s early investment in the electric vehicle market sprang in part from the opportunity to win share from its biggest rival, Toyota. The financial case for Toyota&#39;s recent investment in electric vehicles is partly based on defending its market share. Both companies are strongly incentivized by the threat from emerging electric car makers in China. Similarly, carbon capture and storage is expensive and still speculative, but the financial case to industrialize it could be strong for a fossil fuel company concerned about future prohibitions against extracting and selling its mineral assets.</p><p> This insight aligns well with the way political power sits largely at the national level (or regional level, in the case of the EU). Governments can stimulate climate action in ways that favor their companies and their economies. The incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act are attracting corporate investment, skilled jobs, and technology innovation to the US Japan&#39;s steelmakers are looking to lead the world in new technology solutions for high-end steel, using hydrogen rather than carbon to reduce iron ore to iron. This battle for competitiveness at both the national and company levels is how we can drive climate action at scale in the short time we have to make an impact.</p><h3> Creating and Destroying</h3><p> The transition we are describing is the creative destruction and value migration that have always fueled innovation and investment in a capitalist economy. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> In this important sense, climate change is not a collective-action problem: For systemwide transformations in which nobody loses, the transition will be practically unaffordable. We need winners and losers — or at least the real prospect of winners and losers — to provide the competitive pressure and financial incentive for companies to act.</p><p> The practical task for policy makers is not just to correct for the externalized costs of pollution but to facilitate the dynamic transition to this new state. As researchers have recently asserted, policy makers need to “simultaneously and successfully navigate two distinct but interrelated dynamics: the creation and mass commodification of new green energy technologies on the one hand, and the destruction of powerful, fossil fuel incumbencies on the other.” <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a></p><p> The American and European approaches do not provide this navigation. The carrots of America&#39;s Inflation Reduction Act help to create the new without constraining the old. The sticks of EU&#39;s regulations constrain the old without solving the technological or economic challenge of substituting with the new.</p><p> What would a more balanced and dynamic, sequenced approach look like?</p><h3> Paths to Green Transformation</h3><p> Japan&#39;s approach to green transformation, or GX, involves a mix of carrots and sticks to drive both parts of the creative destruction required, sequenced over time. The <a href="https://www.meti.go.jp/english/press/2023/pdf/0210_003b.pdf">explicit goal</a> is to deliver “both emissions reduction and economic growth,” without sacrificing either. At the highest level, Japanese corporate and government interests are aligned: “The success or failure of GX initiatives is directly linked to the competitiveness of companies and nations.”</p><p> The immediate carrot is the commitment of 20 trillion yen ($140 billion) of government support for upfront investment over the next 10 years and an envisaged 150 trillion yen of public and private investment. The principal stick is an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/carbon/japans-carbon-pricing-scheme-being-launched-april-2023-03-30/">industrial pricing mechanism</a> for carbon that is in trials now and expected to be phased in starting in 2026. The plan includes both a European-style emissions-trading scheme for high-emissions industries and a surcharge on the supply of fossil fuels.</p><p> Announcing the stick now but phasing it in later in the decade creates the immediate incentive for companies to make the technology investments in their transitions, without penalizing them financially before they have had the opportunity to adapt.</p><p> Japanese companies are partners in this effort as well as counterparties. The intent is not just to reduce Japan&#39;s own emissions, which account for 3% of the world&#39;s total, but to position Japanese companies as service providers helping to reduce other countries&#39; emissions too, through the green technology solutions they will offer.</p><p> Companies worked with METI — or with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, in the case of maritime transport and aviation — to develop technology road maps for 10 sectors that collectively cover 80% of Japan&#39;s carbon emissions. In the technology road map for iron and steel, for example, the specialist committee advising METI included representation from the Japan Iron and Steel Federation, credit analysts, and the Development Bank of Japan, as well as professors in engineering and technology. The METI road map illustrates its general framework with a specific example, JFE Steel; JFE Steel in turn presents its corporate road map as an application of the METI framework. This collaboration helps companies commit to ambitious transition plans, with the confidence that the government is doing its part in creating the conditions that will make them viable in terms of R&amp;D, energy infrastructure, finance, carbon pricing, and more. The GX plan is as much about enabling these road maps as it is about mandating them.</p><p></p><p> The plans are not rigid. In the future, different technologies might win out than what today&#39;s plans project. Both government and industry know the technology assumptions that the plans are based on and thus are able to adapt as needed and aren&#39;t locked in. Pluralism is celebrated: The cover image of METI&#39;s strategy document shows multiple paths up a mountain to the 2050 carbon-neutral summit.</p><p> Creating the conditions for corporate investments in this way is the role for governments&#39; industrial strategy, in partnership with sustainable finance. Without such coordinated industrial policies, merely strengthening disclosure requirements on climate-related data and information might increase regulatory burdens unproductively. Government efforts to step up sustainability-related reporting frameworks need to be matched by government actions on the industrial strategy front.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/economic-incentives-are-key-to-driving-sustainability-at-scale/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> R&amp;D Leaders Must Play a Key Role in the Journey to Net Zero</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/rd-leaders-must-step-up-in-the-journey-to-net-zero/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/rd-leaders-must-step-up-in-the-journey-to-net-zero/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 30 Oct 2023 11:00:07 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Dan Edwards and Michael Zeitlyn. <p>Dan Edwards is group managing director and CEO at Science Group, a science, engineering, and technology consultancy.

Momentum can, of course, be difficult to sustain. Carbon reduction may be imperative for the good of the planet, but it requires businesses to think and operate in new ways, to collaborate with more outside entities, to trust data-gathering processes that are new and developing — and to put R&amp;D and innovation leaders at the center of the process.</p><p> Science Group convened a forum of R&amp;D leaders and CTOs — including executives from Amcor, Bayer, Mars, PepsiCo, Procter &amp; Gamble, Solvay, and Stepan — to identify ways in which companies can translate net-zero ambitions into material progress. In particular, we wanted to help define the pivotal role that innovation teams can play in the journey. Here, we highlight insights that emerged from this forum about practices that help build a <a href="https://sustainability.sciencegroup.com/net-zero-playbook/ ">pathway</a> for both industry and the planet to thrive.</p><p></p><h3> A Mandate for Action</h3><p> If companies want their net-zero pledges to be more than well-intended aspirations, they have to make carbon reduction a core business value: Management must lose sleep over it, the way they have historically lost sleep over safety, quality, and profits. Acting on net zero is a cross-functional initiative, and the division of labor can be murky. Marketing, distribution, and other business functions will contribute to the company&#39;s greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction target on their own timelines. Procurement, for instance, might be able to reduce emissions in short order, whereas R&amp;D — which is, by definition, forward-looking — might be working three, five, or even 10 years out. The key, of course, is that all functions are working in concert toward clearly stated goals. R&amp;D should swiftly and explicitly map out how its own role vis-à-vis carbon reduction differs from that of colleagues in other parts of the business. R&amp;D leaders&#39; capacity to present scientific arguments to other executives can be a valuable assist to colleagues who must shape a similar plan.</p><p> Mapping out a companywide collaboration can be a process of self-discovery — one that reveals interdependencies and potential alliances. As R&amp;D digs into its targets, its leaders should also consider how entities outside their own company — suppliers, customers, regulators, nonprofit advisers, and even competitors — can be recruited for what is, after all, as universal a mission as they&#39;re likely to encounter in their lifetimes. Companies may well have other worthy sustainability initiatives in the works, and leaders must be conversant with all of them and understand the interplay between them.</p><p> But it&#39;s also critical that companies give their R&amp;D leaders and CTOs a clear mandate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Once they have it, they will be well placed to instigate changes to ensure that future products and services have lower associated GHG emissions. The R&amp;D and innovation teams will be on the front lines, reducing GHGs by using alternative raw materials, reimagined product designs, and more climate-friendly technologies. To succeed, net zero must be embedded into each project from its earliest days so that a product&#39;s likely GHG footprint is evaluated early and often. Every R&amp;D conversation should now take GHG into account. And lest anyone think this is a half-hearted exercise in virtue signaling, the team should be judged on how well it executes.</p><p></p><h3> Manage the R&amp;D Portfolio to Deliver Net Zero</h3><p> R&amp;D leaders should now evaluate the “carbon health” of their existing project portfolio to see how well it aligns with their targets. Reaching the goal means knowing exactly where and by when the reductions will happen, and not trusting it to luck or to future technologies that are only barely visible on the horizon.</p><p> To date, sustainability has often been the focus of special projects. Such an approach might help secure investment, demonstrate ambition, create momentum, and burnish a company&#39;s image — and those are undeniably heady inducements. Still, we would argue that integrating carbon reduction into the day-to-day fabric of R&amp;D is more vital. Net-zero success depends on the performance of the portfolio as a whole, not the rise or fall of individual projects. There&#39;s nothing wrong with a few big, speculative longer-term opportunities, but placing smart bets across the entire R&amp;D portfolio is a savvier strategy. Not every project is likely to advance the cause of net zero. And, frankly, R&amp;D can let a particular project underperform in terms of reducing GHG emissions — if commercial needs are simply too urgent, for instance, or if another department can offset the deficit by some other means — as long as the wider portfolio stays on track.</p><p></p><p> Choosing which initiatives to prioritize means identifying the most promising battlegrounds. There will be wins that R&amp;D can instigate and move forward. A product might be a prime candidate for R&amp;D to focus on immediately because rethinking its design or manufacture even minimally could have a significant impact on emissions, or because those changes could be made in the R&amp;D kitchen without creating a ripple effect along the whole supply chain. But many of the big wins will require R&amp;D to work with other partners inside and outside the organization, and although they may be harder and take longer to achieve, the outcome may merit the commitment and investment.</p><p> R&amp;D leaders should expect to provide forecasts of their portfolio&#39;s impact on GHG emissions. Measuring the net contribution (even using a simplistic order-of-magnitude estimate of future impact) will allow the company to balance commercial needs and climate-change intent. Environmental, social, and governance reporting will become more prevalent over time as customers and stakeholders insist on knowing which companies have robust sustainability strategies, and the companies themselves realize that those strategies can reduce costs, spur growth, and minimize issues with regulators. Data on GHG emissions is not yet as accurate as the moment demands, but it will inevitably improve. In the meantime, R&amp;D teams will need to get comfortable with using the available data and accepting approximations.</p><h3> The Commercial Reality</h3><p> It&#39;s often said that corporations have a choice: They can get “green” or they can make money. No one is pretending that there&#39;s no truth in this. But as consumers change, the regulatory environment evolves, stories about reputational damage proliferate, and considerations of carbon impacts become more ubiquitous, a different set of commercial realities will prevail. For now, R&amp;D can build momentum by identifying the customers, products, and brands with a preexisting affinity for net-zero messaging. This is low-hanging fruit. It&#39;s here that carbon-friendly products can command a “green premium” or provide a competitive advantage. In arenas where regulation or standards favor — or even require — carbon-reduced products, the marketplace will likely accept a performance compromise or accept a price premium. Wherever the door is already open, innovators can capitalize on the market value of a climate-friendly product. Elsewhere, they will need to get creative and continually hunt for synergies and flywheels, where innovating for net zero brings other advantages.</p><p> Ideally, innovating to serve the needs of the market — that is, delivering on conventional value parameters — will create collateral opportunities to reduce carbon outputs. No one&#39;s going to object to lowering emissions if it seems to be a happy coincidence. There are manufacturing processes, that, in reducing carbon emissions, may also reduce either upfront capital costs or ongoing energy costs. Projects that can make use of them should be prioritized, and R&amp;D leaders should articulate the benefits of carbon reduction, even if the top priority is cutting expenses.</p><p></p><p></p><p> This next proposal may seem counterintuitive in the extreme, but R&amp;D leaders should also consider trading off on price and/or performance if a reduced-carbon product would enable a different kind of win. The words “new” and “improved” have been fused together in the advertising lexicon for more than a century, so companies won&#39;t be thrilled to announce that they&#39;ve made a less-effective product because they wanted to cut GHG emissions at the plant. But regulation, as well as customer and stakeholder intent, have begun to will it.</p><p> “Accomplishing net-zero goals takes courage,” said Robert Reiter, head of R&amp;D in the Crop Science division of Bayer. “There are going to be tensions, and at some point there will need to be trade-offs when the low-hanging-fruit opportunities are gone. I guess one can wait for regulation to level the competitive playing field, but sometimes a company just needs to lead the way.”</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/rd-leaders-must-step-up-in-the-journey-to-net-zero/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Why Text-to-Image AI Requires a New Branding Mindset</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/why-text-to-image-ai-requires-a-new-branding-mindset/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/why-text-to-image-ai-requires-a-new-branding-mindset/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 11:00:21 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrés Gvirtz and Oguz A.

One doesn&#39;t need to look any further than T-Mobile&#39;s signature magenta hue (226 red, 0 green, 116 blue) to realize how fiercely this castle is protected. Use a similar shade, and you might find a cease-and-desist letter in your mailbox. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p> But what if the very ramparts that have protected brands could hinder their future in the age of generative AI?</p><p> In one notable advertising campaign, Heinz turned to OpenAI&#39;s DALL-E generator to create ketchup-inspired images. The images weren&#39;t perfect in terms of the dimensions or colors, but they were undeniably Heinz. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> This shows that even AI models recognize that the Heinz brand has top-of-mind awareness. An old-school brand purist might have raised an eyebrow at the way the brand was represented, but the campaign <a href=" https://www.oneclub.org/awards/theoneshow/-award/49451/ketchup-ai">created undeniable buzz</a> , with 850 million earned impressions around the world.</p><p></p><p> We&#39;ve experienced the transformative potential of generative AI on branding in our own classrooms. Generative AI breathed life into King&#39;s College London&#39;s mascot, a fiery-red <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/ioppn-welcomes-new-students-and-kings-mascot-reggie-the-lion">lion named Reggie</a> , as part of the school&#39;s centennial celebration. Thanks to AI tools, the mascot became more than just a static brand symbol: In classroom sessions, Reggie became animated and “alive,” leading some discussions and even sorting through clothes and adjusting prices as we discussed merchandise management. The result: Bland stock images gave way to a beloved mascot that resonated with our students and elicited overwhelmingly positive reactions. But this is just the beginning of these tools&#39; potential for brands.</p><h3> Creativity Versus Control: Choose Wisely</h3><p> Brands ready to shake off the old, protective mindset will find that generative AI opens new doors to cocreation. Text-to-image AI models, such as OpenAI&#39;s DALL-E, eliminate the barriers for everyday consumers to generate visual designs, allowing unprecedented levels of personal connection and customization.</p><p> In Coca-Cola&#39;s groundbreaking initiative “Create Real Magic,” consumers were invited to unleash their creativity by designing advertisements using ChatGPT and DALL-E. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> The winning entries won&#39;t merely be lauded; they will soon light up the billboards of some of the world&#39;s most iconic advertising stages, including New York&#39;s Times Square and London&#39;s Piccadilly Circus.</p><p> Our research, as well as that of others, shows that these enriched connections don&#39;t just affect the people directly involved; they ripple outward, strengthening relationships and enhancing purchase intentions across the broader market. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p></p><p> Despite these exciting prospects, many brands are reluctant to leave the sidelines, likely held back by fears of losing control. The age-old approach of strictly safeguarding brand identity and symbols could make them lagging adopters of text-to-image models.</p><p> Today&#39;s reality is that absolute control over AI technology remains a pipe dream. While generative AI will get better at rendering consistent styles, it is unable to adhere to the rigid guidelines demanded by many brands today. As seen in Heinz&#39;s campaign, while the technology replicated the familiar bottle shape and color, it fell short of reproducing the exact logo or brand name. Brands banking on a “ready” version of this technology might be in for a long wait. Perhaps more importantly, a myopic focus on control could prevent brands from fully unlocking the doors to consumer engagement that generative AI offers.</p><p></p><h3> Brand Managers Need to Be Enablers</h3><p> The path forward requires a mindset shift: Brand managers must evolve from enforcers and guardians to enablers. It is about focusing on broader innovation and connection opportunities instead of obsessing over minutiae like exact color values.</p><p> <a href="https://www.akqa.com/work/gofundme/help-changes-everything/">GoFundMe&#39;s “Help Changes Everything” campaign</a> made new consumer connections by using text-to-image models to engage with donors in the most personalized way possible. Rather than producing typical year-end content, GoFundMe used tools like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion to produce a series of AI-generated street mural-style images showcasing all of the fundraising campaigns and donors of the past year. These individual pieces were then compiled into a captivating video that resonated strongly with audiences and received widespread acclaim. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a></p><p> Brand managers who are open to such opportunities can leverage text-to-image models to transcend traditional communication boundaries and achieve previously unattainable levels of personalization and authenticity.</p><p> Of course, risk appetites differ. What works for a daring brand like Monster Energy might not for a conservative institution. But even in highly regulated and conservative settings, it is possible to experiment in a way that constrains risks and costs. The risks and potential negative consequences of one-off campaigns or small-scale projects are limited and thus are ideal opportunities for brand exploration. Our endeavor to animate our university&#39;s mascot serves as a case in point.</p><h3> Experiment Safely: Lessons From Coca-Cola</h3><p> This isn&#39;t a call for anarchy. Brands can explore the possibilities of generative AI while keeping within their comfort zones and established boundaries. Coca-Cola&#39;s protective measures include using its own platform, maintaining oversight over <a href="https://www.createrealmagic.com/">content displayed on its site</a> , and providing participants with Coca-Cola-themed templates, all to retain a degree of control over brand portrayal.</p><p> Coca-Cola&#39;s initiative was done in partnership with a text-to-image service alliance of Bain and OpenAI, which helped it switch from a reactive stance to a proactive one. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a> Providers that offer brands such as Coca-Cola security and safeguards will likely emerge as preferred partners.</p><p></p><p> Of course, brand managers must guard against potential misuses and walk a tightrope between creative freedom and control. But let&#39;s not forget: Brand perceptions have always been coauthored with consumers and have depended on an intricate two-way relationship between brands&#39; actions and consumers&#39; reactions. Indeed, consumers have long been instrumental in molding brand perceptions, whether it&#39;s through word-of-mouth endorsements or scathing reviews. Generative AI only intensifies this dynamic, empowering the consumer to wear various hats: They can play the role of designer, cinematographer, or even software developer. In the age of generative AI, active listening, consistent monitoring of consumer sentiments, and an agile approach to recalibrate strategies based on real-time feedback and emerging trends become even more important.</p><p> While brands cannot control every narrative twist, they can guide the dialogue more proactively. One effective approach is to cultivate environments where consumers can connect with one another and the brand and contribute to the brand story within a framework of transparent rules, incentives, and recognition. Coca-Cola&#39;s generative AI campaign, for example, clearly communicates the value it places on consumer input — by rewarding top contributions with highly visible advertising placements, as well as a chance to be selected for a trip to the Coca-Cola headquarters to participate in a content-creation workshop. The brand has invested in a specialized digital platform tailored to promote innovation and deepen consumer relationships while at the same time mitigating risks and maintaining alignment with its core values and identity.</p><h3> Addressing Ethical and Legal Concerns</h3><p> Brand managers also need to be vigilant about ethical and legal issues surrounding text-to-image models. As lawsuits entangle key AI tool companies, staying abreast of these developments around ownership and intellectual property (IP) rights becomes essential. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> Brands are legitimately concerned about legal implications, but where challenges arise, innovation follows.</p><p> Adobe offers one innovative example of how to ease customer concerns regarding IP issues. For its Firefly generative AI tool, which lets people create or enhance images using simple prompts, Adobe trained the AI models on stock images, openly licensed content, and public-domain materials free from copyright constraints. That&#39;s a forward-thinking approach aimed at addressing customers&#39; concerns.</p><p></p><p> Another promising approach is collaborative IP creation agreements that focus on mutually beneficial relationships between AI developers, creators, and brands. A case in point is Shutterstock&#39;s Contributor Fund, which compensates creators when their images are employed in training generative AI models. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a></p><p> Brand managers should opt for partnerships with platforms that have effectively mitigated IP risks. Brand managers could also consider adding specific protections in their contracts, where the platforms confirm that they have properly licensed training data and provide guarantees for any potential IP infringement cases against the brand. For generative AI developers, this serves as a compelling incentive to develop models that respect the copyrights of creators and positions them as desirable collaborators for brands.</p><p> All in all, text-to-image generative AI models are tearing down the walls of the traditional branding castle, creating a new reality ripe with opportunities, risks, and challenges. As we navigate this transformation, every brand manager must confront a vital question: Will your brand be a builder of bridges or barricades in this new era?</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/why-text-to-image-ai-requires-a-new-branding-mindset/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> There Actually Is an &#39;I&#39; in Team</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/there-actually-is-an-i-in-team/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/there-actually-is-an-i-in-team/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 11:00:43 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Elad N.

Your operators work in highly interdependent teams on the assembly lines, and they&#39;re dealing with a fundamental technological change that you recently implemented. Robotic arms and automated machines were put in place to streamline the assembly process, replacing several tasks previously performed by hand.</p><p> Now, the robotic arms handle repetitive and precision movements, such as screwing components together and applying adhesives. This change relieves your operators of mundane work and lets them focus on more complex aspects of the assembly process, such as quality control, troubleshooting, and process optimization. However, they must adjust to the new work environment: They need to individually learn how to operate and maintain the automated systems while also learning how to coordinate differently as a group.</p><p></p><p> This kind of fundamental change to how members of a team relate to their individual roles and to one another plays out in all kinds of workplaces. Whether it&#39;s triggered by organizational decisions to adopt new technology, new regulations, or structural transformations, it requires adaptation on both an individual and team level.</p><p> Members of an accounting team grappling with changes in disclosure laws, for example, may need to individually master new reporting rules as well as rethink collaboration within the team to establish new internal control systems. Employees of an organization transitioning from a functional structure to a divisional structure may need to individually acquire knowledge about the products and services offered by each division in addition to learning how to effectively coordinate with colleagues in the new cross-functional environment.</p><p> Overcoming these dual learning and adaptation challenges is key to successful change management, but as we note in <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2022.1621">our recent paper in <cite>Organization Science</cite></a> , leaders often don&#39;t pay adequate attention to whether, when, or how individuals on their team reskill — and when they do, their focus is often on the team as a whole. Our research shows that there may be benefits to making individual reskilling a priority. Our study of how teams and individuals adapted to change in a manufacturing company revealed that when individual learning happens first, teams adapt more easily to fundamental change.</p><p></p><h3> Reskill the Individual Before the Team</h3><p> Successful teaming requires skills at two different levels: Team members need to become proficient in their own tasks, and they need to work well together. Until team members master their individual skills, we argue, it is difficult for a team to master and maximize collective coordination. This is because collective mastery can often be built only on individual skills. To best deal with fundamental change, individual skill development should occur first.</p><p> These ideas are supported by our study of fundamental change as it unfolded in a division of a large electronics manufacturing company in eastern China that employs more than 10,000 workers. We followed 116 production teams over several months. These teams had just begun adapting to a series of radical technological advances that required the use of novel tools and production processes. To gauge team performance before and after the change, we used the company&#39;s own metric, yield, which is the percentage of products that are manufactured correctly to technical specifications.</p><p></p><p> As we expected, the need to adjust to the change did negatively affect yield. About two weeks before the change, the average yield was 99.15%; about four weeks after the change, the average yield had dropped to 93.82%. But the drop was not distributed equally across all teams. We attributed some differences among teams to variations in the intensity of the change the team faced: Some teams had much more to relearn at both the individual and collective levels.</p><p> However, after accounting for the intensity of the change, we found that the teams that had initially focused on individual reskilling performed 12% better than the teams that, right off the bat, had focused on improving collective coordination. Reward systems played a critical role: Team members who were given more individual-focused rewards (compared with team-focused rewards) at this initial phase excelled early on in recovering from the change.</p><p> When we explored yield again two months later, in a later phase of the change, the average yield across all teams had climbed back to 96.95%. Yet, there was a high variance in team performance compared with pre-change team performance.</p><p> At this point, teams that had built on individual reskilling and were now focused on collective coordination were performing 11% better than teams that had not made that switch. That change in focus was enabled by a more collectively oriented reward system. Teams that emphasized team rewards at this later phase of change more easily shifted their focus from individual reskilling to collective coordination.</p><h3> Manage Change in Two Phases</h3><p> Our research demonstrates how managing fundamental organizational changes requires a two-phased, sequential response.</p><p> In the early periods following a fundamental change, leaders should encourage individual task reskilling. Such reskilling means not only providing relevant training but also giving members time to experiment and master their tasks alone, before making any attempts to improve the team as a whole. In the context of our study, teams that succeeded early on gave members more time to experiment with new ways to complete their own tasks and adapt the standardized equipment to their own needs.</p><p> The reward system should support such individual reskilling in this phase. When rewards reflect individual contributions, team members focus on improving individual skills. Such rewards promote self-focus and the pursuit of personal goals.</p><p></p><p> In the later periods following a fundamental change, once team members have mastered their individual tasks, they can begin experimenting with coordination and task flow and identifying redundancies in their collective processes. For our study, once members had mastered their new tasks individually, it became clear that some of them could complete their tasks faster than before. This outcome implied that the teams had to change how tasks were assigned to maximize workflow efficiency. This is the phase in which a greater emphasis should be placed on team rewards. When rewards are team-focused and the pay differences between members are minimized, team members focus on learning collective skills. These rewards promote a focus on others, collaboration, and the pursuit of team goals.</p><p> The sequencing of rewards is critical to ensuring that team members focus on the right priority in the right order, by moving from an initial focus on individual reskilling to only later practicing collective coordination. Providing only team-oriented rewards right from the beginning fails to incentivize the individual reskilling that forms the basis of team action.</p><h3> Timing Matters</h3><p> While our research provides some empirical evidence to support the idea of building individual skills before team skills to improve adaptation to change in a business environment, we can observe how this principle applies equally in other domains.</p><p> In the early 1990s, a new rule was introduced in soccer that disallowed goalkeepers from using their hands to pick up balls that the defenders had kicked back to them. This represented <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/unsure-footing/">a fundamental change</a> in the way the sport was played, because it required new skills and new types of coordination.</p><p> At first, teams struggled to perform under the new rule. Defenders, by habit, would kick the ball back to the goalkeeper. Because the goalkeepers could not touch the ball with their hands and were less skilled at footwork, teams made mistakes.</p><p> Many soccer coaches initially focused on the handoffs between the goalkeepers and defenders, to improve how this set of players coordinated with each other. Such approaches were not very successful. They put the horse before the cart by asking players to focus on collaboration before both goalkeepers and defenders had developed their new individual skills.</p><p></p><p> In contrast, other coaches focused on helping the goalkeepers and defenders first become proficient on their own dribbling and passing skills without making them work with each other. Only later, once the players had individually acquired those skills, did these teams get them together to coordinate their defense and offense in new and creative ways. This strategy was much more successful and led to a reimagining of how the game as a whole was played.</p><p></p><p> Collective capabilities can grow only on a foundation of strong individual skills. Leaders often forget that and, in times of change, try to rally the team to work better together before members have mastered their individual tasks. Leaders managing change should remember to provide enough space and incentives for individuals to experiment and learn new technologies and knowledge on their own before coming to the team to chart out how best to collectively collaborate.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/there-actually-is-an-i-in-team/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Entrepreneurial AI in the Enterprise: LG Nova&#39;s Shilpa Prasad</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/entrepreneurial-ai-in-the-enterprise-lg-novas-shilpa-prasad/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/entrepreneurial-ai-in-the-enterprise-lg-novas-shilpa-prasad/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 11:00:22 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. <p>Sam Ransbotham ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ransbotham">@ransbotham</a> ) is a professor in the information systems department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College, as well as guest editor for <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> &#39;s Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy Big Ideas initiative.

Each episode, we introduce you to someone innovating with AI. I&#39;m Sam Ransbotham, professor of analytics at Boston College. I&#39;m also the AI and business strategy guest editor at <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> .</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And I&#39;m Shervin Khodabandeh, senior partner with BCG and one of the leaders of our AI business. Together, <cite>MIT SMR</cite> and BCG have been researching and publishing on AI since 2017, interviewing hundreds of practitioners and surveying thousands of companies on what it takes to build and to deploy and scale AI capabilities and really transform the way organizations operate.</p><p> Hello everyone. Today Sam and I are excited to be joined by Shilpa Prasad, entrepreneur in residence at LG Nova. Hi, Shilpa. Welcome to the show.</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Thank you, Shervin. Excited to be here.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Tell us about LG Nova and your role there.</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> I get asked this a lot. LG Nova is the innovation center of LG Electronics, based here in Silicon Valley. Our mandate is very simple: We&#39;re tasked with finding new business opportunities for LG Electronics that are not core to their bread-and-butter business. LG Electronics is a consumer electronics manufacturer traditionally, looking to make forays into solution-driven businesses. And so [it&#39;s] constantly identifying new technologies and areas that can be interesting for them to build upon and hopefully launch billion-dollar businesses out of it.</p><p> That&#39;s what LG Nova is. My role at LG Nova is entrepreneur in residence, and what that entails is I have many different hats that I wear, one of them being a plain consultant for the corporation. And by consultant, I don&#39;t mean traditional consulting but more in the context of, what are some of the trends to look out for, what new technology areas could be interesting, [and] how can we combine a multitude of technologies, maybe, for a business opportunity? That&#39;s one part of it.</p><p> The second part of it is very much focused on outside-in innovation. Our roots are set on the fact that we don&#39;t want to do what somebody else has already done, and startups are a great example of how quickly they innovate. And we want to bring that innovation into the enterprise that we are and leverage some of that capability to chart out a path together.</p><p> So collaboration with startups is key, and that&#39;s where the entrepreneur side of me kicks in — where you&#39;ve got to be able to understand the mindset of the entrepreneur, the speed at which they function, what drives them, what makes them do the stuff that they do — and convey that to the corporation in an effective way. And then, of course, there&#39;s the reverse role, where the entrepreneurs don&#39;t necessarily — outside of the corporation — understand the workings of the big corporation, and how you bridge that gap, I think, is very crucial to the role. It sounds very simple, but there are a lot of balls in the air in that sense, and you&#39;ve got to be able to juggle all of that at the same time while keeping your eyes on the goal of building new business.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> You&#39;re talking about a large, global, multibillion-dollar company that&#39;s operating at a given speed, and you also want this group to operate at a much faster, I would assume, entrepreneurial speed. So I could imagine why it&#39;s juggling a lot of balls.</p><p> I wanted to ask you, is it identification of these technologies or innovation opportunities/disruptors, or is it an addition — incubation and building — of these as well?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Yeah. So there is the ideation piece, but there is also the venture-building piece, and part of venture-building is incubation. So you have maybe six months to identify an opportunity, build toward something, and then demonstrate that capability both on the product side [and] on the business side to senior stakeholders and investors wherever necessary, and then drive that to new business. So that definitely is a big part of what I do there.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Maybe it&#39;s just what Shervin and I hear a lot of, but there&#39;s a lot of artificial intelligence with startups, and you haven&#39;t mentioned artificial intelligence yet. So how does artificial intelligence intersect with your role?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> AI is not intersecting. It&#39;s at the forefront of what I&#39;m doing. If you remember like a year, year-and-a-half ago, Sam, there was a big hype around the metaverse, and technologies come and go. My focus is to identify real-world problems that can be solved using and leveraging some of these technologies. So AI is definitely at the forefront. There&#39;s a lot of AI-related work that goes on inside of the enterprise which focuses on servicing the existing business units, and that&#39;s not what I&#39;m put in place to do. My role is to look at AI as a technology and identify areas that could be interesting to solve as a problem in this ginormous world and build a business around it.</p><p> I can&#39;t speak too much of exactly what I&#39;m building, but I can talk to the fact that there is an intersection of augmented reality and artificial intelligence that I personally am charting internally here, which will possibly change the way skilled-training transference, upskilling, reskilling, and content around that is going to play out.</p><p> I&#39;m sure you already know this — that with AI in the mix now, so much of this can be so intuitive, with a feedback loop that can be generated for both the trainee and the reviewer and essentially allow workforce development or skill training in particular to move forward at a much faster pace.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> It seems like AI is going to be more of a key ingredient of the mix, not just an additive, and so keeping humans in the mix is going to be even more key. I hear thematically in what you&#39;re talking about a focus on that. So tell us a bit about AI that&#39;s happening. You said you can&#39;t speak much, but I still want to tease some information out of you. So talk about AI that&#39;s happening within this innovation center, or contrast it with AI that&#39;s happening at the enterprise.</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> I&#39;m sure both of you are very familiar with a large enterprise and the channels one has to navigate in order to get anything to market. And what I mean by “get anything to market,” it&#39;s also about releasing something which impacts a lot more inside the enterprise, right? So when you look at the traditional sort of research that happens around AI within the enterprise, and particularly LG Electronics, my understanding thus far has been that the appetite for risk-taking is limited because it disrupts a lot of their existing work, [whereas] something like this that I&#39;m charting out is leveraging some existing technologies that are out there, and when we launch something like this into the market, none of the existing pieces are impacted — in fact, they&#39;re benefited.</p><p> So LG, for example, has 85,000-plus workers across the globe working in factory environments. Everybody understands today that there is a gap in the labor that&#39;s available in the factories from a front-line worker perspective. There are productivity-related asks constantly within the enterprise to make sure that the entire … capacity is being met. These are all real problems that the AI research within the enterprise is not addressing.</p><p> You asked about the time to market. My mandate is six months to figure out whether a business can go to market or not. I think on the enterprise side, it&#39;s a few years, if not more, right? Anywhere between two to five years.</p><p> It has always been a topic of conversation, saying, “Corporate is slow; the startup is fast.” So I&#39;m essentially building a startup inside corporate.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> So, what I&#39;m hearing is sort of unshackled from a lot of the sort of legacy scale — with which comes inertia — and much faster sort of as new ventures that are going out. And, of course, some of that innovation then helps some of the existing enterprise AI that&#39;s going on, right?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Yeah.绝对地。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Wonderful. You talked about upskilling, reskilling, and possibly reimagining the role of humans in this whole mix with AI — in the mix you talked about. Tell us about generative AI and where you see that play out in this.</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> I think the possibilities are humongous, just like with any other opportunity in AI. One of the aspects of, for example, intersecting augmented reality technology with AI means that we&#39;re not only focusing on voice and text with respect to AI but also computer vision-related data streams that are being captured and processed in order for skill transference to happen as effectively as possible.</p><p> So think about a nurse training environment. We&#39;re not practicing on real patients but on the dummy. If you have to teach trainee nurses how to position the patient on the bed in order to do a specific procedure, then there is a multitude of value in capturing the data stream from the head trainer nurse in order to see how to do that and, when you&#39;re actually practicing it, to get real-time feedback, right?</p><p> So we&#39;re looking at multiple data streams here. So not just NLP [natural language processing], but we would be looking at computer vision-based technologies and bringing in AI to almost superpower that process and that trainee and training experience on both sides, right? So that&#39;s an example of how we&#39;re doing it differently.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Normally, I&#39;m pretty excited about the applications of artificial intelligence we talk about, but I get a little threatened here [for] a second. I mean I&#39;m an educator here, and I hear you talking about all sorts of different ways of reskilling and retraining. Where do I go? You mentioned a model before with nurses, where the experienced nurse would teach the less-experienced nurse. Maybe a lot of that gets replaced. What&#39;s the role for that experienced nurse now in this new model?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Yeah. Well, actually, Sam, I think your fear is maybe misplaced here, and let me explain this. We&#39;re not trying to replace the trainer. What we&#39;re doing is actually empowering the trainer with more opportunity to do the stuff that they should be doing. So in the training-of-the-nurses example, a head nurse has to actually physically stand next to the trainee nurses, possibly multiple times during the day, and teach them how they&#39;re doing their specific tasks. Now imagine a scenario where we&#39;ve eliminated at least two levels of feedback, review, and assessment before the head trainer can actually come into the mix and take a look at what&#39;s going on.</p><p> So the certification, I think, is still very, very important, right? Whether it be manufacturing, whether it be health care — the two examples that we&#39;re talking about — the certification is still important, and that certification comes from the trainer, who is the expert. So we&#39;re not removing the expert. It&#39;s actually empowering the expert to also be able to train effectively and not have to monitor 100 screens of trainee nurses that are doing their job. So you see the difference, hopefully.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah. Sam&#39;s a tenured professor, so I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going anywhere. But, Sam, it&#39;s a little bit like the full professor, ie, yourself, sort of not being bogged down with the things that a graduate student can take care of, and you only do the tough ones and the ones that really tease your brain.</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Yeah.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That sounds glorious to me.</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> I think it&#39;s an assistant, right? You&#39;d have an AI assistant that could actually do a lot of the grunt work that otherwise you have to sit and do. So I think there is value in it. At least we&#39;re seeing some inferences of value that we&#39;re able to generate in the very early conversations we&#39;re having.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Wonderful. Shilpa, tell us a little bit about your background, how you ended up in this role.</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> My career is a zigzag line, Shervin; it&#39;s not a straight line to what I&#39;m doing today. Over the years, I think there&#39;s always been a lot of value and joy that I have found in creating something [from the] ground up. The energy, the momentum, and the rigor it requires to scoop something up from nothing and create something out of it has been at the core of everything I&#39;ve done.</p><p> So very early on in my career, I had the opportunity to partner with someone to start [up] a graphic design studio. And there, I learned the mechanics of what it takes to actually create a business. It taught me a lot of the pieces that went into it.</p><p> From there, I&#39;ve always landed myself in roles that were actually entrepreneurial in nature or servicing the entrepreneurial ecosystem. I&#39;d like to mention a company called YouNoodle Inc. that I worked with here when I first came to Silicon Valley. There, I learned the power of selecting the right startups or innovations to work with in order to move innovation forward, whether in the context of corporations, governments, universities even, and large-scale accelerator programs.</p><p> That led me to my own entrepreneurial journey again, during COVID. It was really difficult. I launched a startup called LongPlay and built a team of about 10 people. It was focused around changing the way corporate innovation happens. And one of the things I think there is, when you&#39;re outside of the corporate, there is just no way to understand all of the different moving parts that go on. So we couldn&#39;t prove product-market fit there, which is where Nova came into the mix. I got the opportunity again to try to do a product-market fit in an industry and an environment that was a little different from what I was used to, but I think the nuts and bolts are the same. So that&#39;s just a quick background on me.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> It&#39;s super exciting — very multidisciplinary. And it brings me to my next question: There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to AI, and it&#39;s of course a full ecosystem of engineers and software engineers and prompt engineers and AI engineers and data scientists, etc. But I&#39;ve been noticing a gradual evolution of the skills over the past, I would say, 10, 12, 15 years or so, from hard-core technical-only to also more multidisciplinary, and that “multidisciplinary” could be in a variety of areas. It could be in social sciences or it could be in human-AI interaction, or it could be in philosophy or whatever. But are you seeing the same thing, and what is your perspective on talent of the future in this space of AI?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> It&#39;s an interesting question. I have to say I&#39;m not seeing the same thing.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> OK.</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> I&#39;m not seeing the width as much as I&#39;m seeing the depth. There is still, I think, a tremendous gap in the workforce with respect to being able to be multidisciplinary. There&#39;s a lot of, to your point, deep tech work that happens, especially around AI.</p><p> I think that&#39;s [something that] over the next few years, a lot of the folks like myself that are responsible for how this technology unfolds are going to have to carry with them.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That comes to measurement too. I mean — Shervin, I know that&#39;s a <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/big-ideas/artificial-intelligence-business-strategy/">hot topic for you right now</a> — but when you&#39;re talking about impact, you&#39;ve got to figure out how to measure it. There&#39;s going to have to be some measure of “Is this working? Is this not working?” And these seem like some difficult problems, particularly with the newness of the technology, the freshness of the timelines that you&#39;re talking about. It seems very difficult to figure out if this is working or not working in your role.</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I can give it a little bit of a personal take. My style of building projects has always alluded to testing it as much as possible with the customer who has the problem.</p><p> And that&#39;s where the product focus sort of is very front and center for me, and that&#39;s why venture-building is exciting. When we talk about measurement, there are definitely different ways in which the impact of what we&#39;re creating or what we&#39;re trying to create can be measured. There is a market validation aspect here, right? There is definitely an investor validation aspect, meaning our investors ... It&#39;s not just about my project, right? It&#39;s not just about the project that I&#39;m creating or building. It&#39;s actually more about where the money is going. And, of course, a little bit of it is hype, but a little bit of it is also taking the chance on the next thing that is likely to change the way AI is going to be used in day-to-day environments or contexts.</p><p> I think the third part here is also just about empowering the users, ultimately, of whatever solution we&#39;re creating and whatever we are building, in order for the business opportunity … Ultimately [it] has to add value to the humans — that is, you and I, who are actually going to use that technology to make our lives better. Today, we&#39;re doing the work in the exact same way that we are taught or we&#39;re used to or we have learned how to, and we&#39;re going to have to change that or adapt that and pivot to a new way of doing things.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And is AI enabling you to have better data and information on that? Is AI enabling you to know something that maybe 20 years ago would&#39;ve taken you a lot longer to know?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Absolutely, but I think “Is AI enabling me? Only <em>it</em> will do that,” I think, is perhaps a lot of weight on AI and less relevant to what has been done in the past 10, 15 years in a specific industry. I think AI also has a flip side to it, which is, sometimes it&#39;s putting too much in front of you, where then you have to actually go through the top layers to really figure out where this data can be used and how this data can be applied. So there&#39;s the pro and the con of AI as well.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> You mentioned cons. What kinds of cons are you seeing from these startups you&#39;re working with? What are people struggling with here?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> I think the startups, in particular, are still looking for ways in which whatever they have developed can be applied. The application of AI in effective ways is still to be determined. And so startups are creating all these LLMs [large language models] that can be relevant to the project, but they don&#39;t know <em>how</em> it&#39;s going to actually translate.</p><p> So I&#39;d say there&#39;s still a little bit of a journey there for the startup to be able to understand it. And in the context of the role that I have today, for example, I&#39;m also enabling the startup to understand how they can use the technology that they&#39;ve created and translate it over to a meaningful problem, but … that&#39;s why I said consulting before. It&#39;s consulting for the startup as well: to give them some real-[world] scenarios where you can apply something that we&#39;ve built together and then see how it translates into value. So I think the startups are still learning for sure, Sam.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So those things actually tie back to maybe some of Shervin&#39;s comments about breadth and breadth of knowledge and multidisciplinary, because you didn&#39;t specifically mention that they&#39;re struggling with technology. I heard lots of things there that were not particularly technology-oriented.</p><p> Let&#39;s transition here. One of the things that we do at the end of the episode is we ask you five questions. We&#39;re going to ask them fast. We just want your first reaction from them. What do you see as the biggest opportunity for AI right now?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Health care.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> OK. What&#39;s the biggest misconception that people have about artificial intelligence?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> That it&#39;s going to replace them. That it&#39;s going to replace us as humans. That&#39;s not going to happen, I think. We&#39;re a ways away from that.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Ways away. Good. What&#39;s the first career that you wanted?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> To be an entrepreneur. I think it was always in my DNA.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Good. Did you have a lemonade stand when you were growing up?</p><p> When is there too much artificial intelligence? Where are we trying to make a square peg fit in a round hole?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> I don&#39;t think I have a concrete answer for you, Sam, there. So if you&#39;re going to switch the question out …</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Ask it this way: Can it be too much?</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Can you put too much artificial intelligence into a product?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. I think an area that comes to mind is cobots — collaborative robots. It could work, it may not work, and then it&#39;s very heavily AI-driven. So automation is key there, but how much of that could be relevant, I think, is questionable for me personally.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> If you were fantasizing, what&#39;s one thing you wish artificial intelligence could do right now that it can&#39;t currently do?</p><p> <strong>Shilpa Prasad:</strong> Make me sound as good as I possibly can.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Shilpa, thank you so much. This has been illuminating and wonderful.

This is thought to be particularly true when serving online shoppers, who are known to be less patient and have shorter attention spans; after all, competitor websites are but a few clicks away.</p><p> Most business leaders we know prioritize eliminating friction at the “moment of truth,” when displaying prices and taking payment, because beyond wanting to make life easier for eager customers, they fear giving customers reason to pause and reconsider their decisions. But as we will demonstrate, it is precisely in giving customers time to consider their purchase decisions when money is on the line that longer-term benefits and cost savings can accrue to the firm.</p><p></p><h3> Friction and the Fickle Online Shopper</h3><p> It&#39;s easy to see why making shopping as seamless as possible is so urgent for e-commerce companies, when the average global cart abandonment rate for the last 12 months stood at a staggering 71.7% overall — 60.7% among people using desktop or laptop computers, 65.1% among those using tablets, and 77.4% for those using mobile phones. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> This last figure is perhaps the most troubling, given that mobile shopping in the US grew by more than $200 billion in three years to reach $431 billion in 2022. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> According to the Baymard Institute, the average large e-commerce site could increase conversion by 35% by streamlining and simplifying the checkout process. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p> Not surprisingly, e-commerce titans such as Amazon and Alibaba are investing heavily in quickly ushering consumers through their moments of truth by making prices and payments nearly invisible. Amazon pioneered one-click shopping back in 1999. Today, the attention is on its Just Walk Out technology, which blends computer vision, weight sensors, and deep learning to bring some of the ease of online shopping to physical stores: Patrons tap a credit card when entering a retail location to open a virtual cart, select items from the shelves, and leave without stopping at the cashier. At Alibaba, digital payments and self-service checkout stations are the norm across its 300 Freshippo supermarkets. People can even leverage its Alipay affiliate&#39;s facial recognition technology to “pay by face.”</p><p> Companies with fewer resources are making changes to their purchase processes that are more incremental but no less significant. Consider, for example, the recent popularity of “buy now, pay later” installment financing or of automatic-renewal clauses for subscription-based services, which allow companies to avoid the annual reckoning of customers reconsidering whether they still want the service. Online businesses have embraced these and other opportunities to make spending money less painful simply by allowing customers not to think about it.</p><p> However, it is simplistic to think of friction as having strictly negative effects, such as annoying customers or depressing sales. While it is true that too much resistance in the purchase journey can easily crowd out the desire to buy, too little resistance dumbs down decision-making and leads to missed opportunities to better connect with customers. The question we suggest that business leaders ask themselves, then, is whether they really want their customers to purchase on autopilot.</p><p> In this article, we explain how a little friction in the buying process can help companies engage customers and offer guidance on how to leverage these effects to build stronger customer relationships.</p><h3> No Pain, No Gain</h3><p> Some friction in the purchase journey can protect consumers from fraud, privacy violations, or their own unintended actions. For example, requiring two-step verification and asking the customer to confirm that they want to complete the purchase are two commonsense inconveniences that ultimately ensure that customers are safeguarded from threats and mistakes.</p><p> But either too much or too little friction around a purchase decision can have negative effects. Having too many steps in the purchase journey can distract shoppers, leaving them without the cognitive bandwidth to carefully consider their decisions. This fuels cart abandonment rates and removes opportunities to engage customers with the company through reviews, referrals, recommendations, or other interactions. Too little friction, and people don&#39;t think enough about their decisions, giving in to the human inclination to economize on mental effort. This absence of friction is numbing, and the less connected shoppers are with a purchase, the more ambivalent they become. That lack of commitment can in turn prompt product returns, weaken brands, and reduce satisfaction in the long run.</p><p> A purchase journey that is sufficiently challenging, however, is engaging. Because the transaction is neither stressful nor straightforward, people have an incentive to invest mental effort in the task. In other words, the right amount of friction can prompt customers to refine and consolidate their preferences and can lead to three benefits for companies.</p><p></p><p> <strong>1. Friction helps sellers select the right customers.</strong> Companies that prioritize the long-term profitability of their customer bases over the immediate gain from making a sale must take a holistic and equally long-term perspective on developing relationships with their target audiences. This involves investing in acquisition, retention, and growth. With that idea in mind, the question is whether hurdles that increase the psychological pain of considering an expense will disproportionately deter would-be customers who are more costly to acquire, less likely to purchase again on future occasions, or less likely to increase their spending on the brand over time or recommend the brand. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p> Friction to weed out the wrong customers or select the right ones is a familiar technique in luxury goods markets and in any context where a company wants prospective customers to demonstrate commitment. Ferrari, for example, is known for making it difficult to buy special-edition cars. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> Similarly, luxury fashion brands don&#39;t mind fostering queues, whether virtual or real, or complicating the purchase process by temporarily withholding prices, lengthening the checkout process, or using other approaches. The simple logic behind these tactics is that only the customers who are most interested in the company&#39;s products or most invested in the brand will find working through these inconveniences and complications acceptable in the shopping journey.</p><p></p><p> <strong>2. When friction enables better decisions, customer satisfaction improves.</strong> Using friction to give consumers a moment to pause and consider the implications of their purchases can forestall buyer&#39;s remorse and encourage shoppers to choose the most appropriate option among the available alternatives.</p><p> Making the trade-off between what the potential buyer will pay and what they will receive sufficiently obvious can help prevent mindless purchasing decisions made in the heat of the moment. For example, social media may pitch “buy now, pay later” financing as a savvy way to buy on a budget, but the ease and convenience of such services, now available in many e-commerce sites&#39; checkout processes, can encourage households to overspend, leading to financial strain and debt accumulation. One survey found that 42% of Americans who took out such a loan made at least one late payment on it. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a> In addition, research shows that payments made either long before or long after the natural moment of consumption can reduce people&#39;s attention to cost. Proponents of buy now, pay later assert that this “separates the fun experience of buying from the tedious process of paying,” when in fact such “transaction decoupling” has been shown to reduce the likelihood that the consumer will use the item purchased. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p> The advantage of avoiding bad decisions is relatively clear from a public policy perspective: Most people would agree that overspending and chronic underutilization of purchased goods are not desirable qualities in a society. But encouraging more thoughtful engagement by customers via friction in the purchase process can pay off for businesses, too.</p><p> One immediate benefit is a drop in return rates. In many sectors, online returns are a considerable drag on financial performance — adding up to as much as 15 to 30 cents per dollar of the price of returned merchandise. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> According to a study by Appriss Retail and the National Retail Federation, close to $220 billion worth of merchandise was returned to US digital retailers in 2021, or approximately 21% of total online sales. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a> And this drag, of course, is not just financial — it&#39;s also environmental. Returned products might not be resalable due to wear and tear or other issues and thus end up being sent to landfills or destroyed. According to one report, online returns in the US alone create 5 billion pounds of landfill waste and 15 million tons of carbon emissions annually. <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a> Adding friction also provides customers with time to consider the purchase and become more invested in it. Brands such as Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and Balenciaga delay the communication of prices in a variety of ways — for example, by introducing personalized experiences with salespeople — not only to select better customers, as discussed above, but to put the product center stage and help customers internalize its quality and meaning. Research at the intersection of marketing and neuroscience reports that revealing prices after product information focuses evaluations on attractiveness and desirability (people ask themselves, “Do I like this?”), while doing the opposite focuses evaluations on monetary worth (people ask themselves, “Is it worth it?”). <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a> In a Gartner study, B2B and B2C customers agreed that if they “realized something new about their needs or their own goals,” they were 1.73 times more likely to buy more. <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a></p><p> Using friction to stimulate thinking that results in a decision to purchase can foster a sense of ownership of the product. This can trigger a stronger bond between company and customers and increase customers&#39; willingness to invest additional resources in the relationship. <a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a> As customers put more thought into the purchase decision, they tend to feel more emotionally attached to the product they ultimately choose. And there&#39;s evidence that connecting with customers at the emotional level is a valid route to maximizing customer value. <a id="reflink14" class="reflink" href="#ref14">14</a></p><p> Finally, research also shows that people tend to value products more when they are obtained through effort — the aptly named “Ikea effect,” in reference to the retailer&#39;s policy of outsourcing the assembly of its furniture to customers. <a id="reflink15" class="reflink" href="#ref15">15</a> The experience of effort can influence how people perceive the value and quality of a product or service, and adding effort to the online purchase process can trigger this effect.</p><p></p><p> Overall, we see that friction is successful at triggering engagement, and we know that engaged customers are generally more satisfied with their interactions and experiences with brands and retailers. Engaged customers become advocates, increasing visibility and credibility for companies. They are likely to engage in positive word of mouth, which can lead to new-customer acquisition and elevated brand reputation. They are also likely to have better customer service experiences, feel valued by the company, and provide meaningful feedback and suggestions. Such feedback is valuable for understanding evolving customer needs and making the right improvements to products or services over time.</p><p> <strong>3. Friction creates space for companies to communicate with customers.</strong> Retaining some friction exactly when people face prices and payment, especially when this friction is unexpected, gains attention. This is an opportunity for companies to advertise what they stand for and the merits of their offerings.</p><p> There are several ways to use friction for promotion. First, companies can involve customers in the payment process to evoke positive emotions. For example, one common practice is to give customers the option to round up the transaction amount to the next highest dollar, with the difference being donated to charity. Another possibility is to introduce pay-what-you-want campaigns, where customers choose the price they will pay for the product. While these initiatives do not expedite payment (it is surprisingly effortful to consider how much one wants to pay for something), they can lead to greater emotional connections.</p><p> Companies can also express prices in ways that are intentionally unconventional to force customers to think harder about the underlying message. <a id="reflink16" class="reflink" href="#ref16">16</a> For instance, an advertisement from Ikea uses cans of soda to playfully quantify the prices of its products. Of course, the retailer won&#39;t accept soda as payment for furniture. And although it takes a moment of cognitive effort to understand the “exchange rate,” the message that the furniture is as affordable as a number of small-ticket purchases, such as soda, is conveyed to customers.</p><p> Another example is Stella Artois&#39;s award-winning “reassuringly expensive” campaign. The brand attempted to signal the high quality of its beer by introducing the dependency between price and quality into its price communication. Stella upended consumer expectations by playfully offering a coupon that increased the price of the product (“Bring this coupon and pay an extra $1.25 on your next Stella Artois”). By presenting a seemingly confusing and illogical “deal,” it nudged customers to conclude that the product is far superior to that of its competitors (and worth the cost).</p><p> Friction in the payment process can also be used to communicate the brand&#39;s values. For example, in 2014, the relief organization Misereor increased donation rates by deploying interactive screens in locations such as airports that asked passersby to donate 2 euros by swiping their credit cards over the screen. The swipe activated an engaging interactive sequence, such as depicting the credit card slicing a piece of bread to feed the hungry or freeing an imprisoned child.</p><p> Finally, in a bold example of extreme friction, outdoor retailer REI closed its physical stores and stopped processing online payments on Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year in the US Its goal was to take a stand against consumerism and encourage would-be shoppers to spend time outdoors instead — a message that underscores the company&#39;s dedication to accessible exploration. <a id="reflink17" class="reflink" href="#ref17">17 号</a></p><h3>The Friction Sweet Spot</h3><p> Better customer selection, consumer decisions, and promotion are three good reasons to abandon the simplistic goal of zero friction. Given the drawbacks of encouraging customers to purchase on autopilot, business leaders should seek to determine the right degree of friction for their companies&#39; purchase processes. In our experience, there are at least five factors to consider. We&#39;ll review them and introduce a scorecard that brings them together and helps to guide decision-making. (See “What&#39;s the Right Amount of Friction for Your Online Customer Experience?”)</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> What&#39;s the Right Amount of Friction for Your Online Customer Experience?</h4><p class="caption"> Use this scorecard to help you determine the optimal amount of friction to help you<br /> cultivate enduring customer relationships.</p><p></p></article></aside></div><p> The first step for every company is to adopt a more accurate definition of what friction is. At the moment, all friction is viewed negatively, which reduces organizations&#39; sense of needing to specify what it actually is. By most accounts, friction is operationalized in terms of time saved. But not all time is created equal. In fact, companies should view negative friction as anything that blocks or distracts customers from the purchase decision, and positive friction as anything that optimizes deliberation.</p><p> The second step is to understand what contexts benefit from positive friction — because this need is not universal. What&#39;s at stake in a particular purchase decision, and does it typically require high or low customer involvement? The two often go together, such that high-stakes decisions also require high involvement, but this is not necessarily the case. For instance, a consumer who is financially secure might not engage more with a purchase decision simply because the item is expensive. And it is exactly when this relation breaks down that you want to step in to proactively manage friction. High-stakes decisions might be such because of the significance of the product or service in question, the scale of the financial outlay, or the personal or social consequences of the purchase. In this spirit, using a technology like Amazon&#39;s Just Walk Out in stadiums might not be good for people who are no longer dissuaded from buying unhealthy snacks by excessively long lines at the concession stand.</p><p> Third, think about your commercial objective. If you care about highlighting cost savings relative to competitors&#39; prices, then, yes — reducing friction by posting your almost-too-good-to-be-true price upfront is worthwhile. However, if you compete on the basis of innovation, quality, or customer service, then perhaps retaining a little friction by delaying when the price is presented is best, because this gets customers to think about and crystallize their preferences. Some friction allows businesses to shift the conversation from “Is it worth it?” to “Do I like it?” And if the goal is to strengthen one&#39;s brand, then adding friction is the right way to go.</p><p> Fourth, consider the makeup of your customer base and the relative closeness of customer relationships. Different customer demographics might require more or less friction, depending on expectations around their understanding of a product or service or their ability to pay. Likewise, relationship stage is important. You might want to include more friction in transactions with new customers versus returning customers, in particular those who might be less familiar with your products or product category. You might want to make it harder for a prospective customer to make a purchase, add a bit of friction for a returning customer, and present a frictionless experience to a loyal customer who fully understands the product or service. A company should maximize enduring relationships with clients — because that is the only path to increase customer value.</p><p> Fifth, think about your choice of route to market. All retail environments could potentially benefit from some friction, but their application will be different. In a brick-and-mortar store, adding pain points that incentivize interaction between a salesperson and the customer might be the right type of friction. In an online store, however, adding steps to foster deliberation can reduce returns and increase subsequent satisfaction with the company. On social media, a company could look to balance content that engages customer interaction and not just click-through rates, thereby helping to dissuade users from mindlessly or impulsively shopping.</p><p></p><p> In fact, for a business selling the same product in brick-and-mortar stores and online, more (positive) friction might be needed in the online or mobile channel, given that product returns tend to be greatest in those channels. One interesting technique that some fashion brands have recently introduced is imposing a fee for online returns. Companies like Anthropologie, H&amp;M, and Zara are charging for returning items online (but not for making in-store returns). <a id="reflink18" class="reflink" href="#ref18">18</a> Yes, charging for returns can antagonize some customers. But, again, this point can be key to retaining the most relevant customers and strengthening relationships with those who persist and make a purchase.</p><p></p><p> “How can we make our prices a little less conspicuous and easier to pay?” is among the most common questions asked of user experience teams and experts. But business leaders should embrace the customer moment of truth rather than work to eliminate it. They should not buy into the popular idea that friction is the ultimate conversion killer.</p><p> Without a doubt, when used poorly, friction can derail the customer experience. But a frictionless world is just as dangerous. This is a lesson most of us learned years ago from our high school physics teacher: Too much friction prevents progress toward a goal, but too little friction can throw everything into chaos.</p><p> Indeed, many business leaders are already telling us that they want customers to spend more productive time on their purchase decisions. This sounds like the perfect job for friction. If thinking leads shoppers to make safer, better choices, and in turn these choices impact companies through lower product returns, more sustainable consumer behavior, higher customer satisfaction, and higher loyalty, then let&#39;s all accept and embrace some hassles and hurdles as yet another — albeit surprising — tool at the disposal of customer centricity.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/can-friction-improve-your-customers-experiences/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Is Your Organization Investing Enough in Responsible AI? &#39;Probably Not,&#39; Says Our Data</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/is-your-organization-investing-enough-in-responsible-ai-probably-not-says-our-data/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/is-your-organization-investing-enough-in-responsible-ai-probably-not-says-our-data/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 11:00:53 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[David Kiron and Steven Mills. ]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business Priorities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Risk Management]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology Investment]]></category><category><![CDATA[AI & Machine Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Data, AI, & Machine Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Financial Management & Risk]]></category><category><![CDATA[Managing Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Responsible AI]]></category><description><![CDATA[For the second year in a row, MIT Sloan Management Review and Boston Consulting Group have assembled an international panel of AI experts to help us understand how responsible artificial intelligence (RAI) is being implemented across organizations worldwide.

For our final question in this year&#39;s research cycle, we asked our academic and practitioner panelists to respond to this provocation: <em>As the business community becomes more aware of AI&#39;s risks, companies are making adequate investments in RAI.</em></p><p> While their reasons vary, most panelists recognize that RAI investments are falling short of what&#39;s needed: Eleven out of 13 were reluctant to agree that organizations&#39; investments in responsible AI are “adequate.” The panelists largely affirmed findings from our <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/building-robust-rai-programs-as-third-party-ai-tools-proliferate/">2023 RAI global survey</a> , in which less than half of respondents said they believe their company is prepared to make adequate investments in RAI. This is a pressing leadership challenge for companies that are prioritizing AI and must manage AI-related risks.</p><p> The need to expand investments in RAI marks a significant shift now that “AI-related risks are impossible to ignore,” observes Linda Leopold, head of responsible AI and data at H&amp;M Group. While making adequate investments in RAI used to be an important but not particularly urgent issue, Leopold suggests that recent advances in generative AI and the proliferation of third-party tools have made the urgency of such investments clear.</p><p> Making adequate investments in RAI is complicated by measurement challenges. There are no industry standards that offer guidance, so how do you know when or if your investments are sufficient? What&#39;s more, rational executives can have different opinions about what constitutes an adequate investment. What&#39;s clear is that epistemic questions should not be a barrier to action, especially when AI risks pose real business threats.</p><div class="callout-chart"><div class="callout-chart__bg"><div class="callout-chart__container"><div class="callout-chart__info"><h3> The Panelists Respond</p></h3><h2> It is unclear if organizations are making appropriate investments in RAI.</p></h2><p> Most panelists are reluctant to agree that organizations are making “adequate” investments in RAI.</p><p> <a href="#sf-inter-app" class="callout-chart__info__anchor link-offset">Jump to panelists&#39; detailed responses below.</a> </div><div class="callout-chart__bars"><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RAI2023_Article4-Chart.jpg" alt="Chart: 0 strongly agree; 15% agree, 46% neither agree nor disagree; 39% disagree; 0% strongly disagree"></div></p></div><p class="callout-chart__source"> Source: Responsible AI panel of 13 experts in artificial intelligence strategy. </p></p></div><p><path id="Path" d="M0,0,14.067,15.065,28.941,0" transform="translate(1.096 1.054)" fill="none" stroke="#fff" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="3" /> <a href="" class="callout-chart-add__button"><span class="callout-chart-add__button-text"><strong>Show</strong> Global Survey Results</span></a> </p><div class="callout-chart-add"><div class="callout-chart-add__container"><div class="callout-chart-add__info"><h4></h4><h3> Responses from the 2023 Global Executive Survey<br /></h3><p> “To what extent do you believe that your organization is prepared to invest (reduce revenue, increase costs) to comply with responsible AI initiatives?” </p></p></div><div class="callout-chart-add__chart"><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/RAI2023_Article4-survey.jpg" alt="Bar chart: To a moderate or great extent: 48%; To some extent: 29%; To a minor extent: 8%; Not at all: 3%; Don't know: 12%" class="mt0"></p><p class="callout-chart-add__source"> Source: Survey data of 1,240 respondents representing organizations reporting at least $100 million in annual revenues.

Several panelists suggested that profit motives are a factor. Tshilidzi Marwala, rector of the United Nations University and UN undersecretary general, contends that only “20% of the companies aware of AI risks are investing in RAI programs. The rest are more concerned about how they can use AI to maximize their profits.” Simon Chesterman, the David Marshall Professor and vice provost at the National University of Singapore, adds, “The gold rush around generative AI has led to a downsizing of safety and security teams in tech companies, and a shortened path to market for new products. … Fear of missing out is triumphing — in many organizations, if not all — over risk management.”</p><p> Another reason behind underinvestment is that greater use of AI throughout an enterprise expands the scope of RAI and increases required investments. As Philip Dawson, head of AI policy at Armilla AI, observes, “Investment in AI capabilities continues to vastly outstrip investment in AI safety and tools to operationalize AI risk management. Enterprises are playing catch-up in an uphill battle that is only getting steeper.” Leopold adds that generative AI and an increasing number of possible applications “significantly increases the size of the audience that responsible AI programs have to reach.”</p><p></p><p> A third reason is that growing awareness of AI risks does not always translate into accurate assessments of those risks. Oarabile Mudongo, a policy specialist at the African Observatory on Responsible AI, suggests that some companies might not be investing enough in their RAI programs because they “underestimate the extent of AI risks.”</p><h3> How Do You Know Whether You&#39;re Investing Enough?</h3><p> Other panelists pointed out that although making adequate investments in RAI is important, it&#39;s hard to gauge whether the investment is large enough or effective. How should companies calculate a return on RAI investments? What counts as an “adequate” return? What even counts as an investment? David R. Hardoon, CEO of Aboitiz Data Innovation and chief data and AI officer of Union Bank of the Philippines, asks, “How can the investments in RAI be broadly, and generally, considered adequate if (1) all companies are not subjected to the same levels of standards, (2) we have yet to agree on what is &#39;sufficient&#39; or &#39;acceptable,&#39; or (3) we don&#39;t have a mechanism to verify third parties?”</p><p> Triveni Gandhi, responsible AI lead at Dataiku, agrees: “Among those companies that have taken the time to invest in RAI programs, there is wide variation in how these programs are actually designed and implemented. The lack of cohesive or clear expectations on how to implement or operationalize RAI values makes it difficult for organizations to start investing efficiently.”</p><p> “It is difficult to determine the extent to which companies are making adequate investments in responsible AI programs, as there is a large spectrum of awareness and relevance,” asserts Giuseppe Manai, cofounder, chief operating officer, and chief scientist at Stemly. Aisha Naseer, director of research at Huawei Technologies (UK), adds, “It is not evident whether these investments are adequate or enough, as these range from trivial to huge funds being allocated for the control of AI and associated risk mitigation.”</p><p></p><h3>建议</h3><p>For organizations seeking to adequately invest in RAI, we recommend the following:</p><p> <strong>1. Build leadership awareness of AI risks.</strong> Leaders need to be aware that using AI is a double-edged sword that introduces risks as well as benefits. Focusing on investments that increase the benefits of AI without a commensurate focus on managing its risks undermines value creation in two ways. One is that without appropriate guardrails, the benefits from AI might be underwhelming: Our research has found that innovation with AI increases when RAI practices are in place. Second, risks from AI are proliferating as quickly as the tools they are embedded in. A robust awareness of AI&#39;s risks and benefits supports leadership efforts to manage risks and grow the company. Building management awareness can take many forms, including executive education, discussion forums, and RAI programs that have a variety of stakeholders with different types of exposure to (and experience with) AI risks.</p><p> <strong>2. Accept that investing in RAI will be an ongoing process.</strong> As AI development and use increase — with no foreseeable end — RAI practices and implementations need to adapt as well. That requires ongoing RAI investment to continually evolve an RAI program. With the regulatory landscape poised for change in the European Union, the US, and Asia, leaders will face growing pressure to evolve their AI-focused risk management systems. Waiting to invest (or halting investment) in these systems — technologically, culturally, and financially — can undermine business growth. When new regulations and industry standards take effect, rapidly overhauling processes to meet compliance requirements can interfere with AI-related innovation. It&#39;s better to co-evolve RAI programs with AI development so they complement each other rather than create this unnecessary interference. As companies scale their AI investments, so, too, will their RAI investments need to grow. But those companies that are already behind will need to move quickly and invest aggressively in RAI to avoid always lagging behind.</p><p> <strong>3. Develop RAI investment metrics.</strong> Investing in RAI is complex — and what does a return on such an investment even look like? Much like with cybersecurity investments, the best RAI returns might be the sound of silence when AI-related issues are discovered before they create damage to brand reputation, regulatory issues, and increased costs. That said, silence should not be mistaken for adequate investment. As our survey results show, companies making minimal investment might not find issues simply because they aren&#39;t looking for them. Leaders should align on what constitutes an RAI investment, the appropriate metrics to evaluate these investments, and who will decide on investment levels. Metrics that gauge RAI program success are necessary to support RAI programs over time, but they can be a lagging indicator. Metrics should also evaluate forward-looking dimensions such as leadership commitment, program adoption, training and workforce needs, and culture change. Leaders must also determine how RAI funding is related to funding for AI projects. Should every large AI project have a budget set aside for RAI? Or should RAI funding be independent of specific projects or some combination of project-based (decentralized) and institutional (centralized) investments?</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/is-your-organization-investing-enough-in-responsible-ai-probably-not-says-our-data/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Real Issues Driving the Nursing Crisis</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-solve-nursing-crisis/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-solve-nursing-crisis/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 11:02:56 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Donald Sull and Charles Sull. <p>Donald Sull ( <a href="https://twitter.com/culturexinsight">@culturexinsight</a> ) is a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management and a cofounder of CultureX.

For each review, we analyzed whether it mentioned one of 200 topics and assessed whether the nurse spoke about that topic positively or negatively. The topics were derived from research on various elements of employees&#39; experiences, including culture, compensation and benefits, work schedules, and perceived organizational support. We clustered related topics together into two dozen broader themes.</p><p> We used the topics as features in an XGBoost model that predicted each nurse&#39;s overall rating of their current or former employer on a 5-point scale. We then calculated SHAP values (which assign an importance value to each feature in a model) to directly compare the relative importance of different topics in predicting job satisfaction (measured by the overall rating each nurse gave their employer). We also used textual analysis to compare how favorably travel nurses spoke about topics compared with nurses on staff at health care systems.</p><p> Using the topics nurses mentioned and their sentiment toward each topic as predictors, our models explain between 29% and 39% of the variance in ratings across nurses — nearly an order of magnitude more than we could account for using ownership, organizational type, and location as predictors. <a id="reflinki" class="reflink" href="#refi">i</a></p></aside><p> Health care leaders face a daunting set of challenges — rising costs, the transition to digital health, and shifting payment models, to name just a few. But according to a recent survey from the American College of Healthcare Executives, the No. 1 problem hospital CEOs face is staff shortages and burnout. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> Ninety percent of the CEOs surveyed cited nursing shortages as a particularly acute pain point.</p><p> In 2021, the total number of registered nurses working in the US dropped by the largest amount in 40 years, with younger nurses leading the exodus. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> By 2025, the US health care system could suffer a shortfall of up to 450,000 nurses, or 20% fewer than the nursing workforce required for patient care. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p></p><p> High levels of job dissatisfaction and burnout are driving nurses from the profession. The COVID-19 pandemic placed tremendous pressure on all health care workers, but dissatisfaction and burnout among nurses have not improved since the pandemic ended. And by some measures, it might be getting worse: In 2021, nearly two-thirds of registered nurses would have encouraged others to become a nurse, but only half said they would recommend nursing as a profession two years later. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p> One of the richest sources of insight on dissatisfaction among nurses is how they describe their job, in their own words, on employment sites like Indeed and Glassdoor. This information is voluminous but difficult to synthesize because most of it takes the form of unstructured free text. To understand the challenges nurses face, we analyzed how 150,000 of them had described their employers in Glassdoor reviews since the beginning of the pandemic. (See “The Research.”) In this article, we share key insights from that analysis and offer advice to health care leaders about how they can address nurses&#39; most pressing issues.</p><h3> Health Care Leaders Are Out of Touch</h3><p> Nurses view their managers as out of touch with the daily realities of patient care. We categorized their comments about managers into nearly 50 leadership traits. The second most frequently cited trait described managers as being unaware of the challenges that nurses struggle with in the workplace. When nurses discussed how managers understood life at the bedside, their comments were negative 9 times out of 10.</p><p></p><p> Nurses are particularly critical of members of the senior executive team for their disconnectedness. The top team was 10 times more likely than front-line supervisors and middle managers to be criticized for being out of touch. Our results reinforce a separate survey in which nearly half of hospital nurses said they believe management does not listen to their concerns. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a></p><p> To address dissatisfaction and burnout, health care leaders must first understand what&#39;s happening at the bedside. This can be challenging, particularly in large health care systems with thousands of nurses working across multiple sites and specialties.</p><p> Historically, leaders have struggled to systematically analyze the gold mine of insights into nurses&#39; frustrations that can be gleaned from their comments in employee surveys or external reviews. Reading, understanding, and analyzing huge volumes of unstructured textual data has simply not been practical. However, recent advances in artificial intelligence make it possible to identify deep patterns in large bodies of text and understand feedback at scale. Leaders can now mine free text to gain a nuanced understanding of the issues driving dissatisfaction and burnout among nurses and use that insight to improve life at work for their nursing staffs. (See “Getting Started With Text Analytics.”)</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Getting Started With Text Analytics</h4><p> Our research analyzes data from hundreds of organizations and hundreds of thousands of nurses, but you can delve more deeply into your own employees&#39; feedback as well. Regardless of whether you develop AI text analytics capabilities internally, through a workforce analytics function, or with an external partner, you should keep these principles in mind to maximize the effectiveness of the cultural measurement.</p><p> <strong>Precision matters, but so does recall.</strong> Precision — the percentage of text instances that are correctly classified as discussing a topic — is a critical element of free text analysis. So is recall — the percentage of total mentions of the topic in a body of text that are captured by your text analytics platform. If you gauge success solely through precision, you will end up with an analytical platform that is highly accurate but misses most of what employees actually say. A sophisticated AI tool will pick up on slang, idioms, acronyms, cultural references, and organization-specific language to capture the long tail of seldom-mentioned but information-rich terms.</p><div class="callout-toggle"><p> <strong>Keep subject matter experts in the loop.</strong> The heart of text analytics is classifying natural language into meaningful topics. Ideally, the people measuring culture will engage subject matter experts when developing topics for analysis. Subject matter experts can ensure that the cultural and workplace topics selected are clearly defined, linked to existing research, and properly measured.</p><p> <strong>Likert questions have severe drawbacks but, used in moderation, can be very helpful.</strong> Too many Likert-scale questions can lead survey takers to shift into autopilot mode. But Likert questions should not be thrown out altogether. Effective cultural measurement combines Likert-scale outcomes on broad topics (such as engagement, attrition intent, and other important measures) with free-text data to identify which, out of hundreds of free-text topics, have the most powerful impact on outcomes.</p><p> <strong>Transparency matters and will probably matter more going forward.</strong> While it remains to be seen how AI will be regulated, it is likely that legislators or courts will not look kindly on important decisions being made by black-box models with no explanation of how the models are reaching their conclusions. Leaders often rely on culture measurement to make important decisions such as compensation policies, personnel changes, and how to prioritize resources. They should be wary of relying exclusively on models that make decisions that humans cannot understand.</p><p> <strong>Employees hate it when you spy on them — and you won&#39;t learn much about culture.</strong> Leaders should resist the temptation to expand their text analytics efforts to the content of emails, Slack channels, phone messages, and other forms of communication that were not designed to provide employee feedback. Many employees consider listening to their work conversations eavesdropping or worse. Moreover, work emails and Slack messages tend to contain far less cultural information than question prompts that explicitly invite employees to discuss what is working and not working in their organization. Keep employee listening consensual, and keep Big Brother out of the workplace.</p></div></article></aside></div><h3> Identify Relative Strengths and Opportunities Through Benchmarking</h3><p> Nursing satisfaction varies widely across employers. We identified 200 of the largest health care employers in the United States, including hospitals and health care systems, home health care providers, operators of senior living facilities, and staffing agencies. For each employer, we calculated how highly nurses rated the organization and senior leadership on Glassdoor from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic through June 2023. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p> Among large employers, nurses&#39; Glassdoor ratings ran the gamut from poor (2.6) to nearly perfect (4.9) on a 5-point scale. Nurses&#39; assessments of how well senior leadership has performed during and after the pandemic were even more varied, ranging from 2.1 to 4.9 on the same 5-point scale. The wide variance in Glassdoor ratings is consistent with a separate survey in which the percentage of dissatisfied nurses ranged from 2% to 48% across 60 US hospitals. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p> Employees of the 200 large health care organizations can use our <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/nursing-satisfaction-index/">interactive tool</a> to see how their organization ranks against others. The index is sortable by nurses&#39; overall ratings, their assessments of the top leadership, and the four most powerful predictors of nurses&#39; satisfaction: compensation, workload, organizational support, and toxic culture. </p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sull_Nursing_Interactive_512.jpg" class="launchscreen no-mobile"></p><h4> How Do Nurses Rate Their Employers?</h4><p class="caption"> Use the Nursing Satisfaction Index to compare how nurses evaluated the employee experience at 200 large health care organizations.</p><p></p></article></aside></div><p> Nurses who work for staffing agencies (who are sometimes referred to as travel nurses) are, on average, much more satisfied than other nurses. The five highest-ranked employers in our sample (and six of the top 10) are staffing agencies.</p><p> Higher compensation, of course, accounts for part of this difference, but not all of it. We compared how positively nurses working with staffing agencies spoke about 200 topics compared with their counterparts employed by hospitals and health care systems. (See “Staffing Agencies Rate Better on Many Key Factors.”) While compensation was viewed more favorably by agency nurses, issues around solving nurses&#39; problems and open, honest communication had a larger sentiment gap between the two groups. By focusing on nurses as clients, staffing agencies excel at practices that improve satisfaction beyond simply paying higher wages. Other health care leaders can learn from their example, and we&#39;ll make some concrete recommendations below.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Staffing Agencies Rate Better on Many Key Factors</h4><p class="caption"> We analyzed the free text of US Glassdoor reviews by nurses from the start of the pandemic to June 2023 to see how positively they spoke about a variety of topics. We then compared the positive sentiments of nurses working with staffing agencies to those of nurses working in hospitals and health care systems. While staffing agencies rate higher on many key topics — including honest communication, resolving issues efficiently, and building trust — hospitals and health care systems are stronger when it comes to learning and development, benefits, colleagues, and opportunities for promotion. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sull_Nursing_Fig1.png" alt="Staffing Agencies Rate Better on Many Key Factors" /><br /></article></aside></div><h3> Prioritize Drivers of Job Satisfaction</h3><p> To understand the drivers of job satisfaction among nurses, we analyzed the free text of all reviews that had been written by the nurses in our sample since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and classified the text into nearly 200 topics. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> We then clustered topics into two dozen broader themes and used those themes to predict nurses&#39; overall ratings of their employers. We then compared each theme&#39;s relative importance in predicting ratings. (See “Top and Bottom Predictors of Nurses&#39; Job Satisfaction.”)</p><p></p><p> Compensation was the top predictor of satisfaction among nurses reviewing their current employer, which is not surprising, given that inflation eroded the purchasing power of take-home pay during the period we analyzed. The importance of workload, the second-most-important driver, jibes with findings from a separate large-scale survey that found insufficient staffing was the strongest predictor of nurses&#39; job dissatisfaction, burnout, and intent to quit. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p> Workload and compensation are root causes of the nursing crisis that must be addressed, but they are not the only factors influencing nurses&#39; job satisfaction. Our analysis surfaced other aspects of the work environment, including toxic culture, organizational support, work schedules, communication, and learning and development opportunities, that leaders can focus on to improve nurses&#39; work lives.</p><p> This analysis also highlights areas that are unlikely to move the needle in improving the workplace experience for nurses. Perks are nice, but they will not compensate for a punishing workload or wages that fail to keep pace with inflation. Highlighting the corporate mission to promote patient health won&#39;t help much either. Nurses already know that their job serves a higher purpose; that&#39;s why most of them became nurses in the first place.</p><h3> Mine Free Text for Actionable Insights</h3><p> Many health care organizations rely on annual employee surveys, with dozens of items rated on a 5-point scale and a few open-ended questions tacked on as an afterthought. Faced with a long list of multiple-choice questions, employees are prone to switching to autopilot and assigning similar scores to very different items. The choice of questions constrains what employees can discuss, and there is seldom room to expand on why they chose a particular numeric response.</p><p> Open-ended, free-text feedback provides a rich source of nuanced and actionable insights. When nurses can decide which topics to write about, they use their freedom to discuss what matters most to them. Open-ended questions provide nurses with the space to expand on their concerns in their own words, offer crucial context, and propose concrete and actionable fixes to the problems they face. Individual free-text responses can be aggregated into broader themes to prioritize where leaders could focus their attention and limited resources to achieve the largest improvements in nurses&#39; satisfaction.</p><p> While organizational averages are useful, it is important to remember that distinctive subcultures can coexist within the same organization. This is particularly true among large health care systems that have grown through mergers and acquisitions. One national hospital chain, for example, has ratings that range from 1.9 to 3.9 across nearly 50 sites. Rather than relying on organizational averages alone, health care leaders must measure and analyze differences across locations, departments, functions, teams, and individual leaders.</p><p> Women, underrepresented minorities, and older employees can also experience organizational culture very differently from other employees. <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a> It&#39;s crucial to understand the drivers of job satisfaction and burnout across diverse employee populations.</p><p></p><p> Leaders can mine the free text for detailed insights about the most critical pain points for specific groups and tailor their interventions accordingly. Schedules, for example, have a significant impact on nurses&#39; job satisfaction, but which aspects of scheduling matter most will depend on the specific position. Flexibility in scheduling shifts and the ability to take uninterrupted work breaks is very important for nurses in hospitals and primary care practices, while home health care nurses place a premium on predictable schedules. <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a></p><p> Nurses&#39; comments provide a treasure trove of practical suggestions to improve the workplace and patient care. The Glassdoor reviews we studied, for example, include dozens of actionable suggestions for how employers can improve scheduling. Some are easy-to-implement actions, such as using an app to make it easier to pick up or swap shifts, or paying a $20 to $50 bonus to nurses who pick up shifts at the last minute. Others are more systemic changes, like including nurses on a committee established to set schedules or ensuring that employees who receive tuition assistance are able to schedule work around their classes.</p><h3> Listen to Nurses Who Leave Your Organization</h3><p> Most organizations limit their surveys to current employees. Exit interviews are administered haphazardly, if at all, and the feedback from former employees is too often dismissed as the rantings of malcontents. But ignoring feedback from former employees is a big mistake. </p><div class="post_video_player fit-video"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KJE4DW0Lbuk?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> Interviewing or surveying former employees can surface the reasons for their departure and pinpoint the most effective actions to retain talent. Free of the threat of retaliation, nurses who are leaving (or have left) an organization are more likely to provide candid feedback, even about taboo issues that current employees are reluctant to discuss. By collecting feedback from those who have left, organizations can uncover potential blind spots.</p><p> More than one-third of the Glassdoor reviews in our sample were written by former employees and provide insights on what mattered most to nurses who voted with their feet. <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a> The bars on the left side of the figure “Top and Bottom Predictors of Nurses&#39; Job Satisfaction” rank the factors that predict how nurses who quit rank their former employers, and it sheds light on a critical reason nurses might head for the exits.</p><p> In an <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/why-every-leader-needs-to-worry-about-toxic-culture/">earlier article</a> , we argued that five behavioral attributes — disrespectful, noninclusive, unethical, cutthroat, and abusive — mark an organizational culture as toxic. <a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a> Among nurses who quit, toxic culture is more than twice as predictive of their overall satisfaction than compensation or workload. The importance of toxic workplaces among nurses who quit is consistent with earlier research that found toxicity to be the strongest predictor of industry-adjusted attrition during the first six months of the Great Resignation. <a id="reflink14" class="reflink" href="#ref14">14</a></p><p> Toxic culture has become more important for nurses in the post-pandemic era. When we compared which factors best predict how nurses rated their employer before and after the pandemic, toxic culture experienced the largest gain in relative importance post-COVID-19 (followed by workload, well-being, and compensation). If your organization suffers from cultural toxicity, another article of ours, “ <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-fix-a-toxic-culture/">How to Fix a Toxic Culture</a> ,” presents several evidence-based interventions health care leaders can use to detox their own organization.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Top and Bottom Predictors of Nurses&#39; Job Satisfaction</h4><p class="caption"> We classified the text of over 150,000 nurses&#39; Glassdoor reviews into two dozen themes that affect the employee experience, and we then analyzed which themes best predict how nurses rate their employer. The chart ranks the importance of each theme in predicting these ratings by showing how much each theme contributes to the overall prediction. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sull_Nursing_Fig2.png" alt="Top and Bottom Predictors of Nurses’ Job Satisfaction" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><h3> Learn From Staffing Agency Practices</h3><p> As the figure “Staffing Agencies Rate Better on Many Key Factors” shows, nurses are very positive about the processes staffing agencies have in place to resolve problems quickly and efficiently. Of nurses who mentioned the efficiency of staffing agencies&#39; processes, 75% were positive, compared with 23% expressing positive sentiment for health care systems. For travel nurses, common process issues include onboarding, obtaining required credentials and licenses, contract negotiation, and reimbursement. The best staffing agencies listen to feedback, develop a deep understanding of the typical problems travel nurses face, and optimize their work processes to address these issues.</p><p> Many of the pain points encountered by staff nurses will differ from those of agency nurses. Health care systems, home health agencies, and long-term care providers could, however, adopt a similar approach to capture and analyze nurses&#39; feedback, prioritize the most common and frustrating challenges they face, and work with staff members to address these issues.</p><p> Consistently listening to and acting on feedback can also build trust with the nursing staff. Staffing agency nurses are more positive about having the psychological safety to speak up about difficult issues and be heard than are nurses working in hospitals and health care systems.</p><p> The benefits of psychological safety are blunted, however, if management is slow to respond to issues that nurses raise. Nurses speak highly of how quickly staffing agencies respond to their questions and concerns. In contrast, nurses frequently complain that other types of employers are slow to respond to emails raising issues, if they get a reply at all. Nurses also place a high value on having multiple channels of communication with their supervisors, including text, email, Facebook, Jabber, and a 24/7 hotline.</p><p> Another insight from our research is that nurses value honesty and transparency. They understand the challenges health care faces as well as anyone, and they expect honest communication about what is happening in the organization, how it affects them, and why decisions were made. Triage, a staffing agency and the fourth most highly rated large employer we studied, places honest communication at the center of its value proposition: “We tell it like it is so you won&#39;t be surprised by how it goes.” <a id="reflink15" class="reflink" href="#ref15">15</a></p><p> Health care systems can learn from staffing agencies, but they can also leverage their own distinctive advantages to attract and retain nurses. Nurses in full-time staff positions rate hospitals and health care systems higher than staffing agencies on three important aspects of organizational life: learning and development (including promotion opportunities and reimbursement for training), benefits, and colleagues. Those three factors are among the top 10 predictors of how nurses rate their employers. Health care systems should invest in their comparative advantages and emphasize them when communicating their value proposition to potential and current employees.</p><p></p><h3> Translate Feedback Into Action to Build Trust</h3><p> It&#39;s one thing to collect employee feedback, but it&#39;s another to consistently act on those insights. Employees are less likely to surface issues or propose potential solutions if they believe that managers will not act. <a id="reflink16" class="reflink" href="#ref16">16</a> Worse yet, employees are more likely to quit if they believe that management lacks the power, resources, or interest to make changes based on their suggestions. <a id="reflink17" class="reflink" href="#ref17">17</a> Nearly half of nurses believe that management will not fix problems that clinical staff members bring to their attention. <a id="reflink18" class="reflink" href="#ref18">18</a></p><p> Organizations need to put in place structures to consistently act on employee feedback. One well-known example is Kaiser Permanente&#39;s unit-based teams (UBTs), which consist of clinical staff members and managers who regularly work together in a specific unit or department. <a id="reflink19" class="reflink" href="#ref19">19</a> The teams, which meet at least once per month, are responsible for their unit&#39;s performance and are co-led by a manager, a labor representative, and, typically, a clinical staff member.</p><p> The UBTs identify opportunities to improve along four dimensions: quality (including patient outcomes), patient service, affordability, and employee experience. The teams use employee feedback to identify and prioritize improvement opportunities. Next, the teams develop and test solutions using best practices and evidence-based methods. Once a solution has been deemed effective, it is implemented across the unit, department, or, in some cases, the entire organization. The UBTs then monitor the impact of these changes in terms of patient outcomes, employee satisfaction, and cost reduction.</p><p></p><p> Our study of 150,000 reviews written by US nurses since the onset of COVID-19 reveals wide variation in how nurses rate their employers as a whole, and specifically in terms of compensation, workload, toxic culture, and organizational support — the four factors that most shape nurses&#39; job satisfaction. In our view, this variation offers a message of hope. Despite the structural challenges that all health care organizations face, it <em>is</em> possible to provide an environment where nurses look forward to going to work every day.</p><p> Many organizations, including some of the largest employers of nurses, have significant room for improvement. These rankings are not designed to “name and shame” but rather to make health care leaders aware of the magnitude of the gap between their organization&#39;s performance and what is possible when it comes to providing a healthy workplace for nurses. We also hope that the objective data on how health care organizations rank on factors that matter most to nurses can provide their leaders with the impetus to make improvements and the evidence to convince all stakeholders of the urgent need for change.</p><p></p><p> What leaders should not do is ask nurses to work harder and endure more frustration and stress while failing to understand and address the organizational factors that make life miserable for many of them. Leaders who continue business as usual should not be surprised when staff members quit, workers unionize, and state and federal legislators dictate regulations to protect the interests of nurses.</p><p> To improve the work lives of nurses, and indeed all health care workers, leaders must collect and act on their feedback, recognizing that different parts of the organization and different populations will face distinctive challenges and issues. Listening to nurses demonstrates that there are meaningful steps health care leaders can take to fix the nursing crisis. The single most important step is to listen to them in the first place.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-solve-nursing-crisis/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Explore How Nurses Rate Their Employers</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/nursing-satisfaction-index/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/nursing-satisfaction-index/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 18 Oct 2023 11:01:03 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Donald Sull and Charles Sull. <p>Donald Sull ( <a href="https://twitter.com/culturexinsight">@culturexinsight</a> ) is a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management and a cofounder of CultureX.

What&#39;s driving that burnout? What&#39;s most important to a nurse&#39;s job satisfaction? How common are toxic cultures in health care settings? What can health care leaders do to improve the problems? In this video, we talk to five current and former nurses to learn about the reality of working in health care, including the toxic cultures and stressors they&#39;ve experienced, and get advice from them and health care experts on what needs to change.</p><p> Article author and researcher Donald Sull also discusses the truths about job satisfaction revealed by the analysis of 150,000 employer reviews by nurses on job site Glassdoor, and what health care leaders can learn from them.</p><p></p><p> “The key, actionable finding from our research is, nurses are telling you what&#39;s not working for them, often in very granular detail, and they&#39;re offering concrete recommendations to address these issues. They want to help. They want their voices heard, and they want to make a positive impact,” Sull says.</p><p> “One of the most difficult or frustrating things about being a nurse is really not having enough time to spend with the patient,” says Jennie Evans, who served as a pediatric oncology and ICU RN for 18 years. “Those moments where you can sit, talk with the patient, hold their hand, talk with the family, and really get to know them and understand not just the disease but other underlying anxieties or fears that the patient might have.”</p><p> Watch the video to hear more from nurses on what they want health care leaders to know about toxic cultures, mental health, growth opportunities, and other issues that are critical to caregivers.</p><p class="attribution"> Image credit: Jack Daly</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/how-solve-nursing-shortage/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
