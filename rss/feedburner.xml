Sustained remote work again [&#8230;]]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><figure class="article-inline"><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Raman-1290x860-1.jpg" alt="" /><br /></figure><p>随着经济衰退的威胁迫在眉睫，我们正在进入不确定性和快速变化的连续第四年。三年前，一场全球大流行颠覆了供应链，隔离改变了我们的工作方式。几个月后，种族正义的清算迫使企业做出前所未有的承诺，<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/inclusive-hiring-to-build-better-teams-period/">建立包容性组织</a>。持续的远程工作再次挑战了工作场所的现状，并在某些情况下成为了无障碍的工具。持续紧张的劳动力市场迫使企业重新考虑并调整其吸引顶尖人才的努力。现在，人工智能的进步将重塑每个行业几乎所有工作所需的技能组合。</p><p>所有这些变化使人力资源成为高管对话的中心，雇主对如何发现、培养和发展人才有了不同的思考。很快，技能就开始主导对话。从 2021 年 10 月到 2022 年 10 月，LinkedIn 网络平台上提及技能优先相关主题的帖子平均数量大约增加了一倍。雇主正在努力将技能置于其人才战略的中心——从招聘到晋升——这一点可以证明<a href="http://www.oneten.org/">OneTen</a>和<a href="https://www.businessroundtable.org/workforceskills">商业圆桌会议</a>等团体。由于许多商界普遍谈论可能出现的经济衰退，一个关键问题悬而未决：雇主如何保持对技能优先方法不断增长的投资，以最大限度地提高工人和企业的投资回报？</p><p></p><p> LinkedIn 的新数据为加倍努力以技能为先提供了令人信服的案例。 《 <a href="https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report">2023 年工作场所学习报告》</a>显示，Z 世代和千禧一代员工最有可能重视职业发展和技能建设的机会，甚至超过了工作与生活的平衡。调查结果还显示，内部流动性已成为最高管理层领导者的第二大劳动力优先事项，学习与发展 (L&amp;D) 领导者表示与高管的合作比以往任何时候都更加密切。</p><p>随着最年轻的员工要求技能驱动的职业道路和高管的关注，未能维持对技能优先人才战略投资的企业将被抛在后面。然而，在经济放缓期间，人们有一种倾向，即退缩并恢复到旧的、可预测的模式和策略。从本质上讲，企业的生存本能迫使许多人选择停滞而不是创新。在 2008 年经济大衰退期间，以前要求教育程度较低的工作坚持要求大学学位的做法（即所谓的<a href="https://www.hbs.edu/managing-the-future-of-work/Documents/dismissed-by-degrees.pdf">学位膨胀</a>）加速了。这种倒退通过增加招聘成本和流动率直接损害了企业的利润，同时加剧了少数人受益而多数人失去机会的经济格局。</p><p></p><h3>扩大多元化人才的机会</h3><p>如今，即使经济前景仍然不确定，企业领导者有机会以不同的方式做事，而且他们在扩大技能优先战略方面处于更有利的地位。无论您仍在努力吸引人才，还是您的招聘已显着降温，都有一些方法可以将技能优先的方法嵌入到您业务的各个方面，即使在经济放缓期间，也可以推动更强劲的长期成果。</p><p>寻找人员来填补空缺职位过去是一个繁琐的手动过程。如果没有复杂的方法来根据实际技能寻找和培养人才，大学学位就成为雇主用来验证候选人是否具备某些技能和能力的少数生硬工具之一，但它却将<a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat07.htm">大多数美国人排除在外。劳动力</a>，尤其是有色人种工人。</p><p>如今，我们可以使用比以往更多的数据来准确确定我们所需的技能，然后找到拥有这些技能的人员（无论是内部人员还是外部人员）。 <a href="https://economicgraph.linkedin.com/research/skills-first-report">LinkedIn 的数据</a>显示，接受这种转变并注重技能的组织可以看到巨大的影响：LinkedIn 上采取技能优先方法的组织可以将其人才管道扩大近 10 倍。雇主已经开始意识到这一点：LinkedIn 上超过 45% 的企业现在<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/skills-new-currency-ryan-roslansky/">明确使用技能数据</a>来填补空缺职位。</p><p></p><p>为了建立未来所需的多元化、高职能团队，雇主必须关注技能——这种方法对人才管道多元化也产生巨大影响。当雇主要求某职位拥有大学学位时，他们会自动排除 60% 的美国人，其中包括 76% 的非裔美国人和 83% 的拉美裔美国人。</p><p>从职位描述中删除不必要的学位要求是基于技能的人才获取的基础，但这还不够。人才招聘领导者还必须投资扩大采购渠道并修改招聘材料中的语言，以确保其包容性和吸引力。此外，面试问题和招聘流程应以第一天的职位所需的基本技能为基础，而不仅仅是证书或经验，并且应有意且公平地制定这些技能，以揭示这些技能。</p><h3>投资于学习和内部流动</h3><p>虽然聘用具备合适技能的新员工是技能投资的一种方式，但我们有机会重新关注支持现有员工的成长和发展，尤其是在招聘降温的行业。 LinkedIn 工作场所学习报告的最新调查结果表明，鉴于有效地将人才重新部署到优先业务领域的紧迫性再次凸显，2023 年可能成为扩大技能提升和内部流动计划的重要一年。事实上，调查结果显示，预算预测依然强劲，41% 的 L&amp;D 领导者预计今年的消费能力更强，只有 8% 的人预计预算会减少。</p><p>现在为员工投资技能和基于技能的职业道路可以带来回报。 LinkedIn 的调查结果显示，公司在三年内<a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/global-talent-trends">学习了工作技能的</a>员工保留率提高了近 7%。根据工作场所学习报告，在两年内进行过内部调动的员工有 75% 的可能性留在公司，而角色没有改变的员工有 56% 的可能性继续留在公司。</p><p>与技能优先的招聘类似，技能优先的人才管理要求公司对现有流程进行一系列补充性改变并投资新流程。推动技能优先的内部流动性的关键一步是定义特定角色所需和首选的技能以及跨角色的技能如何重叠。从那里，领导者可以帮助他们的团队建立稳健的职业道路，使员工能够通过培养和应用与其目标相符的技能来实现职业发展。最后，整个企业——更重要的是直接与员工——就可用的职业道路和获得这些职业道路所需的技能进行沟通和透明度，对于提高保留率和晋升率至关重要。</p><p>虽然技能提升和再技能计划的势头正在增强，但显然需要加快进展。 LinkedIn的调查结果显示，40%的公司仍处于早期阶段，向利益相关者出售他们的项目并组建他们的团队； 54% 处于中期阶段，正在开发和启动项目；只有 2% 的人表示他们已经完成了一个项目。百分之四的人根本没有开始。</p><p></p><p>除了运营变革之外，培育包容性、以学习为导向的文化也是公司正在做出的核心转变。 Through work with leading employer clients, Grads of Life has learned that it takes more than financial investments in L&amp;D to ensure that employees from underrepresented populations stay and grow within a company. The organization&#39;s research reveals <a href="https://gradsoflife.org/equity-career-advancement-insights-from-underrepresented-employees/">disparities in both pay and promotions</a> for Black talent compared with their White counterparts. It is critical that, alongside operational changes, organizations also invest in change management and remove bias from pay and promotion systems to strengthen organizational culture. Taking a skills-based approach to hiring and retention is a significant departure from the status quo for most employers, and the implementation teams faced with putting it into practice will need guidance, training, and support to be successful.</p><p></p><p></p><p> Amid a cloudy economic forecast, CEOs are engaged in a careful balancing act between where to pull back and where to double down. Investing in skills-first approaches to bring on great people and grow the great people they already have will not just help them weather a current storm. Making skills core to your company&#39;s strategy will set your workforce up for long-term resilience in a world where all of our jobs keep changing.</p><p> Data from LinkedIn shows that skill sets for <a href="https://linkedin.github.io/future-of-skills/#explore">jobs have changed</a> by about 25% since 2015, and that percentage is on pace to double by 2027 — which means the core skills required for a job today look very different from the same job just a few years ago. And today, the new era of AI we are about to enter could accelerate this change even further, with 82% of leaders acknowledging that their employees will need new skills for a new way of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/will-ai-fix-work">working with artificial intelligence</a> .</p><p> It&#39;s now, when the seas are choppy, that the corporate leaders set to succeed in this new world of work will show how it can be done. Now is not the time to wait around for better conditions to make a change. There has never been a better time for businesses to update their thinking and rise to the challenge by focusing on a skills-based workforce.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/focus-on-skills-to-grow-your-workforce/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Social Science of AI: Intel&#39;s Elizabeth Anne Watkins</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/the-social-science-of-ai-intels-elizabeth-anne-watkins/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/the-social-science-of-ai-intels-elizabeth-anne-watkins/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 20 Jun 2023 11:00:48 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. <p>Sam Ransbotham ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ransbotham">@ransbotham</a> ) is a professor in the information systems department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College, as well as guest editor for <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> &#39;s Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy Big Ideas initiative.

Each episode, we introduce you to someone innovating with AI. I&#39;m Sam Ransbotham, professor of analytics at Boston College. I&#39;m also the AI and business strategy guest editor at <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> .</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And I&#39;m Shervin Khodabandeh, senior partner with BCG and one of the leaders of our AI business. Together, <cite>MIT SMR</cite> and BCG have been researching and publishing on AI since 2017, interviewing hundreds of practitioners and surveying thousands of companies on what it takes to build and to deploy and scale AI capabilities and really transform the way organizations operate.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Welcome. Today we&#39;ve got a great guest: Elizabeth Anne Watkins, a research scientist at Intel. Elizabeth, thanks for joining us today. Let&#39;s get started.</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Thank you so much for having me today.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> As the world&#39;s largest semiconductor manufacturer, Intel is probably a company that most people already know, but can you tell us about Intel Labs in general and maybe your role specifically?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Just like you said, we&#39;re not always top of mind in the big discussions around AI and the AI industry and the AI field right now, but there is so much fascinating work happening inside Intel, and we have such a unique perspective on the field and a unique way of entering that field that I&#39;m really excited to bring some of that to light today in our conversation.</p><p> I just joined Intel in August of last year, and already it&#39;s been a really incredible experience meeting so many different teams. I joined Intel as a research scientist in the social science of artificial intelligence and work under Lama Nachman in Intel Labs. The group is called Intelligent Systems Research.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Elizabeth, you mentioned Intel Labs is doing some unique things with AI. Do you mind sharing with us some of the things you&#39;re working on?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> A project that I&#39;m particularly excited about is called MARIE, an acronym which stands for Multimodal Activity Recognition in Industrial Environments. So basically, I&#39;m going to start with a metaphor: Imagine that your computer could watch you put together, say, a piece of furniture that you ordered on the internet. When you got to a tough part of the manual, or you&#39;re holding a screwdriver, you&#39;re holding a piece of plywood, and you can&#39;t get back to the manual, imagine that your computer could see what you were doing, knew what the manual was going to tell you to [do], and then help you to connect those two. Imagine that your computer could actually tell you, “Hey, I think you are about to screw shelf A into bracket B,” or something of that nature. And I know that every time I have received that flat pack that they say has an armchair in it, it&#39;s a really tough time for me to get from A to B.</p><p> And it&#39;s processes like these that our people are doing inside of our facilities, where they&#39;re actually building and manufacturing the semiconductor chips. So the folks who work inside of our factories, our technicians, are doing very involved and very delicate work, handling parts and tools for all kinds of manual operations happening on the factory floor. And so all of the work that they&#39;re doing is just as complicated — sometimes even more complicated — than getting that flat pack into an armchair. There&#39;s a lot of tools involved. There are all kinds of different processes, different pieces of equipment, different sizes of equipment. And so we are building computer systems a little bit like the one that I described that said, “Hey, did you mean to put screw A into bracket B?” We&#39;re building systems to help the people inside of our factories do this kind of really careful and really complicated work.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Actually, that&#39;s a fun analogy. I mean, I think we all find flat packs challenging, perhaps, though I have to admit I kind of enjoy them. But I&#39;m sure it&#39;s much more complicated within Intel. And what I liked about that example is, I feel like so often we&#39;re talking about automation: Can we get machines to learn how to do something that humans do? That&#39;s machine learning [ML] at its core. And then we talk about augmentation and, well, how can machines help humans make a decision? This strikes me as a little bit different. This is going the next step.</p><p> So in this case, we&#39;re not trying to get the machine to assemble the flat pack. We&#39;re not trying to get the machine to assemble the semiconductor. It&#39;s still the humans doing it. And so it&#39;s the humans who are needing to learn here. That seems like pushing that a little bit further than we&#39;ve talked [about] before.</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> I&#39;m so glad you picked up on that, Sam. That&#39;s exactly what we talk about inside Intel Labs, is that the human is the expert. The human is the one who knows how to interact with these systems, and they know how to screw the bits together. And they know all of the physical and dynamic intricacies of what it takes to put these tiny and very delicate components together.</p><p> We don&#39;t want to train a computer to do that. A computer <em>cannot</em> do that. The way that this both assembly and cleaning process — because, of course, all of these processes take place within these super-clean rooms, where everyone has to wear hazmat suits and gloves … we want to support the humans who are doing it. There is no computer who could do this. It takes human judgment; it takes human expertise to do these processes in a way that is comprehensive and truly dynamic and can respond to new pressures.</p><p> If a larger piece of a machine bends in a particular way, or if a screw falls into a hole in a particular way — it&#39;s going to be many, many years before computers are able to assess and diagnose and fix these kinds of constant dynamic problems. But you know who&#39;s really good at doing that is humans. And so we&#39;re trying to center humans and center human expertise. And that points to this dual reason that I&#39;m really excited about MARIE, is that there&#39;s both a tech side and there&#39;s a human side. And on the tech side, I think MARIE is really exciting because it&#39;s multimodal. It combines a lot of different kinds of AI systems through ambient sensing. It combines computer vision, which uses activity recognition, with audio sensing, combined with natural language processing [NLP] in a way that can help build an ambient environment around the technician, ultimately to help them [with] what they do.</p><p> But before the system can help them [with] what they do, the system has to actually learn, and it&#39;s the human experts that are teaching the system how to learn and teaching the system what it needs to know. And so this is, as far as I know, a brand-new way to deploy AI systems into new domains and apply them to new problems. … We are confronting and tackling one of the big challenges of AI development, which is data collection.</p><p> You need a lot of data to get into a new domain. You need a lot of data that&#39;s labeled the appropriate way, labeled according to the kinds of problems that you&#39;re trying to solve. And so we&#39;ve kind of flipped the script: Instead of trying to get all the data we can <em>before</em> a system is deployed, we go ahead and deploy a system that then works in partnership with the experts on the ground, and they teach the system — through speaking aloud and through dynamic data labeling — they teach the system what it needs to know. And so, hopefully, the data that is going to be used to help people to do these tasks down the line is going to be produced by the very first batches of people who are using the tool.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That seems like a great analogy because as you&#39;re saying that, it reminded me of what you would do if it was a new human partner joining the project. You&#39;d go through those same steps.</p><p> Shervin and I have some research where we find that <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/achieving-individual-and-organizational-value-with-ai/">60% of the people out there are thinking of AI as a coworker</a> , and that&#39;s exactly the sort of relationship that you&#39;re describing. But it made me think of a little danger here. Let&#39;s say that when you put that system out there, it doesn&#39;t know much, and you&#39;ve got the human training them. All right; I&#39;m a human. I feel like I&#39;m a little bit annoyed. I&#39;m like, “Why am I having to work so hard to train this coworker?” How do you keep that dynamic? You mentioned there being a technical side of this project, but the social side as well. That strikes me as maybe harder on the social side than on the technical side.</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> That&#39;s precisely what I want to talk about next because that&#39;s precisely what I get to do. I get to talk to the people about what they actually think about these systems — and you are right on the money. Sometimes they do perceive it to be annoying, where they&#39;re asking, “Wait — so I&#39;m putting together this really complex instrument, and the system asks me what I&#39;m doing, and it&#39;s <em>wrong</em> ? So how am I supposed to spend time not only doing my job but also teaching this machine how to do my job?”</p><p> And so I am really gratified that I get to be the social scientist who is there right on the ground. We&#39;re still deep in development, and it&#39;s common for companies to do as much testing as they can, of course, before something is deployed and then, when the actual tenets of deployment come — things such as user experience and user interface designs — those typically come closer to the end of a development process. But here, the social science and the understanding of what people need and what people might find annoying and what they need to trust a machine that is a coworker with them is right in the DNA of the development. And so I get to consistently speak with the technicians that we are building the system for and ask them questions just like the one that you described, asking them, “Do you think this is annoying? How might this be more helpful? What are some other affordances that we can build into the system to make it more helpful for you?”</p><p> And also asking deeper questions, not just about their dyadic relationship with the system but also about their larger sociotechnical context of work. Asking about, like, “What does your schedule look like?” and, “What have your bosses said about the system?” and, “Is there a way that we could try to facilitate more productive relationships, not just with your bosses but also with your other coworkers, through this system?” And so our goal is to build a very deep understanding, not just of one task but an entire space of work, and ask how our system can help in the best way it can to amplify human potential by being a coworker for humans within this space, but also [asking], “How can it be built with an understanding of their work context in order to facilitate a long-term relationship?”</p><p> Because one of these things that&#39;s demanded by the fact that we&#39;re leaning on people to provide data and leaning on people to help us actually do the data labeling is that we need them to be engaged, and we need them to like interacting with the system, and we need them to find it trustworthy and reliable and useful. And understanding how all those goals can be achieved requires a deep understanding of social context and social habits and work habits and task flows. And so that&#39;s precisely what we&#39;re working on now.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I think it&#39;s really interesting how you seem to be thinking beyond just this project. There&#39;s the element of “OK, how do I get this particular project in place,” but underlying a lot of things you&#39;re talking about are things like, “How do we figure out the best way to introduce, essentially, a new system? How do we figure out the best way for how to transform and get to our overall vision?” And that transcends just a single project. How are you trying to pick up on those lessons?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> That is a really great question. I am really proud of our labs and some of the big bets that we&#39;re making on human-AI collaboration and how much the input and contributions and insights drawn from social science are being picked up, and have been picked up historically at Intel, throughout their research projects. As we&#39;re doing research projects and building products across verticals like education and manufacturing and accessibility, there&#39;s deep investment across the teams that facilitates and encourages conversations with folks like me — with the social scientists.</p><p> We often get these really fantastic teams in a room where we have engineers and data scientists and policy makers and social scientists, including not just me but a wonderful team — headed up by Dawn Nafus — of anthropologists, as well as another team of social scientists that has psychologists. And we all work together really closely to ensure that the products we build are not just designs to answer one problem but that they&#39;re properly engineered around what the best solution is, that we take advantage of all the different kinds of multimodal affordances that our tools can provide, and that we&#39;re deeply understanding of the social and organizational context that all of our products are going to be deployed into.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I think so often there&#39;s a transition that seems to be happening between when we were first talking about these models and tools and using data: Things were very heavily data- and tool-oriented and very heavily science-oriented. And that made a lot of sense because we didn&#39;t know how to do some of these things. And now, as a society, we&#39;re learning how to do many of these tools and model buildings. But a lot of the team you mentioned there — anthropology, psychology — these are not traditional things that we might have thought of [as] being integral to producing an AI application, but those are the ones you happened to mention. Why did you pick those? I guess that&#39;s some of your background in social science, right?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Yeah, throughout my graduate studies and postdoc work, I was always really invested in the users and in people. And I was always really fascinated by just how weird people can be and how creative and how innovative, and how folks often use technologies in ways that their developers did not anticipate and did not foresee.</p><p> And while there are some dangerous elements to that, as we&#39;ve seen in various misuse and dual-use applications, there are also a lot of really fantastic and wonderful ways that people have figured out for technology to be more suited to them in their context or to work a little bit more smoothly for them. And so seeing how Intel was different because of their history of being a semiconductor manufacturer and being deeply invested in hardware and having an ecosystem approach to the way that AI tools are deployed really showed me that they were a company that cared, just like I did, about the people who were going to be using these tools and the social structures in which these people were embedded, and building tools that could match not just the people who bought or used the tools but also the lives and the communities into which these technologies were going to be interjected.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Elizabeth, clearly a lot of your background has been coming through as we&#39;ve been talking, but could we step back for a second and ask you about how you ended up in this role at Intel Labs?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> I guess my road to this role started way back, probably at the beginning of my graduate career. After I graduated MIT and started my Ph.D. at Columbia, there was an opening for someone to contribute to a project on security and privacy behaviors among journalists. And my adviser said, “Hey, I got you an interview for this project.” And I said, “I don&#39;t know anything about security and privacy.” And she said, “Just go to the interview. I got you the interview. Just go.” And so the night before the interview, I thought, “Oh, I&#39;d better have something to talk about. PGP — Pretty Good Privacy — everyone&#39;s talking about PGP. I better download PGP so I can act like I know what PGP is.” And I tried to figure it out, and it was hard. I couldn&#39;t figure out … I went to the website and I was like, “The website doesn&#39;t really explain what&#39;s happening here. Where&#39;s the key? I download the key, but the key&#39;s also kept in a database, but I write the key on my emails? Oh, I&#39;m so … I can&#39;t do this. I&#39;m so bad at this. This is not for me.”</p><p> And I went into the interview the next day with the wonderful project lead, Susan McGregor, and I said, “You know what? This job&#39;s not for me. I tried to do PGP; it&#39;s weirdly hard. There&#39;s something about it that I just … I can&#39;t quite grok the language.” And she said, “I think that makes you perfect for this job because we are trying to figure out why security and privacy are so hard for people at work, especially journalists who are high-value targets for attack from a lot of different actors, and we are trying to figure out how we can make security and privacy protocols better for them, so it sounds like you&#39;re frustrated with how security is designed.” And I said, “Yeah, that was frustrating.” And she said, “OK, let&#39;s do some work.”</p><p> So we ended up working together for several years studying journalists. We had one particularly harrowing project studying the journalists who published the Panama Papers. And for that, they had terabytes of data. There were journalists working all over the world; none of them were colocated, and they didn&#39;t have a single breach. Never once did they have a breach and in all of that data. And so we saw that as a success story. And we said, “OK. We&#39;re always hearing the bad stories about breaches and attacks; we never hear the success stories.” And so we got to interview the journalists who contributed to the Panama Papers and talked to them about their organizational culture and how making protocols uniform across all journalists helped to instill a sense of teamwork and a sense that they were protecting each other. And seeing the power of culture and shared mission on behaviors around something as difficult as PGP and security protocols … it was really inspirational.</p><p> And around that time, I started paying attention to facial recognition, and from there it was a short bridge over to looking at AI and asking similar questions around “Why is this hard to understand? How can we communicate it to people in a more strategic way that is more understanding of the work that they&#39;re doing and the work that they need to do? And how can we bring some transparency to these systems in a way that is meaningful and understandable for real people?”</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> One of the things interesting about that is, security&#39;s always like that. If it&#39;s a little bit hard to do, then we all tend to not do it, because it&#39;s tomorrow&#39;s problem versus today&#39;s problem. … That&#39;s something we as humans are terrible about. And you know, I think what we&#39;ve failed [at] in many ways here is not building that into the infrastructure so it&#39;s a default. And there&#39;s a lot of analogies for artificial intelligence: We&#39;re building things, and if we don&#39;t make the defaults easy to use or easy to do the right thing, then people will do the wrong thing — or people will do the easy thing or the short-term thing. And you mentioned facial recognition: What are the kinds of things that we should be building into our infrastructure so we don&#39;t propagate AI-based mistakes?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> That&#39;s a great question. Something that drives my research, both throughout my graduate career and here at Intel, is a recognition that people are the experts in their own lives and that we really need to engage with the people and with the users throughout the development pipeline in order to build not just systems but solutions, and solutions for the real problems that are happening on the ground. And as close as a company can get to including the expertise of social science and what social scientists can bring about rigorous and robust tools to study how people live and the kinds of languages they use and the kinds of values they have and what&#39;s truly important to them and what they want to protect and what they want to keep safe, as well as building in different kinds of options and different kinds of pathways into the same technology that might be used differently by people of different levels of accessibility, are all things that I would love to see the entire field take up.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That <em>sounds</em> good. I mean … much like buying low and selling high sounds great. How do companies actually do this? What steps do they need to take to make progress on these?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> That&#39;s a great question. The way that we&#39;re doing it at Intel is that we are facilitating conversations between our technical teams — people who are building really amazing systems around robotics and accessibility tools and educational tools — and embedding social scientists across all these teams so that we can ask some questions around “Hey, what are the presumptions of this system? Have you talked to teachers? Have you talked to the folks who are going to be using this robot on the ground? What are your conversations like with the people who are going to be served by these solutions?”</p><p> And I&#39;m really lucky that I get to be in a place where we&#39;re embedding this expertise way back into the problem-formulation stage and into the project-formulation stage, all throughout the development pipeline. I&#39;ve also been really gratified that Intel established the ethical impact assessment process along with the Responsible AI [Advisory] Council. And so this is a process for robustly and rigorously building into the development pipeline that teams all across Intel and across all business units [use]. This is a way to inject the expertise, not just of social scientists but everyone who sits on the Responsible AI [Advisory] Council, including engineers and policy makers and folks from legal and folks from standards, and facilitate conversations with this multidisciplinary Responsible AI [Advisory] Council with development teams through their submission of the ethical impact assessment.</p><p> And the ethical impact assessment is a way for us to put values into practice and ensure that values around human oversights and human rights and privacy and safety and security and diversity and inclusion — these are ways for us to make sure that those values are built into the tools that Intel BUs [business units] are putting together across the organization.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> OK, we have a segment where we ask our guests a series of five rapid-fire questions. Just answer the first thing that comes to your mind. First: What is your proudest AI moment?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Oh, goodness. That&#39;s a great question. I am really proud of being able to represent the voices of the technicians who we have on the floor to these teams of engineers and data scientists who are building these systems. And because of the process that Intel has built, where I get to sit with the engineering teams who are building the computer vision and the action recognition and the NLP and choosing the phrases in the semantic frames around tasks and about how tasks are built and how they can be recognized, being able to do the interviews that I do with technicians to ask them about their concerns when this technology is introduced, what we can do to make sure that their concerns are addressed, asking what they need to know around transparency, what they need in order to trust the system, all in the service of enhancing the work that people are doing.</p><p> The fact that I get to grab that information and deliver it consistently to the engineers and to see how quickly they respond. Like, “Oh, well, we can build this and we can build that. And what if we built this into the UI? And what if we built this into the dialog?” It&#39;s such an incredibly compelling process, especially after coming from academia, where I would write a paper and then it would take a year to get published. And then …</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Oh, a year sounds fast.</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Right. If I were lucky, it would take a year. I think my longest record was maybe 3½ years it took to get published.我不知道。 What&#39;s your record?</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Uh, 10. So …</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Ten!</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Yeah. Let&#39;s don&#39;t talk about it though, because I&#39;ll get all sad.</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Oh, no.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So you mentioned concerns that people have. What worries you about artificial intelligence?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Well, one of their biggest concerns, when I started talking to the technicians, was that they were going to get replaced.</p><p> I said, “OK, let&#39;s have a conversation. What do you think this is for?” And they said, “I&#39;ve seen the news. I know you&#39;re trying to build a robot just to do exactly what I do, so I figure I&#39;m training my replacement.” And I thought, “Oh, no! That&#39;s terrible.” And I got to have a lot of conversations with our technicians where I got to say, “That&#39;s <em>not</em> what we&#39;re doing. We are not trying to replace you. You are the expert. We need you. In fact, we need you to teach the system so that the system can go and help other people like you. So by you training the system, you&#39;re actually helping a lot of other folks in Intel fabs [semiconductor manufacturing plants] across the planet, and you are ensuring that they get help in the way that you would like to get help.”</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Some research that Shervin and I were involved in a couple years ago focused entirely on this <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/expanding-ais-impact-with-organizational-learning">organizational learning</a> aspect that you were alluding to — that this is a way for everyone to learn more quickly and to spread knowledge.</p><p> What&#39;s your favorite activity that does not involve technology? What&#39;s <em>not</em> AI going on in your world?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Well, there&#39;s so much happening recently, it seems tough sometimes to figure out what&#39;s AI and what&#39;s not.</p><p> [In] my personal life, I do a lot of baking. It&#39;s been a while since I made a loaf of bread. I do a lot of cooking. I am very lucky to live with my husband in the city of New York, and so we do a lot of exploring — in fact, just getting outside. That&#39;s probably the biggest non-AI activity, is walking outside on our own two feet and looking around with our own eyes. And that always feels very refreshing.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What&#39;s the first career you wanted when you were young? What did you want to be when you grew up?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> I wanted to be an artist, and it has been a topsy-turvy winding road. I did my undergrad at UC Irvine, and I studied video art.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What&#39;s your greatest wish for AI in the future?</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> There&#39;s so much that AI can do that humans cannot, but there&#39;s also so much that humans can do that AI cannot. And I think a big challenge, at least for me, and I hope the people with whom I work going forward for the next few years, is going to be figuring out exactly what that balance is and how can we systematize “What do people really need help with that AI systems can do?” but with a really thorough understanding of what it is that people do and how they do it.</p><p> Now that the AI systems are becoming so advanced, but oftentimes in a lab or in a vacuum, as they mature into the real world, I think it&#39;s really exciting what they can do, but we&#39;re facing a lot of work in getting them there. And I think it&#39;s going to be other social scientists and multidisciplinary teams like the ones that we have at Intel all working together to make sure that these systems can really be deployed as solutions.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That&#39;s a good cap for the episode. Thanks for talking to us. I think one of the things that has come through [is], you&#39;re talking about projects and things you&#39;re working on, but you&#39;re also giving us a hint about what&#39;s going to happen in the future as we move off of the, let&#39;s say, tool-focused “Can we get the ML right? Can we get the model right? Can we get the data right?” You&#39;re talking a lot about what happens next, what happens once we check off some of those check marks — what are those checks? And I think a lot of people can learn from that. Thanks for taking the time to talk with us today.</p><p> <strong>Elizabeth Anne Watkins:</strong> Oh my gosh, it&#39;s been such a pleasure.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Thanks for listening. Next time, Shervin and I speak with David Hardoon from Aboitiz Data Innovation. We&#39;re once again talking about chemical engineering, so you won&#39;t want to miss this one.</p><p> <strong>Allison Ryder:</strong> Thanks for listening to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> .

It&#39;s an obvious concern because generative AI can create the types of outputs that the industry uses — text (in the form of stories, scripts, ad copy, and reviews), marketing campaigns, and moving and static images. Segments of the industry are facing economic pressures, which increases the demand for productivity and less-expensive “product.” And a high percentage of current entertainment is derivative of past content, which makes it well suited for generative technologies that are trained on … past content.</p><p> It&#39;s still early days for generative AI-created entertainment, but it&#39;s clear that something big is happening. A recent <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-chatgpt-hollywood-intellectual-property-spongebob-81fd5d15"><cite>Wall Street Journal</cite> article</a> noted that widely available AI tools can suggest storylines, character arcs, and dialogue; it even includes an interactive module that lets readers see for themselves how easily ChatGPT can write a basic script when given a few prompts. The article also raises questions about image intellectual property: “If a user prompts an AI tool to build a new character influenced by say, SpongeBob, should the original creators have to grant permission? Who owns it? Can the new work itself be copyrighted?”</p><p></p><p> Generative AI was used in <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/05/05/runway-generative-ai-chatgpt-video">making the 2022 film <cite>Everything Everywhere All at Once</cite></a> , and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oscars-2023-everything-everywhere-all-at-once-most-awards/">we know how that turned out</a> . Tom recently wrote about the use of generative AI to create <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomdavenport/2023/03/13/cuebric-generative-ai-comes-to-hollywood/">movie and TV backdrop images</a> . There are already generative AI systems that can create videos, although they are short and relatively primitive. AI is being used to provide data-driven predictions about <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/democratizing-data-in-hollywood-jumpcuts-kartik-hosanagar/">how unusual storylines will land with viewers</a> .</p><p> So, what does this mean for the industry? There are many different components to this question, as a new <a href="https://variety.com/vip-special-reports/generative-ai-entertainment-a-special-report-1235564989/">report from Variety Intelligence Platform</a> suggests. In May, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) went on strike, primarily over film and TV writers&#39; <a href="https://time.com/6277158/writers-strike-ai-wga-screenwriting/">income from streaming services programming</a> , but it also demanded that production companies “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/29/business/media/writers-guild-hollywood-ai-chatgpt.html">regulate use of material produced using artificial intelligence</a> or similar technologies.” Because there are so many uncertainties about what will happen when and how with the technology, we spoke with two experts on the topic. Both are based in — not surprisingly — Los Angeles, and both are involved with centers at the University of Southern California (USC). However, they don&#39;t work together, and they have very different approaches to the technology.</p><p></p><h3> Resolutely Against Generative AI</h3><p> Jonathan Taplin is director emeritus at the <a href="https://www.annenberglab.com/">Annenberg Innovation Lab</a> at USC. He&#39;s had a long career in the entertainment industry and was previously a tour manager for musicians, including Bob Dylan and The Band. In addition, he&#39;s been a film producer, a banker, and a writer. His latest book, <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jonathan-taplin/the-end-of-reality/9781541703155/?lens=publicaffairs"><cite>The End of Reality: How Four Billionaires Are Selling a Fantasy Future of the Metaverse, Mars, and Crypto</cite></a> , will be released in September. As you might infer from the title, he&#39;s not a fan of how big tech firms&#39; generative AI tools are being developed or promulgated.</p><p> “The way they train their models is by ingesting everything on the internet, with no concern for copyright,” Taplin told us. “Google has a music-generation AI trained on every audio file on YouTube. You can issue a prompt like &#39;Write me a song that sounds like Taylor Swift, sad ending, up-tempo,&#39; and the resulting song sounds somewhat like her. Someone could include it in a video game or a bar scene in a movie for free.” Generative AI could do the same kind of repurposing with video content owned by the studios, he added.</p><p> Taplin&#39;s primary concern is that generative AI will replace some of the work done by human writers, artists, photographers, and other creative professionals in the arts and entertainment industry. He also believes that it will exacerbate problems that are already bringing the film and TV industry down. “The biggest problem in the movies is too many formulas. There is a lack of originality, and that&#39;s why the industry isn&#39;t performing,” he said. Generative AI, he added, is only capable of producing even more formulaic content and will make the predictability worse. “Entertainment relies on new ideas, and this technology can&#39;t produce them,” Taplin added.</p><p> He said he&#39;s concerned that generative AI will continue to reduce the number of performers who can make a living in their fields. The majority of entertainment revenue already goes to a very small percentage of artists. This is the <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2014/03/05/toponepercent/">reality for musicians</a> , especially on <a href="https://themusicnetwork.com/few-artists-generate-most-streams/">streaming services</a> , and is echoed in Hollywood in the huge <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/655480/all-time-top-grossing-actors-box-office/">box office revenues</a> generated by a handful of leading actors in blockbuster films. When you get an “algorithmic economy,” Taplin said, “the algorithms narrow the funnel, with outsize paychecks for a few.” He&#39;s hopeful that a collective licensing regime — similar to what&#39;s in place for music sampling — will emerge to protect artists when their content is used to train generative AI.</p><h3> Embracing Generative AI, With Some Concerns</h3><p> Yves Bergquist is director of the AI &amp; Neuroscience in Media Project at USC&#39;s <a href="https://www.etcenter.org/">Entertainment Technology Center</a> , which is funded by Hollywood studios. You can guess that his opinion of generative AI is probably much more favorable than Taplin&#39;s. It is, although he said he does have some concerns about AI&#39;s potential effects on the media and entertainment industry: “It&#39;s a completely revolutionary technology” characterized by misinformation and “some insanity.”</p><p> We asked Bergquist whether movie studios would embrace generative AI. Parts of them are already doing so, he said. “Some groups within the studios are highly technologically savvy, such as the chief technology officers and all of the visual effects artists and technicians. They are very sophisticated and are already working with generative AI companies. The studios do a lot of the postproduction work in films — particularly in animation — and there is a lot of pressure to bring costs down. The postproduction companies have a software development culture, so they will embrace generative AI.”</p><p> He also believes that many production companies will embrace the technology because they are already shooting on large LED-based screens and will need generative images for them. Bergquist said he expects that tools offering virtual actors and voice synthesis will be most aggressively adopted by short-form creators who distribute their work on TikTok or YouTube and by video game producers. “Streaming channels, digital ads, games — that&#39;s what kids watch these days,” he noted. “The media industry no longer has a monopoly on entertainment.” Makers of hardware (such as cameras) are experimenting with generative in-camera visual effects as well.</p><p></p><p> The business side of traditional movie studios is sometimes more reluctant to embrace AI, Bergquist observed, simply because they don&#39;t have the same kind of culture of data or software. “It&#39;s being bolted onto organizations and people who aren&#39;t ready,” he said. Even the new streaming studios, like Netflix and Prime Video, have experienced a lot of growing pains in their AI journeys.</p><p> Bergquist said that before the WGA strike started in May, many screenwriters told him that they view the likes of ChatGPT as a “great creative assistant tool” but not something that will replace human writers. “It&#39;s good at brainstorming ideas, but it will output only average content,” Bergquist asserted. “It&#39;s nowhere near capable of the symbolic abstraction necessary for script development, and it can&#39;t output a script with narrative structure and character arcs.” At least not now. Future language models with higher levels of intelligence and new paradigms for AI might be able to do so.</p><p></p><p> Bergquist thinks generative AI will have enormous effects not only on entertainment but also on education. He believes that schools, including the School of Cinematic Arts at USC, need to quickly ramp up their teaching to keep pace with the frenzy of new generative AI tools that are released nearly every week. Bergquist is preparing courses himself on the technology for the Society of Motion Pictures and Television Engineers, an organization that represents technologists in media.</p><h3> Are Both Experts Right?</h3><p> Although Taplin and Bergquist seem to have very different views on generative AI, they might both be right about its impacts. Economic pressures may entice the industry — at least some sectors of it — to embrace these new tools. Generative AI will lead to dramatic changes in production and postproduction, distribution, and intellectual property ownership. The technology may not be good for traditional artists and the companies that employ them, but it is likely to lead to significant changes in the industry over the next few years — hopefully some for the better along with some for the worse. Perhaps the only purely good news is that neither expert expects that humans will be entirely replaced anytime soon.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-impact-of-generative-ai-on-hollywood-and-entertainment/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Recapping Work/23: The Big Shift</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/recapping-work-23-the-big-shift/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/recapping-work-23-the-big-shift/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 15 Jun 2023 11:09:56 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[MIT SMR Editors. ]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Career Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Employee Development]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video]]></category><category><![CDATA[Webinars & Videos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Workplace Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Diversity & Inclusion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Organizational Behavior]]></category><category><![CDATA[Remote Work]]></category><category><![CDATA[Skills & Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Workplace, Teams, & Culture]]></category><description><![CDATA[Download the Event Summary Download (PDF) The pandemic irrevocably changed the how, why, and where of work.

Nalbantian outlined ways companies are tackling the obstacles women and people of color continue to face — obstacles that are often due to situational factors, such as the roles people are in or whom they report to.</p><h6 class="work23-timestamp"> Section time stamp: 1:02</h6><hr /><h4 class="work23-title" id="berwick"> The Why, What, and How of Skills-Based Talent Practices</h4><h5 class="work23-speaker"> Beth Berwick, Grads of Life</h5><p> More jobs than ever now require a four-year college degree, including many that never did in the past. But that criterion excludes 64% of the population — including 76% of Black Americans and 80% of Latinos. Berwick is among those calling for a retreat on the degree requirement. She explained how organizations can instead hire effectively based on the skills they need.</p><h6 class="work23-timestamp"> Section time stamp: 33:24</h6><hr /><h4 class="work23-title" id="smith"> The New World of Accessing Talent</h4><h5 class="work23-speaker"> Mike Smith, Randstad Enterprise; David Kiron, <cite>MIT SMR</cite></h5><p> Companies are changing how they approach and apply technology to find the people they need. <cite>MIT SMR</cite> &#39;s Kiron and our presenting partner&#39;s chief executive discussed the ways that innovative organizations are designing their own talent pools, building their talent brands, and expanding DEI initiatives beyond their own boundaries.</p><h6 class="work23-timestamp"> Section time stamp: 54:44</h6><hr /><h4 class="work23-title" id="dervin"> Flexible <em>and</em> Effective: Leadership Strategies for the Hybrid Workplace</h4><h5 class="work23-speaker"> Julie Dervin, Atlassian; Brian Elliott, Future Forum; N.

Tools that can help us solve complex and vexing problems can also be put to work by cybercriminals or give authoritarian governments unprecedented power to spy on and direct the lives of their citizens. We can build models that lead to the development of new, more sustainable materials or important new drugs — and we can build models that embed biased decision-making into systems and processes and then grind individuals up in their gears.</p><p></p><p> In other words, AI already gives us plenty to worry about. We shouldn&#39;t be distracted by dystopian fever dreams that misdirect our attention from present-day risk.</p><p> The recent emergence of ChatGPT and similar large language models into broader public awareness has heightened general interest in both the potential benefits and the dangers of AI. A few days before I wrote this, Geoffrey Hinton, a giant of the AI field whose work underlies much of the current technology, resigned from his position at Google, telling <cite>The New York Times</cite> that he wanted to speak freely about the risks of generative AI. “It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,” he told the newspaper.</p><p> And there, indeed, is where we should put our attention. Throughout human history, new technologies have been put to work to advance civilization, but they have also been weaponized by bad actors. The difference this time is that not only is the technology extremely complex and difficult for most people to understand — so too are the potential outcomes.</p><p> There&#39;s a steep learning curve that all of us must be prepared to climb if we want AI to do more good than harm. The excitement about possible uses for these tools must be tempered by good questions about how automated decisions are made, how AI systems are trained, and what assumptions and biases are thus baked in. Business leaders, especially, need to be as aware of reputational and material risks, and the potential for value destruction, as they are of opportunities to leverage AI.</p><p></p><p> And while AI development is likely to continue to proceed at a breakneck pace that no open letter can arrest, the rest of us ought to proceed deliberately and with caution. In “<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/dont-get-distracted-by-the-hype-around-generative-ai/">Don&#39;t Get Distracted by the Hype Around Generative AI</a> ,” Lee Vinsel reminds us that tech bubbles are accompanied by a lot of noise. We need to let go of the fear of missing out (FOMO) and take a measured, rational approach to evaluating emerging technologies.</p><p> Here at <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> , we will continue to support business leaders with the research and intelligence required for clear-headed decision-making and judicious experimentation. Our ongoing <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/big-ideas/responsible-ai/">focus on responsible AI practices</a> , led by guest editor Elizabeth Renieris of the University of Oxford, is a critical part of that commitment.</p><p> We&#39;re all stakeholders in the AI revolution.

Glaser, Omid Omidvar, and Mehdi Safavi</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> When algorithms aren&#39;t updated to account for changes in the environment, they deliver poor-quality predictions.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> AI models designed to dynamically account for new circumstances don&#39;t always do so effectively. This scenario, called <em>algorithmic inertia</em> , can result in poor guidance and flawed decisions. The authors explored the causes and consequences of algorithmic inertia by investigating credit-ratings agency Moody&#39;s and its use of algorithmic models to rate mortgage-backed securities in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. They found that the most significant contributing factors to algorithmic inertia are buried assumptions, superficial remodeling, simulation of the unknown future, and specialized compartmentalization. Exposing data and assumptions, and periodically redesigning algorithmic routines, are two key practices for heading off such inertia.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/predictive-models-can-lose-the-plot-heres-how-to-keep-them-on-track/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/risk-intelligence-and-the-resilient-company/" class="no-underline">Risk Intelligence and the Resilient Company</a></h4><h6> Ananya Sheth and Joseph V.

Risk intelligence — the honed ability to rigorously interpret risks and the consequences or opportunities they pose for a company — supports organizational resilience by helping leaders identify and manage a broad array of potential threats to their company&#39;s value exchange system, both over time and across changing business contexts. To strengthen their organization&#39;s risk intelligence, leaders should systematically categorize and interpret risk events, compartmentalize uncertainty and reduce its impact, and construct and contextualize an enterprise risk network.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/risk-intelligence-and-the-resilient-company/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-professional-services-firms-dodged-disruption/" class="no-underline">How Professional Services Firms Dodged Disruption</a></h4><h6> Julian Birkinshaw and David Lancefield</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Professional services firms with longevity hold lessons for other businesses trying to survive disruptions in turbulent markets.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> Big professional services firms appeared to be in the crosshairs of new, technology-fueled competitors a decade ago, but many have maintained or even bolstered their positions. These consulting giants, top-tier law firms, and others have found resilience in their capacity to diagnose the different causes of potential disruption and respond accordingly. They have doubled down on their traditional strengths of tackling clients&#39; most challenging problems and providing advice and compliance in high-impact, large-scale, high-risk situations — and charging a premium to do so. And they have learned to live with a pragmatic acknowledgment that their fundamentals are sound, tempered with a touch of paranoid suspicion of emerging technologies and competitors.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-professional-services-firms-dodged-disruption/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-missing-discipline-behind-failure-to-scale/" class="no-underline">The Missing Discipline Behind Failure to Scale</a></h4><h6> Andy Binns and Christine Griffin</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Developing a scaling path for new ventures is both an art and a science, but it&#39;s one that leaders can use to learn and iterate as they go.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> Companies make significant investments in developing new business initiatives, but too few follow a rigorous path to broadly implementing them. While 80% of companies claim to ideate and incubate new ventures, only 16% of companies successfully scale them. Scaling paths require a clarity of ambition equal to the scale of opportunity; a set of plausible strategic options for what assets will be needed to achieve that ambition; smart brainstorming about how to acquire those assets; an openness to bringing in new leaders to support the expanding scope of activities; and preparation for the inevitable high-stakes moments when decisions entail commitments that will be difficult, if not impossible, to reverse.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-missing-discipline-behind-failure-to-scale/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/helping-neurodivergent-employees-succeed/" class="no-underline">Helping Neurodivergent Employees Succeed</a></h4><h6> Emily R.

Bringing neurodiversity into the larger conversation about workplace diversity, equity, and inclusion is important not only because it&#39;s the fair thing to do but because neurodivergent individuals can make valuable contributions. Creating a neuroinclusive organization calls for specific training and development efforts that benefit neurodivergent employees and the wider workforce. Managers are key to the success of these programs and need to be educated about how to support their neurodivergent employees.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/helping-neurodivergent-employees-succeed/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-digitally-mature-is-your-finance-office" class="no-underline">How Digitally Mature Is Your Finance Office?</a></h4><h6> Kristof Stouthuysen</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Many finance offices are stuck in traditional operational roles and aren&#39;t benefiting from advanced analytics.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> Finance leaders in a wide range of industries are trying to integrate data and analytics to improve operations, but not all CFOs have cracked the code. In particular, many are not capitalizing on the promise of new machine learning applications. CFOs who are able to challenge an often conservative, cautious culture and manage to successfully deploy advanced analytics can deliver more real-time insights, reduce human error and bias, and speed up processes and decision-making. What&#39;s more, while more traditional finance leaders often guard the data they possess, those who embrace advanced analytics — what the author calls <em>digital finance leaders</em> — become strong advocates for democratizing data across a company&#39;s silos.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-digitally-mature-is-your-finance-office" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/cashing-out-excellence/" class="no-underline">Cashing Out Excellence</a></h4><h6> Robert D.

Nalbantian</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Understanding what factors drive employee promotion can help managers more equitably position women and people of color for advancement.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> New research shows that factors unrelated to employees&#39; knowledge, capabilities, or behavior have an outsize effect on career advancement. Circumstances such as reporting to a high performer, holding a career-accelerator role such as being a supervisor, and not taking advantage of flexible work options all play a leading role in promotions and pay increases. Disparities in performance ratings also have a cascading effect that adversely affects people of color: In the author&#39;s study, people of color in the majority of companies were up to 50% less likely to receive high performance ratings. Because ratings tend to persist, with a high rating one year predicting the likelihood of a high rating the next, getting shut out from the start can significantly impede career progression.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/opening-access-to-the-fast-track-for-career-equity/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-unequal-rewards-of-peer-support-at-work/" class="no-underline">The Unequal Rewards of Peer Support at Work</a></h4><h6> Nancy Baym and Constance Noonan Hadley</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Job satisfaction comes in part from how well people feel their organization recognizes and values the social support they provide to colleagues.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> Employees&#39; supportive behaviors with one another boost engagement and productivity, but research shows that men gain more benefits from such efforts than women do. Social support includes emotional assistance, esteem reinforcement, social companionship, information or advice, and instrumental help. In the authors&#39; study, more women than men focused their efforts on listening, showing personal interest, and complimenting a coworker, while men reported offering career advice more frequently. Although men said they provided less-frequent social support than women overall, they received higher levels of organizational encouragement, rewards, and job satisfaction. Managers can encourage a more equitable peer culture by making the invisible visible and valuable — providing clarity about which behaviors count while also revising performance management systems.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-unequal-rewards-of-peer-support-at-work/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/moving-beyond-islands-of-experimentation-to-ai-everywhere/" class="no-underline">Moving Beyond Islands of Experimentation to AI Everywhere</a></h4><h6> Amit Joshi, Ivy Buche, and Miguel Paredes Sadler</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> It may make sense to start AI efforts with isolated experiments, but new, companywide structures are needed to scale them and reap broader benefits.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> Artificial intelligence often takes root in isolated experiments within an organization, and many companies stall out on their AI journeys because of difficulty moving beyond these pilots. Scaling technology requires different types of formal structures: The authors found that AI projects generally begin as islands of experimentation before coming together around a corporate <em>center of excellence</em> . A small number then move to a sophisticated <em>federation of expertise</em> model built on a centralized base of knowledge, systems, processes, and tools, and on decentralized embedded capabilities. Enterprises with AI ambitions need to be prepared to make two structural leaps away from the startup stage if they are intent on delivering on the technology&#39;s potential.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/moving-beyond-islands-of-experimentation-to-ai-everywhere/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><hr /><h4> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/manage-your-workforce-ecosystem-not-just-your-employees/" class="no-underline">Manage Your Workforce Ecosystem, Not Just Your Employees</a></h4><h6> Elizabeth J. Altman, David Kiron, Jeff Schwartz, and Robin Jones</h6><p> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> New organizational structures are needed to coordinate workforce ecosystems that include a wide array of external workers and partners.</p><p> <strong>Top Takeaways:</strong> A majority of executives agree that the idea of “the workforce” is being redefined. They say it&#39;s broader than an organization&#39;s full-time employees, instead encompassing ecosystems of contractors, gig workers, service providers, and even technologies. These networks require innovative management practices, given that hierarchical, command-and-control leadership is ill suited for workforces that span internal and external boundaries. In developing new practices, leaders must address three types of issues: structural design (pertaining to the division of labor, goals, and incentives), politics (relating to resources, power, and status), and culture (affecting individuals&#39; search for identity and meaning). Intentionally orchestrating a perspective that considers all players leads to a more nuanced view of how organizations and their partners cooperate to meet their strategic goals.</p><p> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/manage-your-workforce-ecosystem-not-just-your-employees/" class="pan-series__series-read-more">Read the article</a></p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/our-guide-to-the-summer-2023-issue/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> How Professional Services Firms Dodged Disruption</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-professional-services-firms-dodged-disruption/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-professional-services-firms-dodged-disruption/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 13 Jun 2023 12:23:56 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Julian Birkinshaw and David Lancefield. <p>Julian Birkinshaw is a professor of strategy at London Business School, where he also serves as vice dean.

In 2015, Richard and Daniel Susskind foresaw that technology would cause a “steady decline in the need for traditional flesh-and-blood professionals,” while more recently, CB Insights said that “a tectonic disruption is hitting management consulting.” <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> Even earlier, Clayton Christensen and colleagues warned, “Although we cannot forecast the exact progress of disruption in the consulting industry, we can say with utter confidence that whatever its pace, some incumbents will be caught by surprise.” <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a></p><p> But things have not played out as predicted. In consulting and law, the established firms are as influential and profitable as ever. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> Many potential disrupters have come along. Some have failed, some have gained strong niche positions, but none has challenged — let alone toppled — the existing order. Most established leaders have used a wide range of strategies and tactics to adapt quickly to the threats.</p><p></p><p> As is the case in many well-established industries, professional services markets are dominated by a small, clearly identifiable group at the top and large numbers of lower-tier firms operating in their shadow. Consulting&#39;s giants include McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group, and Bain; technology-based firms Accenture and Capgemini; and the Big Four accounting firms Ernst &amp; Young, Deloitte, KPMG, and PwC. In law, the top tier includes the five London-based firms informally known as the Magic Circle — Linklaters, Clifford Chance, Freshfields, Allen &amp; Overy, and Slaughter and May — along with Kirkland &amp; Ellis, Latham &amp; Watkins, and DLA Piper.</p><p> How have these firms been so resilient? Our research, which included interviews with 25 executives and a review of case studies on a dozen would-be disrupters, revealed many factors at work. The one that distinguishes the most effective firms is their capacity to diagnose potential causes of disruption and respond accordingly.</p><p> We define <em>industry disruption</em> as an upending of the established order, with incumbents losing out to new competitors. As Joshua Gans has argued, disruption can occur when incumbent firms have blind spots about what customers want (a demand-side effect) or when a new technology makes the incumbents&#39; existing capabilities obsolete (a supply-side effect) — or a combination of the two. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> (See “Four Types of Potential Threat in Consulting and Law.”)</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Four Types of Potential Threat in Consulting and Law</h4><p class="caption"> Professional services firms face threats on both the demand and supply sides.</p><p class="caption"> Supply-side disruption increases as the capabilities delivered by the incumbent decrease in value to the customer. Demand-side disruption grows along with increased changes in customer behavior. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MAG_Birkinshaw-Figure.png" alt="Four Types of Potential Threat in Consulting and Law" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p> Because each scenario requires its own response, understanding the dynamics of supply- and demand-side effects can enable executives in any sector to more readily identify potential disrupters and keep them at bay. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a></p><h3> Demand- and Supply-Side Threats</h3><p> Based on our research, we identified artificial intelligence technology as the biggest supply-side risk, threatening to take over work that professionals have traditionally seen as their own. On the demand side, the threat comes from clients seeking greater control over how they buy and use professional services. Still other would-be disrupters challenge incumbents from both the supply and demand sides at the same time. Meanwhile, new boutique and specialist firms have cropped up to serve particular client needs in lucrative business segments, though they have rarely been truly disruptive. Below, we look at each potential threat in detail.</p><p> <strong>AI undermines the business model.</strong> The launch of generative AI in November 2022 has accelerated the ongoing transformation of many aspects of professional services work, enabling greater accuracy and significant cost savings.</p><p> At law firms, AI tools scan legal documents and review contracts. AI-based services companies such as Kira Systems, Clio, Reveal-Brainspace, iManage, and Thomson Reuters provide assistance in discovery, due diligence, and contract management and review. Thomson Reuters&#39;s services are used by 97% of the largest law firms.</p><p> These companies don&#39;t position themselves as competitors to law firms, but as they scale and the technology gains capabilities, they can begin to undermine those firms&#39; business models. Clio&#39;s legal software, for example, can conduct e-discovery for a claim and even engage in litigation analysis by scanning precedent-setting cases, potentially reducing the number of billable hours that a firm can charge to clients.</p><p> In consulting, AI can help professional services firms provide additional value by uncovering new relationships, identifying patterns of customer behavior, and highlighting cost-saving opportunities. “It&#39;s no longer good enough to show up with a team that knows more about this industry than anybody else,” one Big Four consulting partner said. “You also need a data set or an algorithm that provides additional sources of value.”</p><p> But AI can also be a powerful disrupter. Palantir Technologies started out using AI to detect fraud and has since expanded to applying state-of-the-art machine learning to solve problems for a variety of government and private clients. Its work in support of government surveillance has drawn controversy, but its predictive analytics helped a large automotive supplier make large efficiency gains in its engineering and manufacturing functions. Such results represent a significant advance in the rigor and quality of insights consulting firms can offer.</p><p> Established firms have taken on the threat by building up their own AI capabilities through acquisitions and in-house development. McKinsey has acquired 12 mostly small AI firms since 2013, including UK-based QuantumBlack, which uses advanced data analytics to improve organizational performance. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a> In law, San Francisco-based DLA Piper has developed Aiscension, an AI product that monitors compliance risks. The insurance law firm Kennedys created its Kennedys IQ spinoff, which uses AI to assess medical evidence and recommend amounts for damages.</p><p> These acquisitions and partnerships deliver more than new capabilities; they can expand the range of issues their firms can handle for clients.</p><p> Incumbents are also enhancing their role as high-touch trusted advisers, which AI cannot replicate. Several large consulting firms have increased their range of offerings by investing in experience centers — physical and virtual environments where clients and consultants use design thinking and other creative techniques to envision possible futures. Over the past five years, IBM, Deloitte, Accenture, and other firms have bought more than 200 creative agencies to help develop these centers.</p><p> <strong>Clients take control: unbundling the service.</strong> The most profound demand-side threat is unbundling, as increasingly savvy clients look for ways to cut costs and exert greater influence over their relationships with services firms. This can mean reclaiming activities previously handled by outside firms or turning to specialists instead of the broad offering of a large professional firm. Both options can help clients build up their internal capabilities and gain greater accountability for business outcomes. But unbundling threatens the incumbent firms&#39; leverage model by taking away work that would typically be assigned to a lot of their junior — and lower-paid — generalists.</p><p> In law, the emergence of alternative legal service providers (ALSPs) is a testament to this demand-side threat. ALSPs aren&#39;t law firms as such, but they provide a vast array of legal services, such as document review or contract management, at a lower cost. In 2017, DXC Technology, a Virginia-based IT services firm, outsourced almost its entire legal function to UnitedLex, an ALSP based in Overland Park, Kansas. DXC transferred 150 in-house lawyers to UnitedLex, retaining only a small number of senior professionals. While outsourcing in-house legal departments is not uncommon, law firms saw this as a huge threat because it was the biggest transaction of its kind at the time and because it involved an ALSP, which can offer a much lower cost structure.</p><p> Consulting faces a similar challenge from the rise of consulting networks, such as London-based Eden McCallum, and from online platforms, such as New York-based Gerson Lehrman Group. These companies match clients with consultants on a project-by-project basis, bypassing the large firms. London-based Kubrick Group contracts with companies to provide teams of data scientists and technologists, who can later be hired by the client.</p><p> Such arrangements put the onus on the client to define its problems and integrate work teams — something traditionally handled by a large consulting firm. But they eliminate the need to hire a large firm except on the biggest and most complex projects. And without the incumbents&#39; higher overhead, fees are much lower.</p><p> Clients are also changing commercial arrangements, increasingly demanding outcome-based deals that require consultants to demonstrate that they were directly responsible for the desired results, such as a 5% reduction in costs. Because this can be harder to do with projects that involve factors outside the consultants&#39; influence, like growing revenue, most firms agree to outcome-based deals only when they can be confident of contributing to the desired result.</p><p> Incumbent firms are responding to these demand-side challenges in a couple of ways. Law firms have formed their own ALSPs; London-based Allen &amp; Overy created Peerpoint in 2013, a separate operation with 350 largely freelance lawyers and 53 million pounds ($64 million) in revenue. In consulting, Deloitte created a unit called Pixel that breaks down client problems into their constituent parts and then uses a crowdsourcing platform to find the right experts to work on each part.</p><p> The large firms are also doubling down on their traditional strengths: tackling clients&#39; biggest and most challenging problems. Their value comes from their ability to provide advice and compliance in high-impact, large-scale, high-risk situations, and they can charge a premium for the service. “We do open heart surgery rather than provide [general practitioner] services,” said one senior lawyer.</p><p> <strong>Boutiques and specialists find strength in market focus.</strong> New competitors emerge all the time in professional services, as former top partners set up their own boutiques or venture firms back new startups. The successful ones take market share in specific niches but rarely cause much concern to top-tier firms. They cause limited disruption on either the demand or supply side, and they simply reflect the heterogeneity and complexity of the market.</p><p> In consulting, London-based Baringa has grown quickly by focusing on the energy industry, identifying such hot topics as renewable energy and hiring specialists who use scenario modeling to project future energy prices. New York-based AlixPartners focuses on turnarounds, litigation support, and transformation. Both firms have more than 1,000 employees. The legal industry has seen the rapid growth of specialists such as Caldwell Intellectual Property Law in the US and Mishcon de Reya, a specialist in disputes, in the UK and Singapore. The success of such firms shows how deep expertise can create a defensible niche against broad-based competitors.</p><p> Large firms don&#39;t view these smaller businesses as a direct threat and often ignore them altogether. “They&#39;re not on our radar for the work we do with the C-suite,” said a partner in a large London law firm. Still, they can help incumbents stay vigilant.</p><p> For one, they provide a window on a changing marketplace, often prodding established firms to move into business areas they might have otherwise neglected. Deloitte, for example, launched its digital business in response to the emergence of specialized boutique firms. Bain created and spun off The Bridgespan Group in order to focus on nonprofits.</p><p> The specialty firms can also expose weaknesses in top-tier firms&#39; ways of working that need attention. For example, Altman Solon, the largest global strategy consulting firm specializing in telecommunications, media, and technology, commands C-suite attention in large part because the entire firm comprises specialists with deep expertise in those sectors, unlike many large firms that fill junior ranks with a lot of smart generalists. As a result, it is already up to speed with the industries in which it operates and thus is better able to develop client-specific strategies quickly.</p><p> <strong>Would-be disrupters that pose supply- and demand-side risk.</strong> The nightmare scenario for incumbents is disruption that affects the supply and demand sides at the same time. This is ultimately what killed Kodak and Polaroid: Digital technology changed how images were created and how they were consumed, leaving the incumbents nothing valuable to fall back on. The survivors from the photography industry, such as Fuji and Canon, did so by moving into adjacent markets, not by staying and fighting.</p><p> Such challengers have appeared in professional services, but so far they have fallen short as disrupters. For example, HourlyNerd, founded in 2013, had big ambitions to become a marketplace for connecting technology clients with freelance consultants, giving the client a wider choice of consultants at a faster rate than the typical procurement process. “We like to think of ourselves as a replacement to potentially hiring a consulting firm,” one of the cofounders said. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p> Axiom Law, founded in 2000, sought to provide on-demand legal talent using a network of employees and associates to provide legal services more efficiently. “Axiom has an opportunity to disrupt an industry that hasn&#39;t materially changed in a century,” one investor said. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a></p><p> Both firms have done moderately well. HourlyNerd, which rebranded as Catalant in 2016, shifted to a software-as-a-service model and today has several hundred employees. Axiom is a midsize law firm with about 1,600 employees, $842.5 million in revenue, and a more flexible business model than most of its competitors. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a> But neither has achieved the disruptive effects it aspired to.</p><p></p><h3> Disruptive Threats on the Horizon</h3><p> So, what looming disruptions keep the executives running consulting and law firms awake at night?</p><p> One factor the senior professionals we interviewed pointed to is a dramatic acceleration in AI and analytics capabilities. In law, codification — the process of capturing the legal reasoning of an experienced partner and turning that into an algorithm that can then be applied to future cases — threatens to eliminate much of the cognitive work now done by professionals. “That would be disruptive,” said a partner in a large London firm.</p><p> Several others indicated that the biggest threat in the near future will most likely come from the giant technology companies: Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce, in particular. Each has built client-facing capabilities, some from the large consulting firms, to enhance their strength in selling solutions to clients&#39; technology challenges.</p><p> With their AI capabilities and global reach, they could affect both the supply and demand sides of professional firms&#39; businesses. For example, using the vast amount of data at its disposal, Amazon Web Services could exploit its unique insights into customer behavior to provide retail clients with forecasts of online shopping trends.</p><p> “The greatest impact of Amazon Web Services won&#39;t lie in its position as a supplier of cloud services, but in the extraordinary scale and depth of its information on consumer buying behavior, which no conventional consulting firm could begin to compete with,” said a partner in a large consulting firm.</p><p> Others downplayed the threat. “The likes of Google are not actually that good at client service,” one interviewee said. While it is possible that a tech company could buy a large consulting firm, that would represent a significant strategic pivot from the typical approach of developing partnerships with consulting firms and would reduce the number of firms it could partner with in the future.</p><h3> Staying Nimble</h3><p> The big professional services firms haven&#39;t avoided disruption simply because of the actions they&#39;ve taken. More important is their vigilance and responsiveness to changes in their business environment. While consulting and law firm executives often disparage their seemingly old-fashioned ways of working, their professional partnership models have proved to be remarkably resilient.</p><p> From our interviews, we identified three elements of success that are worth highlighting as potentially applicable to other sectors as well.</p><p> <strong>Innovation efforts are devoted to solving client problems.</strong> This contrasts with many other businesses, where innovation activities are pursued separately from the customer-facing parts of the organization. The best professional services firms pursue product and service innovations based on common limitations, frictions, and opportunities they&#39;ve identified in their clients&#39; businesses. They then develop, test, and refine those innovations with selected clients and partner organizations — such as technology providers — before launching them across their client portfolios.</p><p> <strong>Partners and their juniors work closely together with clients.</strong> The firms&#39; apprenticeship model means that the sense-response gap — the difference between sensing client needs and then taking appropriate action to address them — is narrower than in firms where the leaders are a long way removed from those doing the work.</p><p> <strong>Firms take a cautious approach to investing in new activities.</strong> While this might seem to be a weakness in a fast-changing world, the truth is that most emerging technologies take a long time to realize their potential, and plenty of firms have failed by moving too quickly. Because of the project-based nature of their work, professional firms are able to test new technologies, see what works, and then move forward based on project success and client demand.</p><h3> Staying Ahead of Disruption</h3><p> The experience of professional services firms in holding off potential disruption suggests four actions that firms in other sectors can take to prepare for and respond to change.</p><p> <strong>Diagnose the threat.</strong> While every new competitor or technology can be seen as a potential threat, it&#39;s necessary to assess the magnitude of the risk and the part of the business that it might affect. The consulting and law firms we studied were mostly very thoughtful about separating out the demand- and supply-side effects. (See “Diagnosing the Nature of the Disruptive Threat” for how to apply this logic.)</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Diagnosing the Nature of the Disruptive Threat</h4><p class="caption"> Consider an emerging technology or new competitor in your industry and answer the following questions to determine the nature of the disruptive threat.</p><p class="print no-mobile no-desktop caption"> Take the assessment at https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-professional-services-firms-dodged-disruption/</p><p> <a id="interactive-modal" href="#modal-container" class="is-button aqua no-print" style="max-width:275px">Take the assessment now</a> </p><p class="caption"><svg height="20.25" viewBox="0 0 18.183 20.25" width="18.183" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><clipPath id="a"><path d="m0 0h18.183v20.25h-18.183z"></path></clipPath><g clip-path="url(#a)"><path d="m17.081 12.4a1.087 1.087 0 0 1 1.1 1.1v5.648a1.087 1.087 0 0 1 -1.1 1.1h-15.981a1.087 1.087 0 0 1 -1.1-1.1v-5.648a1.185 1.185 0 0 1 1.1-1.1 1.185 1.185 0 0 1 1.1 1.1v4.546h13.642v-4.546a1.324 1.324 0 0 1 1.24-1.1m-11.71-4.135 2.618 2.617v-9.642a1.214 1.214 0 0 1 1.102-1.24 1.185 1.185 0 0 1 1.1 1.1v9.643l2.617-2.48a1.012 1.012 0 0 1 .827-.276 1.958 1.958 0 0 1 .827.276 1.254 1.254 0 0 1 0 1.653l-4.545 4.548c-.138.138-.276.138-.413.276a.878.878 0 0 1 -.827 0c-.138 0-.276-.138-.413-.276l-4.546-4.684a1.081 1.081 0 0 1 0-1.515 1.257 1.257 0 0 1 1.653 0" fill="#000000"></path></g></svg> <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/a3e29f5546.pdf" target="_blank" class="marketing_click" id="Download_Assessment[Birkinshaw_article]" rel="noopener">Download the scorecard (PDF)</a></p><div id="modal-container"><div  id="btn-close-modal" class="close-modal-container"> ← RETURN TO ARTICLE </div><div class="modal-content"><iframe src="https://survey.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eWAtUnHf3GCdswu" width="100%" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></p></div><p><script>$("#interactive-modal").animatedModal({modalTarget:'modal-container',animatedIn:'fadeInRightBig',animatedOut:'fadeOutRightBig',animationDuration:'.6s',color:'#292929',overflow:'hidden'});</script></p></article></aside></div><p> <strong>Match the response to the challenge.</strong> Once the supply and demand effects have been mapped, it&#39;s possible to target the appropriate response. Demand-side challenges require experimentation in how clients&#39; needs can be anticipated, understood, met, and adjusted to. Professional services firms are inherently good at this. Project teams are empowered to come up with creative solutions and to experiment with alternative models for forming partnerships and delivering services. This should serve as a cautionary note to firms that have become too “corporate,” with decisions flowing from the top down to partners and teams.</p><p> Supply-side changes, in contrast, require investment in new capabilities and an openness to restructuring and even outsourcing internal activities. This often requires a higher level of centralization, frequently with a dedicated team that hires from the outside or makes small acquisitions. The challenge is to integrate them with client project teams so they are deployed in the market.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Stay focused on the organization&#39;s true mission.</strong> While there are plenty of genuine threats out there, there&#39;s also a lot of noise. Paying too much attention to all of the changes swirling around can cause leaders to lose sight of the bigger picture. For professional services firms, the client relationship transcends all else, and the appropriate response to both demand- and supply-driven threats is to double down on that relationship. “We want to retain the overall relationship, focusing on the areas of premium work,” the partner in a large London law firm said. “The debate is how much we leave ... to other law firms and how much we retain and do via third parties or alternative delivery models.”</p><p> <strong>Balance pragmatism with a healthy paranoia.</strong> The law and consulting partners we spoke with in our interviews were genuinely torn. On the one hand, they saw little or no evidence that their strong positions were under threat, and they agreed that the dire predictions of disruption from a decade ago had been unfounded. On the other hand, they did not want to appear complacent, and they certainly didn&#39;t want to send a message to their junior colleagues that there were no future risks of disruption. Executives must learn to live with a dual mindset: a pragmatic acknowledgment that the fundamentals are sound, coupled with a paranoid suspicion of emerging technologies or new competitors. After all, it was those incumbents that might be caught by surprise that Christensen and his colleagues considered most at risk of disruption.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-professional-services-firms-dodged-disruption/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Risk Intelligence and the Resilient Company</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/risk-intelligence-and-the-resilient-company/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/risk-intelligence-and-the-resilient-company/#comments</comments><pubDate> Tue, 13 Jun 2023 12:05:04 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Ananya Sheth and Joseph V.

At a time when a container ship grounded in the Suez Canal can bottle up 12% of the world&#39;s trade, or a virus can disrupt the global flow of commodities, components, and talent, a corporation&#39;s ability to quickly adapt in the face of unfolding events is essential to its survival and prosperity.</p><p> Business resilience is a dynamic property that is retrospectively measured by the stability and longevity of corporate value across changing contexts. In real time, it manifests in an enterprise&#39;s timely adaptation to both immediate and gradual changes in the business environment.</p><p> Our work, which employs a complex adaptive systems view of businesses, shows that resilience derives from three fundamental adaptive capacities: sensing and monitoring, to recognize emerging changes in the business environment; business model portfolio development, to build and test capabilities across operating contexts; and fundamental capability development, to drive growth with longevity and avoid corporate stall. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> Moreover, each of these capacities hinges on the development of a capability for <em>risk intelligence</em> .</p><p></p><p> We define risk intelligence as the honed ability to rigorously interpret risks and the consequences or opportunities they pose for a company. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> It allows leaders to see through environmental complexity and systematically identify, categorize, and interpret risks. This enables them to look beyond known risk factors and intentionally explore yet-to-be-known risks, thereby embracing rather than avoiding uncertainty. Importantly, risk intelligence brings recognition that individual risks or the forms in which they manifest matter far less than the often-shared consequences they have on a company&#39;s value exchange system — that is, the manner in which it manages, identifies, creates, conveys, delivers, captures, protects, and sustains value. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> And finally, it provides leaders with a network view of risks that enables more effective allocation of risk mitigation resources by illuminating not just the direct consequences of risks but the manner in which they could cascade across the company&#39;s value exchange system. In this article, we break down risk intelligence into actionable elements that leaders can pursue to help toughen their organizations for the long term.</p><h3> Identify, Categorize, and Interpret Risk Events</h3><p> Leaders cannot accurately predict specific risk events, nor can they prepare their companies for all risks. They can, however, identify, categorize, and interpret risk events in a systematic manner that reveals how seemingly different events could have similar consequences.</p><p> The first step is to work through each business value function and identify plausible risk events that may have implications for its effectiveness. To aid in this process, we constructed an industry-agnostic inventory organizing three tiers of 99 major risk categories identified in our study in relation to individual value exchange system components. (See “A Value Function Risk Inventory.”) While inevitably not exhaustive, this resource serves as a robust starting point to identify potential risks faced by any enterprise. </p><div class="callout-highlight callout-highlight--transparent callout--expand-column" id="fig1"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> A Value Function Risk Inventory</h4><p class="caption"> This risk inventory derived from 20 years of S&amp;P 500 data shows how the functions of a company&#39;s value exchange system (green nodes) link to business functions and their respective risk categories. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MAG_FE_Sheth_fig1.png" alt="A Value Function Risk Inventory"/></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p> Next, leaders should characterize and group risk events by their <em>scope</em> of impact, the <em>permanence</em> of the changes they induce, and the <em>frequency</em> of event occurrence. (See “Characterizing Risks.”) Leaders can then interpret the linkages between each group of risk events and the components of the company&#39;s value exchange system.</p><div class="callout-highlight" id="fig2"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Characterizing Risks</h4><p class="caption"> Every risk can be characterized according to how widely its impact may be felt, how long the changes it causes may last, and how often it occurs. For example, a major snow event has intra-industry scope, induces temporary changes, and occurs infrequently. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MAG_FE_Sheth_fig2.png" alt="Characterizing Risks" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p> Risk categorization begins with understanding a risk event&#39;s scope, which conveys a sense of how widely a risk&#39;s effects will be felt across the range of affected stakeholders. The wide scope of the COVID-19 pandemic created supply- and demand-side effects across entire value networks, whereas narrow-scope events, such as a labor strike at an individual manufacturing facility, tend to have more bounded effects. When multiple stakeholders experience simultaneous or sequential disruptions, the increased complexity of the impact prevents the system from self-organizing to normalcy. Such circumstances also may invite interventions from sovereign states or international organizations, which can aid recovery or act as new disruptive forces.</p><p> To fully categorize risk events, leaders must also consider the permanence of their consequences. Both the pandemic and the 2021 Suez Canal blockage caused supply-side disruptions, but the permanence of the changes each event induced varied significantly. While supply chain shocks such as the canal blockage often follow a self-organizing correction mechanism in which price increases lower demand and normalize the lagging supply, the same formula cannot be applied to counter a protracted situation like the pandemic. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> It is important to understand permanence before planning and implementing a response strategy. For example, the business interruption created by the pandemic had a scope that was broader and consequences that were of greater permanence, affecting a significantly larger set of value system functions in comparison to the more limited impact of the canal blockage.</p><p></p><p> How often a risk event occurs is important too, because the enterprise mechanisms needed to handle frequent events can be different from those employed for singular events. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> Although companies learn from all events, their responses to those that occur repeatedly are typically converted into standard operating procedures. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a> For example, the adoption of barcodes and scanners to track and manage inventory in real time has largely eliminated stock-keeping record errors and delays resulting from mismatching data.</p><p> Our scope, permanence, and frequency (SPF) framework provides a structured view that shows how a risk event itself is less important than its consequences. The framework is especially useful when multiple risk events occur at the same time, because it gives managers a common, logical approach for considering them and quickly gaining information and understanding. By then connecting those events to the company&#39;s value exchange system, managers can more easily see when diverse risks are nonetheless leading to similar consequences for its value functions. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p> Consider a manufacturer dealing with both an overseas supplier whose products are suddenly subject to much higher tariffs due to a trade war, and the bankruptcy of a value chain partner. These risk events share SPF characteristics (the scope of both is interfirm, their permanence is reversible, and their frequency is low), and, as important, both events also affect the same value functions. The bankruptcy and the trade war are both likely to slow inputs and raise costs on the supply side and make it more difficult to meet customer demand. Both also would require the manufacturer to secure new supply sources and stabilize operational cash flow. By characterizing these potential risk events according to the SPF framework and linking them to value functions, managers can then view them more simply as groups of risks that have shared consequences for a company&#39;s specific value functions and deserve similar preparedness and response.</p><h3> Compartmentalize and Reduce Uncertainty</h3><p> Uncertainty about the consequences of a risk event is unavoidable, but it can be managed based on where the level of uncertainty falls on a spectrum between complete knowledge and complete ignorance (both of which are extreme and unlikely). <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> Leaders should then seek to convert risks with higher levels of impact uncertainty to lower levels. (See “Managing Levels of Impact Uncertainty.”) </p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand-column" id="fig3"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Managing Levels of Impact Uncertainty</h4><p class="caption"> Once managers have mapped risks to the appropriate level, they should take the critical action recommended to convert higher-order risks to lower-order risks. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MAG_FE_Sheth_fig3.png" alt="Managing Levels of Impact Uncertainty" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p></p><p> Risk events causing level 1 uncertainty usually entail a very limited number of future scenarios with clear intrafirm effects, where causal linkages between risk events and the enterprise&#39;s value exchange system can be accurately known. Examples of such events include routine variation in production, expected sales losses, and human errors in performing manual tasks. When specific types of level 1 events occur frequently, they are indicative of errors in process or oversight that can be rectified permanently if diagnosed correctly. For instance, cargo thefts — a recurrent problem at logjammed transport hubs — can be prevented using optical character recognition scanners that track container freight and maintain real-time records. Importantly, at level 1, the overall uncertainty of the impact on firm value is within an expected, acceptable range.</p><p> Risk events causing level 2 uncertainty involve a larger number of alternate future scenarios and have interfirm consequences; however, even though they are more challenging, the probability that they will occur and their effects can be estimated. Businesses&#39; formal scenario planning exercises often involve level 2 events in which previously acquired knowledge regarding the impact of risk factors leads to improved accuracy and an effective exercise overall. The six-day Suez Canal blockage was predictable because a multiship pileup had closed the canal for two days in 2018. As a result, the Pentagon had already worked a longer blockage into its normal operational preparedness. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p> Risk events causing level 3 uncertainty involve a bounded set of scenarios where certain known risk events may affect the company in unknown ways. There is limited knowledge about how a chain reaction of consequences from a risk event might manifest at this level. Typically, these risks include less frequently occurring events with intra-industry scope and multistakeholder implications, which should be considered worst-case scenarios.</p><p> <a href="https://www.portrevel.com/">Port Revel</a> , a training facility situated on a lake in the French Alps, reduces level 3 uncertainty by helping ocean shipping companies simulate worst cases and identify the previously unknown consequences of operating increasingly large container ships through shipping infrastructure largely designed for smaller vessels. It closely replicates conditions at the trickiest spots in maritime transport, allowing trainee pilots to navigate scaled giant container ships through strong gusts of wind across a mini-Suez, steer and dock cruise ships in a crowded mini-San Francisco Bay, and maneuver oil tankers through an imitation Port Arthur. These exercises draw out unanticipated ship performance and pilot behaviors, helping to identify and address previously unknown event consequences.</p><p> Level 4 uncertainty encompasses events with unknown risk factors that could have a variety of negative consequences, the repercussions of which can&#39;t be estimated. These unknown unknowns are usually expressed in 10-Ks through statements such as “Other unknown risks may impact our business operations and projected performance.” It is challenging to develop scenario models in the presence of unknown unknowns. The models are incomplete representations of the world that could entail risks unimagined while developing them.</p><p> Once leaders order the uncertainty of impact into levels, they can focus on converting higher-level impact uncertainty into lower levels by discovering unknowns through data, simulation modeling, and logical analyses. For instance, the three-year gap between the UK&#39;s Brexit referendum in 2016 and its departure from the European Union in 2019 offered leaders an opportunity to convert the imagined event into likely scenarios and capture its vast trade implications. By focusing on the most vulnerable aspects of their value chains, such as those with the highest number of cross-border transactions, leaders could have recognized the imminent redistribution of goods passing through congested ports and modeled rerouting scenarios. For example, Felixstowe was known to be handling 48% of the UK&#39;s container trade, which could have been sent instead to multiple smaller and less busy ports. Evidence of impending port congestion also could have implied the high likelihood of delays and the need to hold more inventory in the UK to guarantee on-time deliveries.</p><p> Systemwide changes that are likely to have permanent effects are typically caused by noticeable megatrends, such as technological breakthroughs, changes in consumer demand patterns, global events, or regulatory body interventions. Once these trends are on a company&#39;s radar, they can be tracked and rapidly interpreted (if the necessary observation and modeling capabilities are in place). For instance, the European Union&#39;s carbon border tax, which was enacted in December 2022 after years of debate, won&#39;t be fully implemented until 2026, offering companies several years to reduce the uncertainty arising from it.</p><p></p><p> Further, for potential events that may be infrequent yet high impact, businesses can examine other industries where the consequences of similar events might be better recognized; then they can interpret the implications for their own value exchange system. For example, Brexit strategists could have studied cross-border trade between the US and Canada and the US and Mexico in the automobile and white goods sectors to help them navigate looming free-trade agreements and border regulations.</p><p> The active identification of plausible risk events and their potential consequences are the kinds of actions that contribute to building true risk intelligence. However, our research indicates that companies place little emphasis on discovering unknown and plausible risk events and their outcomes and instead focus attention on managing known risks. We also find that companies do not have a similarly complete knowledge of risks, even when those risks are publicly disclosed by direct competitors. Our study of 10-Ks revealed significant variation in the acknowledgment of risk factors, even among companies in the same industry. For instance, there was a lag of as much as eight years in acknowledging cyber risks after the first public data breach within a group of 18 comparable companies in the financial sector. This pattern was consistent in four additional sectors — including retail, telecom, technology, and health care.</p><p> Moreover, our analyses revealed only marginal levels of acknowledgment of causal relationships between risk factors, which are how risks impact companies in the real world. It is only logical that a known or unknown risk factor, when manifested, would likely influence other linked known and unknown risk factors, thereby creating a cascade of consequences. This ultimately would affect a company in potentially known but unexpected (or, worse, misunderstood) ways.</p><p></p><p> While most companies think they are preparing for risk events, they tend to focus only on level 1 and 2 uncertainty and therefore develop highly specific but narrow mitigation plans. Take Maersk, for example, which in 2017 fell victim to a ransomware cyberattack that brought down its entire network for days and halted its operations at 76 port terminals globally at a cost of roughly $300 million. <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a> Yet the shipping company did not publicly acknowledge the risk of a cyberattack until its 2013 annual report, despite the risk of hacking and other cyberthreats having been well known since the late 1990s (although perhaps not seriously regarded as a primary risk for shippers). Thus, few risks are entirely unknown, and industry-specific unknowns may not be unknowns in other sectors.</p><h3> Construct and Contextualize an Enterprise Risk Network</h3><p> To gain clearer insight into level 3 and 4 uncertainty, it is important to understand the linkages among enterprise risks. Developing quantified risk networks (QRNs) can help. A QRN is a weighted map that links all identified potential risks to a company&#39;s value exchange system functions and helps decision makers interpret related impacts. Moreover, QRNs can reveal counterintuitive insights, such as a function&#39;s indirect exposure to risks typically associated with a different but connected function. For example, the risk of inaccurately forecasting shipping demand in a freight company directly affects its operating expense management function and indirectly affects facility capacity, operational capability, and customer concessions, as well as the company&#39;s reputation.</p><p> Companies should build their own risk networks for three reasons. First, each company has its own unique value exchange system that is best understood by its leaders. Second, resilient companies need to build in redundancies, which is challenging to do in resource-constrained environments. Custom QRNs highlight the most connected — and most vulnerable — value functions, creating an order of priority for allocating resources to bolster the enterprise. Third, custom QRNs provide a shared picture of risk for company leaders, who may or may not agree on critical vulnerabilities. The QRN-building activity focuses managerial attention on the often disregarded but potentially crucial functions and related risk categories to ultimately help leaders anticipate and prepare for the future.</p><p> To begin constructing your company&#39;s risk network, identify the risk events that are particularly relevant to your business by working from critical value functions upon which it relies and from the risk categories captured in the inventory. Identify plausible risk events in each category from data sources such as company memos, public risk disclosures, investment analyst reports, and historical knowledge. For example, leaders managing the operations function can use inventory risk categories, such as facilities and process management, sourcing, and distribution, to build a list of plausible risk factors or events (such as an unexpected storm, an equipment malfunction, input shortages, drained emergency supplies, worker health emergencies, communications interruptions, or labor strikes) that could affect business continuity. Note that these lists will likely contain several risk factors under each risk category.</p><p> Next, characterize relevant risks using the SPF framework, identify plausible scenarios related to the company&#39;s value functions, and identify potential responses. This exercise gives managers the opportunity to pay extra attention to less appreciated risks and helps them reduce the overall level of uncertainty of the impact of risks on the company&#39;s value exchange system.</p><p> Since the archetypal company is organized by function, the consequences of potential risks on individual functions (such as a labor strike&#39;s effect on sourcing) and the interconnectivity between different value functions themselves should be estimated for each functional node in the QRN. For instance, once managers define the level of interconnectivity between the sourcing and operations functions in their company, they can deduce the direct consequences of a labor strike for sourcing and its indirect consequences for operations. Weighting impacts, even using relative terms such as high, medium, and low, provides a common language for managers to discuss significant risks and plausible scenarios and can help resolve debate on what is likely or what is important. Functions identified as particularly important or vulnerable should be analyzed by experts to develop a deeper understanding of the risks affecting them and their interconnectivity.</p><p> We created a generalized QRN, beginning by asking leaders with sector and functional expertise to indicate interconnectivity between their function and other business functions on a 10-point scale. (See “A Quantitative Risk Network.”) Then we asked the leaders to indicate the potential impact of specific risks to their functional area arising from these connections. For example, a sales and marketing expert who indicated significant interconnectivity with the business strategy function was asked whether sales forecasting risks, sales execution risks, and reputation risks would have a high, medium, or low impact on business strategy. Companies can follow this process to build a codified understanding by leveraging their internal leaders as well as external experts. Once coded, the data forms the basis for a network representation of risks and a company-specific QRN. </p><div class="callout-highlight callout-highlight--transparent callout--expand-column" id="fig4"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> A Quantitative Risk Network</h4><p class="caption"> This visual representation of a generalized QRN reveals the linkages between risk categories and enterprise functions.

The more central the function, the larger its font size; the thick links in the QRN imply high-impact relationships between functions and risk categories. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MAG_FE_Sheth_fig4.png" alt="A Quantitative Risk Network" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p> Such a QRN helps leaders better understand a company&#39;s vulnerability to risk events by illuminating those functions that are central to the value exchange system. A risk event affecting a central function would imply a strong cascade of negative effects across the company&#39;s value exchange system. For example, financial capital management connects directly to 15 financial risk categories and indirectly to 30 risk categories from other functions. Any event occurring in any one of the risk categories affecting financial capital management will have implications for all other connected functions; for instance, significant currency exposure will likely affect the company&#39;s sourcing decisions. Thus, protecting the financial capital management function is critical to resilience. In contrast, a negative effect on the marketing and sales function is unlikely to cause a cascading impact in this company. <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a></p><p> Expert knowledge, industry insights, experience, and the simulations are all useful in building a network view of enterprise risks. QRNs are baseline resources that help a company isolate and objectively model for worst-case scenarios, estimate cause-effect patterns, and effectively reduce level 3 and 4 uncertainty.</p><p> A company with a well-honed QRN will be able to differentiate between the scope and consequences of a business interruption due to, say, a pandemic and a transport route blockage. It will also be able to pinpoint the parts of the business that will likely experience significant consequences from these events, such as value delivery, value creation, and value protection, and identify the precise business functions that should be guarded for each of these events. In the case of the pandemic, these functions would include financial capital management, market risk assessment, and technology management; for the lower-scope blockage, these would include operations management and operating expense control. Furthermore, the company could use the value function risk inventory and build scenario models for risk events identified within each of these functions.</p><p> Ultimately, pairing the knowledge of plausible risk events and their likely interactions with the company&#39;s value functions enables strategists to develop tailored mitigation plans and response strategies. Leaders who recognize the need to better understand a specific set of scenarios can invest in developing precise models to reduce the uncertainty of their impact on the company.</p><p></p><p></p><p> The value exchange system that drives any large, complex enterprise is continuously challenged as contexts vary in the dynamic business environment. This raises the stakes for anticipating change, exploring new variations of business models, and continuously pursuing the next wave of growth-enabling capabilities. Risk intelligence helps leaders in this work, enabling them to better focus on maintaining continuous value exchange and fostering the adaptability needed to achieve resilience.</p><p> To create and nurture risk intelligence, a company needs a central risk management function that is staffed with broad functional expertise and given the resources required to identify and categorize risks. It needs to embrace a mindset of risk uncertainty versus risk avoidance and reduce the levels of uncertainty. It needs a company-specific quantified risk network that is updated in a dynamic manner. And finally, it needs a culture of risk intelligence in which leaders across the organization share a common framework and language for interpreting risks and guiding resource allocation for risk mitigation efforts. Ultimately, honing a risk intelligence capability represents the key to building a resilient enterprise.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/risk-intelligence-and-the-resilient-company/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 1</slash:comments></item><item><title> Predictive Models Can Lose the Plot.

However, these organizational efforts often fail — sometimes with spectacular consequences.</p><p> In 2018, real estate marketplace Zillow launched Zillow Offers, an “instant buyer” arm of the business. It leveraged a proprietary algorithm called Zestimate, which calculates how much a given residential property can be expected to sell for. Based on these calculations, Zillow Offers planned to purchase, renovate, and resell properties for a profit. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> While it had some success for the first few years, the model failed to adjust to the new dynamics of a more volatile market in 2021. Zillow lost an average of $25,000 on every home it sold in the fourth quarter that year — resulting in a write-down of $881 million. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a></p><p> This is an example of what we call <em>algorithmic inertia</em> : when organizations use algorithmic models to take environmental changes into account but fail to keep pace with those changes. In this article, we explain algorithmic inertia, identify its sources, and suggest practices organizations can implement to overcome it.</p><p></p><h3> A Credit-Rating Catastrophe</h3><p> To understand the phenomenon of algorithmic inertia, we conducted an in-depth study of another organization that failed to respond to changes in the environment: Moody&#39;s, a financial research firm that provides credit ratings for bonds and complex financial instruments such as residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs). These securities aggregated bundles of individual mortgages into distinct tranches with unique characteristics during the period leading up to the global financial crisis of 2008. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p> Moody&#39;s made a concerted effort to account for environmental changes in its credit ratings by developing a proprietary algorithmic model in 2000 called M3 Prime. The model analyzed data about properties, mortgage holders, and the economy to estimate two parameters central to calculating a credit rating: expected losses for the mortgage pool and the loss coverage protection required for a security to maintain a AAA rating. An analyst would present a recommendation to Moody&#39;s credit rating committee, which assigned a publicly posted rating for the security. Moody&#39;s monitored these ratings and upgraded or downgraded RMBSs as the environment changed. The M3 Prime model achieved early success, so in 2006, Moody&#39;s expanded its scope of algorithmic analysis by introducing a derivative model, M3 Subprime.</p><p> Between 2000 and 2008, Moody&#39;s provided credit ratings for thousands of RMBSs, but it ended up downgrading 83% of AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities valued at billions of dollars by 2008. The US government, along with 21 states and the District of Columbia, held Moody&#39;s responsible for the role that its inflated ratings of those and other products played in precipitating the financial crisis. In 2017, the agency agreed to pay $864 million to settle the allegations. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p> This is a particularly illustrative example of algorithmic inertia with devastating societal consequences. Moody&#39;s decisions offer an excellent context for exploring algorithmic inertia because the organization was explicitly responsible for analyzing environmental changes as part of its core service. Moreover, we were able to access detailed information about its algorithmic model from a report produced by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that includes extensive interviews conducted under oath with Moody&#39;s executives who were involved in the business at the time. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a></p><p> Our analysis enabled us to identify the most significant contributing factors to algorithmic inertia — buried assumptions, superficial remodeling, simulation of the unknown future, and specialized compartmentalization — described below.

For example, loan originators were increasingly underwriting mortgages based on lower credit standards and substantially less documentation than before. So an original assumption undergirding Moody&#39;s M3 Prime model — that the technology that mortgage originators were using to streamline the loan application process was also enabling a more accurate assessment of underlying risks — wasn&#39;t modified to reflect the changing lending environment. The managing director of credit policy at Moody&#39;s told a federal inquiry panel that he sat on a high-level structured credit committee that would have been expected to deal with issues like declining mortgage underwriting standards, but the topic was never raised. “We talked about everything but … the elephant sitting on the table,” he said. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p></p><p> Moody&#39;s model also assumed that consumers&#39; FICO credit scores were the primary predictive factor in loan defaults. But the quality of this data input significantly diminished over time: As the use of these credit scores became increasingly common, individuals found ways to artificially inflate them. As a result, low- and no-documentation mortgages carried latent risk that was not being taken into account in Moody&#39;s algorithmic model. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p> <strong>Superficial remodeling.</strong> This phenomenon occurs when organizations make only minor modifications to the algorithmic model in response to substantive changes in the environment. At Moody&#39;s, some major changes to the environment included a growing number of loan originators, increasingly low-quality mortgages, and an unprecedented decline in interest rates.</p><p> Moody&#39;s response to these changes was to seek to capture more business in the rapidly growing market, so it fine-tuned the model to be “more efficient, more profitable, cheaper, and more versatile,” according to its chief credit officer — not to be more accurate. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> When it modified M3 Prime to introduce the M3 Subprime model, it extrapolated loss curves for subprime loans based on premium loans rather than developing fresh loss curves for subprime loans.</p><p> <strong>Simulation of the unknown future.</strong> Relying on an algorithmic model to produce viable scenarios for the future environment can also leave organizations vulnerable to algorithmic inertia. Moody&#39;s constructed a simulation engine featuring 1,250 macroeconomic scenarios that enabled it to estimate possible future losses based on variations in economic markers such as inflation, unemployment, and house prices. However, the simulation engine was limited by its underlying structure and assumptions, so analysts did not consider the changes that were occurring, did not update scenarios, and failed to accurately represent the changing macroeconomic environment. Based on the belief that detailed performance histories could more precisely reveal causal links between economic stresses and loan behavior, Moody&#39;s used estimates based on historical parameters rather than expected pool loss distributions to examine behavior in stress scenarios. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p> <strong>Specialized compartmentalization.</strong> This situation arises when experts in different domains are involved in an algorithm&#39;s design and use and there is no overarching single ownership or shared understanding of the model. At Moody&#39;s, responsibilities for the credit rating routine were divided between the domain experts (credit rating committee members) who used the quantitative model and the quantitative analysts who had developed it.</p><p> Because ownership and use of the model were distributed, and Moody&#39;s didn&#39;t strictly define how to use it, credit rating committee members established ad hoc rules to adjust the results of the model when its outputs didn&#39;t conform to what their expert judgment led them to believe it ought to produce. Model outputs weren&#39;t considered final; rather, the models were seen as tools to be used in conjunction with other approaches, and there was much divergence in how different ratings committees made their determinations.</p><p> The models were developed and modified by individuals who were distant from the domains in which they would be applied; disparate groups of domain experts then used the models in inconsistent ways without understanding their underlying logic. The managing director for rating RMBSs described the model as so technically complex that few people understood how it worked. <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a></p><p> This issue is at the heart of what makes algorithmic inertia hard to tackle: The models and algorithms are often so complex that domain experts can hardly grasp the details of their functioning, while data scientists are disconnected from how their models are being used in the real world.</p><h3> Develop Practices That Combat Algorithmic Inertia</h3><p> We have described how each of the causes of algorithmic inertia played out in Moody&#39;s use of an algorithmic model to dynamically incorporate changes in the environment into its credit ratings. Despite recognizing flaws in the model and making active attempts to change it, the organization was unable to effectively adapt to the environment, thereby substantially contributing to the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p> To prevent similar degradation of critical algorithms&#39; predictive value, we suggest that organizations implement the four practices described below. (See “Keeping Algorithms Relevant.”)</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Keeping Algorithms Relevant</h4><p class="caption"> Organizations can increase the likelihood that algorithmic tools will effectively adapt to changes in the environment by following four practices. </p><table id="Chart#" class="chart-grouped-rows no-mobile"><thead><th style="border-right:hidden;border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;"></th><th style="border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;"></th></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right:hidden;border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding-left:0px;"><p> <strong>Expose Data and Assumptions</strong></p></td><td style="border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;"><p> Articulate and document the data and the fundamental assumptions in the algorithmic model. </p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right:hidden;background-color:#f0f0f0;border-bottom-color:black;padding-left:0px;"><p> <strong>Periodically Redesign Algorithmic Routines</strong></p></td><td  style="background-color:#f0f0f0;;border-bottom-color:black;"><p> Periodically redesign — and be willing to overhaul — the algorithmic model and how it fits into broader organizational routines. </p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right:hidden;border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding-left:0px;"><p> <strong>Assume That the Model Will Break</strong></p></td><td style="border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;"><p> Actively consider scenarios outside the scope of algorithmic models by challenging predictive assumptions, assuming that the model will be fundamentally flawed, and envisioning qualitative alternative predictions of the future.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right:hidden;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding-left:0px;"><p> <strong>Build Bridges Between Data Scientists and Domain Experts</strong></p></td><td style="background-color:#f0f0f0;"><p> Ensure that data scientists and domain experts work closely together to design the algorithmic model and the organizational routine in which it is to be embedded. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><!--IMAGE FALLBACK FOR MOBILE BELOW --></p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MAG_Glaser_Table_2.png" alt="Keeping Algorithms Relevant" class="no-desktop" /></p></article></aside></div><p></p><p> <strong>Expose data and assumptions.</strong> Organizations should articulate and document the data used in their algorithmic models, including data sources and fundamental assumptions underlying their data selection decisions, which can have deleterious effects. <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a> Models often include operationalizations of many concepts, and it is easy for organizations to lose track of these parameters, which can be buried in layers of software code. Parameters representing the environment need to be documented to ensure that they remain visible. Similarly, the fundamental assumptions undergirding the model should be articulated and periodically revisited.</p><p> Moody&#39;s used a data set on premium mortgages to train a model that was intended to be used to rate RMBSs composed of subprime mortgages. Initially, this might have been a reasonable choice due to the availability of data. But when a model&#39;s initial data set isn&#39;t refreshed, algorithmic inertia can result. As the Moody&#39;s case suggests, data is never completely accurate, objective, and flawless. Therefore, making the sources of data and assumptions about those sources transparent to algorithm users, and continually reflecting on the appropriateness of that data, are critical practices for organizations seeking to avoid algorithmic inertia.</p><p> Organizations must keep data sources clearly organized and evaluate them periodically. Different data sources have different qualities and characteristics. Ensuring that these sources are distinguished from one another before they are fed into algorithmic models, processed, and constantly compared against one another enables data scientists to identify and eliminate algorithmic inertia sooner rather than later.</p><p> The assumptions underpinning the use of an algorithm should also be documented and articulated. Any attempt to model the environment involves quantification — transforming aspects of reality into numerical data. Such quantification inevitably involves making assumptions about how the environment works. However, while quantification is necessary for algorithmic models to work, details about how it is performed can get lost in the complex process of designing and using algorithmic models. Therefore, maintaining a living record of such assumptions may prevent the emergence of algorithmic inertia.</p><p> <strong>Periodically redesign algorithmic routines.</strong> Organizations should regularly redesign — and be willing to overhaul — their algorithmic model and reconsider how it fits into broader organizational routines. The initial design of an algorithmic model can take a lot of work, and it is natural for an organization to want to reap the benefits of that work. However, in a dynamic and quickly changing environment, it&#39;s important to be willing not just to make incremental changes to a model but to fundamentally overhaul it if necessary.</p><p> Of course, organizations face a trade-off when it comes to overhauling an algorithmic routine: It can be very expensive to completely re-architect an algorithmic model. However, the consequences of failing to do so can be disastrous.</p><p> For example, when Moody&#39;s had to rate an increasing number of subprime-dominated RMBSs, the organization chose to incrementally modify the M3 Prime model. However, it may have been more effective to specify the distinctions between the prime and the subprime markets and do a deeper overhaul of the original model. In addition to rethinking the algorithmic model itself, an organization can consider how it is deployed in practice: Hypothetically, Moody&#39;s could have applied the M3 Prime model differently to different types of RMBSs — perhaps simply requiring more human intervention for tranches composed of lower-quality loans.</p><p> Redesigning and overhauling an algorithmic model is contingent upon understanding what organizational processes interrelate with the model and analyzing the implications that changes in the environment have for it. If it becomes clear that either the model or the processes that it relies on or feeds into have been rendered obsolete or ineffective, an overhaul should be seriously considered.</p><p> <strong>Assume that the model will break.</strong> It can be dangerous for an organization to think of potential future scenarios only through the prism of what algorithmic models predict: All assumptions embedded in a model limit the potential futures that can be considered. To address algorithmic inertia associated with the simulation of an unknown future, it is important to assume that the model will break. Consider scenarios beyond the scope of the algorithmic model; this requires challenging predictive assumptions as well as presuming that the model is fundamentally flawed.</p><p> An active practice of considering scenarios that are <em>outside</em> the model can help motivate and inspire the prior two practices — exposing data and assumptions and periodically redesigning algorithmic routines — by forcing team members to actively consider the limitations of algorithmic models.</p><p></p><p> One particularly useful approach might be to make use of qualitative predictions of the future instead of quantitative predictions that rely on available data from the past. These forms of scenario planning offer opportunities to consider radically different visions of what the future may hold. This might also entail developing hybrid algorithms that do not precisely rely on past data to predict scenarios but also embed in them qualitative measures and expert rules introduced by domain experts.</p><p> <strong>Build bridges between data scientists and domain experts.</strong> Organizations must create processes for data scientists and domain experts to work closely together to design their algorithmic routines. <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a> Practically speaking, data scientists and AI specialists approach problems very differently than domain experts do. Domain experts focus on organizational routines and idiosyncratic situations, whereas data scientists focus on developing generalizable constructs based on mathematical principles. To overcome algorithmic inertia, data scientists and domain experts must work closely together to understand how characteristics of organizational routines and idiosyncratic situations map to the mathematical parameters used in an algorithmic model.</p><p> When the worlds of data scientists and domain experts are completely separate, there is also the danger that data scientists and domain experts will shift responsibility by superficially trusting each other&#39;s work. Such assumptions can actually prevent crucial dialogue between the two worlds. For instance, Moody&#39;s ended up subverting the results of its credit rating model because the credit rating analysts didn&#39;t attempt to understand why the model might be generating results that didn&#39;t fit with their intuitions. Building bridges between data scientists and domain experts enables domain experts to obtain an intuitive grasp of how the algorithmic model works. Such common ground could enable organizations to create and use models that better adapt to changes in the environment.</p><p> One structural bridge-building practice that organizations can use to facilitate communication between data scientists and domain experts is establishing a position such as a product manager. This should be held by one individual with both domain and data science experience who has direct responsibility for overseeing algorithmic routines. For example, some data experts have called for the creation of a new organizational structure that includes an “innovation marshal” role — someone who is respected by both data scientists and field experts. <a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a> Given their knowledge and expertise in both areas, these people can gain the respect of the organization by developing and maintaining “high-bandwidth, bidirectional communication channels” that help ensure that algorithmic routines are able to adapt to environmental changes. <a id="reflink14" class="reflink" href="#ref14">14</a></p><p></p><p> Another bridge-building practice is called <em>model explainability</em> : describing the algorithmic models in a practical and comprehensible manner. For data scientists, such explainability can facilitate access to the expert knowledge needed to counteract the sources of algorithmic inertia; for domain experts, such explainability can help them develop a deep and intuitive understanding of how the model takes environmental changes into account. Model explainability establishes common ground between two groups of professionals who have different types of expertise. Such practices enable organizations to build bridges instead of just talking about them.</p><p></p><p> Organizations seeking to reap the benefits of powerful predictive analytics are increasingly confronting the problem of algorithmic inertia. Despite leveraging dynamic algorithms to adapt to changes in the environment, organizations may find that the results are not keeping pace with new developments. By exposing data and assumptions, periodically redesigning algorithmic routines, assuming that their models will break, and building bridges, organizations can increase the likelihood that their substantial investments in algorithmic solutions will pay off with better decision-making.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/predictive-models-can-lose-the-plot-heres-how-to-keep-them-on-track/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
