希望不是在沃尔沃汽车中，但这是现实，对吗？</p><p>但你提到的确实非常有趣，因为它也反过来了：就像，现在我们有了这些传感器，我们可以通过这个为客户提供哪些其他真正有价值的功能，当然，保护隐私考虑到等等？</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>这非常有趣，因为沃尔沃……我记得小时候我叔叔常说，“你想要一辆安全的汽车，你就买一辆沃尔沃。”它一直是安全的代名词，对于一家将安全体验作为主要目标之一的公司来说，退后一步想想，现在有了如此大量的数据和所有这些，真是太神奇了大量的处理，我可以想象有如此多的用例，对于 Sam 来说，正在被考虑。所以这真的非常令人鼓舞。</p><p>这里的路线图是什么样的？我的意思是，这是一种持续不断的创新构思方法，它会说：“在个人、安全和可持续这三大支柱上，我们还能做些什么？”提出这些想法并挑选好的想法并实施或不实施的过程是怎样的？</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren：</strong>我认为这些想法要么来自技术方面并从中真正受到启发，要么来自分析方面。通常，当新技术和真正以客户为中心的需求……它们相遇时，当然，我们的组织也具有执行这些需求的敏捷性。这确实是我们取得丰硕成果的地方。它通常是不同来源的混合：我想说的是创新和新方向。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>公司中有一种机制可以创造这种跨学科的灵感吗？</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren：</strong>是的，我会这么说。我想说，既有正式的机制，也有非正式的机制。作为一家汽车公司，沃尔沃汽车并不是超级大。当然也有较小的，但我认为这也是一个优势，我的意思是，几乎所有不同的步骤，从产品战略、设计、研发、工程，然后是后期阶段……</p><p>总部位于[瑞典]哥德堡，步行即可到达。美国部门距离我现在坐的地方实际上是50米，而另一个方向50米是碰撞测试设施和安全中心。</p><p>所以，我想说的是，建立联系和创建这种联系更容易——我该怎么说呢？ ——非正式创新活动。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>这就是相对较小的尺寸和托管确实非常有帮助的地方。拥有彼此接近的团队。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>谈论它很小很有趣，因为它肯定不是一家小公司。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>一切都是相对的，是的。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>我想一切都是相对的。当我们聊天时，我想到了我们之前交谈过的一些人，人们提到的反复出现的主题之一是，哦，从业务问题开始的想法：“你不没有人工智能并找到使用它的地方。你从一个业务问题开始，然后解决它。”但这是一个很好的组合——听起来有很多事情都是从业务问题开始的，但有趣的是，一旦这些流程到位，一旦这些技术到位，就会出现一个草根问题创新说：“好吧；我们如何使用它？我认为这是一个有趣的观点，但它并没有得到强烈的体现——或者也许我忘记了一些事情——但似乎并没有那么强烈地得到体现。这是一个很好的组合，也许适用于这种规模的组织……这个位于同一地点的组织。</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren：</strong>是的，尤其是在原型设计和构思阶段。但是，当然，在实际进入产品之前，需要经过更彻底的审查等等。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>沃尔沃对小型人工智能初创公司和公司进行了相当多的投资和收购。请告诉我们一些关于内部、供应商和合作伙伴公司的整体生态系统的信息，这些公司共同将您正在谈论的一些人工智能创意变为现实。是内部的吗？是外在的吗？是混合的吗？您如何看待生态系统？</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren：</strong>我肯定会说这是一个混合体。有些事情……我们需要自己做才能获得充分的理解，或者我们真正想在哪些领域处于领先地位，而在其他一些领域，我们肯定希望与在这些领域实力雄厚的其他公司合作。传统上来说，汽车是一种超级复杂的产品。它有数百或数千个不同的部分，所有这些部分都需要组装在一起。当然，这个领域传统上有很多供应商提供不同的零件。</p><p>最近，我们更多地致力于将软件实施引入内部，以提高开发过程的速度和敏捷性。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>这在汽车制造中似乎特别复杂，因为如果我思考汽车是如何开始的，它们是独立的系统。有制动系统、动力传动系统、空调和信息娱乐系统，所有这些都是独立的。这很好，因为这样我们就拥有了与信息娱乐系统和制动系统不同的特定标准——或者至少我希望会有这样的标准。但你要指出的是，其中每一个都可能使用来自不同区域的传感器，整个汽车如何独立变得更加复杂，但它也变得更加复杂，试图连接所有这些部件和让他们一起工作。</p><p>一方面，这似乎是人工智能的机遇，但同时也是挑战。</p><p><strong>安德斯·舍格伦：</strong>是的。这是100%真实的。这既是一个非常大的机会，但这也意味着这确实是核心挑战之一——我的意思是，如何建立对汽车内部和外部的统一理解。</p><p>我们谈论客户数字孪生和车辆数字孪生等等，从某种意义上说，这些方面可能意味着很多不同的事情。但是，当然，您所说的这些不同的系统传统上位于公司的不同部门，因此这也意味着需要大量的跨职能协作。但我们确实需要弥合这些组织边界。</p><p>我认为这确实是关键点之一，也就是说，为了成功采用分析和人工智能，这确实意味着公司的不同部门需要共同努力才能实现这一目标。因为否则，它就会变成一个筒仓。有些人并不会真正从中受益。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>你知道，这是真的。这是一个常见的主题，在 BCG 的工作中，我们有这样的经验法则 - 10:20:70 - 我们说 10% 是数据和算法，20% 是技术和数字平台，但 70% 是其中 % 是业务集成和实施，以及将组织的不同部分整合在一起。也许，这在一家汽车公司最为真实，正如您所说，山姆，在那里，看似不同的系统正在组合在一起创建一个更大的系统，但这些单元中的每一个都已单独完善，现在你也想要集体的完美。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>安德斯，我们谈论了很多关于沃尔沃的事情。您个人是如何对人工智能、数据、技术和分析产生兴趣的？你的起源故事是什么？</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren：</strong>我想我一直对计算机感兴趣。我的父亲确实是个瘾君子，所以我就是伴随着这个瘾君子长大的。</p><p>我最初是一名工程专业的学生，​​并获得了计算机科学硕士学位。然后我开始在哥德堡大学医院担任医学领域的研究工程师，然后很快发现为了真正利用数据——结论等来自数据……所以我然后进入了数理统计领域。</p><p>所以我读了博士学位。然后回到软件产品开发。一段时间后，我回到学术界工作了几年，做了博士后，然后在沃尔沃汽车公司获得了一个很好的机会。所以我基本上已经在这里呆了七年了。这就是我的一点历史。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>非常鼓舞人心。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong> Anders，我们还想问您一些快速问题，我们的想法是尽快回答。这些并不是沃尔沃特有的问题。</p><p>您对人工智能所做的最自豪的事情是什么？</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren：</strong>问题是大多数事情我都无法谈论。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>这也是一个很好的答案。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>你必须拭目以待。好吧，那么你对人工智能担心什么？</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren：</strong>担心吗？</p><p><strong>萨姆·兰斯博瑟姆：</strong>嗯嗯。</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren：</strong>哦，我想，当然，一个是长期的——那种奇点的东西。但我认为，距离现在更近了，可以这么说，我们确实看到了大型语言[模型]的超快速发展及其可以做的事情，以及那种不仅仅解决一个问题并给出解决方案的系统一个答案，但实际上可以按顺序产生一系列步骤。这是一种超级强大的技术，但超级强大的技术既可以用来做好事，也可以用来做坏事。</p><p>这既让我超级兴奋，又有点担心。 20年后的世界会是什么样子？</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>您最喜欢的不涉及技术的活动是什么？</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren：</strong>骑摩托车，但显然使用了技术。但它更像是……是的。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>涉及技术。一切事物都以某种方式涉及技术。</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren：</strong>是的，差不多。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>您小时候想要的第一个职业是什么？你长大后想做什么？</p><p><strong>安德斯·舍格伦：</strong>医生。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>嗯，这与您在医疗公司工作的第一份职业有关。</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren：</strong>是的，我这么认为，但后来我发现数学和那些东西非常令人兴奋，所以我进入了那个领域。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>未来您对人工智能最大的愿望是什么？您希望我们能从这些技术的出现中获得什么？</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren：</strong>如果说我们最大的愿望，我想那就是我们找到一种方法来利用它来实现我们的共同利益。我们需要找到一种方式让它融入社会，我想这确实是我最大的愿望。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>在相对较短的时间内，我们了解了数据、人工智能和技术的各种用途，了解了如何以新的方式制造汽车，以及人工智能和技术提供帮助和服务的所有不同方式驾驶它们的人。这真的很有启发，安德斯。感谢您的加入。</p><p> <strong>Anders Sjögren：</strong>谢谢你邀请我。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>感谢您的聆听。在我们的下一集中，Sam 和我采访了 LG Nova 的常驻企业家 Shilpa Prasad。请加入我们。</p><p><strong>艾莉森·莱德：</strong>感谢您聆听<cite>我、我自己和人工智能的演讲</cite>。和您一样，我们相信关于人工智能实施的对话不会从这个播客开始和结束。这就是为什么我们在 LinkedIn 上专门为像您这样的听众创建了一个群组。它被称为 AI for Leaders，如果您加入我们，您可以与节目创作者和主持人聊天，提出您自己的问题，分享您的见解，并获得来自<cite>MIT SMR</cite>和 BCG 的有关 AI 实施的宝贵资源。您可以通过访问<a href="https://mitsmr.com/AIforLeaders">mitsmr.com/AIforLeaders</a>来访问它。我们会将该链接放在演出笔记中，希望在那里见到您。</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/fueling-interciplin-innovation-with-ai-volvos-anders-sjogren/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>领导者将阻力转化为进步的五种方法</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ Five-ways-leaders-can-turn-pushback-into-progress/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ Five-ways-leaders-can-turn-pushback-into-progress/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 11:00:56 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Phillip G.

Even smart executives often fall into this trap, overestimating the degree and depth of their educational efforts.</p><p> Advocating might play a role at some point after educating, but ultimately, effective leaders assume that allowing people to voice concerns reaps benefits. Short term, the pushback might result in tweaks that will increase long-term acceptance and smooth implementation.</p><p> <strong>5. Signpost inflection points.</strong> As decisions, initiatives, and policies evolve, a leader&#39;s level of certainty and openness to pushback shifts. In the absence of leadership clarity about these inflection points, employees apply unspoken rules regarding pushback, such as the following:</p><ul><li> Rule A: If the leader has not made a final decision, then I can speak up and candidly share my perspectives.</li><li> Rule B: If the leader has a strong position or has made a final decision, then I support it or shut up.</li><li> Rule C: If I agitate on an issue long enough, leaders will yield.</li></ul><p> If unspoken rules A and B undergird the pushback dynamics, then leaders might overestimate the degree of support for an initiative or decision. Why? Because employees operating under rule B assume that requests for feedback are for theater or designed to manufacture buy-in; they self-censor or offer only token opposition. Consequently, dissenting and potentially valuable voices go silent.</p><p></p><p> Rule C animates pushback dynamics in precisely the opposite direction, with endless debate; this fosters a culture of complaint after decisions have been tweaked, modified, or finalized. Effective leaders know that openness does not provide a license for never-ending discussion; after all, pushback to the pushback can go on forever.</p><p> The best way to inhibit these silent rules from taking root is to clearly signpost inflection points during pushback. Leaders who camouflage their sentiments in the name of openness undermine the candor of the entire conversation. Instead, effective leaders share their level of openness to tweaking proposed plans, proclaiming when their sentiments have shifted, and clearly signaling when the time for pushback has ended.</p><h3> A Pushback Success Story</h3><p> Laurie Butz, the CEO of Capital Credit Union, routinely uses these guidelines to lean into pushback to fully understand what employees believe they are losing as new initiatives roll out. For example, as the COVID-19 threat faded, she sought to restart face-to-face all-employee meetings to enhance inclusiveness and engage in more robust, thoughtful discussions about pending initiatives. She believes that the educational process goes in both directions, which requires more face-to-face forums that encourage adherence to more productive discussion ground rules than screen-enabled venting.</p><p> Yet that announcement was greeted with considerable pushback by employees who faced a long commute to the twice-a-year gatherings. Some used online surveys to voice concerns about the expense and time, while others expressed their discontent directly to their immediate supervisor, arguing that “Zoom meetings worked pretty well during COVID.”</p><p> Butz acknowledged these concerns while respectfully justifying the in-person gathering because, after all, “you could have a Zoom wedding, but something important would be missing.” Similar messaging was echoed in more personal channels by her “ambassadors” (opinion leaders).</p><p></p><p> Over time, the in-person meetings (1) increased employee engagement, (2) renewed employee interest in being a part of the process, and (3) spawned more thoughtful discussions of key issues. Quantitative evidence backed up these observations. For example, participation in all-employee surveys increased from 60% to 91% after the in-person meetings resumed, and 83% of survey respondents reported that they were “highly engaged in their work.” Anecdotal evidence also emerged: Employees often left the in-person meetings inquiring, “When will we have another opportunity to meet like this?”</p><p></p><p> Suppressing pushback by repressing uncertainty, invoking power dynamics, and paying too much attention to the most vocal employees may well induce short-term conformity and compliance at the expense of <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/decision-downloading/">undermining long-term trust</a> . Adroitly and respectfully managing pushback involves an upfront time commitment that engages employees while supplying forward momentum. The bonus: Leaders learn to more subtly influence how employees interpret trends, events, and decisions and develop greater insight into emerging issues.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/five-ways-leaders-can-turn-pushback-into-progress/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> How ChatGPT Can and Can&#39;t Help Managers Design Better Job Roles</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-chatgpt-can-and-cant-help-managers-design-better-job-roles/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-chatgpt-can-and-cant-help-managers-design-better-job-roles/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 11:00:54 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Fangfang Zhang and Sharon K.

To fight it, managers need to offer employees more healthy and meaningful work. In surveys conducted in the United States by Gallup in 2022, 40% of employees reported that their job had a negative impact on their mental health, and around 30% said they frequently experience burnout. Moreover, US employee engagement hit a seven-year low, with only 32% of workers polled by Gallup saying they were engaged and 17% saying they were actively disengaged in 2022. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> Globally, employees&#39; lack of engagement has been estimated to cost employers $7.8 trillion — equivalent to 11% of the global gross domestic product. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a></p><p> The root causes of disengagement and work stress often lie in how an organization has designed people&#39;s jobs. Decades of extensive research consistently link poor work design with negative employee outcomes, including mental strain, high turnover, job dissatisfaction, decreased productivity, and impaired learning. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> Many companies are now striving to do better.</p><p></p><p> Unfortunately, our research indicates that many managers lack the necessary understanding to design high-quality jobs. This is where artificial intelligence technologies such as ChatGPT could play a key role, by bridging the manager knowledge gap and helping design high-quality work that benefits both employees and organizations. However, it is important for managers to first understand the pros and cons of using ChatGPT for work design. Let&#39;s explore some takeaways for managers that our research has revealed.</p><h3> Managerial Challenges: Mundane and Unfulfilling Jobs</h3><p> What factors determine whether a job is high quality? The <a href="https://www.futureofworkinstitute.com.au/smart-workdesign">SMART work design model</a> , a framework created by Sharon K. Parker, defines high-quality work as work that is <em>stimulating</em> (jobs with task variety and a chance to develop new skills), incorporates <em>mastery</em> (such as role clarity and job feedback), is <em>agentic</em> (such as job autonomy and change participation), is <em>relational</em> (where social support and positive teamwork are available), and is <em>tolerable</em> (with manageable work hours and reasonable levels of time pressure). <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p> Despite the benefits of well-designed jobs, poorly designed ones are still prevalent. According to the Gallup 2019 Great Jobs Survey, only 40% of employed Americans are engaged in jobs that possess SMART characteristics. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> On the other hand, 16% find themselves in jobs that lack essential SMART characteristics, and 44% have jobs that possess only some satisfactory SMART attributes. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p> A lack of knowledge among today&#39;s managers about job design might explain such findings. A study we recently conducted explored how people design jobs for others. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> Participants in an online simulation (Simulation 1) were asked to design an administrative job role. The half-time job was made up entirely of four photocopying and filing tasks. Participants were asked to make the job full time by selecting four additional tasks from a list of 11, including five repetitive photocopying and filing tasks and six more-meaningful and interesting tasks, such as greeting visitors or helping colleagues arrange meetings.</p><p></p><p> Participants were scored on a 0 to 4 range, with a higher score indicating the creation of a more stimulating work design. Almost half (45%) of university-level management students and professionals/managers working in human services industries tended to incorporate repetitive and monotonous work, demonstrating a knowledge gap when it comes to quality work design.</p><p> In a second simulation (Simulation 2), participants were asked to act like a manager and solve workforce problems in four scenarios. In each scenario, the job role design was clearly poor. To fix the problems, participants rated how likely they were to adopt strategies from a list that included both “fixing the worker” approaches, which attributed problems to the employee, and “fixing the poor work design” approaches, which acknowledged the poor-quality job design.</p><p> For example, in one scenario, a warehouse worker consistently failed to meet 50% of the timed deadlines in gathering products and delivering them to dispatch — despite frequently running to pick up goods. While the majority of participants focused on choices that improved the work design (for example, “Involve the employee and their colleagues in a review to identify ways in which their work could be organized better” or “Reorganize the work so that tasks do not need to be timed”), a surprising number of participants (40%) still chose strategies aimed at fixing the worker (such as “Discreetly observe the person&#39;s behavior to see how fast they are moving”). These findings validate our finding that there is a lack of knowledge of work design among managers and staff members.</p><h3> Generative AI Can Suggest Strong Work Design</h3><p> In the study&#39;s next phase, we researched whether an AI-powered tool such as ChatGPT could help managers do better. The short answer: ChatGPT has the potential to enhance decision-making in work design. However, it is important for managers to understand what ChatGPT can and cannot do well.</p><p> We used ChatGPT to make hypothetical work design decisions for the administrative work design simulation (Simulation 1). We ran the simulation task 20 times, using a new, independent chat session with the same prompt each time in ChatGPT. The generative AI model consistently chose enrichment tasks out of the provided list, outperforming both students and professionals/managers in creating interesting and meaningful work. ChatGPT&#39;s performance was similar to that of work design experts. </p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand-column"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Work Design Decision Scores in Different Groups</h4><p class="caption"> When participants in Simulation 1 were asked to design an administrative job role, 45% mostly chose to assign the worker repetitive and monotonous tasks (scored from 0 to 4 indicating the number of enriched tasks selected by the participants). When participants in Simulation 2 were asked to address problems in four poorly designed job roles, 40% chose strategies aimed at fixing the worker rather than the poor design (scored from 1 to 5 indicating the extent to which participants will adopt the strategies, 1=extremely unlikely, 5=extremely likely). </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023_1005_Parker_Fig1-1.png" alt="Work Design Decision Scores in Different Groups"></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p> We then tasked ChatGPT to tackle Simulation 2, addressing the four managerial workforce scenarios (including the theoretical warehouse worker mentioned above), choosing strategies from a list. In each scenario, ChatGPT consistently chose strategies aimed at fixing the work design (good strategies for employee well-being, motivation, and performance) over those focused on fixing the worker. As in Simulation 1, ChatGPT outperformed students, managers, and professionals in its focus on work design to solve the workforce problems.</p><p> However, ChatGPT did not score as well as the work design experts in Simulation 2, suggesting that some caution is warranted. For example, in one session addressing the warehouse worker who was missing deadlines, ChatGPT scored 4 overall but chose the strategy “I would give the employee and her colleagues a bonus when they meet the allocated times,” which ignores the role&#39;s unreasonable time allocation.</p><p></p><h3> One Big Lesson: Specific Prompts Are Key</h3><p> To further assess ChatGPT&#39;s ability to generate suggestions independently, we ran the Simulation 2 work design tasks without providing a multiple-choice solution list. We ran each test in a new account with the chat history function turned off and in independent new chats so that the output of ChatGPT would not be affected by previous inputs.</p><p> To begin with, the outcome was worrying. When we simply instructed the AI model to “provide effective strategies to address the problem” in the missed-deadlines scenario, ChatGPT tended to address problems by trying to fix the worker and creating old-fashioned <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-progressive-roots-of-management-science/">Taylorist approaches to work systems</a> , such as conducting time and motion studies. For example, ChatGPT suggested solutions such as time management skills and additional training to help the warehouse employee, who we named Karen, improve her performance (for example, “Focus on improving Karen&#39;s speed and accuracy in locating and gathering items from the warehouse”). It also recommended providing performance feedback and incentives to motivate Karen to move faster (for instance, “By linking performance with rewards, Karen will be encouraged to focus on improving her speed and efficiency”). Each of these solutions implicitly assumes that the worker&#39;s motivation or ability is the problem rather than the work design.</p><p> After learning that such an open-ended approach was not optimal, we next instructed ChatGPT to address this same scenario using specific prompts: “Consider designing a good-quality job for Karen”; “Consider Karen&#39;s health, well-being, motivation, satisfaction, and work meaningfulness”; and “Consider Karen&#39;s work design.” The AI model then provided solutions related to improving Karen&#39;s work design, including the following:</p><ul><li> Reviewing time allocation and workload to set realistic time goals.</li><li> Involving Karen in the decision-making process and seeking her input on ways to improve her job.</li><li> Offering supportive feedback and recognition to enhance employee satisfaction and motivation.</li><li> Providing adequate training and skill development opportunities to boost confidence and engagement.</li></ul><p> These strategies would boost Karen&#39;s SMART work design characteristics, increasing the tolerability of demands, enhancing agency, boosting mastery, and making the work more stimulating.</p><p> ChatGPT also suggested solutions such as fostering a supportive work environment, encouraging team support and collaboration, offering career advancement opportunities, and promoting work-life balance. These solutions all align well with extensive research on work design and well-being and would make the job “SMART-er” and hence result in a healthier and more productive employee.</p><p> We learned from this particular experiment with ChatGPT that generative AI can make valuable work design decisions, but managers need to provide clear instructions that prioritize outcomes for the worker. For example, asking ChatGPT to “design a high-quality job” rather than simply requesting “good work design” can generate more relevant and effective strategies. Therefore, to enhance the quality of strategy suggestions generated by ChatGPT, managers need to mention specific, desirable goals in their question prompts, such as high-quality jobs; employees&#39; health, well-being, and motivation; and work meaningfulness.</p><p></p><p> One piece of good news: Managers who do not frequently use ChatGPT can learn how to write effective prompts via the ChatGPT tool itself. For example, when asked, “How can one craft a well-structured and clear prompt to effectively address work design challenges?” ChatGPT provided a step-by-step guide on how to write effective prompts. ChatGPT advised us to identify the core issue and be specific — suggestions that could be applied to work design by using prompts such as “Design high-quality work that enhances positive team interaction and collaboration for the sales team” or “Design work that is meaningful to facilitate employee acceptance of technological changes in their work.”</p><p> The experiment also showed that effective prompts need to be reviewed and tested. Managers who struggle to write effective ChatGPT prompts can improve their skills by using a prompt such as “The following is a prompt aimed at asking ChatGPT for advice from a work design expert&#39;s perspective. Please analyze and suggest improvements to get actionable and practical advice from ChatGPT.” In this case, ChatGPT will provide more specific suggestions that drive better-quality outputs.</p><h3> Five Lessons for Managers</h3><p> To address the pervasive issue of poor work role design and its detrimental effects, embracing innovative solutions is crucial. Based on our research, ChatGPT has emerged as a promising AI-powered tool to help managers design healthier and more productive jobs. But it&#39;s not a panacea and needs to be used wisely. Our advice for managers:</p><p> <strong>ChatGPT cannot replace training.</strong> Managers need to be <em>aware</em> that worker problems can emerge from poor work design and that work design, in turn, can affect worker well-being, motivation, and work meaningfulness. This means that before using ChatGPT to design better jobs, managers still need basic training on work design concepts. To get started on this topic, see the related article “ <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-well-designed-work-makes-us-smarter/">How Well-Designed Work Makes Us Smarter</a> ” and the <a href="https://www.smartworkdesign.com.au/">SMART Work Design site</a> .</p><p> <strong>Managers need to be supported in their goal to create well-designed work.</strong> Managers need to be <em>motivated</em> to create better jobs for their staffs. This means managers themselves need roles in which the creation of healthy employee work roles is seen as a legitimate and important responsibility, versus having their sole focus be the bottom line. For example, if managers get promoted purely on the basis of productivity achievements, they will not have much motivation to design SMART work for their teams.</p><p> <strong>Managers need healthy jobs themselves.</strong> Managers need sufficient time to be able to pay attention to how well their staff members&#39; jobs are designed. This means managers&#39; own jobs need to be <em>tolerable</em> and not excessively time-pressured.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Managers need to learn ChatGPT prompting skills.</strong> Managers should be encouraged to use generative AI to help with work design challenges, but they need clear and comprehensive instructions as to how to use it effectively. For example, managers need to be specific and to mention goals such as employee well-being and motivation when seeking work design recommendations from ChatGPT.</p><p> <strong>ChatGPT will augment, not replace, people in designing better jobs.</strong> Unlike simulations, real-life job design situations are often characterized by their ambiguity and complexity, with numerous variables that can influence outcomes. Real situations require a deep understanding of context, human emotions, social dynamics, and political and ethical considerations, all of which can be challenging for an AI tool like ChatGPT to fully grasp. We recommend using ChatGPT as a <em>complement</em> to human managers rather than as a <em>replacement</em> for them.</p><p> By incorporating ChatGPT&#39;s suggestions alongside human expertise, organizations can foster higher staff engagement, job satisfaction, and overall performance. Achieving such a synergy between managers and AI can pave the way for a better future for work design and employee experience.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-chatgpt-can-and-cant-help-managers-design-better-job-roles/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Role of Culture in Enabling Change</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-role-of-culture-in-enabling-change/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-role-of-culture-in-enabling-change/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 11:00:50 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Jonathan Knowles, B.

It&#39;s more helpful to think of culture as the nervous system of an organization. In biology, the central nervous system is the pathway by which thoughts in our brains are translated into actions by our muscles, and how our experience of acting in the world updates our brain&#39;s understanding of the world. In organizations, this means thinking of culture as the transmission mechanism by which a company both communicates its intended strategy to the front lines and receives feedback and intelligence from the field about whether the strategy is achieving the intended outcomes in the market.</p><p> This nervous system metaphor illuminates the factors behind two of the most common reasons given for business failure: “We had a great strategy but failed to execute it” (a failure in the communication from the center to the field) or “Our leaders surrounded themselves with people who were afraid to tell them how the business was really performing” (a failure to relay important feedback and intelligence from the field). Both are examples of the failure to create an effective transmission mechanism from thought to action and back again.</p><p></p><p> A strategic approach to culture involves an active effort to create the environment and infrastructure to promote the necessary information flow between strategy and execution — treating them as complementary components of purposeful doing. These tools can include town halls, customer site visits, postmortems on lost bids, employee engagement surveys and any number of other mechanisms that facilitate the exchange of valuable information about what is (or is not) working. These tools nurture a culture of contextual awareness and adaptability that enables the business to perform better in its current environment and to prepare for future success.</p><p></p><p> There are certain aspects of culture that are universally desirable and others whose value is more context-dependent. When Donald Sull and Charles Sull analyzed 1.4 million employee reviews on Glassdoor, they <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/10-things-your-corporate-culture-needs-to-get-right/">identified four key factors</a> that contribute to a positive corporate culture (respect, leadership, compensation/benefits, and job security). But when organizational change is the imperative, this requires deliberately adding context-dependent factors to the culture.</p><p> The importance of adaptation has been the defining theme of our earlier articles about <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-essence-of-strategy-is-now-how-to-change/">strategy</a> ,<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/effective-innovation-begins-with-strategic-direction/">innovation</a> , and <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/leading-change-means-changing-how-you-lead/">leadership</a> . To illustrate how different change objectives require different choices about culture, we&#39;ll draw on the corporate human resources leadership experiences of one of the authors (Melanie Hughes) across her career. At three different companies, she used three different strategies first to determine the change need and then to identify the characteristics of an effective culture to operationalize this change priority.</p><h3> Identify the Organization&#39;s Change Priority</h3><p> One of the most important — but often overlooked — responsibilities of HR is to analyze what aspects of the corporate culture are enabling the company to perform well in its current environment and what aspects are inhibiting its ability to act in the way and/or with the speed that the context requires.</p><p> The first step in this process is investigating the type of change that the business, unit, or team should be trying to achieve. As we described in “ <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-essence-of-strategy-is-now-how-to-change/">The Essence of Strategy Is Now How to Change</a> ,” there are three approaches to making such changes:</p><ul><li> Reinforce magnitude: Refine and deepen the actions that are contributing to high levels of relevance for key stakeholders and distinctiveness from competition.</li><li> Reimagine activity: Refresh the approaches, channels, and tools being used to pursue the current strategy.</li><li> Rethink direction: Reinvent the business model to deliver the levels of relevance and distinctiveness necessary for an economically viable business.</li></ul><p> Based on its understanding of the desired form of change, HR can identify the mechanisms to achieve the desired results, which staff members are best placed to play the role of change agent (those tasked with infusing new elements into the culture), and who can play the role of culture carrier (demonstrating how these new elements can be integrated with the legacy elements of the culture that are being maintained).</p><p> We review each of the change types and what kinds of tools and actions can best enable each one, drawing from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/melaniehughes/details/experience/">Hughes&#39;s experiences</a> as the chief administrative officer at Gilt Groupe and the chief human resources officer (CHRO) at Moody&#39;s and Tribune Media.</p><p></p><h4> Change Type 1: Reinforce Magnitude</h4><p> Launched in 2007, New York-based Gilt Groupe was a pioneer of the luxury goods flash sale. The company was in hypergrowth mode from 2009 to 2012, when Hughes was the chief administrative officer: expanding from women&#39;s clothing to offering menswear and travel as well, launching operations in Japan, raising capital at a valuation of more than $1 billion in 2011, and actively planning for an initial public offering. With Gilt Groupe as a recognized market leader in the fashion space and a preferred partner of luxury goods manufacturers, the change priority was to reinforce magnitude — that is, expand the actions that were making the company relevant and distinctive — by replicating the successful core business model in new categories.</p><p> The central challenge was determining how to combine the entrepreneurial, growth-focused orientation of the existing culture with the knowledge sharing and repeatable processes necessary to support expansion into multiple new categories and manage their different stages of development. Two of the key enablers of this change were revised messaging by the CEO in the company&#39;s all-hands meetings and adjustments to the incentive schemes for executives and managers.</p><p> In both cases, the prior focus on growth alone was replaced by an emphasis on manageable growth, efficiency, and profitability. The CEO assumed the role of principal change agent, focusing on stories that celebrated costs avoided and efficiencies achieved, not just revenues won. The incentive programs were adjusted, with the focus on the performance of the individual businesses shifting instead to a balance of contributions to “Gilt corporate” and individual business performance. Specific individuals were identified as culture carriers because they had already demonstrated the behaviors of knowledge sharing, mentorship, and effective delegation — three key aspects of the new culture. These individuals were given increased responsibilities and promotions as visible signs of recognition (in addition to nonpublic compensation increases) to underscore the behaviors that the company now valued.</p><p> These actions paved the way for organizational changes that the previous culture would have resisted as bureaucratization infringing on the autonomy of the individual businesses. Instead, the centralization of certain services and infrastructure (such as marketing, development, finance, and recruiting) was accepted as the means to enable the businesses to scale faster.</p><h4> Change Type 2: Reimagine Activity</h4><p> The context of Hughes&#39;s most recent role, as CHRO at Moody&#39;s (2017 to 2021), was, in contrast, one in which reimagining activity was the appropriate stance, given the objective of innovating the approaches and tools being used to pursue the existing strategy. Moody&#39;s comprised a highly successful but mature ratings business and a fast-growing analytics business. There was rising cultural tension as each organization championed the merits of its approach to risk, innovation, customers, and staffing. Recognizing the incompatibility of these modes of operating, the CEO and president of each business worked with HR leadership on a program designed to evolve the corporate culture while also establishing an operating infrastructure and a performance management system specifically designed to support the needs of Moody&#39;s Analytics.</p><p> Several organizational initiatives were developed to support the change. Among them were expanding the corporate values to include elements such as speed and innovation (primarily associated with the analytics business) and to celebrate examples of those values in communications to employees and on investor calls. Leadership development programs were established to cross-train managers on the critical skills for each line of business and identify change agents who could cross-seed desired behaviors into each business. A new talent-planning process called Talent to Value identified the roles with the greatest strategic impact on each business and the skills required to perform those roles. This enabled leaders to understand which internal candidates were truly qualified for roles and where they needed to look for external talent to fill critical roles and support the new culture.</p><p> The CEO explicitly articulated a change from the previous “promote from within” culture, emphasizing the benefits of a broader and more diverse employee base to the performance of both businesses. These communications included LinkedIn posts from the CEO, signaling both internally and externally what was required to progress in the modern Moody&#39;s. This messaging was reinforced by the publicity given to new hires and internal promotions, emphasizing how these employees embodied the desired skills and traits described in the Talent to Value effort.</p><p> Reimagining these activities supported the transition of Moody&#39;s to a multibusiness firm with cultures, structures, and skills sets appropriate for each entity. The stock grew 60% in two years, reflecting a strong profit performance of the legacy Moody&#39;s ratings business combined with a higher multiple attributed to the growth potential of the analytics business.</p><h4> Change Type 3: Rethink Direction</h4><p> Hughes&#39;s time as CHRO at Tribune Media (2013 to 2016) represented an entirely different challenge. Tribune Media had gone through the largest media industry bankruptcy in US history in 2008, and as it emerged from four years of bankruptcy proceedings in 2012, the priority was to rethink its direction by establishing a business based on viable economics. A creative and action-oriented CEO was recruited for this purpose. The company adopted a strategy to spin off the legacy print journalism assets into a separate company (Tribune Publishing), invest heavily to grow the digital media and content-creation capabilities of Tribune Media, and make selective acquisitions in the broadcast business to build the necessary economies of scale.</p><p> For a business that had been beaten down by years in the bankruptcy courts and a relentless focus on cost cutting, the new strategy necessitated a complete cultural reboot. Certain behavioral norms — aversion to risk, a focus on the short term, reluctance to take on additional responsibility — had become ingrained during the bankruptcy years and needed to be reset. The CEO and Hughes recruited a new executive team ready to establish the type of culture required to support the new strategy. They, in turn, brought in new leaders and employees to start to transform their teams. The leadership team worked together to identify “Trib traits” — the set of values and competencies that would encourage new behaviors, which included “curious and courageous,” “competing with passion,” and “exemplifying leadership.”</p><p></p><p> The Trib traits became the blueprint for recruiting new employees and for a new performance evaluation and rewards system. The latter now tied fully 50% of managerial bonuses to the demonstration of competencies, to emphasize that how things got done was as important as the outcome. (Historically, bonuses had been entirely based on financial results.) This shift was reinforced in newly established televised town halls, where the CEO spoke about doing the <em>right</em> thing rather than doing the <em>thing</em> right to give employees the license to venture away from the safe path and experiment with new ways of operating — as was appropriate for a business emerging from bankruptcy and competing in the dynamic environment of digital media and entertainment.</p><p> As the above cases illustrate, the enablers of cultural change vary according to the type of change that an organization is trying to achieve.

The year started with Amazon and Salesforce<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3685936/tech-layoffs-in-2023-a-timeline.html?page=2">cutting 18,000 and 8,000 people</a> , respectively, and sector momentum grew into the spring. An article in the April/May 2023 issue of <cite>Fortune</cite> magazine asserted that companies were “ <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-finance-crypto-making-seismic-110000390.html">swapping exuberance for efficiency</a> ” and pointed out that they had collectively laid off more than 150,000 people since January. (By August, that number was up to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/07/tech-industry-layoffs-2023/">nearly 225,000</a> .)</p><p> An article in that same issue of <cite>Fortune</cite> focused on Salesforce, asking whether there was a conflict between the company&#39;s layoffs and CEO Marc Benioff&#39;s commitment to empathetic leadership and sustainability. That&#39;s a fair question, but the article went further, declaring that Benioff&#39;s dilemma could “serve as a referendum on the whole <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/m-willing-bullets-marc-benioff-153000800.html">model of stakeholder capitalism</a> .” If that&#39;s true, then why aren&#39;t the collective woes across the tech industry, which another article declared “ <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/over-150-000-people-let-153000599.html">a confession of bad management</a> ,” a referendum on <em>shareholder</em> capitalism?</p><p></p><p> There&#39;s a serious inconsistency in how the business world sees sustainability. Whenever a company that prioritizes sustainability gets in trouble, people say the leaders took their eye off the ball. But when companies stumble while pursuing the “normal” strategy of maximizing profits above all — which is, by the way, wrongly implied to be the opposite of sustainability — their troubles are rarely blamed on that single-minded focus.</p><p></p><h3> Sustainability as Scapegoat</h3><p> The burden of proof on sustainability became crystal clear when, in 2021, activist investors and the board ousted the CEO of Danone, the French multinational food company, in a dramatic move that made headlines across the world. CEO Emmanuel Faber had faced harsh criticism for the company&#39;s financial performance versus that of its competitors, but here&#39;s how some of the press approached it at the time: The <cite>Financial Times</cite> editorial board&#39;s take: “ <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/668d9544-28db-4ad7-9870-1f6671623ac5">Danone: A Case Study in the Pitfalls of Purpose</a> .” <cite>Forbes</cite> : “ <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/frankvangansbeke/2021/03/20/sustainability-and-the-downfall-of-danone-ceo-faber-12/?sh=7dc8835b16de">Sustainability and the Downfall of Danone CEO Faber</a> .” <cite>Time</cite> : “ <a href="https://time.com/6121684/emmanuel-faber-danone-interview/">A Top CEO Was Ousted After Making His Company More Environmentally Conscious. Now He&#39;s Speaking Out</a> .”</p><p> Unfortunately, this two-year-old story has legs. I was recently speaking to leaders of a big consumer packaged goods company, and one of the execs expressed skepticism about sustainability, pointing to what had happened at Danone (and at Unilever, which has also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/unilever-under-pressure-show-sustainability-focus-is-good-business-2022-02-09/">taken heat about its sustainability focus</a> ).</p><p> The finger-pointing at sustainability is, if anything, accelerating in some circles; to use modern parlance, it just triggers some people. Without diving into the morass of the anti-ESG movement, I think it&#39;s clear that some prominent voices will blame sustainability for <em>any</em> corporate trouble. When Silicon Valley Bank went under, for example, some pundits and politicians hit the airwaves to claim, ludicrously, that it was because the company had <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2023/03/15/silicon-valley-bank-failure-republicans-blame-diversity-woke/11472710002/">mentioned its diversity and inclusion efforts</a> in its proxy statement.</p><p> Blaming sustainability for financial woes just rings true for most execs. But <em>why</em> ?</p><p> I believe it&#39;s about a deeply flawed base assumption: Sustainability, even as companies embrace it like never before, is still generally assumed to be a drag on earnings and to <em>always</em> add to costs. But that&#39;s never been remotely true.</p><p> The idea that sustainability is a trade-off or is incompatible with financial responsibility is false. Some of the companies most famously focused on sustainability, such as Walmart and Ikea, are relentless cost cutters and have fit their environmental and social efforts into that strategy. These companies know that sustainability not only can cut expenses but also slashes risk, drives innovation and revenues, and builds intangible or brand value. It&#39;s not true that running a business in a sustainable fashion always costs more, although new ways of operating don&#39;t always pay off quickly. And, to be fair, the sustainability community — and that includes me — has sometimes implied as much.</p><p></p><p> But let&#39;s go back to the burden on sustainability and try a quick mental exercise. If a focus on sustainability causes failures, then are the companies that focus only on shareholder profits always successful? Of course not. The failure rate for companies is high: Roughly 50% of <a href="https://www.chamberofcommerce.org/small-business-statistics/">small businesses close</a> within about five years. Even among the Fortune 500 giants, failure is the norm. Of the original list in 1955, <a href="https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/fortune-500-firms-1955-v-2017-only-12-remain-thanks-to-the-creative-destruction-that-fuels-economic-prosperity/">only 60</a> of them survived until the late 2010s. Obsessing over shareholder value didn&#39;t save 88% of the biggest companies.</p><p> All companies, at some point, emphasize a strategic focus. Consider a sample list of core strategies — some fads, some lasting additions to the management arsenal — that companies have embraced across a century: mass production, specialization, product differentiation, quality, safety, customer satisfaction, employee happiness, cost cutting, reengineering, agile and lean development, data-driven decision-making. Companies that embraced these things often outcompeted others, but none of those core strategies was ever the <em>only</em> factor in their success.</p><p> Companies rise and fall for diverse reasons. The most celebrated success stories, like those profiled in the influential book <cite><a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/bhag.html">Built to Last</a></cite> , can also face scrutiny over time. Decline occurs when companies fail to adapt to sectoral transformations (Blockbuster), neglect technological shifts (Kodak), or lose brand relevance when they fail to attract younger consumers as their core audience ages (a fate shared by numerous apparel and consumer packaged goods brands).</p><p> So, in that context, what really happened with Danone? Is it possible that sustainability was the problem? Sure. But perhaps it was something more nuanced. In his book <cite><a href="https://www.harpercollinsleadership.com/books/purpose-profit/ ">Purpose &amp; Profit</a></cite> , Harvard professor George Serafeim analyzed how Danone was doing at the time of the CEO&#39;s ouster and found that the company was underperforming peers not just on financial outcomes but also on <em>sustainability</em> outcomes: The intentions and plans were solid, but the results lagged. Serafeim concluded, “Maybe Danone is underperforming not in spite of its focus on impact but because it&#39;s failing to generate enough impact.” Whether this conclusion is correct is the right debate to be having rather than simply chalking up the company&#39;s problems to sustainability.</p><h3> Stop the Blame Game</h3><p> The good news is that sustainability must now be mainstream or attention-seekers wouldn&#39;t find it worth attacking. It&#39;s becoming core to how business is done, with evidence everywhere — signs like increased regulation and transparency demands from stakeholders, sustainability reports issued by nearly every large company, and countless courses added to business school curricula globally.</p><p></p><p> Given how widespread sustainability efforts are now, perhaps it&#39;s time to do something paradoxical. Could we make sustainability in business more important by lowering the intensity of focus? This does not mean going light on the issues sustainability is grounded in — like climate change and inequality, which are, quite literally, deadly serious — but instead just turning down the heat. Can we normalize sustainability and stop blaming it for anything that goes wrong at companies with a purpose and vision? And can we stop crediting it for being the only factor that drives some companies&#39; success? I&#39;m willing to stipulate, for example, that sustainability darling Patagonia also succeeds because it has <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/travel-backpacks/patagonia-black-hole-mini-mlc-travel-backpack-review-a1476285024/">kick-ass products</a> that last a long time and a culture that <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Patagonia-EI_IE5474.11,20.htm">attracts employees</a> and customers.</p><p> It&#39;s time to truly embed sustainability into business and treat it like any other unquestioned part of operations (think HR, R&amp;D, and safety). Sustainability need not be the scapegoat or the hero. It can just be a powerful way to do business and stay relevant in a fast-changing world … and help society and the planet thrive.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-burden-of-proof-for-corporate-sustainability-is-too-high/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Want More Clarity on Generative AI?

Never before have so many people become so excited by a technology program. Within five days of ChatGPT&#39;s release in November 2022, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/05/technology/chatgpt-ai-twitter.html">more than 1 million people</a> (including me) had logged on to try it out. If financial investments are a predictor of growth, then the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.de/~/media/mckinsey/locations/europe%20and%20middle%20east/deutschland/news/presse/2023/2023-06-14%20mgi%20genai%20report%2023/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier-vf.pdf">$12 billion invested in generative AI</a> in the first five months of 2023 shows the depth of commitment.</p><p> To get a sense of current momentum and direction, I ran a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74OaRCKn92k">research webinar last month on the impact of generative AI</a> on the workplace. Some 260 executives from organizations in Australia, Europe, Japan, and the United States joined me to describe their current use of generative AI in human capital domains. What I heard is that generative AI is a top priority for many CEOs, experiments abound alongside ambiguity, and organizations are already beginning to use artificial intelligence to augment their human capital strategies. I&#39;ll share more details about those findings in a moment.</p><p></p><p> I wanted to hear directly from practitioners because it seems to me that, as with the previous era-defining event — the COVID-19 pandemic — and its <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/making-sense-of-the-future/">impact on the workplace</a> , imagining what is ahead with this new technology is a tough call. As with the emergence of hybrid work and work-from-home initiatives in response to the pandemic, figuring out the right approaches to generative AI is a process replete with ambiguity, experiments, and changes of mind. In other words, it is a learning process driven both by the initiative of individuals and the strategies of organizations.</p><p> Like the response to the pandemic, debate and action around gen AI are moving fast.</p><p></p><p> Two facts are emerging. First, this is a rapidly developing technology. The size of investment gives a sense of this. So, too, does the volume of experimentation: One executive told me, “We have created a head of generative AI with a role simply to moderate and make sense of the hundreds of experiments we have running on any day.” Second, unlike previous workplace technologies, generative AI is not being positioned as a substitute for routine tasks — either analytical tasks, like keeping records or providing repetitive customer-oriented services, or manual tasks, like picking and sorting products or performing routine assembly. Instead, it&#39;s a technology with the potential to hit at the heart of nonroutine analytical work. This is knowledge work, such as forming a hypothesis, creating content, recommending medical diagnostics, or making a sales pitch. The source of this impact is generative AI&#39;s growing capacity to understand natural language. Around 25% of the total work time of knowledge workers is spent on the kinds of creative tasks that generative AI is beginning to get good at.</p><p> Yet, like during the early days of the pandemic and hybrid work, much is currently conjecture. There will certainly be pushback, changes of direction, and believers and resisters, just as there has been throughout the ongoing debate about hybrid work. There will be many experiments before leaders begin to develop their own narratives about how best to support their workers in these complex and ambiguous times.</p><p></p><h3> Experiments, Projections, and the Great Ambiguity</h3><p> The potential for generative AI to very quickly have a real impact in the workplace is fueling the attention it&#39;s getting. Consider the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#key-insights">McKinsey report on generative AI</a> published in June 2023. McKinsey asked a group of technology experts at what point they believed generative AI would substitute for a number of human tasks. It then compared those estimates with pre-gen AI projections made in 2017 about when human performance might be achievable by technology. What is striking is the extent to which their estimated timelines have contracted. For one work task, for example — “coordination with multiple agents” — the experts in 2017 estimated a timeline of substitution that ranged from 2035 to 2058. Today, they estimate that happening from 2023 to 2035. That feels very soon. As important, in 2017, the estimate for when we&#39;d see technology achieve human-level performance for the task of “creativity” was 2030 to 2045; today, the projection is from 2025 to 2030. These dates are for tasks where technology performance is expected to match median human performance. For top-quartile human performance, the timelines are pushed out somewhat.</p><p> How do we make sense of this? What I learned from observing the <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-increase-collaborative-productivity-in-a-pandemic/">impact of the pandemic on work</a> is that watching closely and asking questions of people in the field about their current lived reality is a useful practice. So my Sept. 19 webinar was essentially a listening process. Many executives came from human capital functions, so their interest was primarily in the people side of their business.</p><p> I began by asking where generative AI currently sits on the leadership agenda. Over half of attendees (52%) agreed with the statement “It is a CEO priority where leadership teams are discussing impact.” Only 13% said “It is not yet on the agenda in any meaningful way.” This is a topic that is definitely consuming bandwidth at the top levels of organizations across the world.</p><p></p><p> Generative AI is at the top of leaders&#39; agendas — but what about the scope of debate? What issues are coming forward as people talk through its consequences? For the webinar, I focused on a central aspect of this question: machines and creativity. The technologists in the McKinsey panel estimated that human creativity will be achieved by generative AI within the time span of 2025 to 2030, but what did this group of leaders believe? This, for me, is an important question because the McKinsey panelists are technology experts. I have a hunch that people like them will overestimate technological progress, whereas people like me (psychologists) will overestimate human progress.</p><p> What is fascinating is the lack of agreement among webinar attendees about whether they think human creativity at the top quartile will be achieved by gen AI from 2023 to 2030: Just 10% strongly agreed, while 34% agreed, 22% neither agreed or disagreed, 30% disagreed, and 4% strongly disagreed. I ran a Menti (a quick survey at the website Mentimeter) to collect participants&#39; real-time thoughts and asked why they had come to their conclusions. Within seconds, more than 80 comments had emerged: Those who agreed pointed out that creativity can be broken down into logical steps; that creativity sits on a lot of data; that prompts will be more important than AI; and that use cases, such as songs, already demonstrate creativity. Those who disagreed described how generative AI would augment, not substitute for, creative people and asserted that creativity was about empathy and vulnerability, that humans can generate new ideas, while AI pulls from the past, and that governments will provide regulation. Those who did not know said there are simply too many unknown unknowns.</p><p> For me, the takeaway here is the sheer richness of conversation and variance in opinions about generative AI. These are debates we need to be open about and continue to have.</p><p> I wondered, of course, how generative AI is currently being experimented with and used. My interest is in the human capital agenda and how generative AI will impact the everyday experiences of workers. One of the “promises” of AI, according to the McKinsey report, is a productivity boost from the automation of a wide variety of activities. For knowledge workers, this will come by technology either substituting for or augmenting tasks such as creating connections, retrieving stored data, personalizing content, automating activities, increasing the speed of response, and collaborating.</p><p> I asked about the current velocity of the use of generative AI in three human capital domains: talent development (like recruitment, induction, and career management), productivity (like skills training and managing collaboration), and change management (like internal knowledge management). I was interested in the current use of generative AI in each domain and the use cases. Of course, the data set of attendees comprised self-selected people who had an interest in generative AI, but still, what is clear is that there are many, many experiments currently underway.</p><p></p><p> The human capital domain with the greatest reported use of generative AI right now is “internal knowledge management.” Forty-six percent of attendees said they are experimenting in this sphere, with use cases such as creating communications, conducting market research analysis, finding resources and competencies, and engaging in employee listening. Almost as many attendees (44%) reported using gen AI for recruitment, with use cases such as creating job advertisements, developing simple approval flows, and onboarding new hires. About a third of attendees (34%) said they&#39;re using gen AI for skills training, with use cases that include self-directed learning, the creation of learning content, and virtual reality-based training. And 23% said they&#39;re using the technology for assessment and feedback, with use cases such as developing bespoke assessments, improving performance feedback, designing career paths, and creating chatbots for employees.</p><p> I feel that what I captured in this research webinar is a sense of the sheer depth of conversation and experimentation taking place right now across the world. How to think about and use generative AI is being debated in the C-suite as use cases are being created and tough questions (like the relationship between machines and creativity) are being debated. For organizations to be aligned with this emerging narrative, it is imperative that they experiment freely and observe closely.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/want-more-clarity-on-generative-ai-experiment-widely/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Sound Business: The Promise of Audio Machine Learning Technologies</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/listen-up-machine-learning-holds-great-promise-for-audio-applications/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/listen-up-machine-learning-holds-great-promise-for-audio-applications/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 11:00:43 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Mark Purdy. <p>Mark Purdy ( <a href="https://twitter.com/mjpurdyecon">@mjpurdyecon</a> ) is managing director of Purdy &amp; Associates, an independent economics and technology research company.</p> ]]>;</dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Customer Data]]></category><category><![CDATA[Product Development]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technological Innovation]]></category><category><![CDATA[AI & Machine Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Data, AI, & Machine Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[New Product Development]]></category><description><![CDATA[Carolyn Geason-Beissel/MIT SMR &#124; Getty Images Sounds are everywhere — the chatter and babble of humans and animals, the whirring and thrumming of machines, the background hum of the natural environment, and the murmur of bees on a summer day.

These sounds provide crucial input to our decision-making, whether as pedestrians crossing the road or as engineers testing the safety of a vehicle or machine.</p><p> But until recently, the systematic analysis of sounds in dynamic situations — a busy train station, a shopping mall, or an urban park, for example — has been difficult due to the sheer number of complex acoustic signals interacting at once. But this is now changing, thanks to major advances in sensor technology and deep learning algorithms that can harvest enormous quantities of acoustic input and rapidly extract key information.</p><p></p><p> Two branches of sound-related machine learning are emerging: one focused on the detection and analysis of sounds and the other on the AI-powered creation of sounds. Both have significant potential for business and societal value creation. In fact, according to one estimate, the <a href="https://www.astuteanalytica.com/industry-report/audio-ai-recognition-market">global market for AI audio-recognition technologies</a> is set to more than triple, from $4.1 billion in 2021 to $14.1 billion by 2030.</p><p> Deep learning algorithms are now being used to pioneer innovations across a diverse range of industries and sectors, such as these applications of sound detection and analysis:</p><p> <strong>Commercial and household security.</strong> Every year, US businesses and consumers spend billions of dollars protecting buildings and other physical assets. Smart home devices, such as Amazon&#39;s Echo, already use AI-driven voice recognition technology to authenticate different users and provide personalized entertainment and shopping experiences. But now AI systems&#39; sensors and deep learning algorithms can analyze nonvoice ambient sounds from every part of an office, a factory, or a military facility, distinguishing between innocuous sounds and those that may indicate an emerging threat, such as breaking glass.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Health care.</strong> AI sound technologies could transform many areas of health care, particularly by enabling low-cost, rapid diagnoses of diseases in their early stages. In health care, they could be used to provide real-time measurements for an array of biometric data, such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, and stress level. Deep learning has been used to extract and classify the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34433880/">“crackles” and “wheezes”</a> of different lung diseases. <a href="https://www.cochl.ai/">Cochl</a> , a South Korean startup, is pioneering AI applications to rapidly identify health problems based on the coughs and sneezes of patients. Such early-warning systems could prove to be pivotal in the fight against COVID-19 and future virus outbreaks.</p><p> <strong>Hearables.</strong> Acoustic deep learning technologies are being pioneered in the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/06/03/2681513/0/en/Exploring-the-Global-Hearable-Market-Size-Is-Estimated-to-Exceed-96-53-Billion-by-2030-At-an-Exponential-Growth-Rate-of-16-74-Revenue-and-Market-Share-Projections-from-2022-to-2030.html">“hearables” market</a> — which includes headphones, earphones, and other listening devices — to improve people&#39;s listening experience. Such technologies can <a href="https://edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2022/01/hearables-combine-machine-learning-and-microchips-smart-listening">screen out unwanted noise</a> or alert users to potential dangers, such as when someone is wearing earphones while jogging near traffic. Machine learning algorithms can be used to curate listening content to different contexts, such as by playing more relaxing or softer sounds when breathing signals indicate signs of stress, or more stirring content when the user is exercising.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Retail and leisure industries.</strong> Machine learning technologies can now recognize individuals through the sounds of their <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.08783.pdf">footsteps</a> by isolating these distinctive footfall echoes from background noises and the sounds of other pedestrians. Sound-based gait-recognition technologies offer significant advantages over other surveillance systems, given that they work even in poor lighting conditions and are less intrusive than facial recognition, computer vision, or biometric identification systems.</p><p> One of the biggest potential applications of this technology is in footfall-intensive industries such as retail. Sound-based footfall recognition can be used to recognize returning customers and help identify linger points on the shopper&#39;s journey — places where they pause to compare different products or respond to particular discounts or promotions — or pinpoint the time sensitivity of customers at different times of the day or week, based on the rapidity of footsteps.</p><p> <strong>Predictive maintenance and early-warning systems.</strong> Deep learning algorithms can analyze acoustic signals such as noise pressure and reverberations from machines and engine parts to assess wear and tear and predict when a particular part is likely to need replacing. NASA has used sound-sensing algorithms to monitor the functioning of equipment aboard the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/explorer/Investigation.html?#id=7860">International Space Station</a> . Deep learning algorithms are being used to classify underwater acoustic signals to potentially develop an early-warning system for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02483-w">deep-sea earthquakes and tsunamis</a> .</p><p> <strong>Marketing and media content production.</strong> Speech-to-text technologies have been around for some time, but the reverse is now happening with the growth of AI-powered text-to-speech or <a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~yipin/pub/cvpr2018.pdf">video-to-sound technologies</a> . <a href="https://audiostack.ai/">AudioStack</a> , a UK-based startup, provides AI-enabled audio creation, drawing on a database of more than 600 voices in more than 60 languages. Use cases include generating audio ads with different regional nuances, music, or voice tones, or generating synthetic or cloned voices for podcasts or narrated news flashes based on textual content. The algorithm that <a href="https://deepzen.io/">DeepZen</a> uses for artificial voice creation from text is able to infer different emotional tones from the content, such as excitement, enthusiasm, or comfort. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10981.pdf?utm_source=thenewstack&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=platform">AutoFoley</a> was developed to replicate the role of Foley artists, who add audio effects — such as the gallop of a horse or footsteps on a staircase — to movies. Applications like these have huge potential in industries such as gaming, marketing, and publishing, where <a href="https://speechify.com/blog/what-is-the-voice-over-actor-market-size">global demand for voiceovers</a> is forecast to grow by 9% per year to reach $2.3 billion by 2026.</p><h3> Recommendations for Business Leaders</h3><p> The rise of AI-based sound detection and creation will raise several challenges for businesses, especially in the intellectual property arena. To capitalize on the opportunities and mitigate the risks, business leaders should consider these recommendations:</p><p> <strong>Understand and protect your sonic assets.</strong> Most large companies will trademark or register a well-known jingle or catchphrase associated with their products or services, but in a world of AI-based sonification, businesses will also need to carefully assess the sonic print of their entire product portfolios — the distinctive whir of a washing machine or vacuum cleaner, the signature ignition of a sports car, the pop of a soda can opening. Counterfeiting of sounds will become a growing problem that businesses will need to prepare for.</p><p></p><p> <strong>“Sonify” the product experience.</strong> Businesses will pay increasing attention to the sonic signatures of their products, either to diminish cacophonous elements (such as a noisy clothes dryer) or to enhance aesthetically pleasing sounds (such as the tick-tock of a <a href="https://www.soundoflife.com/blogs/design/product-sonification-elevating-the-consumer-s-experience-via-the-beauty-of-sound-engineering">car&#39;s turn indicator</a> ). In the future, manufacturers could incorporate sonic signatures that track the product life cycle — for example, by varying a sound profile from a consumer durable as its components start to wear out. Businesses of all types will need to make sonic signatures a core part of user interface design, by identifying both the right functional and informational sounds for different uses and contexts, and by combining these with visual and other sensory elements.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Prompt for sound.</strong> Generative AI systems — large language models capable of creating and synthesizing text, sounds, speech, images, and code — are increasingly enabling businesses to create completely new sounds and sonic combinations, or to combine audio with video, text or images to create new product campaigns. With a single prompt, marketers will be able to create an advertising tune for a new brand of ice cream, turn a wordy blog or product description into a music video, or alter a product jingle to make it more appealing to younger or older consumers or potential customers in a new market overseas. With “prompt engineering” now becoming a major discipline in the AI and automation fields, businesses will need to train designers, marketers, and product developers to write efficient prompts for sound-based use cases, taking into account factors such as brand values, product tone of voice, intellectual property rules, and ethics.</p><p> As the saying goes, “Wisdom is the reward for a lifetime of listening.” Today, AI-powered acoustic technologies are opening up a world of sounds previously inaccessible to us. They&#39;re providing new insights and opportunities for businesses and policy makers in areas as diverse as consumer behavior, health care, urban planning, commercial security, and infrastructure management. Businesses that choose to listen to this new world, and act upon the insights, will be well positioned for future success.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/listen-up-machine-learning-holds-great-promise-for-audio-applications/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Thorny Talent and AI Challenges Now: 5 Experts Speak</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/thorny-talent-and-ai-challenges-now-5-experts-speak/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/thorny-talent-and-ai-challenges-now-5-experts-speak/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 27 Sep 2023 17:00:03 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Laurianne McLaughlin . <p>Laurianne McLaughlin is senior editor, digital, at <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> .</p> ]]>; </dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence]]></category><category><![CDATA[Motivation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Performance Management]]></category><category><![CDATA[Process Innovation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video]]></category><category><![CDATA[Webinars & Videos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership]]></category><category><![CDATA[Talent Management]]></category><description><![CDATA[If you ask leaders about their toughest leadership challenges right now, you’ll hear wide-ranging concerns about both talent management and artificial intelligence.

They also can&#39;t manage what they can&#39;t discuss. Take the term <em>data monetization</em> : Definitions range from the narrowly focused “selling data sets” to the overly broad “creating benefits from data.” Too little consistency among curricula in academia and too much siloed business thought leadership only add to the proliferation of data babel. When leaders try to have productive conversations about a data monetization strategy within a complex business environment, they often reach an impasse. They need a simple, common language to break through.</p><p> Try using this definition: Data monetization is the conversion of data into financial returns. In the new book <cite><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262048217/data-is-everybodys-business/">Data Is Everybody&#39;s Business</a></cite> , we offer two simple data frameworks that — when combined — represent an easy yet comprehensive set of data products. The first framework offers three different approaches to converting data into money: <em>Improve</em> , <em>wrap</em> , or <em>sell</em> . The second framework reflects three points along the data value creation process: People or systems need to use <em>data</em> to develop <em>insight</em> that informs <em>action</em> . Combine the two frameworks, and you have a matrix that offers nine distinct product choices, each with its own set of commitments and outcomes.</p><p></p><p> Leaders can use the data monetization matrix to explore current activities, future opportunities, and the interrelatedness of work. The simplicity of the matrix can help leaders be more transparent and open to breakthrough ideas. The objectivity of the matrix removes the heat from discussions and encourages conversations about <em>how</em> to monetize data instead of whether to monetize data.</p><h3> Explaining the Monetization Approaches: Improve, Wrap, and Sell</h3><p> If you sat down and began to list possible ways to create value from your company&#39;s data assets, you likely could come up with hundreds of ideas. Fundamentally, however, you can organize your ideas into three buckets. Does the idea make a work task or process better, cheaper, or faster? If so, you&#39;re looking at the improving approach. Does the idea make a product more valuable to customers? That&#39;s wrapping. Does the idea identify information that a customer would pay for? You&#39;re proposing selling. Improving, wrapping, and selling are very different in terms of risk, ownership, and requirements. When you know whether you are improving, wrapping, or selling, you can have smart conversations about data investments, capabilities, and returns.</p><p> Let&#39;s break down each of the three approaches in plain terms, with examples and questions to ask yourself about each approach.</p><p> <strong>Improve.</strong> Most companies find it easy to identify ways to use data to do things better, more cheaply, or faster. Consider Femsa, a multinational beverage and retail company that operates 21,000 Oxxo convenience stores in Latin America. The Oxxo subsidiary&#39;s senior management invested in creating a method of calculating SKU-level revenues and costs to arrive at a true measure of profit. In this way, they generated a data asset out of a host of revenue and cost data. With this new data asset, the organization could help its people understand the profitability of their decisions, leading to more profitable choices. Oxxo didn&#39;t just develop a data asset. The company soon used it for myriad improvements in store management, merchandising, product assortment, and operations.</p><p> Companies often fail to establish the kind of internal accountability that Oxxo achieved and then miss out on having efficiencies materialize as financial returns. Conversations about improving with data need to explore who in the company can drive workplace change and how to support them. Ask these questions: Who has the experience to make an improvement viable, appealing, and scalable? Who else or what else is needed to reduce or redeploy slack resources to activities that hit the bottom line? Does the company have the willingness and ability to measure and track the financial impact of improvements?</p><p> <strong>Wrap.</strong> Almost any product can be wrapped. A tractor can be wrapped with a digital display that shows operational performance; a bank account can be wrapped with a chart that categorizes the account owner&#39;s spending; and freight delivery can be wrapped with notifications of expected delivery times. Consider wrapping initiatives when products are being commoditized (a threat) or when products can be enhanced using new kinds of data via sensors, mobile apps, or surveillance feeds (an opportunity).</p><p> Wrapping conversations are customer-centric: How can the company use data to help customers better acquire, use, or retire its product? How can it use data to help its customers make money, save money, or better reach their goals? Such conversations need to include the owner of the product that is being enhanced because they are the person ultimately in charge of monetizing a wrap. How will wrapping be evaluated, monitored, and managed as a part of the company&#39;s product management and development processes? How does the company ensure that wrapping delights rather than disappoints customers?</p><p><strong>卖。</strong> An organization might be attracted by the higher margins that selling information seems to promise, but it&#39;s important to understand that this approach also comes with the greatest risks. Companies like Healthcare IQ, LexisNexis, and Verisk have learned how to solve specialized problems using their data assets after decades of investing in technology platforms, building algorithms, deepening subject matter expertise, cocreating with customers, and learning how to price solutions.</p><p> The crux of any selling conversation is whether it is worthwhile to invest in a new business model. Who in the company has the skills and experience to lead an information business? How can the selling initiative be established, protected, and nurtured while it gains traction? How can the company identify markets that want solutions based on its data? How can the company learn how much to charge them and how to sustain profitability in the face of competition?</p><p></p><h3> Explaining the Value-Creation Journey Points: Data, Insight, and Action</h3><p> To truly create value from data, organizations need a person or system to take an action that would not have happened otherwise. There are three ways in which a company can help make this happen. First, it can give data to someone (or to a system) who uses it to derive insight and take action that generates benefits. Better yet, a company can give an insight directly to the consumer, who then needs to choose the appropriate action. Or, taking an even more active approach, a company can trigger or prompt action, and the consumer sees results without having to do much.</p><p> Leaders need to understand where and how the company should participate in the data value-creation process and consider the related trade-offs.</p><p> <strong>Data.</strong> Offering data involves putting new or better data into the hands of someone executing part of a process (for example, machine speed data, for an equipment maintenance supervisor), someone using an existing product (for example, medical history data, for a health care patient), or an entirely new customer (for instance, someone buying a list of registered voters). When offering data, consider if the recipient will know from the data alone what action to take in order to generate value. Will someone take the time to turn that value into money?</p><p> <strong>Insight.</strong> Offering insight, as a rule, involves analyzed or contextualized data. Using the same examples as above, insight might include machine speed compared against standards, the likelihood of a patient having certain medical conditions, or a comparison of voting behavior across ZIP codes. Insight conversations debate consumer behaviors and require exceptional subject-matter expertise. Your team will want to be well-versed in what common questions consumers ask of the data and how they ask them. Your company will also need a strong sense of the competitive marketplace and the latest analytical platforms. What exactly do consumers need to know and for what reason, and what inefficiencies can be removed from their analyses?</p><p><strong>行动。</strong> Offering action prompts specific behaviors or automates tasks. Examples include automating the scheduling of machine service to prevent equipment downtime, providing a set of tailored dietary recommendations along with a food log to help a patient manage their health, or automating delivery of voter registration forms to selected recipients. Take caution here: Action always appears to be an ideal place to participate in data monetization because it positions the company closest to value creation, with a high likelihood of influencing it. However, leaders need to thoughtfully explore whether they have the capabilities, the rights, and the trust to offer action. Does the consumer want the company to trigger an action on their behalf, and would that be legal? Is the company confident that its data and insights are good enough to inform the correct action?</p><p> As you can see from these examples, leaders can deliver data, insight, or action using any of the three data monetization approaches (improve, wrap, sell).</p><h3> The Data Monetization Matrix: Examples in Action</h3><p> To help a team evaluate potential options, use the data monetization matrix to frame the discussion. Explore these real-world examples that a company might tackle and how the matrix helps explain the options. </p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand-column"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Using the Data Monetization Matrix: 3 Scenarios</h4><p class="caption"> The matrix helps frame discussions of how to monetize data. Start by considering whether your organization wants to use data for improving, wrapping, or selling (as shown on the horizontal axis). Then discuss where in the value creation process you will participate: by offering data, insight, or action (as shown on the vertical axis). The first example shows an improving/data decision, the second a wrapping/insight choice, and the third a selling/action approach. Note that your company could pursue one type of product, three in a row — or even products for every single matrix square. The key is for your team to understand the implications of each choice. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023_0927_Wixom_Fig-1.png" alt=""></p><p class="attribution"> Barbara H. Wixom, Cynthia M. Beath, and Leslie Owens, <cite class="normal">Data Is Everybody&#39;s Business</cite> (MIT Press, 2023).</p></article></aside></div><p> Let&#39;s start with an improving example. Consider an organization that has an employee performance data asset that includes employee evaluations, skill profiles, and recognition histories. Leaders believe that talent development could be improved by using this data to help supervisors identify, develop, and reward good performance more cheaply, easily, and quickly.</p><ul><li> A <em>data</em> product based on employee performance data might give supervisors direct access to this data, along with some features that allow them to sort and select from it.</li><li> An <em>insight</em> product might provide supervisors analyzed and contextualized performance information — say, a dashboard identifying which employees performed above or below standard expectations. Supervisors might use this information to give feedback and monitor progress.</li><li> An <em>action</em> product might automatically send a bonus and a recognition certificate to employees who consistently performed above expectations.</li></ul><p> Now consider wrapping opportunities at an organization that has a device that collects historical blood sugar readings for patients and their doctors. The product owner believes that if patients received more benefits from the device, its price could be raised.</p><ul><li> A <em>data</em> product would add a display of the historical daily blood sugar level readings for the patient. Hopefully, the patient would see patterns and get insights about how to better control their blood sugar.</li><li> An <em>insight</em> product would display the patient&#39;s recent blood sugar levels relative to established standards for their age/gender cohort. Patients would need to learn how to use this insight to behave differently.</li><li> An <em>action</em> product would send the patient an alert to have their midmorning apple snack within the next 15 minutes.</li></ul><p> Finally, let&#39;s review opportunities that a grocery store chain might investigate in the sell column. This company has a sales data asset consisting of purchase data and other customer-specific information for shoppers who have joined its loyalty program.</p><ul><li> The chain can develop a <em>data</em> product that provides data on items scanned at checkout that the company can sell to product manufacturers.</li><li> That data, coupled with an analysis of customer purchase history (using loyalty card data and shopping cart items), can be the basis of an <em>insight</em> product that the company can sell to organizations that want information about trends in dietary habits.</li><li> In the <em>action</em> box, the team could create a cross-selling algorithm that automatically suggests additional purchases to consumers — and charges the manufacturers who participate in the program.</li></ul><p> Take note: Data monetization opportunities don&#39;t need to flow in a straight line across the matrix. Your conversations might need to flip around. For example, leaders at the grocery store chain might decide that it&#39;s not appealing to monetize by selling at all. Instead, they might want to engage in conversations about how to use the company&#39;s sales data asset to improve store operations and make them better, cheaper, or faster. Or commoditization pressures might lead them to explore how to wrap existing grocery goods and services with the sales data asset to distinguish their services from those of other grocers.</p><h3> 4 Ways to Improve Your Strategy</h3><p> As these examples show, you can use the 3x3 matrix to have more effective conversations about data monetization strategy. To continuously improve, consider using the matrix in these four ways.</p><p> <strong>1. Conduct a rough inventory of your crucial data-heavy initiatives and slot them into the matrix.</strong> Key questions: Have you tried improving, wrapping, and selling? Or just improving? Have you delivered data, insight, and action products? Or mostly just data products? You might find that your activities are weighted toward improving with data (pumping clean data from one system to another, for example, or revealing more data to a partner). If so, start conversations around how to evolve into wrapping or selling, or into insight and action.</p><p> <strong>2. Use the matrix as a benchmark.</strong> From time to time, ask whether you are expanding your repertoire of data monetization approaches. Key questions: Is data monetization activity spreading from pockets of the organization to broader parts of the enterprise? Is data monetization keeping pace with digital transformation goals and accomplishments? Do data monetization efforts have the right accountability, funding, and support?</p><p></p><p> <strong>3. Look for opportunities to reuse and recombine data assets.</strong> Key questions: Are the same data assets being used across the matrix or in just one cell, row, or column? Does each data monetization opportunity require new data preparation, permissions, and provisioning? If so, consider how data can be converted into liquid data assets that can be reused broadly in many data monetization efforts.</p><p> <strong>4. Identify open spots on the matrix.</strong> Key questions: Do empty cells represent hidden opportunities? Or are the open spots unachievable for some reason, like missing enterprise capabilities, skills, or customer connections?</p><p> All companies need a data monetization strategy, but creating, sharing, and executing the strategy can be fraught with misunderstanding and resistance. The solution is not more data or more AI but, rather, better communication. If leaders can get their teams up to speed on the matrix, they&#39;ll encourage people to engage in productive conversations and get on track to manage the right data monetization strategy in the right way.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-have-better-strategy-conversations-about-monetizing-data/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Halt Impostor Syndrome Before It Happens</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/halt-impostor-syndrome-before-it-happens/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/halt-impostor-syndrome-before-it-happens/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 11:00:07 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Angélica S.

Her strong analytical and quantitative skills, coupled with her interpersonal and communication skills, have garnered Isabela high performance ratings. But despite a stellar performance record and clients&#39; and senior managers&#39; characterization of her as “at manager level,” Isabela did not apply for the manager position that recently became available.</p><p> Senior partners at the firm might be quick to conclude that Isabela didn&#39;t apply because she has impostor syndrome — which refers to feelings of inadequacy that individuals experience, and a fear that others will discover that they do not belong in the positions that they occupy. They have likely read articles and attended professional development seminars that discussed employees&#39; susceptibility to experiencing impostor syndrome. Psychologists Pauline Clance and Susan Imes coined the term <em>impostor syndrome</em> to describe high-achieving women who feel incompetent and fear that others will eventually discover that they are a fraud and unfit for their position — a characterization that seems to fit Isabela.</p><p></p><p> But Isabela neither felt inadequate nor questioned her ability to manage — at least not initially. Rather, she decided not to apply because she had been denied a promotion the previous year. Her colleague Greg, who has not been with the company for as long and is less qualified, was promoted instead. Isabela concluded that perhaps she was not as intelligent, competent, and fit for the position as she believed.</p><h3> The Real Problem: &#39;Impostorization&#39;</h3><p> Isabela&#39;s experience underscores the danger in assuming that such behaviors, including the decision not to apply for leadership positions, stem from self-perceived deficiencies. For Isabela and other employees, impostor syndrome is the presumed issue, but <em>impostorization</em> is the real problem.</p><p> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597822000930">Impostorization</a> refers to the policies, practices, and seemingly innocuous interactions in the workplace that make (or intend to make) individuals question their intelligence, competence, and sense of belonging. The strategies that are often recommended to help individuals counter impostor syndrome — such as standing in power poses, reciting positive affirmations, and taking an inventory of past successes — have limited value in countering impostorization.</p><p></p><p> This is not to say that employees such as Isabela do not experience impostor syndrome and that managers need not focus on providing the support that employees need to counter its effects. A <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-help-high-achievers-overcome-imposter-syndrome/">recent <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> article</a> provides valuable insights on how managers can identify impostor syndrome in employees and support them. But before managers assume that the issue is impostor syndrome, it is critical that they examine how the workplace might be inadvertently engaging in impostorization and triggering the feelings that they seek to address.</p><p> Certain policies, practices, and seemingly harmless interactions might unintentionally lead employees to question their intelligence, competence, and sense of belonging. The following are a few examples.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Biased promotion decisions.</strong> Employees like Isabela might have a high degree of self-esteem and self-efficacy — uncharacteristic of people with impostor syndrome — yet employer promotion decisions might trigger feelings of inadequacy. The company&#39;s decision to promote a male employee over Isabela is consistent with the findings of a recent study by MIT Sloan School of Management professor Danielle Li and colleagues that found that male employees tend to receive <a href="https://danielle-li.github.io/assets/docs/PotentialAndTheGenderPromotionGap.pdf">higher ratings than female employees</a> on questions related to “potential,” such as, “If given the opportunity, would this person make a good manager?” These ratings, which are intended to predict an individual&#39;s performance, are often influenced by gender biases and assumptions about leaders, which often favor men. The study found that differences in ratings of people&#39;s potential account for about 50% of the gender promotion gap. Promotion decisions based on factors unrelated to performance can trigger impostor syndrome among employees not selected. Left without feedback to the contrary, employees might attribute these decisions to their own perceived failings, such as a lack of qualifications or poor fit.</p><p> <strong>Glass cliff appointments.</strong> Ironically, women and people of color tend to be promoted at lower rates relative to their White male counterparts, yet the former are promoted more often to lead poorly performing organizations. Studies of promotion and the tenure of Fortune 500 CEOs found that minorities are more likely than White men to be appointed CEO of weak-performing companies, a <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/from-glass-ceilings-to-glass-cliffs-a-guide-to-jumping-not-falling/">phenomenon referred to as the glass cliff</a> . As the entities continue to struggle, minority leaders are blamed. Glass cliff appointments might trigger impostor feelings among minorities — despite their prior records of success — by leading them to question their competence and to interpret organizational failings as a reflection of their own deficiencies rather than circumstances that are objectively challenging or a lack of support.</p><p> <strong>Interruptions and idea-stealing.</strong> Isabela arrived at her employer with confidence and a determination to excel. She often made recommendations and shared insights during meetings, but she observed a pattern: She would either get cut off when speaking, or her ideas would go unnoticed only to be presented minutes later by a colleague who was then praised for the novelty of the idea. While it is common for individuals to interrupt others, studies find that men <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/female-supreme-court-justices-are-interrupted-more-by-male-justices-and-advocates">interrupt women more often than they interrupt other men</a> during meetings, and they get credit for <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/diversity%20and%20inclusion/women%20in%20the%20workplace%202022/women-in-the-workplace-2022.pdf">regurgitating the ideas presented by women</a> . Given the frequency of interruption in meetings, such behaviors might appear innocuous; their cumulative effect, however, could be impostorizing. The individuals who are interrupted and whose ideas go unnoticed might begin to question the value of their contributions. They might wonder whether they failed to articulate their ideas well enough and experience self-doubt, which in turn can decrease their participation and contributions.</p><h3> Avoiding Impostorization</h3><p> Avoiding triggering impostor syndrome is just as important as supporting employees who might be experiencing it. Managers can take the following steps to avoid it and, in the process, increase employees&#39; job satisfaction, organizational citizenship behaviors, motivation to lead, and retention.</p><p> <strong>Use objective criteria in promotion decisions.</strong> Unconscious biases can influence decisions based on subjective assessments. Ensure that opportunities for promotion are communicated to eligible employees, and use clear and explicit criteria when evaluating candidates. Consider providing specific feedback to employees who are denied promotions. Humans have an innate need to make sense of outcomes, and a promotion denial might be impostorizing when employees interpret the decision as a reflection of their inadequacy. Take the time to provide feedback not only on areas that the employee could work on to strengthen their competitiveness for the next promotion but also on what they are doing well. Balanced feedback can help avoid triggering impostor syndrome among employees by drawing attention to their strengths.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Provide employees with sufficient resources.</strong> As the saying goes, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” Whether stepping into the C-suite or an entry-level position, employees are more likely to thrive when they have organizational support. Similarly, failing to equip employees with the resources they need, including effective onboarding and mentoring, can set them up to fail. Failure can be an impostorizing experience by leading otherwise intelligent and competent employees to believe that they are inadequate rather than lacking organizational support.</p><p> <strong>Implement meeting norms that promote listening and idea-crediting.</strong> IDEO, a global design and innovation company, promotes creativity by encouraging employees to avoid criticizing others&#39; ideas; when they do so, a bell is rung. Establishing meeting norms — whether ringing a bell or instituting a “no interruptions” rule — might lead employees to actively listen, avoid cutting off colleagues who are speaking, and give credit where credit is due. Such norms could also help avoid impostorization by conveying to employees that they are heard, their contributions are recognized, and that they are integral members of the organization — in other words, that they are not impostors.</p><p></p><p></p><p> While much of the literature and discussions on impostor syndrome have focused on the individual, and strategies to counter its effects have taken a fix-the-individual approach, it is in fact organizations — through policies, practices, and seemingly innocuous interactions — that might be inadvertently triggering the problem. Managers must consider that the feelings and behaviors of employees might not be symptoms of impostor syndrome, but rather the consequences of impostorization.</p><p> Examine how the organizational culture — through bias, microaggressions, sexism, or racism, for example — might be impostorizing employees. If an employee with a promising performance record decides not to apply for a leadership position, is it because they believe they aren&#39;t capable of leading — or because there is no evidence to suggest that the organization supports structural diversity? If an employee initially contributes to discussions and then begins to stay silent, is it because they are no longer confident — or because their ideas have been repeatedly ignored or credited to someone else? Is the problem really impostor syndrome, or impostorization? Create a culture of psychological safety and pose these questions to those who are most qualified to answer: your employees.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/halt-impostor-syndrome-before-it-happens/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Reconnecting When Network Ties Go Dormant</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/reconnecting-when-network-ties-go-dormant/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/reconnecting-when-network-ties-go-dormant/#comments</comments><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 11:00:58 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Emanuela Rondi, Daniel Z.

As people venture back into professional social settings after having experienced pandemic-induced disconnection, they are particularly keen to revive these inactive ties. Such connections have the potential to be incredibly valuable: During the period of dormancy, former contacts have been learning new things and developing new networks that could yield advice, referrals, emotional support, and even tangible resources.</p><p> We used to assume that <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-power-of-reconnection-how-dormant-ties-can-surprise-you/">reawakening a dormant tie</a> was a simple process — just, you know, reach out and start talking to people. This view presumes that people can simply reengage as if no time has elapsed.</p><p></p><p> However, new research shows that the process of reviving a dormant tie is more complex than that. Simple mistakes can derail the reconnection process, sometimes so dramatically as to cause a relationship to end. For instance, one of us was with an innovation manager at a convention immediately after a former colleague had made a poorly executed attempt at reconnection. “Unbelievable. Did you hear what he asked me?” this manager said. “I will never talk to that guy again!” Less dramatically, dormant contacts will sometimes seem friendly when responding to an overture (“Well, it was great to see you”) but later admit that they were holding back and felt reluctant to fully engage, collaborate with, or share what they know with the other person.</p><p> Why are some reconnection attempts so suboptimal or even downright harmful? And what makes some reconnections more successful than others? We investigated these questions by observing and interviewing managers to understand how to refresh a level of trust in ways that benefit both parties.</p><h3> The Three Key Elements of Reconnection</h3><p> Over the course of several years, our research has included observing dozens of real-time reconnections at industry conventions and conducting 71 interviews with executives across the textile industry in Northern Italy. We identified three elements consistently associated with successful reconnections: how well both parties remember each other, how they go about catching up, and whether they perceive the relationship similarly. We developed a model of reconnections that result in activity where one or both parties obtain resources through the tie, such as a productive collaboration or useful advice.</p><p> We then tested this model in an experiment with 331 US workers to assess the impact of each of the three elements on another person&#39;s willingness to help. We provided a vignette describing a reconnection attempt by a former coworker and asked, “How willing would you be to help this person?” We measured whether people&#39;s willingness changed based on whether a reconnection element was present or absent. We found that with none of the elements present, people&#39;s willingness was neutral at best — 3.86 on a scale from 1 (unwilling) to 7 (willing). When all three elements were present, it went from neutral to, essentially, “Yes, I&#39;d agree to help” (5.72). This validated our findings. We also confirmed that the three reconnection elements are useful specifically because they increase people&#39;s trust that the other person cares about and will look out for them. Our research was <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2023.1685?journalCode=orsc">published earlier this year</a> in <cite>Organization Science.</cite></p><p> Here&#39;s how to work with each of the three key elements that enhance the success of a dormant-tie reconnection.</p><p></p><p> <strong>1. Remembering.</strong> Recognizing each other is critical, and a failure to do so can feel embarrassing and even insulting. Trying to reconnect with someone who does not recognize you is painful and might even make you seem less trustworthy. This often ends the relationship permanently.</p><p> Overtures that give the other person time to look you up on social media such as LinkedIn can provide a way for the person being approached to see your face, read your bio, and be reminded of how they know you. Cold-calling can be risky: An R&amp;D manager told us about calling a CEO and having to explain multiple times who he was and how and where they had met. Eventually, the CEO did remember him as “the young guy with very big hope.” The R&amp;D manager felt humiliated and decided not to ask for the advice he was looking for and never called the CEO again.</p><p> Approaching someone in person at a professional event can also be tricky. Keep in mind, for instance, that everyone&#39;s appearance changes over time, including yours, so providing clues such as a prominent name tag can help.</p><p> After recognizing each other, reminiscing over shared experiences helps to reestablish the relationship by reminding each other of what was happening when the tie was active. You want to talk about times spent together, and even shared hardships. For example, we observed a successful reconnection where one participant said, “Do you remember our director? He was such a jerk.” The other recalled that person the same way: “Ha ha, how could I forget? The most unapproachable guy — super moody.” As memories came flooding back, the former colleagues created a bridge between past and present.</p><p> <strong>2. Catching up.</strong> Updating the other person on professional and even personal matters since you last saw each other brings the relationship into the present and allows you to fill in the picture of what has happened while the relationship was dormant. This is more than just small talk; it lets people see what you&#39;re all about now. One executive said that hearing about the other person&#39;s career path “not only helps but is probably also critical to understanding who you are dealing with.” Note that catching up does not mean providing a detailed chronological account of everything that has happened since you last were in touch. Focusing on just the relevant highlights can help to strategically orient the conversation.</p><p> Including details on personal matters can make the reconnection less transactional. “If you season it all with some mention of your personal life, it can help bring the talk back to a little bit more human level,” said one executive. “If you go straight to the point, people might feel you want to exploit them.” It&#39;s important not to get too personal, though. One manager, in describing catching up with a dormant contact after eight years, explained, “I didn&#39;t want to cross the line and be too intrusive, so I tried to limit this to pleasantries, showing that I care without being indiscreet.” Unfortunately, not everyone follows this advice. Indeed, we witnessed several reconnection disasters brought on by insensitive questions, both in the professional realm (“Did they at least pay you well when you were let go as CEO?”) and in the personal realm, with an inquiry into how a person was coping with the death of a spouse. Both reconnection attempts were cut short by the other person.</p><p></p><p> Reacquainting yourselves also helps both sides assess whether they like and trust each other. It may initially seem like a gratuitous ritual, but it allows people to check whether their mental image of you, including your trustworthiness, is still accurate. How you present yourself — your views, your recent experiences — will affect not just how the other person sees you but the relationship itself. You will likewise have the same opportunity to reassess your old contact. This stage is when both parties evaluate, often subconsciously, whether the other person represents a viable tie for the future.</p><p> <strong>3. Perceiving the tie similarly.</strong> Both sides need to be on the same page about the relationship, such as how close you two feel, whether your roles or companies are in competition, and whether you are of similar or different status. For example, it is fine to reconnect with people you used to know either really well or barely at all, as long as you treat the other person accordingly. Treating someone as a close confidant when you had a distant relationship with them (or vice versa) undermines the reconnection.</p><p> Dormant contacts who are now competitors can still reconnect successfully and sometimes even work together — such as on efforts to promote the industry — but both people need to be in sync about the nature of the relationship. As one executive put it, “If I think that asking that person something would cause them a conflict of interest, I do not ask.”</p><p> One R&amp;D manager told us of a reconnection he tried to make that went poorly, with a former employee who had since become CEO of a small but fast-growing company. The CEO “kept the conversation very brief before hanging up.” Afterward, the R&amp;D manager told us sheepishly that he might have been too bossy, coming off as if his former colleague owed him something. “Maybe he felt like I was treating him as my employee instead of the CEO of an important company,” he said. The two were not seeing the tie similarly, and the reconnection attempt failed.</p><p> Being on the same page sets the boundaries for what is or is not appropriate when making requests in the reconnection process. The other person needs to trust that you will not pressure them into sharing resources they are not comfortable sharing given the type of relationship you have.</p><p></p><p></p><p> These latest findings are on <em>how</em> to reconnect your dormant ties. Don&#39;t forget, though, that it also matters <em>who</em> the other person is. Past research has found that <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-reconnect-for-maximum-impact/">the most useful reconnections</a> are to dormant contacts who are likely to provide novelty — such as higher-status contacts and people you never spent a lot of time with in the past — and who are also likely to be fully engaged, such as people you expect will care about you and be willing to help.</p><p> Refreshing dormant ties can be as important to enhancing your network as adding new people or strengthening existing ties. Savvy executives reconnect, but they do it thoughtfully. The payoff is that requests to collaborate or seek advice will be greeted less warily, with a willingness by the other person to go above and beyond in helping without feeling like they&#39;re being taken advantage of. Those who take the time to pay attention to these three steps are better able to restore past relationships to their full potential — refreshed, trusted, and ready to help.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/reconnecting-when-network-ties-go-dormant/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 1</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
