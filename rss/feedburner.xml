预见到技术将导致“对传统有血有肉的专业人士的需求稳步下降”，而最近，CB Insights 表示“结构性破坏正在冲击管理咨询”。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a>更早之前，克莱顿·克里斯滕森 (Clayton Christensen) 及其同事警告说：“虽然我们无法预测咨询行业颠覆的确切进展，但我们可以非常有信心地说，无论其速度如何，一些现任者都会措手不及。” <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2个</a></p><p>但事情并没有像预期的那样发展。在咨询和法律领域，成熟的公司一如既往地具有影响力和盈利能力。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a>许多潜在的破坏者已经出现。有些失败了，有些获得了强大的利基地位，但没有人挑战——更不用说推翻——现有秩序了。大多数老牌领导者都使用了广泛的战略和策略来快速适应威胁。</p><p></p><p>与许多成熟行业的情况一样，专业服务市场由一小部分可清楚识别的顶端群体和大量在其影子下运营的低端公司主导。咨询的巨头包括麦肯锡、波士顿咨询集团和贝恩；科技公司 Accenture 和 Capgemini；以及四大会计师事务所安永、德勤、毕马威和普华永道。在法律领域，顶级律师事务所包括五家总部位于伦敦的律师事务所，非正式地称为“魔圈”——年利达律师事务所、高伟绅律师事务所、富而德律师事务所、安理国际律师事务所和斯劳特梅律师事务所——以及凯易律师事务所、瑞生律师事务所和欧华律师事务所。</p><p>这些公司为何如此有弹性？我们的研究包括对 25

href="#ref5">5个</a></p><h3>需求方和供应方的威胁</h3><p>根据我们的研究，我们将人工智能技术确定为最大的供应方风险，威胁要接管专业人士传统上视为自己的工作。在需求方面，威胁来自客户寻求更好地控制他们购买和使用专业服务的方式。还有其他潜在的颠覆者同时从供需双方挑战现有企业。与此同时，新的精品和专业公司已经出现，以满足利润丰厚的业务领域的特定客户需求，尽管它们很少真正具有颠覆性。下面，我们将详细介绍每个潜在威胁。</p><p><strong>人工智能破坏了商业模式。</strong> 2022 年 11 月推出的生成式 AI 加速了专业服务工作许多方面的持续转型，从而提高了准确性并显着节省了成本。</p><p>在律师事务所，人工智能工具扫描法律文件并审查合同。基于人工智能的服务公司，如 Kira Systems、Clio、Reveal-Brainspace、iManage 和汤森路透，在发现、尽职调查以及合同管理和审查方面提供帮助。 97% 的大型律师事务所使用汤森路透的服务。</p><p>这些公司并不将自己定位为律师事务所的竞争对手，但随着它们规模的扩大和技术能力的增强，它们可能会开始破坏这些公司的商业模式。例如，Clio 的法律软件可以对索赔进行电子发现，甚至可以通过扫描先例案例进行诉讼分析，从而有可能减少公司可以向客户收取的计费小时数。</p><p>在咨询中，人工智能可以帮助专业服务公司发现新的关系、识别客户行为模式并突出节省成本的机会，从而提供额外的价值。 “与一个比其他任何人都更了解这个行业的团队一起出现已经不够好了，”一位四大咨询合伙人说。 “你还需要一个数据集或算法来提供额外的价值来源。”</p><p>但人工智能也可以成为强大的破坏者。 Palantir Technologies 开始使用 AI 来检测欺诈，后来扩展到应用最先进的机器学习来解决各种政府和私人客户的问题。它支持政府监督的工作引起了争议，但其预测分析帮助一家大型汽车供应商在其工程和制造职能方面取得了巨大的效率提升。这样的结果代表了咨询公司可以提供的洞察力的严谨性和质量的重大进步。</p><p>老牌公司已经通过收购和内部开发建立自己的人工智能能力来应对威胁。自 2013 年以来，麦肯锡收购了 12 家主要是小型人工智能公司，其中包括总部位于英国的 QuantumBlack，该公司使用先进的数据分析来提高组织绩效。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a>在法律方面，总部位于旧金山的 DLA Piper 开发了 Aiscension，这是一种监控合规风险的人工智能产品。保险律师事务所 Kennedys 创建了 Kennedys IQ 衍生产品，它使用人工智能来评估医学证据并建议赔偿金额。</p><p>这些收购和合作伙伴关系提供的不仅仅是新功能；他们可以扩大他们的公司可以为客户处理的问题的范围。</p><p>现任者也在加强他们作为高接触可信顾问的作用，这是人工智能无法复制的。几家大型咨询公司通过投资体验中心扩大了他们的产品范围——客户和顾问在物理和虚拟环境中使用设计思维和其他创造性技术来设想可能的未来。在过去五年中，IBM、德勤、埃森哲和其他公司收购了 200 多家创意机构来帮助开发这些中心。</p><p><strong>客户控制：拆分服务。</strong>最深远的需求方威胁是分拆，因为越来越精明的客户正在寻找降低成本的方法，并对他们与服务公司的关系施加更大的影响。这可能意味着回收以前由外部公司处理的活动或求助于专家而不是大型专业公司的广泛服务。这两种选择都可以帮助客户建立内部能力，并对业务成果承担更大的责任。但分拆威胁到现有公司的杠杆模式，因为它剥夺了通常分配给许多初级和低薪通才的工作。</p><p>在法律上，替代法律服务提供商 (ALSP) 的出现证明了这种需求方威胁。 ALSP 本身并不是律师事务所，但它们以较低的成本提供广泛的法律服务，例如文件审查或合同管理。 2017 年，位于弗吉尼亚州的 IT 服务公司 DXC Technology 将其几乎全部法律职能外包给了位于堪萨斯州欧弗兰帕克的 ALSP UnitedLex。 DXC 将 150 名内部律师转移到 UnitedLex，只保留了少数高级专业人员。虽然外包内部法律部门并不少见，但律师事务所认为这是一个巨大的威胁，因为这是当时同类交易中最大的交易，而且它涉及 ALSP，可以提供更低的成本结构。</p><p>咨询网络的兴起（例如总部位于伦敦的 Eden McCallum）和在线平台（例如总部位于纽约的 Gerson Lehrman Group）也面临着类似的挑战。这些公司在逐个项目的基础上为客户匹配顾问，绕过大公司。总部位于伦敦的 Kubrick Group 与公司签订合同，提供数据科学家和技术专家团队，客户稍后可以聘用他们。</p><p>这种安排让客户有责任定义其问题并整合工作团队——传统上由大型咨询公司处理的事情。但是除了最大和最复杂的项目外，它们消除了雇用大公司的需要。如果没有现任者更高的管理费用，费用就会低得多。</p><p>客户也在改变商业安排，越来越多地要求基于结果的交易，要求顾问证明他们对预期结果直接负责，例如成本降低 5%。因为对于涉及顾问影响之外的因素（例如收入增长）的项目，这可能更难做到，所以大多数公司只有在他们有信心为预期结果做出贡献时才会同意基于结果的交易。</p><p>现有公司正在以多种方式应对这些需求方的挑战。律师事务所已经成立了自己的 ALSP；总部位于伦敦的 Allen &amp; Overy 于 2013 年创建了 Peerpoint，这是一个独立的业务，拥有 350 名主要是自由职业的律师和 5300 万英镑（6400 万美元）的收入。在咨询方面，德勤创建了一个名为 Pixel 的部门，将客户问题分解成各个组成部分，然后使用众包平台寻找合适的专家来处理每个部分。</p><p>大公司也在加倍发挥其传统优势：解决客户最大和最具挑战性的问题。他们的价值来自他们在高影响、大规模、高风险情况下提供建议和合规的能力，并且他们可以为服务收取额外费用。 “我们做的是心脏直视手术，而不是提供 [全科医生] 服务，”一位资深律师说。</p><p><strong>精品店和专家在市场关注中找到优势。</strong>随着前顶级合作伙伴建立自己的精品店或风险投资公司支持新的创业公司，专业服务领域不断出现新的竞争对手。成功的公司在特定的利基市场占据了市场份额，但很少引起顶级公司的关注。它们对需求或供应方造成的干扰有限，它们只是反映了市场的异质性和复杂性。</p><p>在咨询方面，总部位于伦敦的 Baringa 通过专注于能源行业、确定可再生能源等热门话题并聘请使用情景建模来预测未来能源价格的专家，实现了快速发展。总部位于纽约的 AlixPartners 专注于扭亏为盈、诉讼支持和转型。两家公司都有 1,000 多名员工。法律行业见证了专家的快速成长，例如美国的 Caldwell Intellectual Property Law 和英国和新加坡的争议专家 Mishcon de Reya。这些公司的成功表明，深厚的专业知识可以如何创造一个可以抵御基础广泛的竞争对手的可防御的利基市场。</p><p>大公司并不将这些小企业视为直接威胁，而且常常完全忽视它们。 “他们不在我们与 C-suite 的工作中，”伦敦一家大型律师事务所的合伙人说。尽管如此，它们仍可以帮助现任者保持警惕。</p><p>其一，它们为不断变化的市场提供了一个窗口，通常会促使老牌公司进入它们原本可能被忽视的业务领域。例如，德勤针对专业精品公司的出现推出了数字业务。贝恩创建并剥离了 The Bridgespan Group，以专注于非营利组织。</p><p>专业公司还可以暴露顶级公司工作方式中需要注意的弱点。例如，专注于电信、媒体和技术领域的全球最大战略咨询公司 Altman Solon 吸引了最高管理层的关注，这在很大程度上是因为整个公司由在这些领域具有深厚专业知识的专家组成，这与许多填补初级职位的大公司不同有很多聪明的多面手。因此，它已经跟上了其运营所在行业的步伐，因此能够更好地快速制定客户特定的战略。</p><p><strong>潜在的破坏者会带来供需双方的风险。</strong>现任者的噩梦场景是同时影响供需双方的中断。这最终就是杀死柯达和宝丽来的原因：数字技术改变了图像的创建方式和消费方式，让现任者没有任何价值可以依靠。摄影行业的幸存者，如富士和佳能，是通过进入邻近市场而不是留下来战斗来做到这一点的。</p><p>这些挑战者已经出现在专业服务领域，但到目前为止，他们还没有成为颠覆者。例如，成立于 2013 年的 HourlyNerd 雄心勃勃，希望成为连接技术客户与自由顾问的市场，以比典型采购流程更快的速度为客户提供更广泛的顾问选择。 “我们喜欢将自己视为可能聘请咨询公司的替代者，”其中一位联合创始人说。 <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p> Axiom Law 成立于 2000 年，致力于通过员工和合作伙伴网络提供随需应变的法律人才，从而更有效地提供法律服务。 “Axiom 有机会颠覆一个世纪以来未发生实质性变化的行业，”一位投资者表示。 <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8个</a></p><p>两家公司都做得不错。 HourlyNerd 于 2016 年更名为 Catalant，转向软件即服务模式，如今拥有数百名员工。 Axiom 是一家中型律师事务所，拥有约 1,600 名员工，年收入为 8.425 亿美元，其商业模式比大多数竞争对手都更加灵活。 <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a>但两者都没有达到它所期望的破坏性效果。</p><p></p><h3>地平线上的破坏性威胁</h3><p>那么，是什么迫在眉睫的干扰让管理咨询和律师事务所的高管们夜不能寐？</p><p>我们采访的高级专业人士指出的一个因素是人工智能和分析能力的显着加速。在法律中，编纂——捕捉经验丰富的合作伙伴的法律推理并将其转化为可以应用于未来案件的算法的过程——可能会消除专业人士现在所做的大部分认知工作。 “那将是破坏性的，”伦敦一家大型公司的合伙人说。</p><p>其他一些人表示，近期最大的威胁很可能来自科技巨头：尤其是谷歌、亚马逊、微软和 Salesforce。每个人都建立了面向客户的能力，其中一些来自大型咨询公司，以增强他们销售针对客户技术挑战的解决方案的实力。</p><p>凭借其人工智能能力和全球影响力，它们可能会影响专业公司业务的供需双方。例如，Amazon Web Services 利用其掌握的大量数据，可以利用其对客户行为的独特洞察力为零售客户提供在线购物趋势预测。</p><p> “Amazon Web Services 的最大影响不在于其作为云服务供应商的地位，而在于其关于消费者购买行为的信息的非凡规模和深度，这是任何传统咨询公司都无法与之竞争的，”他说一家大型咨询公司的合伙人。</p><p>其他人淡化了威胁。 “像谷歌这样的公司实际上并不擅长客户服务，”一位受访者说。虽然一家科技公司有可能收购一家大型咨询公司，但这将代表与咨询公司发展合作伙伴关系的典型方法的重大战略转变，并将减少未来可以合作的公司数量。</p><h3>保持敏捷</h3><p>大型专业服务公司并没有仅仅因为他们采取的行动就避免了颠覆。更重要的是他们对商业环境变化的警惕性和反应能力。虽然咨询公司和律师事务所的高管经常贬低他们看似过时的工作方式，但事实证明，他们的专业合作模式非常有弹性。</p><p>从我们的访谈中，我们确定了三个值得强调的成功要素，它们也可能适用于其他行业。</p><p><strong>创新努力致力于解决客户问题。</strong>这与许多其他企业形成鲜明对比，在这些企业中，创新活动是与组织面向客户的部分分开进行的。最好的专业服务公司会根据他们在客户业务中发现的共同限制、摩擦和机会来追求产品和服务创新。然后，他们与选定的客户和合作伙伴组织（例如技术提供商）一起开发、测试和改进这些创新，然后再将它们推广到他们的客户组合中。</p><p><strong>合伙人及其后辈与客户密切合作。</strong>这些公司的学徒制模式意味着感觉-反应差距——感知客户需求然后采取适当行动解决这些需求之间的差异——比领导者与从事工作的人相差很远的公司要小。</p><p><strong>公司对投资新活动持谨慎态度。</strong>虽然这在瞬息万变的世界中似乎是一个弱点，但事实是，大多数新兴技术都需要很长时间才能发挥其潜力，而且许多公司都因行动过快而失败。由于其工作基于项目的性质，专业公司能够测试新技术，了解哪些有效，然后根据项目成功和客户需求向前推进。</p><h3>保持领先于中断</h3><p>专业服务公司在抵御潜在破坏方面的经验表明，其他行业的公司可以采取四种行动来准备和应对变化。</p><p><strong>诊断威胁。</strong>虽然每一个新的竞争对手或技术都可以被视为潜在的威胁，但有必要评估风险的大小以及它可能影响的业务部分。我们研究的咨询公司和律师事务所在分离需求和供应方面的影响方面大多非常周到。 （有关如何应用此逻辑，请参阅“诊断破坏性威胁的性质”。）</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>诊断破坏性威胁的性质</h4><p class="caption">考虑您所在行业的新兴技术或新竞争对手，并回答以下问题以确定破坏性威胁的性质。</p><p class="print

“我们希望保持整体关系，专注于优质工作领域，”伦敦一家大型律师事务所的合伙人表示。 “争论的焦点是我们留了多少……给其他律师事务所，我们保留了多少，并通过第三方或替代交付模式做了多少。”</p><p><strong>平衡实用主义与健康的偏执狂。</strong>我们在采访中与之交谈的法律和咨询合作伙伴真的被撕裂了。一方面，他们几乎没有看到任何证据表明他们的强势地位受到威胁，他们一致认为十年前关于颠覆的可怕预测是没有根据的。另一方面，他们不想表现得沾沾自喜，当然也不想向下级同事传达未来没有中断风险的信息。高管们必须学会接受双重心态：务实地承认基本面是好的，同时偏执地怀疑新兴技术或新竞争对手。毕竟，克里斯滕森和他的同事们认为，那些可能会措手不及的现任者最有可能被颠覆。</p><p></p>

12%，或者病毒可以扰乱商品、零部件和人才的全球流动时，一家公司在面对不断发展的事件时快速适应的能力对其生存和繁荣至关重要。</p><p>业务弹性是一种动态属性，可通过企业价值在不断变化的环境中的稳定性和持久性进行回顾性衡量。实时性体现在企业对业务环境的即时变化和渐进变化的及时适应。</p><p>我们的工作采用了企业的复杂适应性系统视图，表明弹性源自三种基本的适应能力：感知和监控，以识别商业环境中出现的新变化；业务模型组合开发，以构建和测试跨运营环境的能力；和基础能力建设，以长寿驱动增长，避免企业停滞。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a>此外，这些能力中的每一项都取决于<em>风险情报</em>能力的发展。</p><p></p><p>我们将风险情报定义为严格解释风险及其给公司带来的后果或机会的磨练能力。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a>它使领导者能够看穿环境的复杂性，并系统地识别、分类和解释风险。这使他们能够超越已知的风险因素，有意识地探索未知的风险，从而拥抱而不是避免不确定性。重要的是，风险情报让人们认识到，个别风险或它们表现出来的形式远不及它们对公司价值交换系统的共同后果——即管理、识别、创造、传达、交付、获取、保护和维持价值。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a>最后，它为领导者提供了风险的网络视图，不仅阐明了风险的直接后果，还阐明了风险在公司价值交换系统中级联的方式，从而能够更有效地分配风险缓解资源。在本文中，我们将风险情报分解为可操作的元素，领导者可以追求这些元素，以帮助长期加强他们的组织。</p><h3>识别、分类和解释风险事件</h3><p>领导者无法准确预测特定的风险事件，也无法让公司为所有风险做好准备。然而，他们可以系统地识别、分类和解释风险事件，揭示看似不同的事件可能产生相似的后果。</p><p>第一步是研究每个业务价值函数，并确定可能对其有效性产生影响的似是而非的风险事件。为了帮助完成这一过程，我们构建了一个与行业无关的清单，将我们的研究中确定的与个体价值交换系统组件相关的 99 个主要风险类别分为三层。 （请参阅“价值函数风险清单”。）虽然不可避免地并不详尽，但该资源可作为识别任何企业面临的潜在风险的可靠起点。 </p><div class="callout-highlight callout-highlight--transparent callout--expand-column" id="fig1"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>价值函数风险清单</h4><p class="caption">这份源自标准普尔 500 指数 20 年数据的风险清单显示了公司价值交换系统（绿色节点）的功能如何与业务功能及其各自的风险类别相关联。 </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MAG_FE_Sheth_fig1.png" alt="价值函数风险清单"/></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p>接下来，领导者应该根据风险事件的影响<em>范围</em>、它们引起的变化的<em>持久性</em>以及事件发生的<em>频率</em>来描述和分组风险事件。 （参见“风险特征”。）领导者随后可以解释每组风险事件与公司价值交换系统组成部分之间的联系。</p><div class="callout-highlight" id="fig2"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>表征风险</h4><p class="caption">每一种风险都可以根据其影响的广泛程度、它引起的变化可能持续多长时间以及它发生的频率来描述。例如，大雪事件具有行业内范围、诱发临时变化、发生频率低等特点。 </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MAG_FE_Sheth_fig2.png" alt="表征风险" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p>风险分类从了解风险事件的范围开始，它传达了一种风险影响在受影响的利益相关者范围内的感受范围。 COVID-19 大流行的广泛范围在整个价值网络中产生了供需方面的影响，而范围狭窄的事件，例如单个制造工厂的罢工，往往会产生更有限的影响。当多个利益相关者经历同时或相继的中断时，影响的复杂性增加会阻止系统自组织恢复常态。这种情况也可能会引起主权国家或国际组织的干预，它们可以帮助恢复或充当新的破坏力量。</p><p>要对风险事件进行全面分类，领导者还必须考虑其后果的持久性。大流行和 2021 年苏伊士运河堵塞都造成了供应方中断，但每个事件引起的变化的持久性差异很大。虽然运河堵塞等供应链冲击通常遵循自组织修正机制，即价格上涨降低需求并使滞后供应正常化，但同样的公式不能用于应对像大流行这样的长期情况。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a>在规划和实施响应策略之前了解持久性很重要。例如，大流行造成的业务中断范围更广，后果更持久，与运河堵塞的影响更有限相比，影响的价值体系功能要多得多。</p><p></p><p>风险事件发生的频率也很重要，因为处理频繁事件所需的企业机制可能不同于处理单一事件的机制。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a>尽管公司从所有事件中学习，但他们对重复发生的事件的响应通常会转化为标准操作程序。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a>例如，采用条形码和扫描仪实时跟踪和管理库存，在很大程度上消除了由于数据不匹配而导致的库存记​​录错误和延误。</p><p>我们的范围、持久性和频率 (SPF) 框架提供了一个结构化视图，显示风险事件本身如何不如其后果重要。当多个风险事件同时发生时，该框架特别有用，因为它为管理人员提供了一种通用的、合乎逻辑的方法来考虑它们并快速获取信息和理解。然后将这些事件与公司的价值交换系统联系起来，经理们可以更容易地看到不同的风险何时仍然会对其价值函数产生类似的后果。 <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p>考虑一家制造商与一家海外供应商打交道，其产品由于贸易战而突然被征收高得多的关税，以及一家价值链合作伙伴的破产。这些风险事件具有 SPF 特征（两者的范围都是公司间的，它们的持久性是可逆的，并且它们的频率很低），并且同样重要的是，这两个事件也会影响相同的价值函数。破产和贸易战都可能减缓投入并提高供应方的成本，使满足客户需求变得更加困难。两者还需要制造商确保新的供应来源并稳定运营现金流。通过根据 SPF 框架描述这些潜在风险事件的特征并将它们与价值函数联系起来，管理人员可以将它们更简单地视为对公司的特定价值函数具有共同后果并需要类似准备和响应的风险组。</p><h3>划分和减少不确定性</h3><p>风险事件后果的不确定性是不可避免的，但可以根据不确定性水平落在完全了解和完全无知（两者都是极端且不太可能）之间的范围内来管理。 <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a>然后，领导者应设法将具有较高影响不确定性的风险降低到较低水平。 （参见“影响不确定性的管理水平”。） </p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand-column" id="fig3"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>管理影响不确定性水平</h4><p class="caption">一旦管理人员将风险映射到适当的级别，他们应该采取建议的关键行动，将高阶风险转换为低阶风险。 </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MAG_FE_Sheth_fig3.png" alt="管理影响不确定性水平" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p></p><p>导致 1 级不确定性的风险事件通常涉及数量非常有限的具有明显公司内部影响的未来情景，在这些情景中，可以准确了解风险事件与企业价值交换系统之间的因果关系。此类事件的示例包括生产中的例行变化、预期的销售损失以及执行手动任务时的人为错误。当特定类型的 1 级事件频繁发生时，它们表明过程中存在错误或疏忽，如果诊断正确，这些错误可以永久纠正。例如，货物盗窃——在拥堵的交通枢纽中经常发生的问题——可以使用跟踪集装箱货运并保持实时记录的光学字符识别扫描仪来防止。重要的是，在第 1 级，对公司价值影响的总体不确定性在预期的可接受范围内。</p><p>导致 2 级不确定性的风险事件涉及大量的替代未来情景并具有公司间后果；然而，尽管它们更具挑战性，但它们发生的可能性及其影响是可以估计的。企业的正式情景规划练习通常涉及 2 级事件，在这些事件中，先前获得的有关风险因素影响的知识可以提高准确性和整体有效练习。为期六天的苏伊士运河堵塞是可以预见的，因为 2018 年多艘船连环相撞使运河关闭了两天。因此，五角大楼已经在其正常运营准备中进行了更长时间的堵塞。 <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p>导致 3 级不确定性的风险事件涉及一组有限的场景，其中某些已知风险事件可能以未知方式影响公司。关于风险事件后果的连锁反应如何在这个层面上表现出来的知识有限。通常，这些风险包括具有行业内范围和多利益相关方影响的不太频繁发生的事件，应将其视为最坏的情况。</p><p> <a href="https://www.portrevel.com/">Port Revel</a>是一个位于法国阿尔卑斯山湖上的培训设施，它通过帮助海运公司模拟最坏的情况并确定以前未知的通过主要为小型船舶设计的航运基础设施运营越来越大的集装箱船的后果来降低 3 级不确定性。它密切模拟了海上运输中最棘手地点的条件，允许实习飞行员在强风中驾驶大型集装箱船穿越迷你苏伊士运河，在拥挤的迷你旧金山湾驾驶和停靠游轮，以及操纵油轮通过仿亚瑟港。这些演习引出了意想不到的船舶性能和飞行员行为，有助于识别和解决以前未知的事件后果。</p><p>第 4 级不确定性包括具有未知风险因素的事件，这些事件可能会产生各种负面后果，其影响无法估计。这些未知的未知因素通常通过“其他未知风险可能影响我们的业务运营和预期绩效”等陈述以 10-K 表示。在存在未知未知数的情况下开发场景模型具有挑战性。这些模型是对世界的不完整表征，在开发它们时可能会带来无法想象的风险。</p><p>一旦领导者将影响的不确定性排序为不同的级别，他们就可以专注于通过数据、模拟建模和逻辑分析发现未知因素，将较高级别的影响不确定性转化为较低级别。例如，2016 年英国脱欧公投与 2019 年脱离欧盟之间的三年时间间隔为领导人提供了一个机会，可以将想象中的事件转化为可能的情景，并把握其巨大的贸易影响。通过关注其价值链中最脆弱的方面，例如跨境交易数量最多的方面，领导者本可以认识到通过拥挤港口的货物即将重新分配，并模拟重新路由场景。例如，众所周知，费利克斯托处理着英国 48% 的集装箱贸易，这些货物本来可以发往多个较小且不那么繁忙的港口。港口即将拥堵的迹象也可能暗示延误的可能性很高，并且需要在英国持有更多库存以保证准时交货。</p><p>可能产生永久影响的全系统变化通常是由明显的大趋势引起的，例如技术突破、消费者需求模式的变化、全球事件或监管机构的干预。一旦这些趋势出现在公司的雷达上，它们就可以被跟踪并快速解释（如果必要的观察和建模能力到位）。例如，经过多年辩论后于 2022 年 12 月颁布的欧盟碳边境税要到 2026 年才能全面实施，为企业提供数年时间来减少由此产生的不确定性。</p><p></p><p>此外，对于可能不常见但影响很大的潜在事件，企业可以检查可能更好地认识到类似事件的后果的其他行业；然后他们可以解释对他们自己的价值交换系统的影响。例如，英国脱欧战略家本可以研究美国和加拿大以及美国和墨西哥在汽车和白色家电行业的跨境贸易，以帮助他们应对迫在眉睫的自由贸易协定和边境法规。</p><p>主动识别似是而非的风险事件及其潜在后果是有助于建立真正风险情报的行动类型。然而，我们的研究表明，公司很少强调发现未知和似是而非的风险事件及其结果，而是将注意力集中在管理已知风险上。我们还发现，即使直接竞争对手公开披露了这些风险，公司也不具备类似的完整风险知识。我们对 10-Ks 的研究表明，即使在同一行业的公司之间，对风险因素的认识也存在显着差异。例如，在金融行业 18 家可比公司首次公开数据泄露后，他们对网络风险的认识滞后了八年之久。这种模式在另外四个行业中是一致的——包括零售、电信、技术和医疗保健。</p><p>此外，我们的分析表明，人们对风险因素之间因果关系的认识程度很低，这就是风险在现实世界中如何影响公司。一个已知或未知的风险因素一旦显现，可能会影响其他相关的已知和未知风险因素，从而产生一连串的后果，这是合乎逻辑的。这最终会以可能已知但出乎意料（或更糟的是，被误解）的方式影响一家公司。</p><p></p><p>虽然大多数公司认为他们正在为风险事件做准备，但他们往往只关注 1 级和 2 级不确定性，因此制定了高度具体但范围狭窄的缓解计划。以马士基为例，该公司在 2017 年成为勒索软件网络攻击的受害者，导致其整个网络瘫痪数日，并停止了全球 76 个港口码头的运营，损失约为 3 亿美元。 <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a>然而，这家航运公司直到 2013 年年度报告才公开承认网络攻击的风险，尽管黑客攻击和其他网络威胁的风险自 1990 年代末以来就广为人知（尽管可能并未被认真视为托运人的主要风险）。因此，很少有风险是完全未知的，而特定行业的未知数在其他部门可能不是未知数。</p><h3>构建企业风险网络并将其情境化</h3><p>要更清楚地了解 3 级和 4 级不确定性，了解企业风险之间的联系非常重要。开发量化风险网络 (QRN) 会有所帮助。 QRN 是一张加权图，它将所有已识别的潜在风险与公司的价值交换系统功能联系起来，并帮助决策者解释相关影响。此外，QRN 可以揭示违反直觉的见解，例如一个功能间接暴露于通常与不同但相关的功能相关的风险。例如，货运公司航运需求预测不准确的风险直接影响其运营费用管理功能，并间接影响设施容量、运营能力和客户让步以及公司声誉。</p><p>出于三个原因，公司应该建立自己的风险网络。首先，每家公司都有自己独特的价值交换体系，其领导层最了解这一点。其次，有弹性的公司需要建立冗余，这在资源受限的环境中很难做到。自定义 QRN 突出了连接最紧密且最脆弱的价值函数，从而创建了分配资源以支持企业的优先顺序。第三，自定义 QRN 为公司领导提供了风险共享图，他们可能会或可能不会就关键漏洞达成一致。 QRN 构建活动将管理注意力集中在经常被忽视但可能至关重要的职能和相关风险类别上，以最终帮助领导者预测未来并为未来做好准备。</p><p>要开始构建您公司的风险网络，请根据您的业务所依赖的关键价值函数和清单中捕获的风险类别来识别与您的业务特别相关的风险事件。从公司备忘录、公共风险披露、投资分析师报告和历史知识等数据源中识别每个类别中的似是而非的风险事件。例如，管理运营职能的领导者可以使用库存风险类别（例如设施和流程管理、采购和分销）来构建一个合理的风险因素或事件列表（例如意外风暴、设备故障、输入短缺、应急物资耗尽、工人健康紧急情况、通信中断或罢工），这些都可能影响业务连续性。请注意，这些列表可能包含每个风险类别下的多个风险因素。</p><p>接下来，使用 SPF 框架描述相关风险，确定与公司价值函数相关的合理情景，并确定潜在的应对措施。这种做法使管理人员有机会特别注意不太重视的风险，并帮助他们降低风险对公司价值交换系统影响的总体不确定性水平。</p><p>由于原型公司是按功能组织的，因此应该为 QRN 中的每个功能节点估计潜在风险对单个功能的影响（例如罢工对采购的影响）以及不同价值功能之间的相互关联性。例如，一旦管理者定义了公司采购和运营职能之间的相互关联程度，他们就可以推断出罢工对采购的直接影响及其对运营的间接影响。加权影响，即使使用高、中、低等相对术语，也为管理人员提供了一种共同语言来讨论重大风险和可能的情景，并有助于解决关于什么是可能的或什么是重要的争论。被确定为特别重要或脆弱的功能应由专家进行分析，以更深入地了解影响它们的风险及其相互关联性。</p><p>我们创建了一个通用的 QRN，首先要求具有部门和职能专业知识的领导者以 10 分制表示他们的职能与其他业务职能之间的相互联系。 （参见“定量风险网络”。）然后，我们要求领导者说明这些联系所产生的特定风险对其职能领域的潜在影响。例如，一位表示与业务战略职能有显着关联的销售和营销专家被问及销售预测风险、销售执行风险和声誉风险是否会对业务战略产生高、中或低影响。公司可以遵循此流程，通过利用内部领导者和外部专家来建立统一的理解。一旦编码，数据就构成了风险网络表示和公司特定 QRN 的基础。 </p><div

通过阐明价值交换系统的核心功能，帮助领导者更好地了解公司对风险事件的脆弱性。影响核心功能的风险事件将意味着对公司价值交换系统产生强烈的负面影响。例如，财务资本管理直接连接到 15 个财务风险类别，并间接连接到其他职能的 30

effectively reduce level 3 and 4 uncertainty.</p><p> A company with a well-honed QRN will be able to differentiate between the scope and consequences of a business interruption due to, say, a pandemic and a transport route blockage. It will also be able to pinpoint the parts of the business that will likely experience significant consequences from these events, such as value delivery, value creation, and value protection, and identify the precise business functions that should be guarded for each of these events. In the case of the pandemic, these functions would include financial capital management, market risk assessment, and technology management; for the lower-scope blockage, these would include operations management and operating expense control. Furthermore, the company could use the value function risk inventory and build scenario models for risk events identified within each of these functions.</p><p> Ultimately, pairing the knowledge of plausible risk events and their likely interactions with the company&#39;s value functions enables strategists to develop tailored mitigation plans and response strategies. Leaders who recognize the need to better understand a specific set of scenarios can invest in developing precise models to reduce the uncertainty of their impact on the company.</p><p></p><p></p><p> The value exchange system that drives any large, complex enterprise is continuously challenged as contexts vary in the dynamic business environment. This raises the stakes for anticipating change, exploring new variations of business models, and continuously pursuing the next wave of growth-enabling capabilities. Risk intelligence helps leaders in this work, enabling them to better focus on maintaining continuous value exchange and fostering the adaptability needed to achieve resilience.</p><p> To create and nurture risk intelligence, a company needs a central risk management function that is staffed with broad functional expertise and given the resources required to identify and categorize risks. It needs to embrace a mindset of risk uncertainty versus risk avoidance and reduce the levels of uncertainty. It needs a company-specific quantified risk network that is updated in a dynamic manner. And finally, it needs a culture of risk intelligence in which leaders across the organization share a common framework and language for interpreting risks and guiding resource allocation for risk mitigation efforts. Ultimately, honing a risk intelligence capability represents the key to building a resilient enterprise.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/risk-intelligence-and-the-resilient-company/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Predictive Models Can Lose the Plot.

However, these organizational efforts often fail — sometimes with spectacular consequences.</p><p> In 2018, real estate marketplace Zillow launched Zillow Offers, an “instant buyer” arm of the business. It leveraged a proprietary algorithm called Zestimate, which calculates how much a given residential property can be expected to sell for. Based on these calculations, Zillow Offers planned to purchase, renovate, and resell properties for a profit. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> While it had some success for the first few years, the model failed to adjust to the new dynamics of a more volatile market in 2021. Zillow lost an average of $25,000 on every home it sold in the fourth quarter that year — resulting in a write-down of $881 million. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2个</a></p><p>This is an example of what we call <em>algorithmic inertia</em> : when organizations use algorithmic models to take environmental changes into account but fail to keep pace with those changes. In this article, we explain algorithmic inertia, identify its sources, and suggest practices organizations can implement to overcome it.</p><p></p><h3> A Credit-Rating Catastrophe</h3><p> To understand the phenomenon of algorithmic inertia, we conducted an in-depth study of another organization that failed to respond to changes in the environment: Moody&#39;s, a financial research firm that provides credit ratings for bonds and complex financial instruments such as residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs). These securities aggregated bundles of individual mortgages into distinct tranches with unique characteristics during the period leading up to the global financial crisis of 2008. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p> Moody&#39;s made a concerted effort to account for environmental changes in its credit ratings by developing a proprietary algorithmic model in 2000 called M3 Prime. The model analyzed data about properties, mortgage holders, and the economy to estimate two parameters central to calculating a credit rating: expected losses for the mortgage pool and the loss coverage protection required for a security to maintain a AAA rating. An analyst would present a recommendation to Moody&#39;s credit rating committee, which assigned a publicly posted rating for the security. Moody&#39;s monitored these ratings and upgraded or downgraded RMBSs as the environment changed. The M3 Prime model achieved early success, so in 2006, Moody&#39;s expanded its scope of algorithmic analysis by introducing a derivative model, M3 Subprime.</p><p> Between 2000 and 2008, Moody&#39;s provided credit ratings for thousands of RMBSs, but it ended up downgrading 83% of AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities valued at billions of dollars by 2008. The US government, along with 21 states and the District of Columbia, held Moody&#39;s responsible for the role that its inflated ratings of those and other products played in precipitating the financial crisis. In 2017, the agency agreed to pay $864 million to settle the allegations. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p> This is a particularly illustrative example of algorithmic inertia with devastating societal consequences. Moody&#39;s decisions offer an excellent context for exploring algorithmic inertia because the organization was explicitly responsible for analyzing environmental changes as part of its core service. Moreover, we were able to access detailed information about its algorithmic model from a report produced by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that includes extensive interviews conducted under oath with Moody&#39;s executives who were involved in the business at the time. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5个</a></p><p>Our analysis enabled us to identify the most significant contributing factors to algorithmic inertia — buried assumptions, superficial remodeling, simulation of the unknown future, and specialized compartmentalization — described below.

For example, loan originators were increasingly underwriting mortgages based on lower credit standards and substantially less documentation than before. So an original assumption undergirding Moody&#39;s M3 Prime model — that the technology that mortgage originators were using to streamline the loan application process was also enabling a more accurate assessment of underlying risks — wasn&#39;t modified to reflect the changing lending environment. The managing director of credit policy at Moody&#39;s told a federal inquiry panel that he sat on a high-level structured credit committee that would have been expected to deal with issues like declining mortgage underwriting standards, but the topic was never raised. “We talked about everything but … the elephant sitting on the table,” he said. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p></p><p> Moody&#39;s model also assumed that consumers&#39; FICO credit scores were the primary predictive factor in loan defaults. But the quality of this data input significantly diminished over time: As the use of these credit scores became increasingly common, individuals found ways to artificially inflate them. As a result, low- and no-documentation mortgages carried latent risk that was not being taken into account in Moody&#39;s algorithmic model. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a></p><p> <strong>Superficial remodeling.</strong> This phenomenon occurs when organizations make only minor modifications to the algorithmic model in response to substantive changes in the environment. At Moody&#39;s, some major changes to the environment included a growing number of loan originators, increasingly low-quality mortgages, and an unprecedented decline in interest rates.</p><p> Moody&#39;s response to these changes was to seek to capture more business in the rapidly growing market, so it fine-tuned the model to be “more efficient, more profitable, cheaper, and more versatile,” according to its chief credit officer — not to be more accurate. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> When it modified M3 Prime to introduce the M3 Subprime model, it extrapolated loss curves for subprime loans based on premium loans rather than developing fresh loss curves for subprime loans.</p><p> <strong>Simulation of the unknown future.</strong> Relying on an algorithmic model to produce viable scenarios for the future environment can also leave organizations vulnerable to algorithmic inertia. Moody&#39;s constructed a simulation engine featuring 1,250 macroeconomic scenarios that enabled it to estimate possible future losses based on variations in economic markers such as inflation, unemployment, and house prices. However, the simulation engine was limited by its underlying structure and assumptions, so analysts did not consider the changes that were occurring, did not update scenarios, and failed to accurately represent the changing macroeconomic environment. Based on the belief that detailed performance histories could more precisely reveal causal links between economic stresses and loan behavior, Moody&#39;s used estimates based on historical parameters rather than expected pool loss distributions to examine behavior in stress scenarios. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p> <strong>Specialized compartmentalization.</strong> This situation arises when experts in different domains are involved in an algorithm&#39;s design and use and there is no overarching single ownership or shared understanding of the model. At Moody&#39;s, responsibilities for the credit rating routine were divided between the domain experts (credit rating committee members) who used the quantitative model and the quantitative analysts who had developed it.</p><p> Because ownership and use of the model were distributed, and Moody&#39;s didn&#39;t strictly define how to use it, credit rating committee members established ad hoc rules to adjust the results of the model when its outputs didn&#39;t conform to what their expert judgment led them to believe it ought to produce. Model outputs weren&#39;t considered final; rather, the models were seen as tools to be used in conjunction with other approaches, and there was much divergence in how different ratings committees made their determinations.</p><p> The models were developed and modified by individuals who were distant from the domains in which they would be applied; disparate groups of domain experts then used the models in inconsistent ways without understanding their underlying logic. The managing director for rating RMBSs described the model as so technically complex that few people understood how it worked. <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a></p><p> This issue is at the heart of what makes algorithmic inertia hard to tackle: The models and algorithms are often so complex that domain experts can hardly grasp the details of their functioning, while data scientists are disconnected from how their models are being used in the real world.</p><h3> Develop Practices That Combat Algorithmic Inertia</h3><p> We have described how each of the causes of algorithmic inertia played out in Moody&#39;s use of an algorithmic model to dynamically incorporate changes in the environment into its credit ratings. Despite recognizing flaws in the model and making active attempts to change it, the organization was unable to effectively adapt to the environment, thereby substantially contributing to the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p> To prevent similar degradation of critical algorithms&#39; predictive value, we suggest that organizations implement the four practices described below. (See “Keeping Algorithms Relevant.”)</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Keeping Algorithms Relevant</h4><p class="caption"> Organizations can increase the likelihood that algorithmic tools will effectively adapt to changes in the environment by following four practices. </p><table id="Chart#" class="chart-grouped-rows no-mobile"><thead><th style="border-right:hidden;border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;"></th><th style="border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;"></th></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right:hidden;border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding-left:0px;"><p> <strong>Expose Data and Assumptions</strong></p></td><td style="border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;"><p> Articulate and document the data and the fundamental assumptions in the algorithmic model. </p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right:hidden;background-color:#f0f0f0;border-bottom-color:black;padding-left:0px;"><p> <strong>Periodically Redesign Algorithmic Routines</strong></p></td><td  style="background-color:#f0f0f0;;border-bottom-color:black;"><p> Periodically redesign — and be willing to overhaul — the algorithmic model and how it fits into broader organizational routines. </p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right:hidden;border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding-left:0px;"><p> <strong>Assume That the Model Will Break</strong></p></td><td style="border-bottom-color:black;background-color:#f0f0f0;"><p> Actively consider scenarios outside the scope of algorithmic models by challenging predictive assumptions, assuming that the model will be fundamentally flawed, and envisioning qualitative alternative predictions of the future.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right:hidden;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding-left:0px;"><p> <strong>Build Bridges Between Data Scientists and Domain Experts</strong></p></td><td style="background-color:#f0f0f0;"><p> Ensure that data scientists and domain experts work closely together to design the algorithmic model and the organizational routine in which it is to be embedded. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><!--IMAGE FALLBACK FOR MOBILE BELOW --></p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MAG_Glaser_Table_2.png" alt="Keeping Algorithms Relevant" class="no-desktop" /></p></article></aside></div><p></p><p> <strong>Expose data and assumptions.</strong> Organizations should articulate and document the data used in their algorithmic models, including data sources and fundamental assumptions underlying their data selection decisions, which can have deleterious effects. <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a> Models often include operationalizations of many concepts, and it is easy for organizations to lose track of these parameters, which can be buried in layers of software code. Parameters representing the environment need to be documented to ensure that they remain visible. Similarly, the fundamental assumptions undergirding the model should be articulated and periodically revisited.</p><p> Moody&#39;s used a data set on premium mortgages to train a model that was intended to be used to rate RMBSs composed of subprime mortgages. Initially, this might have been a reasonable choice due to the availability of data. But when a model&#39;s initial data set isn&#39;t refreshed, algorithmic inertia can result. As the Moody&#39;s case suggests, data is never completely accurate, objective, and flawless. Therefore, making the sources of data and assumptions about those sources transparent to algorithm users, and continually reflecting on the appropriateness of that data, are critical practices for organizations seeking to avoid algorithmic inertia.</p><p> Organizations must keep data sources clearly organized and evaluate them periodically. Different data sources have different qualities and characteristics. Ensuring that these sources are distinguished from one another before they are fed into algorithmic models, processed, and constantly compared against one another enables data scientists to identify and eliminate algorithmic inertia sooner rather than later.</p><p> The assumptions underpinning the use of an algorithm should also be documented and articulated. Any attempt to model the environment involves quantification — transforming aspects of reality into numerical data. Such quantification inevitably involves making assumptions about how the environment works. However, while quantification is necessary for algorithmic models to work, details about how it is performed can get lost in the complex process of designing and using algorithmic models. Therefore, maintaining a living record of such assumptions may prevent the emergence of algorithmic inertia.</p><p> <strong>Periodically redesign algorithmic routines.</strong> Organizations should regularly redesign — and be willing to overhaul — their algorithmic model and reconsider how it fits into broader organizational routines. The initial design of an algorithmic model can take a lot of work, and it is natural for an organization to want to reap the benefits of that work. However, in a dynamic and quickly changing environment, it&#39;s important to be willing not just to make incremental changes to a model but to fundamentally overhaul it if necessary.</p><p> Of course, organizations face a trade-off when it comes to overhauling an algorithmic routine: It can be very expensive to completely re-architect an algorithmic model. However, the consequences of failing to do so can be disastrous.</p><p> For example, when Moody&#39;s had to rate an increasing number of subprime-dominated RMBSs, the organization chose to incrementally modify the M3 Prime model. However, it may have been more effective to specify the distinctions between the prime and the subprime markets and do a deeper overhaul of the original model. In addition to rethinking the algorithmic model itself, an organization can consider how it is deployed in practice: Hypothetically, Moody&#39;s could have applied the M3 Prime model differently to different types of RMBSs — perhaps simply requiring more human intervention for tranches composed of lower-quality loans.</p><p> Redesigning and overhauling an algorithmic model is contingent upon understanding what organizational processes interrelate with the model and analyzing the implications that changes in the environment have for it. If it becomes clear that either the model or the processes that it relies on or feeds into have been rendered obsolete or ineffective, an overhaul should be seriously considered.</p><p> <strong>Assume that the model will break.</strong> It can be dangerous for an organization to think of potential future scenarios only through the prism of what algorithmic models predict: All assumptions embedded in a model limit the potential futures that can be considered. To address algorithmic inertia associated with the simulation of an unknown future, it is important to assume that the model will break. Consider scenarios beyond the scope of the algorithmic model; this requires challenging predictive assumptions as well as presuming that the model is fundamentally flawed.</p><p> An active practice of considering scenarios that are <em>outside</em> the model can help motivate and inspire the prior two practices — exposing data and assumptions and periodically redesigning algorithmic routines — by forcing team members to actively consider the limitations of algorithmic models.</p><p></p><p> One particularly useful approach might be to make use of qualitative predictions of the future instead of quantitative predictions that rely on available data from the past. These forms of scenario planning offer opportunities to consider radically different visions of what the future may hold. This might also entail developing hybrid algorithms that do not precisely rely on past data to predict scenarios but also embed in them qualitative measures and expert rules introduced by domain experts.</p><p> <strong>Build bridges between data scientists and domain experts.</strong> Organizations must create processes for data scientists and domain experts to work closely together to design their algorithmic routines. <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a> Practically speaking, data scientists and AI specialists approach problems very differently than domain experts do. Domain experts focus on organizational routines and idiosyncratic situations, whereas data scientists focus on developing generalizable constructs based on mathematical principles. To overcome algorithmic inertia, data scientists and domain experts must work closely together to understand how characteristics of organizational routines and idiosyncratic situations map to the mathematical parameters used in an algorithmic model.</p><p> When the worlds of data scientists and domain experts are completely separate, there is also the danger that data scientists and domain experts will shift responsibility by superficially trusting each other&#39;s work. Such assumptions can actually prevent crucial dialogue between the two worlds. For instance, Moody&#39;s ended up subverting the results of its credit rating model because the credit rating analysts didn&#39;t attempt to understand why the model might be generating results that didn&#39;t fit with their intuitions. Building bridges between data scientists and domain experts enables domain experts to obtain an intuitive grasp of how the algorithmic model works. Such common ground could enable organizations to create and use models that better adapt to changes in the environment.</p><p> One structural bridge-building practice that organizations can use to facilitate communication between data scientists and domain experts is establishing a position such as a product manager. This should be held by one individual with both domain and data science experience who has direct responsibility for overseeing algorithmic routines. For example, some data experts have called for the creation of a new organizational structure that includes an “innovation marshal” role — someone who is respected by both data scientists and field experts. <a id="reflink13" class="reflink" href="#ref13">13</a> Given their knowledge and expertise in both areas, these people can gain the respect of the organization by developing and maintaining “high-bandwidth, bidirectional communication channels” that help ensure that algorithmic routines are able to adapt to environmental changes. <a id="reflink14" class="reflink" href="#ref14">14</a></p><p></p><p> Another bridge-building practice is called <em>model explainability</em> : describing the algorithmic models in a practical and comprehensible manner. For data scientists, such explainability can facilitate access to the expert knowledge needed to counteract the sources of algorithmic inertia; for domain experts, such explainability can help them develop a deep and intuitive understanding of how the model takes environmental changes into account. Model explainability establishes common ground between two groups of professionals who have different types of expertise. Such practices enable organizations to build bridges instead of just talking about them.</p><p></p><p> Organizations seeking to reap the benefits of powerful predictive analytics are increasingly confronting the problem of algorithmic inertia. Despite leveraging dynamic algorithms to adapt to changes in the environment, organizations may find that the results are not keeping pace with new developments.

“你如何定义你的劳动力？”我们已经向数十名高管和多项全球管理调查提出了这个问题。最常见的答案也是最令人惊讶的。</p><p>少数自信的高管表示，他们的员工就是他们的员工。但绝大多数人，尤其是处于组织转型前线的领导者，所持的观点更广泛，不仅仅是员工。他们越来越多地将劳动力描述为参与实现公司业务目标的所有人员和群体。组织的扩展劳动力对其业务、品牌和价值创造方法变得如此重要，以至于他们需要以不同的方式思考并以不同的方式对待他们的整个员工队伍。</p><p>自从我们几年前开始研究劳动力的未来以来，这代表了管理观点的转变。我们正在看到这种跨行业和各种规模的组织发生的变化——领导者需要重新定义他们的员工队伍由谁组成以及由什么组成，并制定新的管理实践和组织结构，这对领导者提出了挑战。</p><p></p><p>等级制、命令与控制、以内部为中心的管理实践不适合跨越内部和外部组织边界的员工队伍。例如，使用孤立的职能来独立管理员工和外部贡献者充满了挑战：不明确的决策权、治理流程和权力动态甚至会破坏最善意的高管。此外，用于管理员工的技术系统通常与用于访问和跟踪外部贡献者的技术系统不同且相互脱节。缺乏整合会导致效率低下，从而阻碍获得和维持具有战略价值的能力的努力。</p><p>我们将<em>劳动力生态系统</em>定义为一个结构，其中包含组织内外的参与者，他们致力于为组织创造价值。在生态系统中，参与者朝着个人和集体目标努力，参与者之间相互依存和互补。</p><p>劳动力生态系统包括员工以及各种外部贡献者和合作伙伴——长期和短期承包商、临时工、应用程序开发人员、服务提供商和众包参与者。生态系统观点明确认识到，获取和聘用劳动力不再是人力资源职能的唯一权限，而是需要涉及最高管理层、IT、采购、财务、法律和其他领域的领导者的跨职能行动。</p><p>有意识地协调劳动力生态系统需要领导者协调整个组织的活动以及与外部贡献者的活动。为了应对这一挑战，公司需要重新评估人力资源、采购和 IT 等职能之间的协调。还需要决定如何管理与外部贡献者的关系，例如应用程序开发人员和分包商。我们开发了<em>集成架构</em>的概念来定义内部协调以及组织如何与其扩展的员工交互。</p><p></p><p>我们的集成架构模型与大多数劳动力生态系统中管理交互的默认、孤立的方法形成鲜明对比。通常，临时工负责采购。合作伙伴和联盟通常由战略处理，人工智能和自动化是技术组织的一部分（但很少被视为更广泛的劳动力生态系统的一部分）。人力资源部通常监督全职和兼职员工。在这种通用方法中，多个小组独立工作以管理他们有任务的贡献者，但整个组织的努力是不协调的。</p><p>不同部门的经理经常在没有任何集中协调的情况下使用外部和内部员工的组合。这些分散的方法在局部层面可能是有效的，每个业务部门和职能经理都保留最大的控制权，但它们在总体层面上并不是最优的。</p><p>事实上，在协调劳动力生态系统时，权力下放可能会有很大的缺点。分散的努力可能与总体战略重点不一致，并可能破坏企业对新战略方向的追求。缺乏集成可能会限制有关谁（和什么）为组织做出贡献的可用数据。这可能会导致成本效率低下，因为临时工是临时寻找的。这可能意味着内部员工和外部贡献者（现有的和潜在的）都不太了解贡献的机会。虽然权力下放是目前管理员工和扩展劳动力的最常见方法，但它几乎总是不协调的。</p><h3>为什么集中式集成架构具有吸引力</h3><p>鉴于分散架构的缺点，许多协调劳动力生态系统的组织正在创建在其设计中更加集中和跨职能的集成架构。在一些组织中，人力资源部门协调劳动力生态系统管理与采购和 IT 职能；在这些情况下，业务领导者和团队与 HR 和其他人合作，主动管理风险。其他公司正在采用更具跨职能的方法来管理所有类型的个体工人和提供者；在这些情况下，人力资源发挥着关键但不太重要的作用，人才市场在支持跨业务部门和职能的劳动力需求方面发挥着更突出的作用。</p><p>例如，瑞士全球医疗保健公司诺华公司成立了一个跨职能指导委员会来管理其大约 100,000 名内部员工和大约 50,000 名外部员工。诺华正在努力为管理人员提供内部和外部人才来源的可见性，这是​​由来自各种合作伙伴和平台的数据驱动的一项努力。这个过程将由称为劳动力战略家的策展人推动，他们将授予管理人员实时访问员工、承包商和技术团队的权限。</p><p>这场大流行病促使我们研究的另一家全球公司的人力资源部门更多地参与监督更广泛的员工队伍，因为它引发了对临时工和员工的远程和现场工作政策、薪酬连续性、缺勤和病假的担忧。该公司人力资源副总裁报告说，在大流行之前，人力资源部门只密切关注全职员工或兼职员工的情况；通常，对于临时工，“人力资源部门根本不参与，”她说。当时，甚至对于公司临时工的组成人员都没有达成共识。大流行病使公司必须更加集中整合和灵活地照顾其临时工的想法变得紧迫。它还强调，公司需要更好地管理更广泛员工的声誉、法律、运营和成本风险，并充分利用全体员工的竞争优势。</p><p>在同一家公司，招聘流程和程序历来因部门而异——而且部门之间往往不相互沟通。人力资源部支持有关雇用长期雇员的决定，而采购则引入临时工。与此同时，人力资源部门不知道的是，管理人员经常将临时工转变为全职员工。一个涉及人力资源、采购和财务的新开发的信息交换平台为公司提供了基于数据的跨职能可见性，以跟踪和批准外部员工。</p><p>根据首席采购官的说法，临时员工的管理一直是公司的一个烫手山芋：“任何处于中心位置的人都将承担所有风险，而没有任何好处。”但他表示，该公司已经转向从战略而非交易的角度考虑与临时工的关系，这涉及跨职能管理临时工。正如人力资源副总裁所解释的那样，“我们的首席财务官、首席法律顾问、首席人力资源官 [chief human resources officer] 和首席运营官都承认他们都参与了这场游戏。”</p><p>人才市场是另一个很好的工具，可以锚定一个集中的、跨职能集成的​​架构。例如，NASA 曾经有六个人才市场平台，分布在多个部门，每个平台都独立地将员工与演出和项目相匹配。现在，航天局使用单一的人才市场——一种协调机制——来协调整个组织对内部人才的访问。将其内部人才市场扩展到外部贡献者是 NASA 的目标。</p><p></p><h3>集成架构挑战</h3><p>虽然集中式和跨职能集成架构使组织能够在其劳动力生态系统中实现更高级别的协调，但这些努力仍处于初期阶段。即使在处于劳动力生态系统转型前沿的公司中，领导者也强调这些努力才刚刚开始获得牵引力。在我们的研究和咨询工作中，我们发现大多数组织仍然采用被动、本地和不协调的方法来招募和留住外部人才和互补贡献者。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1个</a></p><p>领导者意识到，这种分散的努力既没有成本效益，也没有资源效率，并且有可能使内部员工失去积极性。然而，他们努力为劳动力生态系统编排建立一个集中的跨职能集成架构。我们听到了以下担忧：</p><ul><li>您如何确定一组合适的利益相关者来创建用于劳动力生态系统编排的集中集成架构？</li><li>您如何让利益相关者参与本地劳动力生态系统实验，以根据特定情况调整共同目标？</li><li>您如何从本地实验中促进协调学习？</li><li>随着时间的推移，您如何改进您的劳动力生态系统实施流程？</li></ul><p>要打造一个一体化的劳动力生态系统，至少需要解决三类问题：结构设计（涉及分工、目标和激励）、政治（涉及资源、权力和地位）和文化（影响个人对身份和意义的追求）。我们建议对这些问题采取分阶段的方法，这些问题相互交织、重叠并可以相互加强。此过程可能最适合开始采用劳动力生态系统的大型成熟组织，但关键要素应该对中小型企业有所帮助。

class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p>在第一阶段，我们建议创建一个编排团队，与相关的本地和中央利益相关者（内部和外部）协商制定工作计划、目标和指标。该团队应关注组织内部的整合考虑（职能角色和职责）以及与外部参与者的关系。通过与组织内已经聘用外部员工的团队合作，团队可以与在协调部分劳动力生态系统方面经验丰富的经理一起抢先一步。从结构设计的角度来看，他们可以快速开始突出并解决之前发现的技能差距。</p><p>为了解决政治问题，团队可以选择当地德高望重和行动导向的冠军来领导转型。此外，该团队可以包括来自外部贡献者的代表，以将他们的观点带入工作中。团队成员应能够酌情代表职能领域、产品组和业务部门发言；关键是获得所有利益攸关方群体的参与。最后，为了应对文化挑战，至少有一名团队成员应该扮演边界扳手的角色，充当中央团队、地方团队和其他受影响群体之间的中间人。</p><p>第二阶段，我们建议推进地方试点。中央编排团队可以引入试点项目来探索劳动力生态系统关系的潜在配置。这些实验可以解决结构性问题，例如为项目配备内部和外部员工、确定必要的技能、确保能力以及衡量结果的质量。他们可以解决政治挑战，例如内部员工抵制外部员工的贡献，以及当地领导因为失去对团队组成的控制而感到紧张。最后，随着员工适应职责的转变，可能会出现文化问题，特别是如果他们需要承担更多的协调角色，协调来自不同来源的参与者。</p><p>在第三阶段，我们强调协调学习和资源配置，跨越由本地团队确定并由中央团队监督的挑战（和成功）。现有政策和程序（例如知识产权许可模型或培训规则）等结构性障碍可能在传统的员工生命周期模型中为组织提供良好服务，但需要对劳动力生态系统进行修改。资源问题可能会出现，因为当地管理人员雇用了更多的外部工人或更容易与分包商合作，但随后拒绝释放员工接受其他机会。即使最高管理层和较低级别的人接受变革，中层管理人员也可能会抵制，因为他们经常肩负管理这些有时具有高度破坏性的转型的日常挑战的任务。</p><p>在第四个也是最后一个阶段，我们考虑劳动力生态系统的扩展。一旦对初始试点进行了分析并且新实践开始制度化，领导者应该考虑哪些其他新系统、工具、目标、指标和流程已被证明足够成功，可以采用。随着组织不断获得知识和经验，应定期审查这些内容。领导者可能希望扩大中央协调团队，以包括来自其他内部团队的代表。他们可能想考虑将他们的劳动力生态系统与其他人联系起来——例如，与客户组织及其生态系统更紧密地合作。在文化上，领导者可以考虑通过讲故事和其他沟通工具更积极地促进分布式学习和劳动力生态系统活动。他们可能希望强调增长机会，同时也开始解决不可避免地伴随此类转型而来的无数担忧。</p><p>这种四阶段方法提供了一种实用的方法来吸引、连接和激活关键利益相关者。从那里开始，组织可以开始塑造自己的战略和路径，方法是尝试新型集成架构，并在了解不同环境下哪些有效和无效时快速迭代。</p><p>与集成架构定义内部职能和业务部门如何协同工作以协调劳动力生态系统的方式相呼应，领导者需要定义如何管理与外部贡献者的关系。领导者面临着关于哪些集成架构适合外部贡献者的几个决定。</p><p>第三方集成架构的选择可能决定合作伙伴愿意花费资源参与（或贡献）劳动力生态系统的程度。例如，关于如何与开发人员生态系统协调的决策对于有效的劳动力生态系统至关重要。 Google Play 是 Google 的应用程序和内容分发市场。与 Apple 分发应用程序和内容的 Apple App Store 相比，Google 的操作更轻松，要求和合规性测试也不那么严格。众所周知，Apple 的政策要严格得多。与外部开发人员的集成架构可能或多或少有些僵化，也可能或多或少受欢迎。</p><p>与第三方构建集成架构引发了关于谁应该在企业内拥有这些关系的问题。例如，视频游戏机制造商通常允许第三方开发者（补充者）开发可在其系统上运行的游戏；通常，正是对这些第三方游戏的需求推动了特定游戏机的销售。开发者关系应该由业务开发或战略小组（也可能处理战略联盟）负责，还是由专门负责开发者生态系统的单独小组负责？集成架构有助于定义职责并裁定具有竞争利益的内部团队之间的潜在冲突。</p><p></p><p>在您的组织中实施集成架构首先要评估您的劳动力生态系统当前的运作方式。您组织的人力资源职能目前对内部和外部贡献者有多大的可见性和控制力？如果这些贡献者当前以分散的方式进行管理，请评估您的组织是否最适合此架构。</p><p></p><p>如果您认识到更集中集成和协调的劳动力生态系统对您的组织来说是更好的方法，请决定哪些团体和个人应该成为协调团队的一部分。是否应该由某人（或某个团体）集中负责监督整个劳动力生态系统？</p><p>在我们的整个研究过程中，我们听到领导者描述了他们在日益复杂和相互联系的劳动力生态系统中聘请对公司成功至关重要的人才的努力。我们一次又一次地观察到，有意识地协调劳动力生态系统的观点可以帮助领导者对他们自己的组织以及他们实现战略目标所依赖的人员、合作伙伴和技术有更丰富、更细致的看法。</p><p></p>

In this study, having a supervisor role at any level almost universally improved the chance that an employee would be promoted and receive high ratings. However, we almost always found that women and people of color were far less likely to be in such roles than men or White employees, respectively.</p><p> The differences are often stark and steep. For example, in a global financial services company we studied, US-based employees who were supervisors were 50% more likely to be promoted and 55% more likely to receive high performance ratings than those who were not supervisors. Outside the US, supervisors were 89% more likely to be promoted and 37% more likely to get high ratings. These effects were even larger for female supervisors than for male supervisors. But across the company, women were half as likely to be supervisors. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2个</a></p><p>Further, because women are more likely than men to face career disruption during their child-rearing years, they may take on supervisor roles later. In such cases, they don&#39;t experience the same compounding benefit of being in such roles as their male colleagues.</p><p> <strong>Reporting relationships.</strong> Whom one reports to can have a decisive impact on the trajectory of one&#39;s career. We generally found that people who reported to supervisors with high performance ratings were significantly more likely to receive a high rating as well. The probability that they would be promoted also increased.</p><p> We saw similar effects for employees whose managers were higher up in the corporate hierarchy than the norm for someone at their level and thus had more clout. To the extent that women and people of color are less likely to report to high-performing and higher-level supervisors, they are less likely to receive high ratings or promotions themselves.</p><p> They may also be less likely to benefit from these relationships when they do have them. At a global insurance company, those who reported to a top-rated supervisor were about 50% more likely to be promoted and 30% more likely to receive high performance ratings. Those whose supervisors were at a level higher than the norm were 9% more likely to be promoted and 14% more likely to be highly rated. However, having a high-performing or higher-ranked supervisor did not help women and people of color as much as it helped White men.</p><p> <strong>Flexible working.</strong> Increasingly, organizations view flexible work arrangements as essential to attracting and retaining talent, particularly women and younger employees. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, more companies and employees have embraced such arrangements, but historically, they have been career killers. For example, those who work part time or remotely or take family leave are less likely to be promoted, are paid less, and are more likely to leave their companies.</p><p> At a business I&#39;ll refer to as ConsumerCo, opting for flexible work arrangements hurt both women and people of color. The percentage of women working part time was three times that of men; for people of color, it was two times that of White employees. Overall, working part time reduced promotion probability by 50% and the likelihood of receiving a high rating by 70%. It also increased turnover probability by 25% compared with similarly situated full-time workers.</p><p> Likewise, leaves of absence were disproportionately taken by women and people of color. Those on leave were about 50% less likely to be promoted or receive high ratings and much more likely to turn over — at least 150% more likely in the US and at least 80% more likely globally. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p> Unless companies do something to mitigate the negative consequences of flexible working on employees, the phenomenon of higher levels of flexible work arrangements risks further undermining career progress for women and people of color.</p><h3> The Case for Proactive Career Management</h3><p> With the exception of performance ratings, these drivers of career progress, or lack thereof, are situational. This is telling. It indicates that whether employees advance is not just a reflection of the talents and skills they bring or what they do, but also of how well their employers position them to succeed. All too often, women and people of color simply aren&#39;t positioned to succeed in the same way their White male counterparts are.</p><p> This is not to say that bias and discrimination are not factors, as mentioned above. However, employers can make measurable progress on DEI when they understand the extent of the positioning issues in their workforce and deal with them in a purposeful, systematic way. This is where PCM comes into play.</p><p></p><p> The idea behind proactive career management for DEI is simple: Identify and rank the factors that most influence career success and retention; if and where they skew significantly against certain demographic groups, intervene to eliminate or reduce the disparities. In other words, work to ensure that demographic characteristics bear no relationship to how well or poorly positioned an employee is to stay and succeed at work.</p><p> Every organization has talent flows that shape their workforce. Employers hire, train, and develop employees. And they value employees by giving them promotions, high ratings, raises, and other forms of compensation for the knowledge, capabilities, behavior, and experience they bring, the effort they deliver, and, ultimately, how they perform. Meanwhile, employees&#39; decisions to stay or leave are influenced by whether their careers are progressing.</p><p> These talent flows and rewards define the internal labor market of an organization and produce the supply of people with the attributes needed to meet the demands of the business. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> But as we have seen, different demographic groups within an organization do not have the same opportunities to acquire these attributes or be rewarded for them.</p><p> By not distributing opportunities equitably, companies effectively restrict their talent supplies. Women and people of color become more likely to leave or, if they stay, become less engaged because their careers are stalled. Knowing how the internal labor market functions for different demographic groups within an organization is thus crucial for a company to execute its DEI strategy.</p><p> To implement PCM, organizations should start by creating a success profile that identifies and ranks the factors that drive who advances. From there, they can examine how each factor influences the probability that employees from different demographic groups get promoted and whether the organization is valuing their capabilities and efforts equitably.</p><p></p><p> Small organizations might rely on the four factors described in the previous section. For them, controlled, statistical analyses of their own internal labor market data are likely infeasible. Such organizations might complement the research with qualitative input about the keys to career progress from their leaders and employees who have successfully risen in the ranks there.</p><p> Large employers with complex organizations will be best served by developing an objective success profile based on empirical evidence that identifies and ranks the critical individual and situational factors that drive success in the organization. The natural place to start is with the factors that drive promotions. But organizations might examine other markers of success as well, like pay, ratings, and retention, to see how well the results align with those from the analysis of promotions.</p><p> After creating the profile, the next step is to examine how the profile plays out for different demographic groups. There are two questions to answer.</p><p> First, are the factors that most influence employee success distributed similarly across demographic groups, or do they tend to be concentrated more in some groups than in others? These are <em>quantity effects</em> , and they reflect the relative frequency of the factors across groups. For instance, are women and people of color as likely as men and White employees to have the prized characteristics or to work in circumstances associated with success?</p><p> Second, when people possess the prized characteristics or work in favored circumstances, do they benefit equally from those attributes, or do some demographic groups benefit more? These are <em>price effects</em> . They reflect whether the employer values the attribute, behavior, or situation in question differently for one group than for another.</p><p> Objectively answering these questions is the foundation of PCM, as illustrated in the case of ConsumerCo.</p><p></p><h3> Positioning Employees for Success at ConsumerCo</h3><p> ConsumerCo&#39;s leaders were committed to improving career and pay equity in both their salaried and front-line workforces.</p><p> The company recognized that having a diverse workforce was not a luxury or a concession to social good; it was essential to its success. With an increasingly diverse customer base and growth occurring mostly in markets outside the US and Europe, having a leadership team and a workforce well attuned to the preferences and norms of local cultures was important to achieving growth targets.</p><p> HR and DEI leaders modeled their workforce data to uncover and assess the success profile for their salaried workforce. They identified 12 factors that were most likely to predict whether someone would be promoted. Situational factors dominated this success profile — a finding that stunned company leaders, who viewed the culture as a meritocracy. Of the top 12, only performance ratings and tenure were specific to the talents or accomplishments of an individual employee. The rest were purely circumstantial.</p><p> Being an expat (working outside one&#39;s home country) was the most positively influential factor. Reporting to a supervisor at a higher level than is typical had the least impact among the top 12 factors, but the effect was statistically significant.</p><p> Other factors included three of the four described earlier: having a high performance rating, being in a supervisory role, and reporting to a highly rated supervisor. In addition, working in certain functions or business lines mattered a lot to how one&#39;s career progressed.</p><p> Similar modeling showed that even the probability of receiving a high rating was inordinately influenced by situational factors. This finding suggested that performance ratings were not accurate measures of individuals&#39; contributions.</p><p> When ConsumerCo&#39;s leaders mapped the success profile to women in the company, they found that when women were positioned in situations conducive to their future progress, they usually fared as well as men. But overall, they were less likely to be so positioned. (See “Mapping Women&#39;s Experiences to a Success Profile.”) For instance, women who were expats were more likely to be promoted from those roles than otherwise comparable men, but women were less represented among the expat population.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Mapping Women&#39;s Experiences to a Success Profile</h4><p class="caption"> A global consumer products retailer identified the 12 attributes that most strongly influenced whether an employee would be promoted.

When they did have those roles, it did not help their careers to the same extent as comparable men, for reasons that were not clear. ConsumerCo leaders could see that female employees faced a double whammy of sorts: Not only were they blocked from this accelerator role, but they also didn&#39;t get the same lift to their promotion prospects as their male colleagues when they did have that role.</p><p> When the company looked at people of color, it found that they tended to be both less well positioned and less valued than White employees. ConsumerCo needed to change its internal labor market dynamics to achieve career and pay equity for women and people of color.</p><h3> A Checklist for Change</h3><p> Focusing on situational factors has a distinct advantage: They&#39;re easier to address than individual characteristics. For instance, although tenure is an important driver of success, it is a fact of people&#39;s employment history, not something that ConsumerCo could change overnight.</p><p> Still, ConsumerCo identified several areas where it could act reasonably quickly, such as changing reporting relationships for women and people of color, finding opportunities for them to gain more supervisory experience earlier in their careers, and addressing the disparities in performance ratings for people of color.</p><p> The company had found that taking a leave of absence thwarted career advancement, especially for women, and so it is also developing new leave and career development policies to address imbalances for that group.</p><p> Here&#39;s where the “proactive” part of PCM comes in.</p><p> The analysis of ConsumerCo&#39;s success profile made it possible to create a simple checklist of green lights (career advancers) and red flags (success blockers) that managers could use to evaluate the positioning of individual employees. By considering whether women and people of color on their teams were experiencing more green lights or red flags, line managers and supervisors could identify who was well positioned to stay and thrive, as well as who might be at risk of stalling in their career or leaving the organization. (See “Green Lights, Red Flags.”)</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Green Lights, Red Flags</h4><p style="margin-bottom:30px;"> A global consumer products retailer created a checklist of attributes that help or hurt employees&#39; career progress.

For each factor, they could effectively evaluate the situational reality of different groups and tailor their interventions to address the most significant gaps.</p><p> For instance, they found that female, Black, and Hispanic employees were less likely to be reporting to highly rated supervisors, while Asian employees were more likely to have this advantage. And although women were less likely to be reporting to a manager one grade higher than usual, there were no such disparities for people of color. Also, while every non-White racial group was significantly underrepresented in one of the core functions that most contributed to advancement, women were more likely to work in that function than men.</p><p> ConsumerCo is in the early stages of rolling out interventions to address its disparities. But other companies I have worked with have pursued a variety of solutions.</p><p> Closing gaps due to flexible work arrangements often requires changing the culture. In many companies, part-time work is looked upon as evidence of lower commitment, and it can be difficult to shake these perceptions. However, companies can make quick progress on pay if they stop factoring leaves of absence into the statistical models that they use to assess pay equity and adjust wages and salaries to close gaps.</p><p> Situation-based racial disparities in performance ratings have been reduced in some companies through the calibration process used to align ratings by different supervisors. Some have also eliminated forced rankings that provide for a very limited percentage of employees to receive top ratings. These tend to favor people with more tenure, whom supervisors have known longer, and presumably better — and who are more likely to be White.</p><p> Some clients have addressed the importance of supervisor roles by expanding training, both to reinforce the importance of these roles and to help supervisors understand the impact they have on employees&#39; prospects. Leaders can offer training to help women and people of color gain the experience they need to advance — and close the gap between women and men in these positions.</p><h3> Proactive Career Management Has Benefits and Risks</h3><p> Because a success profile is built from an organization&#39;s data, it is more likely to reflect reality than the assumptions that leaders make about how employees succeed. Leaders may be prone to thinking that what got them to the top could get anyone else there as well, and they may oversimplify their own path. Further, people tend to generalize based on their own experiences, even if they don&#39;t represent the organizational norm.</p><p> A good empirical model can counter the tendency of people to engage in wishful thinking or to cling to belief. It can also account for the effects of being in different business lines, functions, geographies, and job families. This is something that&#39;s hard to do based on personal observation and experience alone.</p><p></p><p> Another value of PCM is that it is grounded in what creates value for the business. If, for instance, a role becomes critical to growth, one would expect the employer to accord more value to that role and the employees who successfully deliver value in it. And to the extent that an organization&#39;s DEI strategy helps ensure that high-potential women and people of color are able to access these newly valuable roles and perform them ably, it will serve the greater business need.</p><p> If there is a downside to PCM, it relates to the sharing of sensitive data and intelligence. PCM proceeds from objective modeling of the drivers of success and how they affect different groups. Invariably, the models will surface potentially damaging information about the existence of systemic gender or racial disparities in outcomes and opportunities, which creates legal risk.</p><p> PCM works best when managers understand the realities uncovered by the models and the reasons why specific actions are warranted. Thus, it requires a reasonable level of transparency. Corporate legal departments may, however, object to exposing what they may believe to be strong evidence of bias and inequity.</p><p> There&#39;s a delicate balance to be achieved. Most organizations I work with accomplish it by sharing high-level information with business and line leaders, and sometimes employee groups, about the reasons for particular actions while restricting the more granular data to a smaller group of top executives and HR and DEI leaders. Legal counsel almost always presides over such decisions; however, such advisers have become more understanding of the need for data-driven DEI strategies, appreciating that people can&#39;t solve problems they don&#39;t know about or understand.</p><p></p><p></p><p> The unexplained disparities in career opportunity and advancement at many organizations are important to address because they signal the potential influence of bias and discrimination. But doing so should not override attention to differences that can be explained by legitimate, business-relevant factors. The surest, most sustainable way to create career equity and equitable representation across all levels of an organization is to address the organization&#39;s career development practices (or lack thereof) that systemically impede the progress of women and people of color.</p><p> Of course, the work that employees do, their knowledge and skills, and how hard and effectively they work influence whether they will succeed. But success is also determined by how individuals are positioned to succeed — and organizations can do better at ensuring that all high-potential talent can gain experiences that will set them up for growth.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/opening-access-to-the-fast-track-for-career-equity/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Empower Your Team, Empower Yourself</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/empower-your-team-empower-yourself/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/empower-your-team-empower-yourself/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 07 Jun 2023 11:00:24 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Russell Clayton, Andrew Artis, and Dejun Tony Kong. <p>Russell Clayton is an assistant professor of instruction, teaching MBA courses in the Muma College of Business at the University of South Florida.

With budgets tightening and workforce disruptions such as layoffs affecting many sectors, now is not the time for organizations to eliminate employee professional development and training. Likewise, individuals should continue to upskill regardless of whether organizational resources are plentiful. In this article, we explore ways that executives may approach learning and development (L&amp;D) spending, as well as strategies for employees to secure professional development funding.</p><h3> For Managers: How L&amp;D Can Keep Teams Competitive</h3><p> In this first section, we&#39;ll explore three key strategies for managers to effectively allocate resources for L&amp;D, even during difficult economic times. When they better understand the importance of such programs, leaders can make more informed decisions that benefit the organization in the long term.</p><p></p><h4> 1. Assess the risk of cutting L&amp;D budgets.</h4><p> When budgets are tight, L&amp;D is often among the first programs to suffer cutbacks. This frequently happens because training is perceived as the low-hanging fruit when it comes to justifying budget cuts. However, these types of short-term cost-saving measures may not be a wise strategic move for executives. Having well-trained employees is critical to staying competitive, and we encourage executives to assess the risks their organization will be taking should they decide to eliminate employee training dollars.</p><p> For example, organizations that cut L&amp;D spending may fall behind when the economy recovers compared with those that maintain their investments. As a result, workers could lack the critical skills needed for organizational success. Furthermore, investing in L&amp;D helps companies do more with less. The number of skills needed for a single job has increased 10% annually since 2017, according to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-02-03-gartner-hr-research-finds-fifty-eight-percent-of-the-workforce-will-need-new-skill-sets-to-do-their-jobs-successfully">research conducted by Gartner</a> . Those organizations that continue to prioritize upskilling will have employees who are up to date on the skills needed to accomplish their work, whereas organizations that significantly cut L&amp;D likely will not.</p><p> <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-survey/2020/reports/pwc-23rd-global-ceo-survey.pdf">PwC&#39;s annual CEO survey</a> found that companies with advanced L&amp;D programs in place had higher employee engagement and were better at attracting and retaining top talent. Executives must keep this in mind, even in the face of economic downturns, because slashing L&amp;D budgets can increase the risk of losing talented employees. As Josh Felperin, global sales director of Alps Controls, put it, “Investing in employees&#39; personal and professional development on a consistent basis should be any leadership team&#39;s No. 1 priority, not just financial results.”</p><h4> 2. Shift to framing L&amp;D as an investment.</h4><p> Managers need to consider L&amp;D as an investment rather than a cost. Think about how L&amp;D can generate revenue instead of being just another budget line item. For example, upskilling and promoting from within can save organizations money on recruitment and hiring. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, the average hard cost of recruiting a new employee is $4,700, with total costs — including soft costs such as time — amounting to two to three times the position&#39;s salary. Now imagine what your L&amp;D managers could do with just half of that dollar figure in terms of upskilling a current employee instead of hiring a new candidate. Not only are you saving on recruiting costs — you are also helping your organization close the skills gap that is plaguing many industries.</p><p></p><p> Finally, executives should view their <em>own</em> L&amp;D activities as an investment. In a tight economic environment, it might be tempting to cut both L&amp;D funds and the time dedicated to training. However, research has found a significant relationship between <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ijtd.12082">executive L&amp;D activities and organizational performance</a> .</p><h4> 3. Strategically prioritize the skills to be developed.</h4><p> When facing economic headwinds, budget reductions across all departments might be unavoidable, and we&#39;re not arguing that L&amp;D budgets should remain completely untouched. However, we do advocate for allocating funds to strategic training priorities. The reality is that some L&amp;D training may be postponed until the economy flourishes again. It might be necessary to prioritize hard skills, like project management or cybersecurity, over soft skills, like time management, in the short term. While we strongly support <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/12/20/the-surprising-thing-google-learned-about-its-employees-and-what-it-means-for-todays-students/">soft skills training</a> — they play a key role in every business — we understand that L&amp;D funds may need to be spent on immediate hard-skills training needs in order to keep your organization competitive.</p><p> Match your L&amp;D expenditures to your organization&#39;s KPIs. Amazon is a great example of a company that does this. Despite recent major layoffs, it continues to train employees in key areas through its Upskilling 2025 initiative, including hard skills like cloud computing services and machine learning. Regardless of which skills you value most, the imperative is to be sure you&#39;re providing training opportunities. “Organizations that are not investing in the development of their employees are working against themselves and tripping over their own feet,” Jon Sexton, senior vice president of culture and leadership development at Vibrant Credit Union, asserted.</p><p></p><h3> For Employees: Strategies for Securing Professional Development Opportunities</h3><p> Pursuing professional development opportunities in the workplace can be challenging, particularly when budgets are constrained. Instead of passively waiting for workshop and training opportunities to arise, employees need to be proactive in convincing managers of the mutual benefits of L&amp;D investments.</p><p> That said, asking for money when budgets are tight is never an easy conversation, particularly when L&amp;D is perceived as merely nice to have. We recommend the following approaches to prepare your case, shape a productive conversation, and secure funding for your professional development.</p><h4> 1. Align your goals with your organization&#39;s needs.</h4><p> To increase your chances of obtaining approval for professional development opportunities, frame your request by demonstrating how the training will support your team&#39;s objectives. If you can explain how it will move your team forward, you&#39;re more likely to gain your manager&#39;s support (and funding).</p><p></p><p> Take the case of Nick. His employer already had an in-house training team delivering Continuing Professional Education hours for accountants, so he didn&#39;t think it would sign off on an external CPE course that focused on reviewing skills. To justify the expense and need — given his position as a junior accountant at the time — Nick discussed how the course would benefit the firm <em>first</em> and himself <em>second</em> with the managing partner. Nick emphasized that the course would help the company maintain its commitment to providing accurate, reliable information to clients through specific training on how to avoid making common tax accounting errors. By making the compelling argument that the external training would provide critical skills to help the company achieve its mission, Nick was able to convince his manager that the training would be valuable and received the funding.</p><p> Similarly, when Amanda, an insurance professional, asked her manager to pay for her training to earn her claims adjuster license, she took what she described as a “help me, help my team” approach. Amanda made her pitch for professional development during a time when the team she was on was struggling. While her current job function was <em>not</em> that of a claims adjuster, earning the license allowed her to help her organization in an area that really needed assistance.</p><p> During your pitch, ask your manager how they would like you to share the knowledge gained from training. This might involve a one-on-one follow-up, sharing presentation materials or bullet points summarizing the training, or even hosting a workshop to review the material with your team. By being proactive in sharing what you&#39;ve learned, you further solidify the benefits of professional development for the entire team.</p><h4> 2. Bring your manager on board.</h4><p> As <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/learning-for-a-living/">Gianpiero Petriglieri has noted</a> , many organizations “are not as hospitable to learning as their rhetoric suggests.” While employees may be frustrated by managers who overlook learning or prioritize performance over all else, they can educate managers on the benefits that professional development can bring to the company by taking a tactful approach.</p><p> For example, one vice president at a large industrial services company was reluctant to see training as an investment, fearing that employees might demand a raise or even leave after the training. In truth, this belief is a myth, if not irrational. Employees are a greater flight risk when they do <em>not</em> see internal opportunities and have to look elsewhere for personal growth. After all, employees are humans who have the fundamental need to feel competent, and they appreciate arrangements that are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2015.08.002">customized to their skills and interests</a> . Employees can share third-party sources that emphasize the importance of targeted training to employee retention and engagement. For example, <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236438/millennials-jobs-development-opportunities.aspx">research from Gallup</a> suggests that professional development is a top factor in retaining millennials.</p><p> When discussing the topic with your manager, it&#39;s important to embrace a positive tone and remember that there might be resistance along the way. Shape the conversation in a way that focuses on how professional development increases the retention of valued employees. Be prepared to hear “no,” but probe to find out what might make your manager say “yes.” By understanding their concerns, you&#39;re better equipped to overcome those barriers. Consider asking questions like, “What would help you say yes?” or, “Would you worry about our competitor sending employees to this training?” This encourages your manager to consider the potential upsides of your request.</p><p> Three communication touch points are helpful for closing the circle when it comes to getting your manager invested in L&amp;D as a team resource. First, communicate clearly about the training you&#39;re seeking and gain permission to attend the training. Second, update your manager <em>during</em> the training, expressing your enthusiasm and gratitude. For example, you can send your manager a short status update on how the training is going and initial ideas you have to bring back to the team. Lastly, once the training is complete, acknowledge your manager&#39;s support when sharing your newfound knowledge with the team. By showing your excitement, you can inspire coworkers who also desire professional development.</p><h4> 3. Show your commitment to learning.</h4><p> When pitching your professional development request, consider providing several options, ranging from fully funded by the company to partially funded by you. Demonstrating your commitment to learning new skills, even if it means investing your own money, can make your request more persuasive.</p><p> Divya, for example, found a $2,500 training opportunity to develop the soft skills needed to better serve customers at her government agency job. Knowing that funding was limited, she proposed several options to her manager, including 100%, 50%, and 25% company funding. By having some skin in the game, Divya showed that she was serious about the training. In the end, her request was fully funded by the agency, but she was prepared to accept partial funding and cover the rest herself.</p><p> You can also show your commitment by exploring lower-cost or free opportunities before pursuing other options. An effective way to do this is to detail what you have learned so far through training options at no cost to your employer — and what skills or knowledge gaps still exist. Perhaps you want to earn a certification in data visualization. You can begin by completing online courses for free or at minimal cost, which can provide the foundational knowledge needed in this area and demonstrate your time investment. Then, explain to your manager what you&#39;ve learned and why additional, funded training is necessary to further your goals.</p><p></p><p> This collaborative negotiation process allows you to (1) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1571-9979.1999.tb00178.x">adopt an interest-based approach</a> , (2) help your manager <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60407-4">overcome psychological barriers</a> , and (3) <a href="https://doi.org/10.5465/amj.2012.0461">build trust</a> and mitigate your manager&#39;s perception of risk.</p><p></p><p> Prioritizing learning and development is essential for both managers and employees to help steer their organizations toward sustainable success and maintain a competitive edge. Even during economic uncertainty, strategic L&amp;D investments can boost employee engagement, close skill gaps, and foster growth. By recognizing the value of professional development and adopting a collaborative approach, leaders and employees alike can create a thriving learning culture that promotes individual and organizational success.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/empower-your-team-empower-yourself/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Do You Have a Corporate Philanthropy Strategy?</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/do-you-have-a-corporate-philanthropy-strategy/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/do-you-have-a-corporate-philanthropy-strategy/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 06 Jun 2023 17:00:01 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Ane Casajús-Burutaran, Tina C.

While management scholars have long pointed out the importance of corporate philanthropy, businesses&#39; approaches to it vary widely, and few have fully integrated it into their corporate strategy. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> This article examines the shifting landscape of corporate giving and the potential implications for businesses and their stakeholders.</p><p> As companies face growing pressures to incorporate purposeful social missions into their core businesses, leaders have gained experience managing initiatives aimed at social impact in addition to profit. While corporate social responsibility (CSR) is part of most companies&#39; business strategies, philanthropy often remains disconnected from core business objectives. This makes it challenging for leaders to discern what types of philanthropic engagement should be prioritized and why.</p><p></p><p> We define <em>strategic corporate philanthropy</em> as voluntary giving that builds on the company&#39;s core competencies to achieve social impact while improving its competitive edge — resulting in a win-win situation. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> The scope of corporate philanthropic engagement is vast. (See “Main Types of Corporate Philanthropy Engagement.”) Even though gift matching has led the way for many years in the US, Coca-Cola, Google, and Walt Disney are just a few of the many multinationals that now engage in more than one type of corporate philanthropy. IBM&#39;s Open Source Community Grant program (with annual contributions of $200,000), the Danone Ecosystem (an impact investment fund with over $200 million committed since 2009), and the Ikea Foundation (with unrestricted funding for selected nonprofits working on emergency relief) are examples of the great diversity of corporate philanthropic engagement.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Main Types of Corporate Philanthropy Engagement</h4><p> <strong>Community grants:</strong> The company supports local community efforts or nonprofits with financial or in-kind contributions.</p><p> <strong>Corporate foundations:</strong> The company establishes and funds an independent legal entity to manage its philanthropic projects. These can be directly operated by the foundation or co-led through partnerships or grant giving.</p><p> <strong>Corporate sponsoring:</strong> The company finances the events, projects, or programs of a nonprofit organization.</p><p> <strong>Gift matching:</strong> The company matches the charitable donation of an employee, usually at a 1-1 ratio.</p><p> <strong>Venture philanthropy:</strong> The corporation takes the principles of venture capital financing to select, guide, and support a charitable project. This is often done through a corporate foundation.</p></article></aside></div><p></p><p> Increasingly, companies are establishing corporate foundations, which are legally independent entities that work exclusively on philanthropic activities. This allows them to take a more systematic approach to giving and create a “philanthropic identity.” Examples include the Walmart Foundation (with annual giving of $1.5 billion) and the Chanel Foundation (supporting over 150 charitable organizations since 2011). However, guidance remains limited on what type of philanthropic engagement would best fit a company&#39;s strategy.</p><p> Corporate philanthropy has the potential to create multiple benefits for a business, including enhanced reputation, legitimacy, local integration, network creation, knowledge acquisition, institutional acceptance, and stakeholder trust. But it also bears risks. Thus, companies must think carefully about what, how, and where to engage.</p><p> Our research examines the various strategies companies are testing in the realm of corporate philanthropy. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> When building a corporate philanthropy strategy, a business&#39;s most important decisions revolve around three central issues: what topics to engage in, which parts of the company can support these efforts, and how to maximize impact. First, in terms of engagement, companies can either actively engage in the design, implementation, and evaluation of potential projects (operational), or provide the resources for another organization to take the lead (grant giving). This decision should be based on their knowledge and expertise in their respective field. The second decision is whether to house the project in an external entity, like a corporate foundation, or internally under a department like sustainability, HR, public relations, or partnerships. Lastly, the project must be anchored within the community to make a real impact, either through the company&#39;s own networks in the country or through local partners.</p><p></p><p> Our analysis offers a framework to assist managers in their decision-making process, enabling them to ask the right questions to understand the fit of a philanthropic project for their organization. Three dimensions need to be assessed.</p><p> <strong>Cognitive fit:</strong> <em>Does your company have the knowledge and expertise to engage in this social issue?</em> Corporate philanthropy, much like any business activity, demands specialized competencies; thus, companies need to be selective to maximize their impact. Tackling complex issues related to their primary industry is a good starting point because businesses already have expertise in dealing with customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. Prominent examples include the Loewe Foundation&#39;s commitment to creativity and craftmanship — aligned with its identity as a luxury fashion house — and Adidas&#39; focus on expanding access to sports for all.</p><p> <strong>Structural fit:</strong> <em>Can the project be linked to the internal structure of your organization?</em> Every project needs organizational support to be integrated with the company&#39;s corporate structure and processes, which will potentially involve CSR, HR, or logistics. But one unit or department has to be in charge of providing adequate economic, human, social, and intellectual capital. We find that different corporations develop very different structural solutions to manage their philanthropic activities. Roche decided to create a whole new department, called the Corporate Donations and Philanthropy department, integrated under the CEO&#39;s office. Inditex still carries out its philanthropic activities within its sustainability department, and Visa chose to manage its donations through the Visa Foundation, as an independent entity.</p><p> <strong>Contextual fit:</strong> <em>Is the company well anchored in the local community, and does it have access to it, in order to effectively design and implement the project?</em> Gaining access to the local context is critical for success — it enhances onsite decision-making capabilities and fosters trust among stakeholders. If the organization engages in a familiar context, it can better tailor social solutions to local needs and do so more efficiently. For instance, HSBC&#39;s Hongkong Bank Foundation has distributed over HK$2.4 billion ($305.8 million) to support the Hong Kong community, its home market. Another example is the eBay Foundation, which encourages its employees to volunteer and give within their local communities.</p><p> Answering these questions helps companies craft a corporate philanthropy strategy and determine the implications of alternative pathways. (See “Designing a Corporate Philanthropy Strategy.”) Our assessment framework can be used on individual projects and to systematically manage a portfolio. When planning and defining a potential philanthropic project, managers can answer the questions related to the three dimensions and consider the recommendations given for each option. For example, a US-based fintech company seeking to engage in research projects focused on Alzheimer&#39;s disease would have a low cognitive fit between the philanthropic project and company expertise. It would also have a low structural fit if it did not have an in-house department to support community outreach for medical issues. Additionally, the fintech firm would score low on contextual fit if it were to engage in a program in Somalia — a market in which it doesn&#39;t operate or have specific knowledge. Under these circumstances, a grant-giving strategy through an external body like a foundation would be advisable. As this case reveals, thinking about the three dimensions can help managers establish guiding principles for their corporate philanthropy strategy and set rules regarding what, how, and where to engage. </p><div class="callout-highlight callout"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4 style="line-height:1.5;"> Designing a Corporate Philanthropy Strategy: An Assessment Framework</h4><p class="caption"> Using a structured framework to answer key questions, companies can craft strategies that not only guide the development of potential philanthropic projects but also streamline the management of their philanthropic portfolios. </p><table id="Chart#" class="chart-grouped-rows no-mobile" style="width: 100%"><thead><tr><th style="width:23%;" class="white">方面</th><th style="width:30%" class="white">评估</th><th style="width:45%" class="white">评估</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><strong style="font-size:larger;"><span class="blue">Cognitive Fit</span></strong><br /> (the “What”)</p></td><td><p> <strong>Does your company have the knowledge and expertise to engage in this social issue?</strong> </p></td><td><div style="vertical-align:top"><div style="background-color:#43BD29; width:15%; text-align:center; float:left;"><p><span class="white"><strong>是的</strong></span></p></div><div style="width:85%; float:right; padding-left:10px;"><p>Take an operational approach based on the company&#39;s knowledge and expertise.

Over time, however, the Adecco Group&#39;s philanthropic portfolio grew and became very diverse, requiring a detailed assessment across the cognitive, structural, and contextual fit of the programs. In 2021, the management team carefully selected the foundation&#39;s priority projects based on the questions provided in our assessment framework. Accordingly, other initiatives were given back to the company (and integrated into the respective departments), and some were entrusted to better-suited nonprofits to take forward. This strategic move allowed the Adecco Group&#39;s foundation, now called the Innovation Foundation, to redefine its corporate philanthropy strategy and develop a decision-making framework rooted in three principles:</p><p> <strong>Industry expertise (cognitive fit).</strong> The foundation now focuses exclusively on the domains of employment, skills, and the future of work — the business&#39;s areas of expertise. In addition to receiving financial support, it benefits from the knowledge, data, experience, and ecosystem of the Adecco Group. This mutually beneficial relationship ensures that the valuable outcomes and insights generated by the foundation are shared back to the company.</p><p> <strong>Tailored social innovation lab methodology (structural fit).</strong> The foundation developed a proprietary operating model that blends data-driven analysis, design thinking, and innovation to deliver user-centric solutions following an acceleratorlike process. Thus, projects that did not align with that format — such as grant giving and fundraising — were given back to the business. These projects were run in the marketing or sustainability department, contingent on their structural fit and their knowledge, personnel, and network needs.</p><p> <strong>Local knowledge (contextual fit).</strong> Because the Innovation Foundation focuses on projects with long-term impact — those that address the source of a problem rather than the symptoms — local partners and end users are involved at every stage. One example is the foundation&#39;s Women Back to Work project in Spain, where the continuous involvement of local organizations and beneficiaries ensures that the program incorporates a deep understanding of the real problems of women reintegrating into the workforce in that context. Once a project has been developed and tested in-house, it is spun off for a local partner organization to scale and create maximum impact.</p><p></p><p> In the year following the foundation&#39;s restructuring, the team pursued three projects aimed at boosting employability for women, young adults, and older employees. These initiatives have provided the company with insights and real-time data on the unmet needs and potential solutions for underserved populations in the labor market.</p><p></p><p> The Adecco Group&#39;s case demonstrates the power of a well-crafted corporate philanthropy strategy that is grounded in guiding principles. As corporate giving becomes increasingly important in today&#39;s business landscape, it&#39;s critical for companies to focus their efforts on maximizing their social impact as well as their competitive position. A well-executed philanthropic strategy not only benefits society but also strengthens an organization&#39;s market position by providing access to new knowledge and expanding the organization&#39;s network.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/do-you-have-a-corporate-philanthropy-strategy/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Making Investments in AI: Samsung&#39;s Hina Dixit</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/making-investments-in-ai-samsungs-hina-dixit/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/making-investments-in-ai-samsungs-hina-dixit/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 06 Jun 2023 11:00:22 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. <p>Sam Ransbotham ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ransbotham">@ransbotham</a> ) is a professor in the information systems department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College, as well as guest editor for <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> &#39;s Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy Big Ideas initiative.

Each episode, we introduce you to someone innovating with AI. I&#39;m Sam Ransbotham, professor of analytics at Boston College. I&#39;m also the AI and business strategy guest editor at <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> .</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And I&#39;m Shervin Khodabandeh, senior partner with BCG and one of the leaders of our AI business. Together, <cite>MIT SMR</cite> and BCG have been researching and publishing on AI since 2017, interviewing hundreds of practitioners and surveying thousands of companies on what it takes to build and to deploy and scale AI capabilities and really transform the way organizations operate.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> On today&#39;s episode, we have Hina Dixit, an investor at Samsung Next. Hina, thanks for joining us.欢迎。</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Thank you so much. It&#39;s a pleasure being here with you.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Most of our listeners are likely familiar with Samsung — giant South Korean multinational, lots of consumer electronics — but people may be less familiar with Samsung Next, so let&#39;s start there. Can you describe what Samsung Next is and what your role is?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. Samsung Next is the private equity or venture capital arm of Samsung. We tend to be stage-agnostic, but at the same time, we have six focus areas where we invest. AI is one of them. We also invest in fintech, blockchain, and infrastructure, and media tech as well, along with health tech.</p><p> Along with these six focus areas, we tend to make more and more learned investments about the ever-changing, dynamic world as well. So if you or anyone has a cool idea, please feel free to reach out.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I should&#39;ve prepared more and had a few pitches ready so that we could&#39;ve put you on the spot here while we were recording and get you on record there. So, what, exactly, do you do, though?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I currently lead the AI investment segment area. If there is any deal which is associated with AI, I tend to lead that deal and also work on the investment strategy for Samsung Next.</p><p> When you head out to these startup demos, to these pitches and expos, you will see thousands of startups. Now, how do you ensure that you are focused on the right areas which matter to Samsung? It should also propel innovation further; [instead of simply] furthering the innovation, it should also be usable. So that&#39;s why having a paradigm will help you make those sound decisions, where you can actually prioritize certain areas ahead of time compared to other investors, and understand which of the current technologies will be booming, say, a few years from now. And accordingly, you tend to segment and understand that, OK, these are my top-priority areas.</p><p> At the same time, I&#39;m very, very passionate about mentoring entrepreneurs, mentoring fellow people in tech. I come from a tech background, so I can always understand the hiccups people face when they are moving from individual-contributor roles or management roles in these big techs and moving forward to a startup entrepreneurial journey. I love connecting with them and helping them out.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That&#39;s really wonderful, Hina. So I want to talk about both things you said, both the mentoring, but also I want to go back to how you pick an investment. I mean, obviously, where you&#39;re sitting, you are looking at thousands of opportunities probably, right? And so you mentioned there are some guiding principles in terms of how you prioritize where to focus and what fits strategically with Samsung, but tell us more about how you pick an investment once you&#39;ve already gone through that filter, that “OK, it&#39;s the right thing for the company. We want to do it.” Now you&#39;re actually evaluating an AI company. Tell us how you pick. What are the factors you consider?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I tend to focus on very important factors for me personally. Every investor out there has a very different way of investing. Some people are very intuition-driven, and I have seen such investors make really great decisions. Some people are very theory-driven, and some people tend to take it as they go.</p><p> I am a mix of all of them. I tend to make these sound, learned decisions where I&#39;m very comfortable and I know the space very well. One thing that is always very important for me is the team. Is there a right product-team fit here? Are these individuals capable of building these great products that they&#39;re promising? I think that is an essential parameter for me.</p><p> And then, moving on to the problem itself: Is this pain point really [going to be] valid in few years? The pain point has to be there. The next thing is the technical innovation. Now, that is important, because that serves as a mode for you, or mode for these entrepreneurs, right? Otherwise, any big tech [company] can just go in and create what they have created. We want to have a solid mode around these products that they&#39;re building and some sort of novelty.</p><p> And then, moving from technical innovation and the mode, obviously there has to be a decent market size. You might be building an awesome product, but at the same time, the market sizing [might be] very small. It becomes really hard to scale that kind of product. Even if it&#39;s not monetizable, it should be solving a very solid pain point, plus the impact of that particular solution has to be global. And that&#39;s another factor for me, where I tend to make my own decision that, OK, this is something which is going to change everything that we do today.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Tell us more about the team, because technology is one aspect, but how do you suss out both the capability of the team itself and then how well the team works with each other? I mean, a lot of startups have team issues, right?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Yeah.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> How do you look into that?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Sure. I think it&#39;s a very deep question, and I think it comes from my days at Apple. Apple has a very startuplike culture in some of their organization, and here I&#39;m speaking about the culture because there were so many learnings from them. When I started, there was a very open culture where people would come on the weekends to support and mentor you and help you. They wouldn&#39;t even ask for any kind of credit. They would help you move forward, and at the same time, they will not just stop there. They will empower you. They will connect you with the right connections across the organization.</p><p> I kind of felt that it is very difficult for people to be that selfless and just focus on making the product great, but I think that&#39;s what the spirit of Apple is, and I tend to see a similar spirit in founders if I know that they&#39;re very, very product-driven, or they&#39;re very, very goal-driven in terms of [their] team. Then I tend to get that sense, OK, these guys will support each other.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> You&#39;ve got some extensive experience in this area. You mentioned Apple a couple of times. Tell us a bit about how you got to where you are now from where you started.</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I come from a very humble family background. So while my dad would work very hard, I would help them out with our family business, which was a small public call office, or a PCO, where people [went] and used to make telephone calls. So I used to sit there, and I used to make those calls for people, handle the customers, and enable them to make these phone calls, and that was a very good learning point for me because I learned how to talk to people.</p><p> From being a very introverted child, I became very public-facing, right then and there. … Like, OK, these are my customers. They are top priority. I need to serve them, help them, and that&#39;s where I think some of these qualities that I [espouse] or these passions that I have — that I love helping people, I love solving conflicts — probably arise.</p><p> I did my high school from Kanpur [City in India], which is Mercy Memorial School, and after my high school, I went to a women&#39;s college because my parents were a bit conservative yet. I was the first girl in the entire family of my dad&#39;s side who went outside of the city in order to get an education.</p><p> It was immensely fun. It was a very safe and secure environment. Obviously, it was very competitive — we women tend to be very competitive — and at the same time, I made great friends there, and I learned so much from my classmates at that time. We used to trade on these various ideas, and we used to create these JavaServer Pages-based applications, web applications for online quizzing, test banks, writing educational articles.</p><p> I remember, even buying a Starbucks coffee at that time used to be a very, very far-off thought because it was so expensive for me, and I used to work multiple jobs at the same time. And then I was placed at Symantec six months ahead of graduation. So that took some pressure off of me, and Symantec was a great starting point for me. I was in their data loss prevention team. I learned significantly from all the mentors there. I still share great relationships with all of them. And then Apple happened, and the rest is history.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> One thing that&#39;s fascinating: As you were saying that, I was thinking about how you tied your exposure to customer service through that very early call office job.</p><p> At the same time, much of what we&#39;re talking about with artificial intelligence ... it strikes me that the kind of job that would be suspect or likely to be replaced, and I have to wonder, how does the next Hina Dixit come along without that experience if we don&#39;t have those introductory customer service-oriented jobs to learn those skills?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Yeah, I get the question. This has been a grave thought, and a lot of people are coming forward and discussing it. But I think AI is not going to replace people. AI is going to empower people, and that&#39;s the thought process I come from. Just because phones became relevant, it didn&#39;t mean that [the mail was] not relevant anymore. We still order Amazon packages, and we still get our bills in the mail and whatnot, and that&#39;s how I think we will be able to push mankind. That&#39;s how we keep on pushing each and every … mile toward the ultimate goal of humankind&#39;s future, right?</p><p> Moving to the ultimate goal there, I think nobody should blindly trust that, OK, AI is going to replace their job, but they should be able to learn about AI. And that&#39;s one of the things where I&#39;ve been focusing on: finding these really cool technologies which can help people ramp up on AI.</p><p> Like, why do people need to write any single piece of code in order to use AI? Why can&#39;t this be as simple as looking at an Excel sheet? Why can&#39;t this be as accessible [as a] user interface, which is very easily programmable by just any business user out there? So finding that kind of interface between AI and the current users, that is a very critical piece where I think investors should focus on, because the ultimate goal here is to normalize the usage of AI and make that publicly available and at the same time accessible as well.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I think this is a very, very good point. That vision you painted is actually quite appealing. It used to be, the human element of AI was around making the technology better, faster, cheaper, or [writing] the next-generation algorithm, which of course, we still do, but that&#39;s going to be more and more in the R&amp;D and innovation zone. I think, as you&#39;re saying, the usage of AI will go from humans&#39; role as programmers and writers of code to more working at that interface, of having these building blocks and connecting those building blocks that AI provides to solve existing problems, but more importantly, as you&#39;re saying, thinking about “What else can we do with this? How do you innovate, now that you have all this at your fingertips?”</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Yeah. I kind of think the same way, because anybody ... you know, think of Excel. Anybody can just jump into Excel and make applications out of it. I know there are a bunch of cool apps coming around productivity right now which are backed by AI.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Share with us a bit your view on the coolest areas of technology that you are looking at right now. What piques your interest these days with everything that&#39;s going on with cyber and Web3 and quantum computing and everything else? Can you share specific investments or areas you&#39;re looking at?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Sure. We are focused a lot on infrastructure pieces of Web3, and at the same time, we are also focusing a lot on the AI aspect of Web3. So can we use these decentralized systems in order to make compute efficient? That&#39;s a question that we are trying to … answer right now. We are also trying to dive in deeper on the health-tech side, where we want to digitize the normal health paradigm, and we want to empower users out there and give them more proper feedback, maybe in their diet, maybe connect them to the right agents or doctors or nurses.</p><p> The focus is on empowering the humans. That&#39;s where I think we are trying to focus. And then obviously there is meta-tech aspect, which is the metaverse. We&#39;re trying to understand, how easy would it be to convert any image into a 3D asset and place it in the metaverse? And then, how do we make this metaverse accessible, just like the real world?</p><p> It seems surreal, but at the same time, there&#39;s so much hard work and research for each and every aspect of this. We are also focusing a lot on the fintech perspective and trying to empower these LatAm [Latin American] countries, finding a way they can build very sustainable and safe credit-scoring systems in Asia, for example, [and in] India, East Asia, and LatAm countries. So building a lot of infrastructure around fintech in LatAm countries and Asian countries is another thing that we are focusing on.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Yeah, I think that infrastructure&#39;s particularly interesting because that is an area where artificial intelligence can make a difference, when you can get some scale through an infrastructure. It&#39;s one of those situations that it seems like it opens up new possibilities when the economics change — when things that were no longer possible become possible. Are there other things that you&#39;re working on that are next in the portfolio? What are we going to see from Samsung Next next?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> We are moving into robotics as well. I did invest in one of the companies, called Integral AI, and they are trying to use these large AI models or foundation models [to train] their robots. But at the same time, robotics is another area where we want to focus on the consumer robotics aspect, so any cool startups out there building these cool consumer robots, please feel free to reach out to us, and we&#39;ll be happy to jump in and help out.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Hina, we&#39;ve got a segment where we ask you a series of questions, and these are supposed to be rapid-fire. Just give us the first thing that comes to your mind.</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> OK.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> You&#39;ve got a past career that&#39;s over a decade of being involved in these technologies. What&#39;s your proudest AI moment? What&#39;s the thing in this portfolio that you&#39;re proudest of that involves AI?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I think I&#39;ll have to say Stability AI because before that, there were a lot of research communities around, but at the same time, there was no way that somebody could go and commercialize those research works. And I really value Emad Mostaque&#39;s work there — that he recognized this problem and he got these research facilities together in order to start commercializing and build more solid consumer end products.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> We&#39;ve been very positive about artificial intelligence today, but is there anything that worries you about AI?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I think one thing that worries me is that we have seen a recent burst of these large language model-based apps, and that does include ChatGPT. I love their work, but at the same time, there are other pain points. And then, obviously, there are copyright issues that we need to solve, there are security issues. So those are some of the other areas we are trying to focus on, and trying to understand how those pain points can be resolved.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your favorite activity that does not involve technology?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> It&#39;s basically gardening in my house. I just find that very therapeutic, and, secondly, I love playing with my dog, Jimmy. He&#39;s absolutely adorable.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What was the first career you wanted? What did you want to be when you grew up?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> I have always wanted to be a startup founder. I was 8 when I manifested that … I would be a founder, I would be building great products, and I would be helping out other people. So ever since I was 8, [I&#39;ve been] chasing that dream.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your greatest wish for artificial intelligence in the future? What are you hoping we can gain from this?</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> My biggest wish for AI would be enabling common sense in some way, because these large AI models, they do have some AI capabilities when they can be put together in conjunction. We know from the recent <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2204.02311">PaLM research paper that Google published</a> that, OK, there is a way of having these multiple multimodels work together in order to create more sensible information and reliable information out there for users to believe in, and they basically used it to train their robots.</p><p> So that&#39;s one application, but a lot can come forward from that particular research work that Google published, including chain-of-thought prompting as well. How do you use these several models to work together in order to perform better in real-world and unstructured environments? So that would be very cool to see.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> OK, yeah, that seems so exciting to me, too, because we originally had the generative AI adversarial models, where, yes, we learned how to play chess really quickly, or we learned through a game, but the universe that has expanded from the idea that we can have bazillions of these models working kind of with and against each other — that seems very natural to, well, the way that we as humans or current biology works. It seems like there&#39;s a lot of potential for that.</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Yeah, yeah.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Well, Hina, thanks for taking the time to talk with us today. I think that there&#39;s lots — actually, particularly from your background — that is inspiring to people. Thank you for taking the time to talk with us.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah, thank you so much.</p><p> <strong>Hina Dixit:</strong> Thank you so much for having me.
