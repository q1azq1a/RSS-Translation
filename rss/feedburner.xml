Group的一名新加坡高管被禁止出境，并<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-65061116">拘留了该公司的五名中国员工</a>； <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/huawei-s-meng-wanzhou-2-michaels-what-next-china-u-n1280229">两名加拿大商人被针锋相对地拘留，</a>以报复美国对一名在加拿大被捕的华为高管提出的欺诈指控——许多在国际上开展业务的公司都相对默默无闻地面临着出境禁令和商业劫持的现实。</p><p>这种风险正在增加，而且不太可能很快减弱。在正常的业务过程中，没有什么比公司高管或员工被拘留在国外更具破坏性和波动性的了。在中国运营的公司应该提前为这些潜在情况做好准备。</p><p></p><p>出境禁令可能源于民事商业纠纷以及更严重的法律纠纷。 <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-chinese-law-raises-risks-for-american-firms-in-china-u-s-officials-say-cf62c1a0">中国最近对反间谍法的修订</a>，包括对拥有“与国家安全有关的文件、数据、材料或物品”的模糊、开放式禁令，很容易涵盖任何行业的日常商业活动，使外国高管面临更大的被捕风险。 <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/china-travel-advisory.html">美国国务院最近警告说</a>，中国政府“任意执行当地法律，包括对美国公民和其他国家公民发布出境禁令，没有根据法律规定公平和透明的程序。”</p><p>因商业原因而受到出境禁令的人在被阻止在机场登机之前通常不会收到提前通知。该人通常会受到讯问，但不会被告知有关出境禁令的原因或如何提出异议的信息。</p><p>发生商业纠纷时，出境禁令通常只有在外国人同意中国对方的要求后才会解除——中国对方通过限制个人自由，在纠纷中获得了巨大的影响力。即使外国人愿意在被困在中国的情况下花费必要的时间和金钱在法庭上追诉案件，中国法院也不太可能做出有利于外国当事人的裁决。</p><p></p><p>以亨利·蔡（Henry Cai）为例，他是土生土长的中国人，在 20 世纪 80 年代与妻子搬到加利福尼亚州，并成为美国公民。 2012年，蔡投资了一家中国科技初创公司，持股8%，并担任该公司董事。几年后，当这家初创公司面临现金流问题并拖欠贷款时，蔡多次前往中国处理这种情况。 2017年，蔡在机场被拦截并被拒绝出境，此时他意识到自己卷入了该公司债权人提起的诉讼。六年后，他仍然<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-us-exit-ban-diplomacy-11668357015">滞留在中国</a>，无法支付解除出境禁令所需的数百万美元。对于在中国的他以及在加州的妻子和两个孩子来说，人员、情感和经济损失都很高。</p><p></p><p>另一个例子是加州商人布莱恩·霍洛维茨(Brian Horowitz)，他从一家中国制造商那里购买了燃气搅拌机。由于搅拌机不符合加州空气质量标准而引发合同纠纷后，霍洛维茨前往中国与供应商会面。当他试图回国时， <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2011-jan-28-la-fi-china-horowitz-20110128-story.html">在上海机场被拘留</a>；供应商对其公司提出了合同索赔，法院在霍洛维茨不知情的情况下实施了退出禁令。两周后，他的妻子向中国供应商电汇了 25 万美元，让她的丈夫回家。</p><p>尽管因商业纠纷而实施的出境禁令在中国是合法的，但外国高管也面临着成为非法商业劫持事件受害者的风险。在这种情况下，他们可能会被限制在酒店房间或公司设施（例如办公室或工厂）内。劫持商业人质最高可判处三年监禁。然而，在实践中，除非发生暴力，否则中国<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/08/chinas-police-think-hostages-arent-their-problem/">执法部门往往拒绝</a>干预这些情况。</p><p>在一个案例中，一家美国珠宝公司的高管前往中国与一家制造商讨论产品订单和<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3692138">65 万美元付款的</a>纠纷。该高管进入制造商工厂后，她的钱包和护照被没收。随后她被带回酒店，并由制造商的员工看守了五天。她在一名精通中文的美国律师的帮助下逃脱，该律师前往中国，帮助她躲避警卫，并将她带到大使馆。</p><p>另一个案例是，一家美国公司派两名中层管理人员参观为其生产产品的中国工厂。这家美国公司已经向制造商支付了货款，但其高管了解到，工厂工人拒绝发货，因为他们的工资已经几个月没有支付了。工人们将这些高管锁在工厂内，并要求支付赎金才能释放他们。为了释放人质并获得货物，美国公司必须向制造公司和工人支付费用。</p><p>商业劫持人质事件通常会在几天或几周内得到解决，而出境禁令可能需要数月或数年才能解除。这两种情况都没有得到官方追踪，商界人士往往对他们的困境保密。尽管如此，根据六个国家（美国、加拿大、英国、德国、荷兰和澳大利亚）政府的数据和媒体报道，我们记录了大约过去<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/tie.22261">100 多起企业出境禁令和商业人质事件</a>十年。鉴于政府关于这一现象的文件并不全面，而且并非每个案例都会受到媒体关注，这可能是一个严重的低估。</p><h3>采取多方面的方法，为最坏的情况做好准备</h3><p>这些情况的尖锐的个人性质和地缘政治动态使得规划和解决它们特别具有挑战性。您应该支付多少钱才能使您的同事（或您自己）免于被扣为人质？您如何与员工的配偶谈论其伴侣被拘留的原因以及您计划就其返回进行谈判？与媒体接触以施加政治压力以释放员工是您工作的一部分吗？</p><p>为了应对这种情况，企业领导者必须承认前往中国的员工发生这种情况的风险，并进一步了解情况，例如与经历过这种情况的其他人建立对话，这一点至关重要。他们还应该与美国驻外领事官员、公司所在城市的中国官员和警察局长、美国联邦和州政府领导人、地方和国家媒体成员以及适用的行业团体（例如美中贸易全国委员会。</p><p>企业应预先组建危机处理小组并制定行动计划，为中国及其母国的关键员工和顾问分配具体职责。该计划应包括外部沟通，例如利用社交媒体引起人们对被困员工困境的关注。公司应咨询其商业保险公司，了解是否有相关保险可减轻出境禁令或商业人质事件的财务影响。</p><p>在中国有商业利益的高管还应密切关注应付账款、合同义务和业务关系的基调，以识别潜在的冲突或分歧来源。他们应该尽力在问题出现之前预见到问题，并且应该特别警惕任何未偿债务或产品已交付但由于任何原因尚未完全付款的情况。</p><p></p><p>如果已经或疑似已经提起诉讼，或者欠中国实体任何债务，公司应避免让员工前往中国。如果此类旅行不可避免，员工应保持经常沟通，以便其他人了解他们的行踪和日程安排，并应避免单独旅行。如果争议已经发生但尚未具体化为诉讼，并且员工必须前往中国，请考虑在美国先行提起诉讼，假设美国法院对中国企业拥有管辖权。例如，如果美国公司在美国法院指控违反合同，那么员工在国外时应携带翻译成中文的美国诉讼文件。</p><p></p><p>领导者还必须准备好支持和帮助员工及其家人。提前成立的危机小组应该有一个计划，与被困国外的员工及其家人以及整个公司的员工进行诚实和敏感的沟通。表现出你的关心。保持透明和诚实。这些情况会让人精神疲惫、迷失方向、令人恐惧；它们也是建立信任、团结和关爱文化的机会。与金钱相比，更重要的是人。</p><p>当然，重要的是继续致力于以切实的方式帮助受影响的员工及其家人。安排向受影响的家庭提供个性化的护理包；拜访他们的家，并与他们面对面交流。在可能的情况下，还向被困在国外的员工寄送爱心包，并方便与家人通话。</p><p>出境禁令和商业人质事件等情况是人权和地缘政治问题，也是对个人商业的强烈挑战。商业领袖明智地通过制定全面的战略方法来应对此类挑战。</p><p></p>

class="attribution">尼尔·韦伯/theispot.com</p></figcaption></figure><p></p><p>关于身份、多样性和正义的对话是我们这个时代最棘手的人类互动之一。以 Uber 的多元化负责人为例，她举办了一场名为“别叫我凯伦”的工作场所活动，以强调“美国白人女性的经历谱系”，并促进“关于种族的公开和诚实的对话”。由于有色人种员工的强烈反对，她被安排休假。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p>或者想想斯坦福大学法学院负责多样性的副院长，他在保守派法官凯尔·邓肯的演讲中试图“缓和”学生的抗议活动。院长试图安抚因法官的反 LGBTQ+ 观点而愤怒的学生，同时给法官完成演讲的空间。但她的干预引起了公众的愤怒，因为人们认为她将学生的感受置于法官的言论自由权之上。她也被安排休假。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a></p><p></p><p>如果这些对话阻碍了高级多元化、公平和包容性 (DEI) 专业人士的发展，那么普通领导者还有什么希望呢？比你想象的还要多。</p><p>我们领导纽约大学法学院的一个研究中心，致力于研究多样性、包容性和归属感问题。我们共同或单独教导了来自各行各业的数以万计的人如何跨越差异进行更有意义和有效的对话。我们集中精力指导掌权者，因为他们有最大的机会改变这些互动的动态——培养同理心，而不是引发恐惧和分裂。</p><p>虽然我们辅导的人在多种类型的身份对话中遇到困难，但分歧往往是最令人痛苦的。当你和对方意见一致时，参与身份对话相对容易。当你不同意时，你可能会充满焦虑和自我怀疑。你可能会想：<em>我真的像我想象的那样开明吗？人们会感到被我伤害或背叛吗？</em></p><p>你可能会想通过屈服于谈话伙伴所说的任何内容来应对这种焦虑。然而这种做法往往并不可取，因为它损害了你的尊严和真实性。我们相信，即使在当今两极分化和过热的政治气候下，在身份问题上仍然可能存在分歧。关键是要尊重地去做。就是这样。</p><h3>在争议等级上找到对话</h3><p>我们都是同性关系——Kenji 于 2009 年与他的丈夫结婚，David 于 2014 年与他的丈夫结婚——而且我们在许多论坛上参与了有关同性婚姻的辩论。我们从来不喜欢这些讨论，但我们发现其中的一个特点特别糟糕：我们的对手很少承认这场辩论对我们或其他 LGBTQ+ 人群意味着什么。</p><p>在一本反对婚姻平等的著名著作中，作者坚持认为，人们可以拒绝同性婚姻，“但不要诋毁受同性吸引的人，或忽视他们的需求”。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a>他们在现场对话中采取了相同的立场。在一场有关同性婚姻的电视辩论中，主持人要求作者之一瑞安·安德森（Ryan Anderson）向女同性恋财务顾问苏兹·奥曼（Suze Orman）解释“她出了什么问题”。 “我不认为你有什么问题，”安德森告诉奥曼。 “问题是，婚姻是什么？我认为婚姻本质上是……一男一女的结合。” <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p>尽管这听起来很外交，但这种回应并没有意识到，从许多同性恋者的角度来看，安德森反对同性婚姻在逻辑上意味着他认为奥曼是二等公民。然而，在我们关于这个话题的无数次对话中，我们可以用一只手数出对方认识到我们可能会认为他们的观点是对我们基本人性的攻击的次数。这种方法并不要求他们改变观点。它只是要求他们承认这种观点可能会如何传播到另一方。</p><p>部分由于这种挫败感，我们开发了一个争议量表，将分歧的主题沿直线绘制出来。左边是最安全的话题，在这些话题中存在分歧是可以预料的，甚至是值得庆祝的。右边是最有争议的话题，对话最有可能变得丑陋。</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4>如何表达不同意见</h4><p class="caption">在这种争议规模上定位对话主题可以帮助您在更有可能进行尊重性讨论的层面上构建一个困难的主题。 </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAG_Yoshino_Essay_Winter_2024_Figure-1.png" alt="如何表达不同意见" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p>关于个人品味的分歧通常是温暖而善意的。当朋友嘲笑我们喜欢垃圾电视节目时，这些分歧会加强而不是削弱我们的关系。对事实的分歧也相对舒服，只要这确实是关于事实的辩论（例如谁、什么、何时、何地或如何），而不是关于价值观的几乎不加掩饰的辩论（被定义为“另类事实”或“假新闻”） ）。当话题在争议规模上进一步向右漂移时，真正的危险就来了。最激烈的对话是其中一方或双方都感到他们的平等人性受到质疑的对话。</p><p>想象一下，您是工作场所多元化和包容性倡议的拉丁裔支持者，而您正在与反对该计划的非拉丁裔同事进行辩论。我们认为，讨论该倡议是否成功地提高了拉丁裔在工作场所的代表性（事实），您会觉得不舒服，但可以控制。您会发现很难争论是否应在晋升决策（政策）中考虑多样性因素。你会发现争论心理学家理查德·赫恩斯坦和政治学家查尔斯·默里臭名昭著的假设，即智商在种族和族裔群体之间存在差异（人性平等）是令人痛苦的。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a></p><p>身份分歧的问题在于，特权较高的对话伙伴几乎总是将问题定位在争议规模上的不同位置，而不是特权较少的对话伙伴。如果您认为您的公司过于关注反种族主义，您可能会将这场争议视为关于组织应如何优先考虑其使命的不同方面的政策辩论。你的谈话对象是一位亚裔美国同事，她可能会认为你轻视了她对公司的归属感。毕竟，她是那个必须与工作场所的反亚裔偏见作斗争的人。您将该问题定位在“政策”争议范围的中间位置。她将其定位于“人性平等”的右极端。</p><p></p><p>您可能会发现，在认识到对方在争议范围内的位置后，您会重新评估分歧的性质，使问题更接近他们所定位的位置。但你可能不会，我们也不会强迫你这样做。我们所要求的只是您明确承认对方的立场。在谈话开始时，你可能会这样说：“对我来说，这是一场政策辩论，但我知道这对你来说可能是非常个人化的，在分享我的观点时，我会尽力尊重这一现实。 ”有时，在谈话期间或之后，您可能会意识到自己将这个话题视为纯粹的智力练习，并且需要认识到讨论可能对对方产生的影响：“我一直在将政策论点摆到桌面上，但我能问一下，作为一个生活可能更直接受到这个问题影响的人，你对这次讨论有何感受？”</p><p>我们认为，您会惊讶地发现，承认自己的相对主题立场可以在多大程度上消除分歧带来的伤害或激烈情绪。即使这些立场对双方来说都是显而易见的，这一点仍然成立。通常，我们需要的不是更多的知识，而是对共享知识的更多认可。</p><p></p><h3>发现不常见的共同点</h3><p>在 1987 年的电影<cite>《铁血战士》</cite>中，达奇（阿诺·施瓦辛格饰演）和狄龙（卡尔·韦瑟斯饰演）以史诗般的握手方式互相打招呼。 “狄龙，你个王八蛋。”达奇说道，他们走到对方面前，双手紧握在一起，粗壮的手臂摆成V字形，就像要扳手腕一样。他们拒绝放开彼此的手。然后握手就变成了一场真正的扳手腕比赛。这几乎是对过度阳刚之气的模仿。</p><p>如果不是病毒式传播的模因，这个场景可能已经被遗忘了。当社交媒体用户想要展示两个看似无关的人、团体或概念却有着惊人的共同点时，他们会发布一张达奇和狄龙握手的照片。他们在达奇的手臂上贴了一个标签，在狄龙的手臂上贴了另一个标签，并将共同点放在中间。在一个例子中，复仇和冰淇淋就“冷食最佳”这句话握手言和。史诗般的握手还催生了其他尝试，使用维恩图来突出显示不可预测的重叠。我们了解到，银行劫匪、DJ 和传教士都在分享“举起手来”。这些图像帮助我们看到每场扳手腕比赛中隐藏的握手。</p><p>这种能力至关重要，而且培养这种能力比看起来更难。传统观点认为，当与某人意见不同时，提供一致意见是一种有效的策略。但正如哲学家丹尼尔·丹尼特（Daniel Dennett）指出的那样，找到“并非普遍或广泛同意的问题”的观点特别有帮助。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a>这个想法是为了找到不常见的共性，让你从默认的情况中感到惊讶。很多时候，人们会满足于那些感觉像是空洞的平淡的举动。这就像发布银行劫匪、DJ 和传教士表情包，并将这些共性变成“职业”。</p><p>相反，尝试找到不常见的共性，这些共性可以解放你和你的谈话伙伴，并有助于使最具煽动性的话题更容易讨论。近年来，成群结队的忧心忡忡的家长涌入通常沉闷的市政厅会议，对在孩子的教室里进行的有关种族的谈话表示愤怒。巴特·格拉斯哥（Bart Glasgow）就是这样一位家长（与大卫没有关系），他是一位来自佐治亚州坎顿的保守派福音派基督教白人，他在一次学校董事会会议上发言反对在当地学区雇用一名 DEI 管理员。</p><p></p><p>巴特和他的妻子科利决定与四位专家就种族问题进行交谈。其中之一是卡罗尔·安德森（Carol Anderson），她是埃默里大学非裔美国人研究教授兼主席，也是多本书的作者，其中包括<cite>《白色愤怒》</cite> 。从表面上看，安德森和格拉斯哥夫妇没有什么共同之处。然而，在长达一个小时的谈话中，双方都付出了相当大的努力来寻找联系点。 <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a>巴特·格拉斯哥指出，他的大学毕业论文主题是公民抗命，研究了亨利·大卫·梭罗、圣雄甘地和马丁·路德·金等人物。“我认为金博士所做的事情令人惊叹，”他说。 “遵循圣经的原则，当仇恨出现在你面前时，转过另一边脸来表达爱。”安德森指出，她的父亲是“职业军人”，并描述了她在教堂和“敬畏上帝”的社区中长大的经历。他们都因家里有<cite>《世界图书百科全书》</cite>和带他们“去柴棚”的父母一起成长的经历而结下了不解之缘。他们继续分享在教育环境中成为少数群体的经历。安德森是黑人，他谈到了被送往一所白人占多数的高中的经历。白人科利·格拉斯哥 (Coley Glasgow) 表示，她在两所历史悠久的黑人大学完成了高等教育。</p><p>这种对共同点的探索得到了回报。随着谈话的继续，他们表达了不同意见。巴特·格拉斯哥反对强调系统性种族主义；安德森不同意。后来，巴特主张发放学券，允许家长将孩子从表现不佳的当地学校转出，但安德森再次不同意。然而这些分歧是非常文明的。谈话结束后，巴特对安德森说：“我可以和你聊几个小时。我真的可以。”安德森回答说：“非常感谢您来到这里，提出这些精彩的问题并参与这次精彩的对话。谢谢。我喜欢它。”</p><p>下次当你遇到分歧时，试着问问自己与谈话伙伴有哪些共同点可能会让他们感到惊讶。如果您正在辩论同性婚姻，您可能会指出许多人（异性恋和同性恋）认为婚姻是一种过时的制度。因此，尽管存在分歧，你们都相信婚姻作为一种制度的重要性。找到这些不常见的共性需要一点聪明才智，有时可能会让人感到费力。但回报是巨大的：找到它们可以让你们双方摆脱本能和无意识的感觉，即你们在谈话中是对手。</p><h3>展示你的作品</h3><p>在我们推出梅尔策多样性、包容性和归属感中心后不久，我们收到了一封来自一位受人尊敬的同事的令人不安的电子邮件。她要求我们利用我们作为多元化和包容性学者的平台，为那些没有为自己或孩子充分接种疫苗的人发声。在她看来，因违反疫苗规定而将人们排除在学校和工作场所之外，会对多样性、包容性和归属感的价值观产生“令人不安”的影响。她邀请我们与她讨论这个问题，以便在整个大学范围内解决这个问题。</p><p>在 COVID-19 大流行使疫苗成为白热化问题之前，我们就收到了这一请求。即便如此，我们知道这次谈话可能会很困难。我们强烈反对她的观点，但我们担心，无论是承认她在争议规模上的立场还是提供一次史诗般的握手都是不够的。</p><p>因此，我们深入分享了我们的推理。我们礼貌但坚定地表示，我们认为反对疫苗不属于我们中心的工作范围。我们解释说，该中心的主要职能是解决针对边缘化社会群体（例如有色人种或女性）的偏见。我们承认，一些群体，比如宗教少数群体，因为他们的信仰而不是因为他们的身体特征而受到虐待。但特别是作为一个新成立的中心，我们并不急于将边缘化群体的定义延伸到根据对单一问题的看法来定义的人们。我们还注意到，疫苗犹豫的话题引发了我们专业知识之外的复杂的医学、伦理和公共卫生问题。</p><p>我们并不抱有任何幻想，认为这种方法会改变我们同事的想法。但这表明我们真正考虑了她的观点，也为她提供了指出我们可能错的地方的机会。她感谢我们深思熟虑的回应，指出她完全理解我们的立场，并邀请我们参加一个单独主题的活动。</p><p>我们对同事询问的方法是展示你的工作的一个例子——也就是说，尽可能详细地解释分歧，向对方证明你已经仔细考虑过这个问题。强调分歧点的建议似乎与我们之前强调寻找共同点的不一致。但你可以而且应该做到这两点——详细寻找共识点并分享分歧点。全面描述您所持不同意见所依据的事实和价值观、任何影响您当前想法的研究和对话，以及您持有的任何剩余疑虑或不确定性。在你的对话伙伴的一生中，他们可能遇到过很多人，他们基于粗制滥造或不完整的工作而本能地反对他们的观点。展示你所付出的努力将使你从那些对手中脱颖而出。这将帮助他们回应你，而不是回应他们过去的所有声音。</p><p>需要注意的是：在展示你的作品时，不要在立即驳回反对意见之前对它进行草率的总结。作家莫伊拉·韦格尔将这个错误比作高中论文的“最后一段第一句话”：“我已经想到了另一面。别怪我没有想到对方！”

href="#ref8">8</a>不要采取这种粗略的方法，而是花时间研究和理解相反的观点，然后慷慨地分享这种理解，然后再解释为什么你仍然以不同的方式看待问题。展示你的作品以表达你的尊重。</p><h3>管理期望</h3><p>一般来说，许多人对分歧的容忍度较低。如果在会议室桌上出现有争议的身份问题，他们会立即改变话题。如果他们与某人发生争执，他们会在脑海中重播这场对话数周。不幸的是，大卫就是这样的人之一。他会逃避表达不同意见以避免冲突，然后独自因对方不同意他的观点而感到沮丧。无论出于何种原因，他似乎有一种不切实际的期望，即身份对话应该始终以集体拥抱结束。</p><p>人们有时会问我们这样痛苦的问题：“我是一个无神论者和坚定的自由主义者，但我团队中的一位同事是一位保守的福音派基督徒。尽管存在分歧，我们如何才能合作？”我们的答案是：降低你的期望。我们承认这个建议可能不会出现在励志海报上。但我们认为，将分歧中的热情强度与关系的强度进行衡量是完全合适的。</p><p></p><p>兰德尔·芒罗

us, because the teacher-student relationship is less intense than the marital one. The same goes for colleagues, neighbors, and acquaintances. When the relationship isn&#39;t as close, the need for agreement should be lower.</p><p> You can also manage your expectations of what can be achieved in a single conversation. As with any dispute over a heavy subject, identity conflicts often aren&#39;t neatly resolved in one encounter. The first conversation might go poorly, but the second might go better and the third better still. You might need to take multiple off-ramps and on-ramps to and from a conversation before you make progress.</p><p></p><p> When people engage in conversations about identity, diversity, and justice with someone who has opposing views, we encourage them to practice the four strategies we&#39;ve described:</p><ul><li> Locate the conversation on the controversy scale. To you, the conversation might be a factual or policy debate, but to the other person, it might be a debate over their equal humanity.</li><li> Find uncommon commonalities — points of agreement that are not matters of widespread agreement.</li><li> Show your work on the remaining disagreements to demonstrate that you&#39;ve thought carefully about the subject.</li><li> Manage your expectations. Scale the intensity with which you care about the disagreement to the intensity of the relationship.</li></ul><p> Despite the examples we&#39;ve shared, you might think we&#39;re being unrealistic about your ability to disagree agreeably on matters of identity by practicing these strategies. It&#39;s true that they can&#39;t ensure positive outcomes in all conversations. But we&#39;re confident that you&#39;ll see an immediate improvement in the quality of your conversations if you follow these guidelines.</p><p></p><p> Sometimes, of course, the rift between you and the other person will be too wide. Sometimes an attempt at conversation will end without a resolution. Sometimes the relationship itself will end. As awful as that outcome can feel, it&#39;s sometimes a necessary one. We&#39;re not here to guarantee that every disagreement will end happily. Rather, we want to help you ensure that a divide is truly unbridgeable before you walk away from it.</p><p> Other times, of course, you might be surprised in a positive way. Few, if any, meaningful relationships are devoid of conflict. When handled well, moments of tension can deepen a bond. Rather than nodding along insincerely or offering fake opinions, sharing a thoughtful difference of opinion can show the other person that you value them enough to be honest with them. Moreover, by modeling how to productively disagree, you can set the tone for how others throughout your organization can navigate today&#39;s thorniest conversations.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-productively-disagree-on-tough-topics/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Real Measure of Presentation Success</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-real-measure-of-presentation-success/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-real-measure-of-presentation-success/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 12:00:21 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Nancy Duarte. <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nancyduarte/">Nancy Duarte</a> is the CEO of <a href="https://www.duarte.com/">Duarte Inc.</a> , a communication company in the Silicon Valley.

We&#39;ve long known that the spoken word is a powerful tool for influence and action, but how do you measure that power?</p><p> When many organizations flipped from in-person to virtual and hybrid meetings and events, presentation analytics became a whole new ballgame. Speakers used to measure impact largely by surveying people and reading the literal room. While those forms of feedback still provide useful information about whether and how a message is landing, presenters now have many other metrics they can use.</p><p></p><p> Here&#39;s a quick example: For decades, my firm built all the decks for a large company&#39;s annual software developer conference. When the conference went remote because of COVID-19, we reworked all the content — each of the breakout sessions, as well as the keynotes — for a virtual audience. After that conference, the organizers stack-ranked the most popular sessions and realized they&#39;d put the same amount of energy into creating a session that garnered 40 views as they&#39;d put into creating sessions that earned hundreds of thousands of views. The organizers also got data on the percentages of participants actively engaging with the sessions, along with related numbers on downloads and shares. Combined with the substance of attendee comments, these insights told the conference folks which topics were resonating both broadly and deeply, helped them manage their time investments, and shaped their choice to keep the conference mostly virtual.</p><p> That&#39;s just one of many ways you can slice, dice, and analyze. But to gauge a presentation&#39;s success, what should you measure <em>for</em> ? In the example above, a key organizational goal was for developers to learn and build new software features into products, so the conference folks were looking specifically at how long each attendee stayed in the critical sessions, how active they were in the learning sessions, which tools they downloaded, and, after the event, how many applications the developers rolled out. Once the event team knew which sessions had turned out to be the most useful, they could create better-targeted content for the next conference.</p><p> All of these yardsticks measured some form of action. And really, that&#39;s what all presenters should be looking for: evidence that they&#39;ve moved people to <em>do</em> something, whether it&#39;s learning a new skill, adopting a new approach to organizational culture, changing a deeply ingrained process or behavior, or treating customers differently.</p><p> To measure a presentation&#39;s success, you need to assess your audience members&#39; feelings and actions before you speak, while you speak, and after you&#39;re done.</p><p></p><h3> Before Your Talk</h3><p> To define what baseline result you&#39;re after — that is, what action you want people to take after they walk away from your talk — it helps to know your audience. In studying hundreds of powerful speeches (and even checking out business speeches from the Stanford University library all the way back to the 1950s), I found that most of their <a href="https://www.duarte.com/how-to-write-a-call-to-action-in-a-persuasive-speech/#:~:text=Who's%20in%20Your%20Audience%2C%20and,they%20bring%20to%20the%20table.">calls to action</a> targeted one of four audience types: <em>doers</em> , who could instigate activity and get things moving in the organization; <em>suppliers</em> , who could provide resources and other types of support needed to achieve a desired goal; <em>influencers</em> , who could mobilize others to adopt a new idea or approach; or <em>innovators</em> , who could generate new ideas and apply their smarts to solve a problem or seize an opportunity.</p><p> Which type of audience will you address in your talk? Once you&#39;ve sorted out that critical “who,” you can analyze the “what” and the “how” of getting people to adopt and implement your idea. Specifically, you can take one of the following approaches.</p><p> <strong>Delve into your audience&#39;s thoughts and feelings.</strong> Ask yourself about the people you want to reach: <em>What</em> do they think about your idea now? If it&#39;s not on their radar yet, <em>how</em> will they feel about it when they hear what you have to say? And how do you want their thoughts and feelings to <em>change</em> as a result of your talk?</p><p></p><p> This isn&#39;t just a hypothetical stepping-into-their-shoes exercise. Gathering that information in advance — and articulating the points of view you want to move people <em>from</em> and <em>to</em> — will determine the way you frame an issue and possible responses to it. That could mean doing some research or surveying the audience to assess what people currently know about your topic and how they feel about it. For example, you might interview the people closest to your customers or culture. Are they excited about your idea, or skeptical of it? What questions do they have about it? Not only will you figure out what baseline you&#39;re starting from — you&#39;re also likely to gain insights about your audience that will help you <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/four-storytelling-techniques-to-bring-your-data-to-life/">craft your message</a> . You can also identify a benchmark to measure against later on, after your presentation — say, one of your organization&#39;s KPIs or an important talent-recruitment metric.</p><p> <strong>Anticipate emotional sticking points.</strong> The bigger the transformation you&#39;re trying to trigger in your audience, the more difficult it can be to quantify, especially if it&#39;s an emotional shift. As you research what&#39;s currently going on in your audience members&#39; heads, consider their hearts as well. What&#39;s going to be the hardest part of your message for people to accept or process, no matter how logical the argument or solid the evidence? What sources of potential resistance can you identify? If you do win over people&#39;s heads, how will you know when you&#39;ve won over their hearts, too?</p><p> Emotional change often won&#39;t show up on a dashboard. Even technologies that allow organizations to <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/employee-emotions-arent-noise-theyre-data/">track customer or employee sentiment</a> won&#39;t collect data on everything you need to know. Sometimes you&#39;ll know you&#39;ve overcome emotional resistance only when you see it later in new behaviors — when employees stop pushing back on important initiatives, for example, or when customers change their minds and buy the new release of your product.</p><h3> During Your Talk</h3><p> You can gauge your talk&#39;s likelihood of success as it&#39;s happening. To do this, you&#39;ll measure audience reactions in a few ways.</p><p> <strong>Observe audience behavior in the room or online.</strong> The most immediate form of measurement is to watch how people respond to a presentation in real time. When everyone takes out their phones to snap pictures of slides, you know something&#39;s grabbing their attention. Notice, too, when people laugh, gasp, or applaud — these basic behavioral cues signal <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/make-your-data-insights-visually-consumable/">which moments in your talk are resonating</a> . Tech comes in really handy here. If your talk (whether delivered in person or remotely) is recorded, you can easily go back and look for places where the audience visibly or audibly responded.</p><p> <strong>Look at the number of attendees.</strong> If you&#39;re addressing a crowd at a big event such as an industry gathering, another useful metric is the number of people who showed up to hear you speak when they could have attended other sessions instead. If you&#39;ve packed a physical or virtual room, that means you&#39;ve teed up your talk effectively before even opening your mouth. When I spoke this year at Dreamforce, a Salesforce conference, most of my audience members skewed young and weren&#39;t familiar with my work, but the talk was still oversubscribed, with overflow attendees clustered in the doorway. My name wasn&#39;t the draw — rather, it&#39;s the way I&#39;d titled and framed the message that hit a nerve. When attendees rated the talk, the data showed that it had lived up to the promise in the title and program description.</p><p> <strong>Spark and track social engagement.</strong> If your talk is getting everyone buzzing, especially at a large event, they might share quotes or images from your presentation in real time on social channels. Be sure to add your social handles and event-specific hashtags to your slides so it&#39;s easier for your audience to tag you and for you to track the ideas they&#39;re engaging with most. (Those posts, comments, likes, reshares, and other in-the-moment social reactions can later be captured in a post-event report.) You can also accelerate and measure the spread of ideas by providing repackaged presentation content in easily shared formats like infographics or <a href="https://www.duarte.com/resources/books/slidedocs/">Slidedocs</a> (slides that have more text because they are meant to be read by the audience rather than simply presented by the speaker). One of our tech customers has us build their keynote speeches into skimmable e-books with the script and slide visuals as well as trackable links to additional material.</p><h3> After Your Talk</h3><p> Your post-talk metrics can track both satisfaction with the presentation and some of the steps audience members have taken to implement the ideas.</p><p> <strong>Use surveys to assess audience satisfaction.</strong> Many speakers use surveys to measure audience sentiment after a presentation. If you surveyed people before you spoke as well, you&#39;ll be able to see whether your talk has moved the doers, suppliers, influencers, or innovators in the audience any closer to your point of view. One Fortune 100 tech company we work with also uses audience ratings as a management tool to motivate speakers to perform well. Everyone wants to get the highest possible score, and those who don&#39;t score well are likely to work hard to raise their score the next time they speak — or not be invited back.</p><p> <strong>Examine the speaker&#39;s own satisfaction.</strong> In companies without a strong measurement culture, sometimes one of the most telling signs of success is how the speakers themselves think their presentations went. That might seem like navel-gazing, but it&#39;s a bigger deal than most people assume. If a leader who consistently works on their skills and performance as a communicator and is sensitive to cues from the audience feels that they&#39;ve delivered an effective presentation, chances are actually pretty good that they have. And, hey, when your CEO wants to feel like a rock star, and they walk off the stage feeling like one, I call that a win.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Quantify actions taken.</strong> This is where you come back to that baseline result you&#39;ve defined — the audience behavior you wanted to elicit or change when you developed your presentation. While reactions like satisfaction and buy-in matter, actions matter more. The whole point of giving a presentation is to persuade people to adopt and implement your ideas. So look at the traction that your initiative gained as a result of your talk. Did your employees complete the enrollment forms your HR team mentioned in the benefits presentation? Did your sales team download the new corporate overview deck you launched at kickoff? How many deals closed as a result? I embed QR codes in my slide decks — most people know how to use them — and share my slides. This allows attendees to do a deeper “double-click” on a concept. My marketing team can track all that activity for post-talk analysis.</p><p></p><p> If you&#39;re trying to prevent certain actions, it&#39;s important to measure those, too. One year, a company hired my team to help them deliver news of a planned reorganization, one of the most difficult presentations to deliver. Executives worried about two kinds of fallout in particular: highly valued employees leaving their jobs in frustration, and a decline in productivity. So they decided to track two data points after the announcement: the number of resignations over the next several months, and any productivity dip as reflected in customer relationship management data over the next several weeks. With those reports in, they were relieved to see that both numbers were much better than company leaders had anticipated. In this situation, measuring success meant tracking a <em>lack</em> of (that is, negative) action after delivering a sensitively crafted message.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-real-measure-of-presentation-success/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Looming Challenge of Chemical Disclosures</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-looming-challenge-of-chemical-disclosures/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-looming-challenge-of-chemical-disclosures/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 12:00:11 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Lori Bestervelt, Colleen McLoughlin, and Jillian Stacy. <p>Lori Bestervelt, Ph.D., is the former global operations lead, and Colleen McLoughlin, Ph.D., DABT, ERT, is the director of toxicology at Enhesa Sustainable Chemistry.

They apply throughout the product life cycle, from the formulation of ingredients and materials to product manufacturing, packaging and distribution, and recycling and disposal. In the US, four states — California, Colorado, Maine, and Oregon — have adopted <a href="https://www.packworld.com/news/sustainability/article/22419036/four-states-enact-packaging-epr-laws">extended producer responsibility laws aimed at packaging materials</a> , and the issue will be a focal point of the US Securities and Exchange Commission&#39;s eventual <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-46">Scope 3 supply chain requirements</a> . On top of such legislation, a host of new regulatory actions focused on <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB54">materials sourcing and disposal</a> , <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/S8922">safety in global supply chains</a> , and the protection of employee safety and human rights are rolling out in jurisdictions around the world.</p><p></p><p> These rules pose a challenge for many of the brands that manufacture, market, and sell the clothes we wear, the cosmetics we apply, and the toys our kids play with, because their companies have very little visibility into the detailed chemical composition of their products.</p><p> In the face of regulatory developments, fashion brands have had to reconsider their use of materials, dyes, and a host of chemicals that have been linked to deforestation and pollution. They also need to be able to trace these compounds through every link in the supply chain.</p><p> Tracing the chemical composition of a piece of clothing is no easy task, given that the many dozens of substances and materials that go into a single garment are sourced from various suppliers and are incorporated into the product at different stages. A basic clothing item like a pair of jeans will be made up of fabric combinations, dyes, softeners, fading enzymes, biocides, and preservatives from dozens of different suppliers in different formulations that need to be applied using different techniques. All of these elements can create environmental hazards at various points in the supply chain and the full product life cycle.</p><p></p><h3> Beyond Safety Data Sheets</h3><p> Marquee brands that sell consumer products face the greatest pressure from regulators to clean up their supply chains. While many have made <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-rush-to-trace-sprawling-supply-chains-as-sustainability-rules-loom-11674512050">public commitments</a> to improve their sustainability, gaining needed cooperation from suppliers and partners has been a challenge. Most brands have relied on safety data sheets (SDSs) provided by their suppliers for information on product chemical composition. However, these documents are designed primarily to disclose information on chemicals and chemical compounds that could harm workers or others in the supply chain. They don&#39;t provide detailed information on the chemical composition of every material used in a product or offer any meaningful insight into its impact on recycling and disposal.</p><p> In our work conducting chemical hazard assessments and product toxicology analyses for some of the world&#39;s largest brands, approximately one-third of the SDSs we reviewed contained incomplete or inaccurate information on the chemical makeup of the products and materials they covered. Whether that is a result of suppliers intentionally omitting information or a reflection of the limitations of the SDS as a disclosure tool, the end result is that the brands responsible for these products are often in the dark about what&#39;s inside them.</p><p> Filling in the gap between the basic information provided in SDSs and the detailed disclosures that will soon be required by global authorities has become a source of conflict and confusion for many brands. Some suppliers are reluctant to share detailed chemical formulations to protect trade secrets, and many brands have been unwilling (or unable) to invest in costly chemistry assessments.</p><p></p><p> We expect that this problem will be addressed in two ways. First, the market will likely shift to suppliers that can attest to the safety of their products and processes. We&#39;ve already begun to see this in the fashion industry: Brands like Gucci, H&amp;M, Stella McCartney, and Zara recently committed to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fashion-giants-vow-to-buy-more-recycled-fibers-in-boost-to-sustainable-textile-mills-11668451031">buying more recycled materials</a> from sustainable textile mills. Second, companies will have to invest in detailed chemical screening to provide more comprehensive hazard assessments and full formulation disclosures. This approach has also been gaining in popularity as brands seek certainty and an objective means of evaluating their suppliers.</p><p> In both cases, the key objective for the big brands at the center of this shift to sustainability will be transparency. Brands need to start having candid conversations with suppliers about what exactly is in their products and what&#39;s expected in terms of regular reporting and disclosures. They might need to staff up in order to have sufficient resources to engage with suppliers, especially in seeking to extend working relationships beyond the first tier. Brands might also have to coordinate requests for information across multiple parts of the organization to get buy-in. Engaging the full supply chain can be tedious and hard work.</p><p></p><p> And these are not always easy conversations. The most common communication roadblocks we see here are confidentiality concerns, suppliers saying they are just too busy to deal with a litany of chemical composition questions from customers, and misunderstandings over what&#39;s being asked and why. Brands don&#39;t necessarily know what to ask for from their suppliers. They also don&#39;t know how to assess the impact of chemicals when they do get the information. Brands might also have to manage multiple internal chemical inventory systems and harmonize data from suppliers across different platforms.</p><p> To get to a place where all parties are on the same page, brands need to standardize a process for determining what questions to ask, whom to ask, and how to manage the information gathered. Brands also need to explain to suppliers why this information is important to the business and how they will use it, to allay privacy concerns.</p><h3> Evaluating Chemical Risk by the Numbers</h3><p> As we&#39;ve noted, we expect more brands to produce their own hard evidence of the chemical composition of their products when they are unable to get reliable information from their supply chain partners.</p><p> The only way to deliver objective certainty on the chemical risk of products is by performing chemical hazard assessments, which identify the specific chemical components used in the production of a product and screen them against comprehensive lists of known toxins to provide a hazard score. They are not cheap, though. Companies can expect to spend anywhere from $3,000 to $10,000 per substance for each assessment; the cost is at the higher end of that range for substances on which there is a great deal of scientific literature that must be carefully reviewed. Because even the most basic apparel, cosmetics, toys, and consumer products contain dozens of individual chemicals, the costs can mount quickly.</p><p> Add to those costs the challenges of retooling and replacing toxic substances in the production process once they&#39;re found, and it starts to become clear how looming deadlines like the European Green Deal&#39;s Net Zero by 2050 target are much closer than they appear.</p><p></p><p> The critical first step in the process of removing toxic substances from a supply chain is systematically identifying them. For example, we recently worked on a project with a global footwear brand that had a companywide mission to make its rubber supply chain more environmentally sustainable. It began by building a comprehensive database of its current chemical inventory and checking all entries against a list of known toxins and regulated chemicals in each jurisdiction in which it operates. Only then could it start the process of transitioning to safer chemicals.</p><p> As they make progress, brands need to build this institutional knowledge into their sourcing and product development processes to mitigate or eliminate the harmful chemical impacts of future products throughout their life cycles.</p><p> In the long run, these initiatives will result in safer, more sustainable consumer products. In the near term, however, expect to see a great deal of disruption and reshuffling of supply chains as more brands start to recognize that the tried-and-true methods of manufacturing and distribution are no longer sufficient in today&#39;s sustainability-oriented economy.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-looming-challenge-of-chemical-disclosures/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> How to Engage People on Reskilling: A Language Lesson</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-engage-people-on-reskilling-a-language-lesson/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-engage-people-on-reskilling-a-language-lesson/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 18:00:49 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Carl Clarke, Zsófia Belovai, Michelle Davies, Nicha Surawattananon, and James Elfer. <p>Carl Clarke is the director of talent, learning, leadership, skills, and people performance at Vodafone.

Technology advancements like <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_890740/lang--en/index.htm">generative AI</a> have led the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/05/future-of-jobs-2023-skills/">World Economic Forum to project</a> that 44% of employees will experience skill disruptions in 2023. On the surface, organizations seem to be rising to this challenge: Thirty-four percent of Fortune 50 companies have made reskilling and upskilling top strategic priorities and have designated a hefty 1.5% of their annual budgets to support them, according to research from Boston Consulting Group.</p><p> However, despite the level of investment in reskilling infrastructure, such as learning programs and talent technology platforms, we find that organizations are undervaluing the need to <em>change employee behavior</em> through effective engagement strategies. Having a well-designed reskilling program doesn&#39;t help an organization if people don&#39;t sign on to participate in it. To achieve a shift, leaders must understand how to connect people with reskilling initiatives in ways that encourage them to take up learning.</p><p></p><p> In an experiment conducted by a team of behavioral scientists from consultancy MoreThanNow and global telecommunications company Vodafone, we found that while most leaders talk about reskilling as an opportunity for <em>individual</em> progress and/or a means to achieving company strategy, a more frank, assertive message about keeping their skills relevant in a digital future drove more people to act. We present this evidence on how to change behaviors to help leaders connect their employees with the vast organizational investments being made in reskilling and upskilling.</p><p></p><h3> Career Relevancy Resonates</h3><p> Our randomized, controlled experiment, which included a global sample of 800 Vodafone employees, aimed to identify the language and motives that would best engage people to explore Vodafone&#39;s case for change. We compared four different message types that introduced the company&#39;s learning offering and why employees should sign up for it:</p><p> <strong>1. Individual progression:</strong> You&#39;ll invest in your career path and thrive in a digital future.<br /> <strong>2. Company strategy:</strong> You&#39;ll help transform Vodafone into a technology company for a digital future.<br /> <strong>3. Learning enjoyment:</strong> You&#39;ll put the joy of learning into your work as you discover new skills and capabilities every day.<br /> <strong>4. Career relevancy and security:</strong> You&#39;ll develop skills and competencies for the digital future.</p><p> While most leaders and organizations tend to use messages 1 and 2 when talking about reskilling, we found that No. 4&#39;s more direct “career relevancy and security” message had the highest positive impact on attitudes toward reskilling into technology-focused roles. The employees who received that message were, on average, 4.7% more open to broader career options and 4.9% more likely to consider reskilling compared with employees who had received the other messages — despite the time and effort the program would require. While these numbers might seem small in magnitude, they are statistically significant, come from a cost-free change in language, and are scalable.</p><p> Perhaps more notably, the experiment showed that people who received the “career relevancy” message were more likely — by 14.7% — to explore reskilling opportunities on Vodafone&#39;s internal site, which provides a tangible way to measure how Vodafone&#39;s employees actually invest their time in developing their skills.</p><h3> Three Reskilling Communication Tips for Leaders</h3><p> Message 4 made more of an impact with the open, honest, and clear message about the necessity to reskill.</p><p> Decades of research show why losses loom larger than gains and how this can be used as an effective language tool to change minds and behaviors. For example, when people are asked to rate the emotional effect of losing or gaining money, they systematically <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=e89e139fc94470c62f0904b69c229816bba4c2ba">rate losses as having a greater impact</a> . Similarly, in a <a href="https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/28311/ssoar-jebo-2009-3-gachter_et_al-are_experimental_economists_prone_to.pdf?sequence=1">field experiment</a> conducted with economists, a message telling participants that they would be fined for late conference registrations was significantly more effective than a message offering a discount for early registration.</p><p> That body of research and our own study yielded the following three tips to help managers talk more effectively with their employees about reskilling amid the rise of disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence and generative AI.</p><p> <strong>Set the context: Be reassuring but transparent about emerging technologies&#39; potential impact on employees&#39; careers.</strong> Be honest about the uncertainties around the possible effects of AI and other technologies on job roles rather than communicating only the upsides. Employees often fear that AI will steal their jobs, but it is more likely to change and augment their jobs. Talk about staying proactive to these changes and engaging with upskilling and reskilling opportunities in order to ride the wave of change. This can lead to more active attempts by employees to explore the benefits of increasing their technical knowledge and evolving their roles accordingly.</p><p> <strong>Make it relevant: Give personal, specific examples.</strong> Talk about the impact of new technologies on the person&#39;s specific work area and outline what might change for the team. Perhaps the way your team develops presentations, processes data, or takes action on customer feedback will change. Identifying specific scenarios will help both you and your employees think about the skills necessary in the evolving tech landscape and create a tangible plan of action.</p><p> <strong>Make it real: Offer the best options for the future.</strong> Be well informed and open. Talk about training programs employees need to consider as skills for the future rather than as a nice-to-have benefit. It&#39;s easy for employees to get lost in a sea of reskilling program information, and as a manager, you have a responsibility to guide them toward the best future career options that your company has to offer. For example, instead of saying, “I want you to consider a training program to grow your career,” say, “I want you to consider a training program; there&#39;s a possibility that some parts of your role will be automated in the future, so we need to make sure your skills keep evolving.&quot;</p><p></p><p></p><p> Vodafone&#39;s experiment resulted in successful action: Company leaders changed their language from communicating “individual progression” benefits to a more candid “career relevancy and security” message. When Vodafone launched the first cohort of its reskilling program, it successfully engaged 4,000 employees in Italy using this upfront communication style. Some 300 people have now been successfully reskilled and redeployed from contact centers to other internal functions. In total, one million learning hours have been completed by Vodafone employees.</p><p> We encourage leaders to follow Vodafone&#39;s lead and talk about reskilling with their employees in a more open and direct manner. Your digital future — and the ability of your employees to successfully navigate a changed world — might depend on it.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-engage-people-on-reskilling-a-language-lesson/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Marketing With Generative AI: Harvard Business School&#39;s Ayelet Israeli</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/marketing-with-generative-ai-harvard-business-schools-ayelet-israeli/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/marketing-with-generative-ai-harvard-business-schools-ayelet-israeli/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 12:00:48 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. <p>Sam Ransbotham ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ransbotham">@ransbotham</a> ) is a professor in the information systems department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College, as well as guest editor for <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> &#39;s Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy Big Ideas initiative.

Today, Shervin and I are thrilled to be joined by Ayelet Israeli. She&#39;s associate professor and cofounder of the Customer Intelligence Lab at the Digital Data Design Institute at Harvard Business School. Ayelet, thanks for taking the time to talk with us.让我们开始吧。</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Thank you so much for having me.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Often, we begin by asking guests their professions. But what&#39;s nice about being a professor is that people kind of have an idea of what that means. But I still think it&#39;d be nice to hear a little bit about your background and bio. So can you take a minute and introduce yourself and tell us what you&#39;re interested in?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> All right. I&#39;m a marketing professor at Harvard Business School. I&#39;m really interested in how we can better leverage data and AI for better outcomes, if it&#39;s outcomes for the firms, for customers, for society at large. Some of the work I&#39;m working on is around gen AI and how firms can use that to gain better access to consumer information and preferences. In other work I do, I think about how we can eliminate algorithmic bias in our decision-making.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I saw your talk a few months ago about using generative AI, and it really struck me as interesting because lots of people are talking about generative AI, but we don&#39;t have a lot of evidence yet.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> The evidence … is not saying it&#39;s not there, but it&#39;s just forthcoming. But you&#39;re starting to get some evidence through this research that you&#39;re doing. What can we do with GPT and generative in market research?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Me and two of my colleagues that are at Microsoft, Donald Ngwe and James Brand, started thinking around, can we actually use GPT for market research? The idea was, some people have shown that you can replicate very well-known experiments, including the famous Milgram experiment, using GPT by just asking it questions. And we were thinking, “We work so much as researchers and as practitioners to better understand customer preferences; maybe we can use GPT to actually extract these kinds of preferences.”</p><p> For large language models, the idea is that they will give you the most likely next word. That&#39;s how language is produced. And we were thinking, “Maybe if we ask GPT or induce it to make a choice between two things, maybe the response, which is kind of the most likely next word, will actually reflect the most likely responses in the population. And in that sense, we will essentially query GPT but get kind of the underlying distribution of preferences that we see in the population.” And we started playing around with that idea. We focused on consumer products — because we assumed that the data that GPT is aware of is mostly around consumer products, maybe from review websites or things like that — to see, can this idea actually work?</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And does it?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Kind of!</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That&#39;s wonderful. So tell us more.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Our first rush was like, “OK, let&#39;s see if it can generate very basic things we expect from economics. Like, when the price is higher, does it know to reject an offer? Does it know to make this trade-off between price and choice?” And we do see kind of a downward-sloping demand curve, which is what you would expect to see when we query GPT thousands of times to get answers. We also see things like, “Oh, we can tell it something about its income, and it reacts to that.” When it has higher income, it&#39;s less price-sensitive, which makes sense — it&#39;s what we expect from people as well.</p><p> We also see that it can react to information about itself: “Oh, last time you bought in this category, you bought this particular brand” makes it much more likely to pick up this brand in the future. So those are kind of our tests of “Does it actually react in a way that humans would in surveys?” And then we took it one step further, and we were trying to get willingness to pay for products or for certain attributes. And then we basically compared the distribution of prices to distribution of prices we see in the marketplace, which is pretty consistent.</p><p> And a really interesting and exciting thing for us was the ability to look at willingness to pay for attributes, because it&#39;s something that we all, as marketers, want to find. In our example, it&#39;s toothpaste, and we&#39;re trying to figure out how much people are willing to pay for fluoride, which is something that is difficult for us to think about. If someone would ask you that — “I don&#39;t know.” I do know that I prefer to buy this toothpaste, but I don&#39;t know what is the number. So it made us more curious to see if GPT can provide us this number in the same way that we ask consumers. And the way that the researchers have shown over years, the best way to ask these questions is through conjoint studies. Essentially, you provide people with 10 to 15 choices, and through their different choices, you are able to understand the trade-offs that they&#39;re making and actually quantify the difference that they&#39;re willing to pay.</p><p> We essentially did that. We did a conjoint-type analysis with GPT, and we compared the outcomes to human studies that a forthcoming paper just ran and got pretty similar results, so we were very excited about that. Of course, the results are not identical. We need to do a lot more to figure out where some of the issues are and how much does this generalize, but just the fact that we were able to get it is incredibly exciting.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So it seems exciting for firms because I&#39;m guessing that the cost of doing a market study on a lot of people is much more than doing it just through a bunch of API calls with ChatGPT. That has to be the appeal. Are there other appeals?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Basically, these types of studies are time-consuming, costly, and complex. Ideally, you would like to ask people to make a lot of trade-offs, but you&#39;re limited by the human ability to do that. With GPT, you can query it a lot of times. But at this point, I&#39;m not going to tell anyone, “Replace all your human studies with GPT or with another LLM,” because there is a lot more work to be done to figure out how to do that right.</p><p> One of the things around GPT is that it&#39;s pretrained. It will give me preferences, but these preferences are relevant for the time period in which it was pretrained. And a firm wants to know, “What are the customers interested in right now?” So that&#39;s kind of a limitation.</p><p> What we&#39;re testing now is, maybe we still have to query people, but less people than you would normally have to. So usually when you run these studies, you need thousands of users to get something that would be robust and statistically significant from an academic or statistical standpoint. We&#39;re trying to look at, maybe I can collect information from much fewer humans and combine it with LLM through fine-tuning and generate something useful. But really, a big advantage would be cost savings and time savings.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> The time was a big one.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Yeah. And we&#39;re talking so far about consumer products, but you can think about business-to-business type surveys, which are way more expensive and harder to do. So perhaps there is potential there as well. We haven&#39;t tested that yet.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I love the idea. I mean, when you think about most use cases for generative AI, there&#39;s a lot about taking drudgery out of the work or creating images and content and summarizing text. And then there&#39;s more-advanced ones around planning and inventory management. But the one you&#39;re talking about is literally replacing humans with this, right? I mean, that&#39;s basically what it is.</p><p> And it&#39;s a beginning of something that could be quite interesting, because you&#39;ve proven, at least, that it&#39;s sort of rational, right? I mean, you&#39;re asking it all these questions, and it is economically, I guess, rational. But then, as a marketer [like] you are yourself, not all marketing strategies are based on rationality. In fact, many of them are based on completely irrational desires.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Right.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What are your thoughts on the nonrational choices that many people make that create these big brands and $20,000 handbags and all kinds of stuff like that? How do you tap into that?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Before I answer your question, the first thing I was nervous about as an academic is when you used the word <em>proven</em> .</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Prove — I heard it!</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I see Sam is ...</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I smiled when I said it.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I would say we showed evidence consistent with that. And we also know that these models are still evolving, and maybe something we showed a month ago will not be relevant in a month from now, which is also a reason why you shouldn&#39;t just go and implement it without testing. So I want to be careful about that.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yes.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> So you know there is the more rational view of what is a product, but brands have value that is created that is kind of not measurable to us and hard to quantify. But that&#39;s almost like the example I gave with fluoride. Like, we don&#39;t know how to quantify fluoride. We might find it difficult if I would ask you, “Oh, how much are you willing to pay for a brand name like Colgate versus a toothpaste that I just made up?”</p><p> Actually, the same model of conjoint study will be able to infer those differences. And we see preferences, for example, for Mac over a different computer type. So it&#39;s already embedded in there, in a way.</p><p> Now how accurate it is — it&#39;s an empirical question.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah, no, you&#39;re so right because as I heard you respond to this question, I also realized that my assumption that what you showed some evidence for, vis-à-vis proven, isn&#39;t necessarily rationality. It&#39;s that it&#39;s got an ability to sort of encapsulate what most people do — or what many people do — which is embedded in stuff that it was trained on. So then my second question is, how do you get this to be more segmented or more specific or more nuanced? Because when you do focus groups, you&#39;re looking maybe for a particular flavor/particular nuance mix.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Yes, and also, a lot of the uses that we have seen when GPT and other LLMs were just introduced, a lot of the excitement was, “I&#39;m an engineer. I can just ask it a question. It gives me the most common thing. That&#39;s exactly what I want.” And actually, what we are doing is the other side of that. We don&#39;t want the most common thing. We want to understand the distribution.</p><p> That&#39;s why when we query GPT, we ask it every question many, many times — because we want to get many, many different consumers. In our analysis, we only varied income and what you bought before. But we can, in the same way, vary gender, race, anything else that you want … age. And I&#39;ve seen other researchers do that. ……</p><p> There is a really interesting paper by colleagues at Columbia and Berkeley that used GPT to create perceptual maps — how close two brands are to each other. And they also showed differences by gender and age and things like that around cars, which is a market where we expect to see these differences. So you can definitely do that, too, in a similar way. And it was also shown in political science for politics. I can give someone an ideology, and their voting behavior makes sense, their text generation on different topics makes sense. That&#39;s also very exciting as a marketer who cares about heterogeneity and understanding the differences between different consumers.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah. If only we could use this for clinical trials.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I saw some paper on better bedside manner of LLMs relative to doctors, so maybe there&#39;s still something there. [Laughs.]</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That&#39;s GPT-5, maybe.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Yeah.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> As you&#39;re saying that, though, I think about the way these work is a probabilistic estimate of the most likely next word, the most likely next ... and you&#39;ve segmented out “Given that you are low income, high income, given that you are this attribute, that attribute …” That&#39;s interesting, but where do we come up with the weirdness, then? If everything is based off the “most probables,” particularly from predefined [parameters] — not that you&#39;re not brilliant about coming up with a nice search space, but how are we going to find the things we don&#39;t know, then? Isn&#39;t that something that comes out of market research and focus groups?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Certainly, and that&#39;s part of the challenge. Obviously, GPT learns some kind of distribution, but there are people that, you know … let&#39;s say all that it learns is from reviews. There might be a lot of very extreme consumers that don&#39;t write reviews online or don&#39;t have access to the internet but have these interesting extreme ideas. And even if I tell GPT, “I want [as much] randomness as possible, very high variation,” I will not get to those people. So that will definitely be a problem.</p><p> I know already of some startups that are trying to solve this issue and identify these extreme consumers and then take them to the next level by using LLMs to maybe predict what they will do in another case. But at the same time, there has been some work on [the] creativity of GPT and that it creates very creative ideas, which, you know, is not exactly what you&#39;re asking for.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Some of those creative ideas are unconstrained by reality. I think we&#39;ve all seen some of it, [like] the way that it plays chess and decides that that rule is a little bit too confining.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Right. So that&#39;s also the problem of hallucinations, which should be tested in different contexts. But I think the way that we induce it to make a choice is less prone to hallucination problems because it provides a choice and you&#39;re not asking for facts or something like that. I&#39;m not trying to say that GPT will outperform any customer survey or anything like this. All I want to see is if it is as good as humans.</p><p> And even with human customers that we talk to, we have to work really hard to find people to do these surveys, and sometimes we miss them. We might be able to get the distribution of some people but still have to work hard on the extremes without AI but with just human conversation.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What I find really interesting here is, you said something like, “It&#39;s not as good as a consumer survey,” and now I want to challenge that. Because what I find interesting in this idea that you have is that when you think about other AI or gen AI use cases, there is a sort of burden of proof that you say, “OK, so I&#39;m a human. I&#39;m an engineer. I have a task. Let&#39;s ask GPT,” or any generative AI system, whether it&#39;s, let&#39;s say, knowledge kind of work, whether it could do it as well as a human does. OK, great. Or can it code better than a human does? Or can it create a video or a document or something that you would read and you&#39;d say, “Wow, this is nice. So then <em>you</em> could do it. I don&#39;t need to do it.” Right? So that sort of a burden of proof is very clear.</p><p> On this one, I&#39;m not so sure that you even <em>have to</em> have a burden of proof, because in many ways we&#39;re assuming that a focus group of 500 or a thousand people, or any survey — I mean, there&#39;s no focus group that big that I know of — but a survey of that kind is somehow gospel or, like, that&#39;s like what GPT or whoever, whatever —</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Can you talk to the reviewers of our paper? [Laughs.]</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Because the reality of it is, if you think about it, it&#39;s that if the only way to know ... so go back. Because, look: Your premise here is like, “We are going to save so much money on all this market research by augmenting this with that,” which is a true premise, and for sure it is. But I also find the burden is lower. And even if you don&#39;t stop a single human-based market research or survey, you&#39;ve still added a ton of value by broadening the universe of responses and options.</p><p> Because I would argue, how do you know 1,000 people or 2,000 people are representative <em>at all</em> or that they have all those nuances? And so this thing is actually bringing in signals that for a fact exist because otherwise you wouldn&#39;t be there. And I find that actually quite inspiring to a marketer. I&#39;m happy to talk to your reviewers.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I think as academics, we are used to a certain level of rigor and robustness and ability to say, like, oh, to actually prove things, and the fact that this tool can provide a simulation of something is nice, but “Can it actually replace humans?” is a higher burden because of this question of, is it actually giving me meaningful, updated responses? Will it match something? And you&#39;re saying, “Well, maybe humans aren&#39;t that great in the first place, so why do we try to … ?”</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> No, I&#39;m actually making a different point. I was trained as a scientist, and I get the burden of proof is much higher in science and in academia. And I wasn&#39;t trying to argue that you&#39;ve proven that this replaces humans. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s replacing humans. But what I was trying to say is, the value of this is that it dramatically augments the signals and insights and ideas available to a marketer and because there is no survey or focus group that by definition isn&#39;t limited, and this isn&#39;t limited because it&#39;s got everything that&#39;s there. So my point simply is not that the burden of proof has been met but that I don&#39;t even know if there should be that kind of a burden of proof, because it is addressing a limitation of focus groups and traditional research. So it doesn&#39;t necessarily need to replace it. They&#39;re not perfect to begin with. Nobody would argue with that.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Yeah. I think, at the very least, I feel comfortable saying that we showed that it could be very informative about preferences and what is going on, at least within the data it&#39;s trained on. And that could already change a lot for a lot of firms, given the type of research and the problems with market research and access to humans and all of that. For sure.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So there&#39;s multiple different signals coming in here, and I think we&#39;ve addressed this first from the idea of, does this signal replace the other signal from a focus group? But the dependent variable here might be, do people actually buy a product? Do people buy the fluoride? Do they buy the [fake] product?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Right.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> And if this signal adds some information to that prediction, then we&#39;ve got a new information source. If it completely supplants it, then we have a different thing.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Right. And now we&#39;re going to the problem of these surveys of stated preferences versus revealed preferences that are actually based on what people do. Now, I would argue that GPT might have less [of a] problem than humans because it&#39;s not subject to things like experimenter bias or trying to appease me. So it&#39;s probably giving me something closer, but it&#39;s still giving me something likely closer to stated preferences if it brings the data from review sites or market research and not necessarily [giving me] what people would actually buy. But that is also true about the focus groups and the surveys.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So we think about this as a new source of signal — that there are lots of different signals out there, and it has some overlap, perhaps, with one signal. And I think that itself is fascinating, but it may also have a new signal.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Yeah.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> The other thing that I find fascinating here is that AI solutions have been trained on data, and then, when they&#39;re put in production, they are then trained on data or they get feedback from data in production, and they get better. With generative AI, so much of that feedback also needs to be human-driven versus data-driven, right? Like, this is what it tells you to do. Does it resonate with you? Yes, no, etc. So it also feels like this kind of a technology, where generative AI can be a user of another generative AI&#39;s output.</p><p> So let&#39;s go to the paradigm of, look, it&#39;s replacing a human in the focus group, or we can also replace a human in a company that&#39;s a marketer dealing with a response from generative AI on, like, “How do you design a campaign for this?”</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And so this idea of maybe multiple generative AI agents going at each other to improve the overall quality — what do you think about that?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I think it&#39;s an interesting idea. But I also think that the <a href="http://john-joseph-horton.com/papers/llm_ask.pdf">evidence so far</a> suggests that you still need, at some point, at least one human in the loop …</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> For sure.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> ... because of all of these hallucinations, unrealistic things that come out. But certainly, if these models are getting better and better, more efficient, higher quality, then why not? As we implement these type of things in our organizations, we also need to think about how do we — I don&#39;t know if the word is exactly <em>validate</em> , but how do we ensure that the process still makes sense and that we&#39;re not just wasting everyone&#39;s time with these agents talking to each other?</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> No, for sure. You&#39;re 100% right. You need humans in the loop and probably for many decades at least. But you may not need so many of them. You know, if you have some kind of an output that is supposed to be helping, let&#39;s say, a group of 20,000 customer service reps, and it&#39;s going to get better based on the feedback, based on their usage in a pilot of, let&#39;s say, three months, maybe you don&#39;t need to pilot this to 5,000 people. Maybe you could pilot it to a hundred people plus two or three different gen AI agents so that you dramatically accelerate the adoption time.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Yeah, that&#39;s cool.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Although I have to say, when I heard you saying that, Shervin, what it made me think of is when people hold a microphone too close to a speaker and we get these feedback loops — amplifying feedback loops. I do worry that if the two sources of data are too, co-aligned, we&#39;ll get squelched.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That&#39;s true.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> We won&#39;t get craziness. Skip to the back of the chapter here: Give us the answers. People are listening to this, and they&#39;re working in companies, and they have these tools available right now, not 20 years from now, like we&#39;re thinking as an academic. What should people be doing right now with these tools?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Play around with them. Figure out … what do you want to know about your customers? We provide in our paper a whole list of prompts of exactly how to prompt for these types of things and start getting this information. And like Shervin said earlier, what is it exactly? We&#39;re not sure, but it&#39;s a signal. There is information there that we can start finding out, right?</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> And so by playing with it, that helps people discover what information is there?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I think testing and discovering. But starting with a concrete question is really helpful because you will just get down so many rabbit holes. You can have these conversations forever.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Ayelet Israeli, you&#39;re the only guest we&#39;ve had that has the “AI” initials, which nicely fits into <em>Me, Myself, and Ayelet Israeli</em> , which is <em>Me, Myself, and Myself</em> .</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> [Laughs.]</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> But tell us more about yourself and your background and how you ended up where you are and what got you interested in all this stuff.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Sure. I&#39;m originally — as my last name might indicate — I&#39;m originally from Israel. Israel is known to be “ <a href="https://www.cfr.org/book/start-nation">Startup Nation</a> .” And when I came through to think about what I want to study in university, there was a special program that was geared toward improving Startup Nation by giving people kind of managerial tools. So it was a bachelor&#39;s in computer science and an MBA combined program in five years.</p><p> And I started doing that, and I like computer science. I actually majored in finance and marketing, but I especially was interested in marketing and, particularly, making sense of a lot of data in this context that is so kind of fun and applied. And then I decided to get a Ph.D. in marketing.</p><p> Over the years, I figured that consumer products or things around customers and transactions are interesting to me. It&#39;s just a fascinating world. You have a lot of data around that because as we move more to online and digital, we can see more and more data. And then the question is, “How can we actually leverage that data more efficiently and also in a responsible manner?” which a part of my research is about as well.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So we have a segment where we&#39;ll ask you a series of rapid-fire questions to put you on the spot. Just answer the first thing that comes to your mind.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> OK.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s the biggest opportunity for artificial intelligence right now?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Biggest opportunity. This is not rapid.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Next question.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Yeah, next question.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Oh, OK.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I&#39;ll think about it.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Pass.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Pass. What&#39;s the biggest misconception that you think people have about artificial intelligence right now?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I tend to be around people that work in this and understand this, that it is just a model, but a lot of people still don&#39;t and still envision robots and this magical thing that happens. And that&#39;s why I like to explain very clearly, “Oh, it&#39;s predicting the likelihood of the next word and choosing them on distribution, and that&#39;s all that is happening.” So I think we&#39;re still maybe not as bad as it used to be 10 years ago, but it&#39;s still this magical, artificial thing that happens, and it&#39;s not. It&#39;s still magical, I guess.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> It&#39;s pretty amazing — or can be. What was the first career that you wanted?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I don&#39;t know. In Israel, you go into the military. I was in the military; I was a lieutenant in intelligence. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a career I necessarily wanted. It&#39;s something I did.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> There&#39;s a lot of discussion and excitement about artificial intelligence. Where are people overusing it? Where are people using it where it doesn&#39;t apply?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I think one of the challenges I&#39;ve seen is actually using it to ask it factual questions, because that&#39;s not what it&#39;s about. It&#39;s not a truth-finding mechanism, and that&#39;s just a wrong usage.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> OK. Is there something that you wish that artificial intelligence could do right now that it can&#39;t do? What&#39;s the next exciting thing? What announcement tomorrow would make you happy?</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> I&#39;ll take that question slightly differently. I think what excites me about AI in terms of my research on responsible use of data and algorithmic bias is that, yes, a lot of people have shown that AI can generate biased outcomes. We also have known for many years that humans generate biased outcomes. And what excites me about AI is that it&#39;s much easier to fix biased outcomes by a machine and to generate processes that will eliminate bias, and it&#39;s so much more difficult with humans. And that&#39;s something that I&#39;m really excited about.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I love that point because we&#39;ve got all this bias and misogyny in our world, not by the machines. The machines are not the people who put us in this situation in the first place. And the fact that they maybe do a little bit of that at the beginning, before we&#39;ve trained them, we shouldn&#39;t just throw them out for starting down that path, because we can adjust the weights in models. We can give feedback to models to improve those in a way that we can&#39;t with bazillions of people.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Right.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So I think that&#39;s a huge point.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> And we&#39;ve seen the first models of gen AI images. If you say “doctor,” we&#39;re only [seeing] photos of men or things like that. And over time, this has improved a lot. So that&#39;s really exciting, right? We can try to think about how we fix some societal problems using these things because, yes, machines can be manipulated more easily than humans. Of course, that&#39;s a risk, but that&#39;s for some sci-fi podcast, not for this one.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> The example of the doctor in the image is spot-on because I think so many people were fascinated by how accurate these models are because they felt right. They confirmed our stereotypes. You ask for this image, and it gives you exactly what you think of as that image, but that&#39;s just feeding into the problem again. And that&#39;s going to perpetuate it if we don&#39;t [stop it]. But, like you say, there has been improvement there.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Ayelet, thank you so much. This has been really insightful and quite interesting. Thank you for being on the show.</p><p> <strong>Ayelet Israeli:</strong> Thank you so much for having me.

In spring 2023, we fielded a global survey and subsequently analyzed records from 3,043 respondents representing more than 25 industries and 100 countries. We also interviewed 17 executives leading AI initiatives in a broad range of companies and industries, including financial services, media and entertainment, retail, travel and transportation, and life sciences.</p><p> Our research examines how managers and leaders use AI to enhance strategic measurement to advance strategic outcomes. It explores how organizations have adapted — and even generated new — KPIs with AI to define and deliver measurably better performance.</p></aside><p> Without adaptation and refinement, static business metrics create two types of strategic risk. One is encouraging performance on the wrong measures. The 2008 global economic crisis, for example, was triggered in part by banks&#39; dependence on a then widely used metric: value at risk, which measures potential portfolio losses in normal market conditions at a single point in time. Financial institutions did not adjust this measure as riskier subprime mortgages and securitized default swaps became a larger part of their portfolios. Guided by a metric that severely underestimated potential losses — in some cases, by orders of magnitude — many financial institutions went bankrupt or suffered significant losses.</p><p></p><p> Opportunity costs represent another risk from static key performance metrics. Our research persuasively demonstrates that companies deliberately using artificial intelligence to design and create more dynamic KPIs enjoy greater situational awareness, stronger ties between operations and strategic outcomes, and improved results overall. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> These <em>smart</em> KPIs reflect deeper understandings of performance drivers and produce more reliable predictions about future outcomes than comparable KPIs not informed by AI. (See “Three Types of Smart KPIs.”) A “set them and forget them” approach to key metrics is neither desirable nor sustainable in volatile and fast-changing markets.</p><div class="callout-highlight callout-simple"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Three Types of Smart KPIs</h4><p class="caption"><table id="chart1" class="chart-grouped-rows no-mobile"><thead><tr><th> Type of KPI</th><th>描述</th><th>Benefits</th><th> Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><p> <strong>Smart Descriptive KPIs</strong></ul></p></td><td><ul><p> Synthesize historical and current data to deliver insights on <em>what happened</em> or <em>what is happening</em> .</ul></p></td><td><ul><p> Provide a deeper understanding of performance gaps and their causes.</ul></p></td><td><ul><p> Sanofi&#39;s “snackable AI” tool boosts situational awareness by revealing critical interdependencies among different KPIs.</ul></p></td></tr><tr><td><ul><p> <strong>Smart Predictive KPIs</strong></ul></p></td><td><ul><p> Anticipate future performance, producing reliable leading indicators.

Kiron, M. Schrage, F. Candelon, et al., “ <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/strategic-alignment-with-ai-and-smart-kpis/">Strategic Alignment With AI and Smart KPIs</a> ,” <span style="font-style:normal">MIT Sloan Management Review</span> , Sept. 5, 2023.</p></article></aside></div><p> It takes effective governance to ensure that KPIs evolve, remain aligned with strategic aspirations, and are trusted by workers and managers alike. As AI-infused workflows and processes colonize and expand business capabilities, leaders need to update and upgrade their key performance indicators to keep up. From Schneider Electric to Walmart to Maersk, we see strategists, technologists, and business leaders working together to refine and enhance KPIs to ensure their alignment with evolving organizational goals.</p><p> Among these companies, responsibility for making KPIs more predictive, dynamic, and insightful extends beyond strategists and business leaders. They encourage technologists to make a material contribution to the formulation, organization, and prioritization of KPIs. That&#39;s a big change from the way companies have traditionally established and updated KPIs.</p><p> As Schneider Electric chief governance officer and secretary general Hervé Coureil observes, “When processes are digitized, they start to produce &#39;exhaust data&#39; that can be turned into relevant telemetry metrics, providing insights on process behaviors, defects, etc. Secondly, digital transformation triggers significant decisions and investments — portfolio and investment choices, business model implementation, new systems and infrastructure — and therefore, there is a need to measure the impact of those decisions as well as the effectiveness of the various programs that comprise the transformation.”</p><p></p><p> Developing such measures depends on more than executive judgment, intuition, and experience. Transforming static, legacy performance metrics into smarter, more dynamic KPIs demands a greater role for data, analytics, and AI. We suggest that leaders adopt a three-pronged approach to governing the development and use of AI-driven KPIs and, more broadly, their strategic measurement systems. This governance approach rests on three factors:</p><ol><li> A solid data foundation with responsible data and analytics practices.</li><li> Organizational structures with responsibility and accountability for evolving KPIs.</li><li> Trust in KPIs trained to adapt to and learn from changes in circumstances.</li></ol><h3> Governance of Smart KPI Development: Get Your Data in Order</h3><p> Effective KPI governance requires effective data governance. Every organization participating in our research emphasized data quality and discipline as the technical enabler for its AI-driven KPI initiatives. Most legacy IT and database systems, however, aren&#39;t configured to generate or make accessible the quality data necessary for measuring or defining smart KPIs.</p><p> Pierre-Yves Calloc&#39;h, the chief digital officer at Pernod Ricard, recalls that the spirits giant realized it needed three years&#39; worth of weekly consumer sales data to enable meaningful AI interventions. A preliminary review revealed huge gaps. “When we started, we had almost no data governance,” says Calloc&#39;h. “Almost 80% of the data we needed wasn&#39;t there because it was mainly external data. Our statistical experience is that you need weekly data; if you have monthly data, it doesn&#39;t work, so you need to source the information manually. We even called it &#39;archeology&#39; because of the level of effort needed, even going into old PowerPoint and Excel files in mailboxes. In addition, you need a strong business case for the project, because without clear benefits in mind, people will not invest the time.” Essentially, the business case for AI-powered KPIs could not be made without technically reliable and robust governance that transformed data <em>archaeology</em> into data <em>architecture</em> .</p><p> Jon Francis, General Motors&#39; chief data and analytics officer, who previously oversaw Starbucks&#39;s digital transformation, echoed Calloc&#39;h&#39;s observations. “It&#39;s actually really hard to just create a KPI because of the underlying data challenges,” he says. “It takes all of your effort, usually, to create the KPI and report on it.” Poor data and metadata governance undermines an organization&#39;s ability to develop the right metrics. Francis notes that technology systems are often just “spooling data that&#39;s not defined or useable” and, as a result, “you end up with these data dumping grounds.” He candidly observes that for most organizations, the generation of data from production systems is an afterthought.</p><p> Effective KPI governance remains contingent upon a company&#39;s technological capabilities to harness data: It demands diligent data governance, a structured approach to analytics management, and a path for technologists and business unit leaders to collaborate on developing optimal KPIs on an ongoing basis.</p><p></p><h3> Embedding Governance in Teams or Functions</h3><p> Our research finds top management rethinking how to develop and continuously improve their key performance measures and metrics. While approaches vary, a common theme among interviewed executives is choosing to locate responsibility for transforming KPIs in a specific team or group of teams.</p><p> At Schneider Electric, leadership came to recognize that the company&#39;s legacy metrics could become incompatible with its aspirations to strategically collaborate and innovate with its global customers. Coureil helped sponsor the creation of a Performance Management Office within the company&#39;s data team to oversee performance measurement. The office was deliberately positioned in the governance team to ensure a neutral cross-functional perspective.</p><p> The Performance Management Office helped top management transform their portfolio of KPIs and align them with operations. It also pushed the businesses to become far more data-driven and aware of the links between improvement against a given performance metric and enhanced outcomes. “Measurement has been very core for us,” adds Coureil. “We actually tried to make metrics a complete, integral part of our digital transformation, as opposed to an afterthought.”</p><p> What&#39;s the desired outcome of a given KPI? “It&#39;s an ontology or taxonomy question at some point: What behaviors are you looking for?” asks Coureil. “I think people put a lot of things in the KPI basket, and we&#39;ve spent a lot of time trying to be extremely clear about what we&#39;re looking at: What is the desired outcome? It looks very simple, but it is not that simple, actually … being extremely sharp on what the desired outcome of a given KPI is.” That&#39;s why having a performance management office is proving to be essential to strategically coherent and consistent KPI governance, Coureil says.</p><p> Instead of using a performance management office, DBS Bank governs KPI development through cross-functional teams that create value maps linking customer journeys to desired outcomes. The Singapore-based financial services leader revisited its operating model to reflect the fact that using smarter KPIs could measurably improve outcomes for both the business and its customers. “Over the past three years, we moved to something we call a data-driven operating model,” says group chief analytics officer and managing director Sameer Gupta.</p><p> At the heart of the model are cross-functional squads. Representatives from various functions, such as product, risk, data, marketing, call center, and human resources, form a squad, Gupta explains. Every squad member is then aligned on the same set of outcomes mapped to four categories: customer experience, employee experience, profitability, and risk.</p><p> The factors driving performance on each outcome are represented in a value map that connects performance metrics with the four types of outcomes. Each squad is responsible for identifying and optimizing these factors. “The squads look at optimizing those drivers,” says Gupta. “We look at many things to optimize those drivers: experimentation, data, customer immersion, AI, machine learning — all kinds of tools to try and continuously optimize in coordination and consultation with control towers and management dashboards.”</p><p> The result, Gupta notes, is not just greater data-driven operational efficiencies and effectiveness but KPIs that expand the boundaries of the DBS client and customer experience. Revisiting processes for KPI governance have led to both better KPIs and better KPI outcomes.</p><p> While the specific approaches vary, most leaders we spoke with are in the early stages of building governance structures to help make their KPIs more intelligent, detailed, and predictive.</p><h3> Effective KPI Governance Is Based on Trust</h3><p> While these technological and organizational investments in KPI governance are crucial to enhancing KPIs, our research suggests that their practical value to teams is contingent upon people&#39;s willingness to trust them. During Schneider Electric&#39;s digital transformation efforts, Coureil recognized that “one of the changes, versus a more traditional way of doing business, is that you don&#39;t build your dashboard anymore. Somebody else does it for you. So you have to trust those metrics.”</p><p> Anecdotal evidence indicates that establishing trust in AI-sourced metrics can be challenging.</p><p> At Maersk, for instance, the long-held assumption was that getting a vessel out of port and on its way to the next one as quickly as possible was ideal. A digital twin simulation, however, showed that being on time was better than being early: With an end-to-end connected schedule, as is also the situation for commercial airlines, the port that a vessel is heading to next can&#39;t adjust its schedule to immediately accommodate earlier arrivals. In other words, “faster isn&#39;t better” was a counterintuitive assertion from the data team, and it was only after the on-time approach was put into practice that the front-line operators — and even those at the most senior levels managing the entire terminal — were finally convinced.</p><p> Cultivating the trust necessary to develop and use dynamic, AI-enhanced KPIs is a critical leadership and governance challenge. Developing data-savvy managers who are receptive to developing and embracing AI-driven KPIs is a significant part of that challenge. At one media organization, an executive interviewee noted that she&#39;d had a hard time persuading her superiors to look at KPIs and make decisions based on data. Their usual retort was that executives are “paid millions for their gut instincts” — in other words, experience and intuition were valued over data-driven insight.</p><p></p><p> Building a data-oriented management community is one way to create trust among the leaders using enhanced KPIs. At Sanofi, the most senior 150 leaders, representing various functions and businesses, are being trained in boot camps to become more data-centric and to seek out more information before making decisions. As chief digital officer Emmanuel Frenehard says, “Our goal as part of our cultural change is that these 150 people, when they leave the boot camp, are far more inclined to adopt that data-centric view and better understand the potential of AI for us. We are making sure that the core of our leadership is trained on how to use the next generation of AI-driven KPIs.”</p><h3> Further Considerations</h3><p> To ensure that their AI-enabled smart KPIs are setting them up for strategic success, leaders must prioritize the technological, organizational, and cultural dimensions of KPI governance discussed above. As they begin to do so, these related considerations should be top of mind.</p><p> <strong>Establish a steering committee to guide continuous improvement.</strong> Transforming legacy KPIs into enhanced KPIs demands regular experimentation to ensure that key performance is focused on the right outcomes. Determining where this experimentation happens, who does it, and how often are critical leadership and governance decision points. Is it in a central team, like a performance office, or is it more widely distributed? Should certain KPIs be revisited and reviewed more frequently than others? Who has decision rights when changing KPIs changes accountability? There are no one-size-fits-all answers to these questions. Leaders need flexible processes to effectively govern KPIs that might be siloed or cross-functional. We suggest establishing a cross-functional KPI steering committee with business and technical expertise to elicit necessary input and buy-in from relevant stakeholders.</p><p> <strong>Oversee investment in capabilities to optimize groups of KPIs.</strong> Does your company have the capability to assess whether its KPIs are good enough or fully optimized? Our research suggests that AI can play a valuable role in assessing KPI quality, prioritizing KPIs, and addressing trade-offs among them. AI can help determine, for example, under what conditions customer-centricity imperatives should take priority over improving operational efficiencies, or when to prioritize revenue considerations over market share investments. Integrating AI into the process for developing, setting, and prioritizing KPIs can be a disruptive change for managers who are accustomed to making these decisions themselves. To preempt or address such disruptions requires organizational, technological, and cultural investments.</p><p> <strong>Govern KPIs like assets, not tracking tools.</strong> Enhanced KPIs can redefine key performance, not just track it: That makes KPIs, and the capability to enhance them, valuable assets. As with other assets, KPIs can depreciate with time or inattention. Governing KPIs like assets, not tracking tools, ensures that they become more valuable, insightful, and predictive over time. Given a wide variety of asset management frameworks, effective governance means choosing the appropriate asset management framework for KPI assets, including relevant, underlying data assets. Some companies are already beginning to explore using KPIs for KPIs to ensure that the value of their KPI assets consistently improves.</p><p> <strong>Elevate KPI oversight.</strong> As KPIs become more intelligent and more effective proxies for corporate strategy, it becomes more important for boards to be involved with governing KPI development and use. To be sure, developing and using KPIs are management functions. However, boards sign off on strategies that KPIs both embody and inform. Signing off on strategy but not the company&#39;s approach to developing KPIs is short-sighted and can undermine strategic aspirations. Engage the board directly in efforts to develop organizational capabilities for enhancing KPIs. Investing in enhanced KPIs is just as strategically relevant as investing in improving performance itself.</p><p></p><h3>结论</h3><p>Our three-pronged approach to governing the development and use of KPIs expands on the idea that AI can transform KPIs into strategic assets that do more than track performance. They serve as a GPS for the organization, delivering greater foresight and a deeper understanding of interdependencies among key performance drivers.</p><p> Making the transition to AI-enhanced KPIs is not an incremental shift. It is a dramatic change from exclusively human, top-down approaches to setting and refining KPIs. Organizations that have made this transition are putting technology in the (KPI development) loop.</p><p> In the future, KPIs will no longer be passive tools for measurement but active agents for empowering decision makers. Ongoing innovation using generative AI promises to expand the purpose, power, and potential of smart KPIs. Holding conversations with chat-enabled smart KPIs, for instance, is already a goal for several of the executives we interviewed. With proper governance, empowering smart KPIs will empower strategists and managers alike.</p><p> <em>Editor&#39;s note: The authors would like to thank Gaurav Jha, David Zuluaga Martínez, Allison Ryder, and Barbara Spindel for their contributions to this article.</em></p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/governance-for-smarter-kpis/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> How to Make Data Monetization Everybody&#39;s Business</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/how-to-make-data-monetization-everybodys-business/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/how-to-make-data-monetization-everybodys-business/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 13:01:42 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Barbara H.

A confluence of factors is driving this trend: Amid supply chain bottlenecks, rising labor and transportation costs, US tariffs on China, and geopolitical tensions, companies recognize the value of reshoring production. US industrial policies favoring domestic manufacturing are also informing these decisions, including new laws seeking to address national security threats, economic disruptions, and dwindling access to key technological components. The result is an early-stage US reshoring renaissance.</p><p> The question for executives is whether their companies should follow this trend. But first, it&#39;s important to understand the trend&#39;s scope and what&#39;s driving it.</p><p></p><p> There have been calls for reshoring since manufacturing began sharply declining in the late 1970s, but COVID-19 marked a turning point for the C-suite. Between the first quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of 2023, executives started talking about onshoring, reshoring, and nearshoring during earnings calls and conferences much more frequently than they had previously, according to an analysis by The Conference Board.</p><p> Such talk started significantly increasing in the second quarter of 2020, as the pandemic set in globally. In the second quarter of 2022, as supply chain pressures again surged, Russia invaded Ukraine, and new federal industrial policies were enacted. Overall, instances of executives mentioning these ideas increased nearly 3,000% in just three years.</p><p> New laws also helped drive this onshoring resurgence, including the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Each contains stipulations regarding the production and procurement of US-made products and components that benefit companies that manufacture domestically.</p><p> Reshoring is now driving a dramatic rise in manufacturing construction activity. Companies are constructing US manufacturing facilities at a higher rate than any other property type. Such spending rose to an annual rate of $114.7 billion in 2022, according to the US Census Bureau — a 40% increase year over year and a 62% increase over the past five years.</p><p> This made manufacturing the fastest-growing asset category in 2022, as the average growth rate for <em>all</em> nonresidential buildings and infrastructure increased just 7.4% compared with 2021. And the building continues: Manufacturing spending was 74% higher in July 2023 than in the same month the previous year.</p><p></p><p> The reshoring renaissance does not apply universally. Sectors requiring large amounts of manual labor, including shoes and apparel, furniture, and home decorative items, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/business/economy/supply-chain-reshoring-us-manufacturing.html">less likely to reshore</a> . Industries with more complex and expensive products, and those that can use automation and robotics in manufacturing, are leading the US resurgence. The <a href="https://reshorenow.org/content/pdf/2022_Data_Report.pdf">five industries</a> experiencing the greatest US employment growth as a result of reshoring and direct investment are electrical equipment, appliances, and components; computer and electronic products; chemicals; transportation equipment; and medical equipment and supplies.</p><p> Our analysis shows that North America (the US, Canada, and Mexico) has the existing supplier base to support more manufacturing activity than it currently has. In fact, for electrical equipment, North America has 15% of the global supplier base and 7% of global output. Twenty-one percent of the pharmaceutical industry&#39;s global supplier base is in North America, but its share of global output is just 18%, according to <a href="https://www.conference-board.org/publications/TCB-Global-Supplier-Index">The Conference Board Global Supplier Index</a> .</p><p></p><h3> Is Reshoring Right for Your Company?</h3><p> Reshoring results from executives and senior managers reorienting from a “low cost” to a “best cost” supply chain strategy by prioritizing factors such as supply chain resiliency, sustainability, and geopolitical stability over cheap foreign labor. Although onshoring can entail higher costs from building new facilities and paying higher wages, the benefits of minimizing external risks and creating long-term efficiencies might outweigh keeping near-term costs low.</p><p> Business leaders should consider six key factors in deciding whether to adopt this model.</p><p> <strong>1. Labor costs.</strong> Global labor shortages and cost increases — including in China, where wages are rising — make it relatively more affordable to locate manufacturing in the US than it once was. China outpaced G20 countries in real wage growth from 2008 to 2022, according to the International Labour Organization&#39;s “ <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---travail/documents/publication/wcms_862569.pdf">Global Wage Report 2022-2023</a> .” China&#39;s real monthly wages in 2022 were equivalent to about 2.6 times their real 2008 value.</p><p> <strong>2. Advanced manufacturing.</strong> New automated “smart factories,” which require more engineers and skilled technicians but often far fewer workers overall, including traditional assembly-line workers, make the US labor pool attractive due to its well-educated workforce. Demand for robotics and the advanced technology that supports smart facilities is also surging. <a href="https://www.automate.org/news/robot-sales-in-north-america-have-strongest-year-ever-in-2021">North American robot sales set a record in 2021</a> , with 39,708 units sold, for $2 billion — a 14% increase over the previous high in 2017, and 28% more than the number sold in 2020, according to the Association for Advancing Automation. Plex&#39;s “ <a href="https://www.plex.com/sites/default/files/2022-05/10292_7th_State-of-Smart-Manufacturing_Supply-Chain.pdf">7th Annual State of Smart Manufacturing Report</a> ” notes that smart-manufacturing adoption rates increased 50% in 2022 year-over-year and 83% of manufacturers reported that smart factories are key to their future success.</p><p> <strong>3. Risk mitigation.</strong> The longer and more complex the supply chain, the greater the risks it faces, especially in terms of potential geopolitical instability. There is also renewed scrutiny by the federal government of its own reliance on other economies for critical public health and national defense supplies and components, such as personal protective equipment and semiconductors used in military vehicles and weaponry.</p><p> <strong>4. Sustainability</strong> With companies increasingly needing to meet sustainability goals and reduce their carbon footprints, localizing manufacturing offers several benefits. Constructing new, green facilities domestically can greatly reduce Scope 1 operating emissions from company-owned facilities and vehicles. The US has the world&#39;s largest sustainable-building market, with more than 511 million square feet <a href="https://www.usgbc.org/articles/top-10-countries-leed-demonstrate-green-building-truly-global-movement">certified under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design</a> rating system, compared with 180 million square feet in China. Plus, manufacturing a product closer to its end customer reduces emissions from transportation.</p><p> <strong>5. Stakeholder sentiment.</strong> Many companies&#39; stakeholders — including employees, corporate boards, industry organizations, government officials, and other companies connected within a supply chain — want executives to consider <a href="https://www.kearney.com/industry/consumer-retail/article/-/insights/the-2021-reshoring-index-the-tides-are-turning">localizing manufacturing operations</a> . Walmart — the largest retailer in the United States — vowed in 2021 to spend an additional $350 billion through 2030 on items made, grown, or assembled in the US, for example.</p><p> <strong>6. Transportation costs.</strong> When deciding whether to onshore manufacturing operations, executives should weigh the benefits of lower international labor and operating costs against the greater cost of ocean freight shipping. Trans-Pacific shipping costs increased fifteenfold in 2021 from January 2020 levels, and while transportation costs have declined as the economy has slowed, the supply chain volatility of the last few years is front of mind for managers.</p><p> The growth in US manufacturing-facility construction will continue as businesses see value in focusing on aspects of risk mitigation, using automation to offset labor challenges, and even building new facilities that emit less carbon. This reshoring renaissance is just beginning; it takes a few years to plan, permit, and acquire property for new-facility construction.</p><p></p><p> Now is the time for manufacturing executives to understand how their businesses fit into this renaissance and determine whether reshoring is right for them. Using the factors above as a framework, executives should consider these five key questions:</p><ol><li> Can a new facility for my products that uses advanced automation offset higher labor costs?</li><li> Does my current supply chain involve countries that present uncertainty due to geopolitics?</li><li> Will the carbon emissions from my company&#39;s current supply chain improve significantly if we build a new facility powered by renewable energy and localize production?</li><li> Are my stakeholders, especially customers, asking for domestically manufactured products?</li><li> Is the cost savings that comes with eliminating transoceanic shipping enough to balance out a likely increase in labor and new-facility construction costs?</li></ol><p> By seeking answers to questions such as these, the C-suite can better navigate their company&#39;s operations through a changing global production landscape.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/a-reshoring-renaissance-is-underway/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> What Managers Everywhere Must Know About Caste</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/what-managers-everywhere-must-know-about-caste/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/what-managers-everywhere-must-know-about-caste/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 11:00:32 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Hari Bapuji, Kamini Gupta, Snehanjali Chrispal, and Thomas Roulet. <p>Hari Bapuji ( <a href="https://twitter.com/haribapuji">@haribapuji</a> ) is a professor of management at the University of Melbourne, Australia, and a cofounder of <a href="https://air-collective.com/">Action to Improve Representation</a> .

In particular, issues of bias related to caste identity are making headlines around the world more frequently, and maintaining a healthy and productive culture will require leaders to be able to identify, prevent, and mitigate caste-based discrimination.</p><p> The caste system is a sociocultural-economic hierarchy that is pervasive in South Asia and the sizable South Asian diaspora all over the world. An individual&#39;s caste, inherited from their father, is determined solely by their birth and is unchangeable.</p><p> Numerous incidents of caste-based bias in Silicon Valley and elsewhere have been documented in the media. Studies conducted by academics, governments, and advocacy organizations have found that caste discrimination is prevalent in countries with significant South Asian populations, including the US, the UK, Canada, and Australia. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p></p><p> Within South Asia, which is home to a quarter of the world&#39;s population, caste bias can have disastrous consequences for individuals and organizations. For example, in June 2023, Vivek Raj, an employee of Indian fashion retailer Lifestyle International, died by suicide after recording a statement alleging <a href="https://www.thequint.com/south-india/vivek-raj-dalit-bengaluru-employee-lifestyle-dies-caste-discrimination">workplace caste discrimination</a> . In another case, Indian food delivery company Zomato faced public backlash for <a href="https://www.thequint.com/opinion/zomato-ad-kachra-lagaan-caste-marketing-teaching-moment">a 2023 advertisement</a> that reinforced derogatory caste stereotypes.</p><p> Multinational companies, such as Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Dell, and X (formerly Twitter), have recognized the importance of this issue by addressing caste-based discrimination in their corporate policies. Over 20 US universities have also included caste as a protected category in their policies, alongside race, gender, religion, and others.</p><p> In February 2023, the city of Seattle passed a law to outlaw caste discrimination. A similar bill was passed by California&#39;s legislature but was vetoed in October 2023 by its governor, who said that caste-based discrimination was already prohibited under the state&#39;s existing laws. These legislative efforts are in line with laws in countries that have caste systems, such as India, whose constitution outlaws caste discrimination and guarantees affirmative action for low-caste individuals in public education, employment, and political offices.</p><p> Managers everywhere need to understand these issues to help protect employees of South Asian origin from caste-based discrimination, bullying, incivility, and harassment, and to avoid the legal jeopardy that can result from such acts in the workplace. Managers could also improve the well-being and performance of individuals and their organizations by addressing the influence of caste on activities such as hiring, corporate social responsibility, information sharing, and networking. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a></p><h3> What Is Caste, and Why Is It Relevant?</h3><p> The fundamental assumption underlying the caste system is the notion that humans are created as unequal groups. This inequality is manifested by arbitrarily assigning different levels of purity and value to groups of people on an artificially defined hierarchy that gives some of them socially enforced rights and privileges, including the right to practice certain sets of occupations.</p><p></p><p> Caste is a complex system comprising thousands of groups and subgroups across religions. Broadly speaking, among those who practice Hinduism, Brahmins are at the top of the hierarchy. Their occupations have traditionally included religious duties and knowledge professions like recordkeeping, science, and education. Next in the hierarchy are Kshatriyas (who have traditionally occupied military roles), followed by Vysyas (businesspeople and traders) and Shudras (workers and laborers). Similar groups and subgroups are found among those practicing other religions. For instance, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4357934">among South Asian Muslims</a> , there are high castes (Ashraf, consisting of the Saiads, Sheikhs, Pathans, and Mughals) and low castes (Ajlaf, consisting of artisans and other workers). Among those who practice Sikhism, there are high-caste groups like the Jatts and Khatris. Similarly, <a href="https://scroll.in/article/876000/is-the-caste-system-deep-rooted-among-christians-in-india-a-kerala-bishop-stirs-up-a-hornets-nest">South Asian Christian congregations</a> have formed around distinct caste-based identities.</p><p> Dalits are outside of, and well below, the above groups. They are considered by those following the norms of the caste system as inferior and impure to the point of being subhuman and are relegated to occupations that involve activities like cleaning up excrement and disposing of the dead. Dalits, found across religions, are stigmatized as “ <a href="https://baws.in/books/baws/EN/Volume_05/pdf/14">untouchable</a> ” due to the historic, and still prevalent, practice of other castes avoiding physical contact and spatial proximity with them.</p><p> Adivasis (meaning first inhabitants or, more generally, indigenous peoples) are another group outside the caste system who have historically lived in forest or hill areas remote from urban locations and have often been <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02757206.2023.2204866">stigmatized as outlaws</a> .</p><p> Although individuals from each group today engage in occupations other than those assigned to them by caste, an individual&#39;s caste remains a significant determinant of the social and professional opportunities available to them. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><h3> How Caste Shapes Organizations</h3><p> Caste can shape an organization&#39;s internal environment in a few different ways. The talent pool from which a company hires might not have caste diversity due partly to differences in access to education and other resources that have persisted for generations. Caste determines access to capital and valuable business connections. Research has shown that family firms rely on caste-based networks to share knowledge and resources and exert control over markets and industries. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> Value chains that pass through South Asia replicate caste hierarchies such that high-caste individuals control important activities in the chain (such as design, research, and marketing) while low-caste individuals are relegated to activities valued less (such as product assembly and manufacturing). <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> The disproportionate control of institutions like educational, regulatory, legislative, and industry bodies by high-caste individuals also shapes the environment in which organizations operate.</p><p> Caste impacts the functioning of organizations as well. Recruiters and managers are likely to introduce biases into decisions about hiring and promotion, even at the level of the C-suite. Such biases might be explicit, such as through stereotyping individuals of certain caste backgrounds; or implicit, in the weight placed on markers such as speaking English with a familiar accent or observing certain social etiquette, even when they&#39;re not relevant to the job. Caste stereotypes can also affect the assignment of jobs, such as when high-caste individuals get promoted to managerial roles while low-caste individuals are relegated to low-end jobs, like data entry and coding in the <a href="https://scholarcommons.scu.edu/soc/67/">IT sector</a> or cleaning jobs across sectors.</p><p> Caste also tends to impact workplace interactions; for example, low-caste individuals might experience harassment, bullying, and incivility through behaviors like name-calling or exclusion, or be subjected to unsafe or demeaning work conditions. In one study on caste-based discrimination in the US, 25% of Dalit respondents reported having faced physical or verbal assault; 67% said they had been treated unfairly at work, and 60% reported experiencing caste-based derogatory comments and jokes. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><h3> Why Caste Poses Unique Challenges</h3><p> Caste predominantly operates indirectly, in the form of <em>identity</em> , <em>resources</em> , <em>networks</em> , and <em>culture</em> . A person&#39;s caste is not evident from their physiological features but can be inferred based on those four dimensions and shape their perceived merit. That perception of merit, rather than their caste, can then be claimed as the basis for decisions and actions affecting them. (See “The Indirect Markers of Caste.”) Here&#39;s how caste manifests in each of these dimensions.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> The Indirect Markers of Caste</h4><p class="caption"> Caste is often not directly apparent but can be ascertained based on an individual&#39;s identity, resources, networks, and culture. Together, these dimensions shape the perception of an individual&#39;s merit. Caste discrimination in workplaces is therefore not always explicit but can manifest as biases, stereotyping, and exclusionary practices that are difficult to recognize and address. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAG_Bapuji_RF_Winter_2024_Figure-1.png" alt="The Indirect Markers of Caste" /></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p></p><p> <strong>Identity.</strong> For many people from South Asia, caste is an inalienable part of one&#39;s identity. Inherited by birth, caste is seen as a symbol of one&#39;s ancestry. Caste identity is further reinforced through practices such as endogamy (marrying within one&#39;s caste), which is intended to maintain caste purity. Nearly 95% of marriages among Indians, including Indian-origin people in the US, occur within the same caste. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> Even a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-02-11/caste-system-of-india-and-south-asia-in-australia-dalit-rights/13135622">dating app for South Asians</a> that a US company developed allows users to filter for high-caste groups to find matches. Several other matchmaking service providers also facilitate marriages within castes.</p><p> An individual&#39;s caste identity is often reflected in their name. Many South Asian surnames (such as Bhatia, Kamble, Khan, Sharma, and Yadav) can be markers of caste. South Asians who do not have a caste-revealing name can face probing questions and exclusion, because caste identity shapes resource availability, networks, and cultural affinity.</p><p> <strong>Resources.</strong> Tangible resources, such as cash, assets, and investments, are unequally distributed along caste lines. Due to historical differences in rights and opportunities to own and accumulate assets among castes, such inequalities have compounded over generations. Research has found that in India, high-caste individuals are overly represented among the top 50% of wealthy individuals, accounting for 90% of the total wealth, while low-caste individuals have a much higher representation in the bottom 50% of individuals in terms of wealth. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a></p><p> Members of high-caste communities often have systemically greater access to economic capital and the advantages that come with it, such as the ability to attend elite private schools, which affords them greater access to knowledge professions. For instance, <a href="https://theprint.in/india/education/diversity-deficit-in-iims-iits-just-23-sts-and-157-scs-in-9640-faculty-posts/191246/">only 6% of the faculty at the Indian Institutes of Management</a> (premier business schools established by the Indian government) are from the low castes that account for <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/decoded/2021/06/29/measuring-caste-in-india/">the vast majority</a> (69%, according to one estimate) of the Indian population. A similar situation exists in other higher education institutions.</p><p> These differences in resources also affect who can emigrate from South Asia, with high-caste individuals finding it easier to migrate to and get settled in their host countries. For example, nearly 90% of US residents of Indian origin are from high castes. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p> <strong>Networks.</strong> Caste forms the basis of formal and informal social networks that facilitate economic transactions. Members of one caste are more likely to hire, do business with, and lend financial and nonfinancial support to people from similar caste backgrounds. The long-standing practice of marrying within a caste is one way these networks are formed.</p><p> Caste also shapes networks via other forms of spatial and social segregation. Studies have shown the existence of caste-based segregation in many cities in India due in part to historic factors that allowed each caste to reside in a specific part of the city or town and partly due to individuals&#39; preference to live next to people of their own caste. <a id="reflink10" class="reflink" href="#ref10">10</a> Social segregation occurs because of how caste norms shape interactions between castes. For instance, high-caste individuals adhering to such norms might avoid sharing space or a meal with Dalits.</p><p> Formal and informal caste-based associations exist both within South Asia and globally. Such associations can be explicitly caste-based, such as the Brahman Samaj of North America, which is open to all Brahmins, and Pravara Vedika, open only to certain Brahmin subgroups. Some associations represent themselves as broader “community” or linguistic/cultural organizations but are dominated by certain high castes. For example, the Telugu Association of North America is dominated by the Kamma, a high-caste group that actively supports its caste kin; the North American Telugu Association is dominated by the Reddy high-caste group; and the NRI Vasavi Association predominantly comprises members of the Vysya community. <a id="reflink11" class="reflink" href="#ref11">11</a></p><p> <strong>Culture.</strong> The dominant culture and norms of a particular South Asian religion or region are often defined in terms of the high-caste culture, even when it is practiced by a numerical minority of the population. These are most often reflected in people&#39;s religious and cultural practices, diets, and spoken languages, which vary by caste. For example, high-caste groups have a hegemony on certain forms of “classical” music and dance because low-caste groups have been excluded from practicing them. These arts are considered superior to folk music and dances practiced by low-caste individuals. Because high-caste individuals have migrated abroad at a higher rate than those from low castes, these cultural artifacts are often perceived as typical of South Asian culture.</p><p> The common misconception in high-income countries that <a href="https://www.livemint.com/Politics/dWUqT4epdPTHNAYuKYVThK/No-vegetarianism-is-not-growing-in-India.html">most Indians are vegetarian</a> is another example of high-caste culture defining the norm abroad. Several organizations and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0963662520903690">higher education institutions</a> in India adhere to vegetarian menus or have separate kitchens and dining spaces for vegetarians, leading to the segregation, stigmatization, and exclusion of low-caste individuals. Perceptions of South Asian culture are reinforced by the widespread representation of high-caste culture in popular media, including film, TV, and music. Because low-caste individuals do not always fit these profiles, non-South Asian managers might unwittingly treat lower-caste individuals differently as well.</p><h3> What Managers Can Do About Caste Discrimination</h3><p> Caste can be inferred from how it manifests as identity, resources, networks, and culture. For managers of South Asian origin, many signals are visible (such as last names or diet) or can be learned through social interactions (such as location of residence or ancestral occupations) and used in organizational decision-making. For example, research has shown that when the resumes of two candidates of the same profile are presented, high-caste individuals are selected over low-caste individuals based only on the status associated with their last names. <a id="reflink12" class="reflink" href="#ref12">12</a></p><p> However, non-South Asian managers can have difficulty discerning cultural cues to caste identity, and since it is a sensitive topic, inquiring about a person&#39;s caste is not appropriate. Low-caste individuals might choose to hide their caste to fit in and avoid exclusion. What, then, can managers do to create a caste-inclusive environment in their organizations?</p><p> To successfully address the challenges of caste, managers need to take a holistic approach that includes making caste a part of organizational diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies and practices, raising awareness through training, and addressing caste inequalities in societies where they are systemic. (See “How Organizations Can Address Caste.”) Managers should also take steps to preempt resistance as these efforts get underway.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> How Organizations Can Address Caste</h4><p class="caption"> Organizations can employ four approaches to creating a more caste-inclusive working environment for South Asian employees and partners. </p><table id="Chart#" class="chart-grouped-rows no-mobile"><thead><th style="border-right:hidden;border-bottom:hidden;background-color:#f0f0f0;"></th><th style="border-bottom:hidden;background-color:#f0f0f0;"></th></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:middle;"><p> <strong>Employee Policies and Codes of Conduct</strong></p></td><td><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Make caste a protected category alongside race, gender, and other aspects of identity.</p><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Include caste in codes of conduct, such as those for suppliers and communication.</p><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Employ equitable procedures for hiring, job assignments, and promotion.</p><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Put protocols in place to address complaints based on caste.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:middle;"><p> <strong>Training and Awareness</strong></p></td><td><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Provide diversity, equity, and inclusion training to identify caste discrimination, and support employees facing such discrimination.</p><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Coach managers on how to manage teams with employees of different castes, create inclusivity in teams, and handle caste-sensitive issues.</p><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Raise awareness of caste privilege and oppression and how they affect individual attitudes and behaviors.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:middle;"><p> <strong>Corporate Social Initiatives</strong></p></td><td><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Provide scholarships, coaching, and training for low-caste individuals where the company has operations, to overcome caste disadvantages and increase access opportunities.</p><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Create opportunities for low-caste individuals and groups to work as suppliers for the company.</p><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Make philanthropic support conditional on nongovernmental organizations and charities having caste-inclusive operations.</p></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:middle;"><p> <strong>Preempting Resistance</strong></p></td><td><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Understand the sources of resistance and the stakeholders involved.</p><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Address resistance through thoughtful and tactful communications to secure buy-in/participation from employees and other stakeholders.</p><p> <span class="blue">•</span> Design external communications to create broad-based support for caste inclusion. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><!--IMAGE FALLBACK FOR MOBILE BELOW --></p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAG_Bapuji_RF_Winter_2024_Table-1.png" alt="How Organizations Can Address Caste" class="no-desktop" /></p></article></aside></div><p> <strong>Explicitly identify caste as a protected category.</strong> DEI policies aim to promote inclusion for people of all identities, and a first step is to explicitly identify caste as a protected category. This recognition should cover all relevant company policies, including those related to the conduct of employees and suppliers, corporate communications, and employee hiring. Companies can explicitly state in their employee conduct policies that caste discrimination will not be tolerated, as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/caste-california-tech-giants-confront-ancient-indian-hierarchy-2022-08-15/">Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/cobc/2021/fy22-code-of-business-conduct-english.pdf">Cisco</a> have done, and implement protocols to comprehensively address reports of caste discrimination in the workplace. Companies can also include caste in their supplier code of conduct (as Canadian retailer <a href="https://www.loblaw.ca/en/supplier-code-of-conduct/">Loblaw</a> has done) to ensure that caste is a protected category throughout their value chains and that suppliers do not alienate or discriminate against low-caste individuals.</p><p></p><p> Policies around company communications and social media messaging should also include guidance on caste-inclusive language. For example, <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-in/dt/policies/social-media-policy.htm">Dell Technologies&#39;</a> global social media policy notes that caste-based hate speech is not tolerated. Companies that host user-generated content should expand their terms of service to prohibit caste-related discriminatory language and slurs, as <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards/hate-speech/">Meta</a> , X, and <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801939?hl=en-GB#:~:text=We%20remove%20content%20promoting%20violence,Disability">YouTube</a> have done, and moderate content that promotes caste indirectly. To develop such policies, organizations can partner with advocacy groups such as the International Dalit Solidarity Network, which has released <a href="https://idsn.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Caste-hate-speech-report-IDSN-2021.pdf">studies</a> on caste-based hate speech.</p><p> Existing practices for inclusive hiring can be adapted for caste with relative ease. Anonymizing applicants&#39; resumes can eliminate some signals of caste from the recruitment process. Employers can instruct hiring managers to disregard candidate characteristics that are not salient to the job, such as accent, etiquette, status of educational institutions attended, and family background. Companies, especially those with subsidiaries in South Asia, must proactively diversify their pool of applicants through targeted referrals or recruiting drives directed at low-caste candidates. These individuals account for the vast majority of the population, and failing to reach them means overlooking a huge talent pool. Structured and standardized interviews that more accurately evaluate candidates based on job-relevant skills can minimize bias at the interview stage and combat caste prejudices in hiring.</p><p> <strong>Increase awareness and training.</strong> Given that caste is an invisible inequality, raising awareness about it is one of the most important aspects of addressing caste discrimination. This training should be aimed at preventing caste discrimination, creating a caste-inclusive environment, and understanding the effects of caste privilege and oppression.</p><p></p><p> Training on caste needs to address the forms of discrimination that low-caste individuals commonly experience, including <a href="https://youtu.be/wJwkIxOpqZA?si=N67lxr5AWEEF2wRQ">slurs</a> , jokes, and <a href="https://dalitdiscrimination.tumblr.com/">derogatory comments</a> about them and their leaders. For example, low-caste individuals from India, which has caste-based affirmative action policies, are often at the receiving end of derogatory remarks, such as “quota candidate” or “reservation people,” that demean the use of these policies. The training should also extend to supporting employees who face such discrimination.</p><aside class="callout-info"><h4> Additional Resources</h4><ul><li> BR Ambedkar, <cite>Annihilation of Caste: The Annotated Critical Edition</cite> (New Delhi: Navayana, 2014).</li><li> “Testimonies of Practice of Caste in the USA,” Ambedkar King Study Circle, accessed Sept. 14, 2023, <a href="https://akscusa.org">https://akscusa.org</a> .</li><li> <cite>Blocked by Caste: Economic Discrimination in Modern India</cite> , eds.

This could include raising awareness about the many ways in which caste discrimination might appear and signaling the inappropriateness of caste-sensitive topics in workplace discussions. Further, without violating the privacy of individuals, companies can collect self-disclosed data on individuals&#39; caste or conduct caste audits (for example, using last names as caste indicators) to understand the caste homogeneity/diversity in their organizations and make employees aware of its implications for organizational functioning and performance.</p><p> <strong>Tackle caste discrimination at its root.</strong> Organizations can work on addressing caste not just internally but within the countries where the caste system is prevalent. Directly funding education and development initiatives in India, Nepal, or Pakistan, for example, can improve access to education for individuals from low-caste backgrounds. Mentoring individuals and groups from lower castes can also help minimize the barriers they face to enter an industry or a profession. Companies can make their support of nongovernmental organizations and charitable organizations (including community and cultural organizations) conditional on their being caste-inclusive in their operations.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Preempt resistance to addressing caste.</strong> Organizations that attempt to address caste are likely to face resistance. Google <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/02/google-caste-equality-labs-tanuja-gupta/">canceled a talk on caste</a> by Thenmozhi Soundararajan of Equality Labs in 2022 after some of its employees objected to it, and legislative efforts to address caste in the US have faced stiff resistance from <a href="https://www.fairobserver.com/world-news/us-news/caste-is-now-weaponized-against-indian-americans/">some Hindu lobbying groups</a> . These groups often argue that caste is an issue of the past or not an issue outside of South Asia and that policies protecting caste could be misused to discriminate against people of Hindu faith or Indian ethnicity. Understanding these sources of resistance to addressing caste can help organizations design ways to overcome them and secure buy-in from all employees and other stakeholders, including via external communications that encourage broad-based support for caste equity.</p><p> Caste is a complex and difficult issue, but addressing it is both an instrumental and moral imperative for organizations around the world. Doing so contributes to more equitable outcomes for individuals and affirms organizational commitment to cocreating a fairer and more equal society for all.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/what-managers-everywhere-must-know-about-caste/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
