Ransbotham：</strong>学习一门新语言是一个复杂的过程。一家应用程序公司希望人工智能能够帮助实现个性化、情境和动机。了解更多今天的节目。</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani：</strong>我是来自 Duolingo 的 Zan Gilani，你们正在听的是<cite>“我、我自己和 AI”</cite> 。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>欢迎来到<cite>《我、我自己和人工智能》</cite> ，这是一个关于商业人工智能的播客。每集我们都会向您介绍人工智能创新人士。我是 Sam Ransbotham，波士顿学院分析学教授。我还是<cite>《麻省理工学院斯隆管理评论》</cite>的人工智能和商业战略客座编辑。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我是 Shervin Khodabandeh，BCG 的高级合伙人，也是我们人工智能业务的领导者之一。自 2017 年以来， <cite>MIT SMR</cite>和 BCG 一直在人工智能方面进行研究和出版，采访了数百名从业者，并对数千家公司进行了调查，了解如何构建、部署和扩展人工智能能力，并真正改变组织的运营方式。</p><p><strong>萨姆·兰斯博瑟姆：</strong>欢迎。今天，我和 Shervin 与 Duolingo 首席产品经理 Zan Gilani 进行了交谈。我个人对今天的节目感到非常兴奋，因为 Duolingo 的处境非常有趣。在我们的很多节目中，我们最终都会讨论组织如何使用人工智能来增强或改进人类决策，这很棒。但 Duolingo 更进一步，专注于人类如何利用人工智能学习——大规模个性化教育，这对我很有吸引力。无论如何，这对我来说已经足够了。让我们听听Zan的说法。赞，感谢您加入我们。</p><p><strong>赞·吉拉尼：</strong>谢谢。很高兴来到这里。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong> Zan，首先，您能给我们介绍一下 Duolingo 和公司吗？您的角色是什么？</p><p><strong>赞·吉拉尼：</strong>当然。 Duolingo 基本上是一个教授语言的应用程序。我们目前教授 40 多种语言。顺便说一句，这些人中的大多数人都在学习英语，而我们的大多数学习者也在手机上学习，因此 Android 和 iOS 设备也是如此。我们是下载次数最多、使用最多的教育应用程序，无论是语言还是其他方面。我们拥有约 1600 万 DAU（日活跃用户）和 40 多万月活跃用户。我在公司工作刚刚八年，担任实验人工智能团队的首席产品经理。</p><p>我的主要职责是领导这个团队，致力于利用生成式人工智能更有效地进行教学，而且更广泛地说，我帮助公司在生成式人工智能方面取得成功。</p><p>我们现在专门针对生成式人工智能的主要用例之一是新的订阅层。 Duolingo 是一款免费增值产品。使命是提供尽可能最高质量的教育[并]让尽可能多的人[尽可能]获得教育；您所需要的只是互联网连接。所以我们有这个应用程序的免费版本，这是大多数人使用的。这非常好;公司的大多数人都花时间在这上面。然后我们有订阅级别。</p><p>我们最近刚刚推出了一个新的人工智能订阅层，名为 Duolingo Max，我也很高兴介绍其功能。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>所以实验性人工智能……它有点像你的研发实验室，如果你愿意的话？</p><p><strong>赞·吉拉尼：</strong>嗯，我想说的是，实际上公司一半以上的人都在广泛地从事研发工作——所有从事产品工作的人，以及致力于有效学习或教学的人，你可以认为是的，它作为一个实验室。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·霍达班德：</strong>太棒了。也许，对于我们的观众来说，您可以列出正在使用人工智能的各种用例或场所。当然，我的意思是，[除了]许多应用程序都具有的显而易见的个性化和游戏化功能。但请告诉我们人工智能是如何被使用的。</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani：</strong> Duolingo 自该应用程序问世以来就一直在使用人工智能，距今已有十年之久。事实上，它是由卡内基梅隆大学计算机科学教授 Luis von Ahn 和他当时的研究生 Severin Hacker 创立的。目前，它有多种不同的使用方式。例如，在增长方面，大量工作都用于优化通知。</p><p> Duolingo 与其他应用程序的不同之处在于，它确实试图帮助您保持动力。对于我们来说，从教学角度来说，我们认为学习语言最困难的事情实际上是保持动力，因为请记住：这是一件很难做到的事情。自己用手机来做这件事尤其困难——这确实是一件困难的事情。因此，通知以及收到通知的时间、通知所传达的信息确实会影响某人长期坚持使用通知的能力。因此，我们在通知的机器学习上投入了大量精力。</p><p>我们还在内容生成方面使用它，因此我们正在尝试创建有用的、合适的内容；我们也在那里使用它。然后，在该公司的一个独立部门中，即 Duolingo 英语测试，这基本上是学生上大学时必须参加的英语水平测试——有点像托福、托业或雅思的竞争对手；大多数美国人没有经历过这种情况——我们用它来检测作弊行为。我们还使用它在许多不同的地方生成内容。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>这很有趣。该应用程序的实际核心是教你语言，它的动态程度如何？当它适应一个人的学习方式时，它的个性化程度如何？</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani：</strong>个性化发挥了一定作用，但很多体验是由学习科学家和教育内容开发人员策划的。对于大多数人来说，您想要学习的顺序大致相似。例如，每个人都会先学习现在时，然后再学习其他复杂时态。但是，我们使用人工智能进行个性化的地方是专门用于“Birdbrain”的系统，这基本上是我们拥有的一个系统，它针对您将在练习中看到的问题的难度进行优化。</p><p>关于 Duolingo 需要注意的一件事是它是完全互动的。这意味着感觉就像一场游戏。所以每次你学习的时候，你都在回答一个小练习，然后你就会做对或做错。你总是会得到反馈。所以 Birdbrain 的重点是尝试提出一个金发姑娘级别的难度，因为基本上，如果某件事太难，你就会感到沮丧，并且会失去动力。如果某件事太简单了，它就会变得无聊，你就会失去动力。 Birdbrain 是我们特别用于个性化练习的东西之一。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong> Shervin，我认为有趣的一件事是，在描述他的产品时，我们只是认为语音合成、语音识别是理所当然的。这些在10年前都是前卫的东西，而现在昝，你连AI的应用都懒得提了。我认为这有点后退一步，看看现在的情况是正常的。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·霍达班德：</strong>是的。我认为你拥有的一件非常有趣而且可能是独一无二的事情就是你必须拥有的反馈循环的数量。我的意思是，通常，在许多其他应用程序中，当您考虑企业、零售、银行和电信等时，需要一些时间才能获得反馈。而且你几乎可以从很多人那里得到关于如此多的实验或小型实验的即时反馈。也许可以告诉我们更多关于学习速度和算法适应速度的信息。</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani：</strong>这里有一个很好的反映，那就是我们试图将一些有效学习的原则传递到产品本身中。然后，作为一家公司和一个组织，我们也试图按照这些原则运作。当您学习语言时，获得快速反馈确实很重要。但当你致力于产品本身时，这一点也很重要，而且，从很早的时候起，我们基本上就构建了自己的 A/B 测试基础设施，它是产品流程的核心；这是我们在 Duolingo 生产产品的核心组成部分。</p><p>在任何给定的时刻，您都会在非常细粒度的事物上运行数百个实验 - 按钮的位置[指示]页面上我们订阅价格的定价，您经典的面包和黄油实验 -还有巨大的新功能、新标签。基本上，如果这不是一个错误，那么我们可能正在以实验的形式运行它。我们在这方面做得非常非常好、非常老练。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong> Shervin 会翻白眼，因为我要讲一点学术知识，但你是体验式学习的典型案例。事实上，我将在这里给大家介绍一下你们的<a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/">Max 产品</a>，因为我认为其中有两个非常令人兴奋的部分。有角色扮演，它涉及体验式学习的学术、具体经验部分，然后是解释我的答案，这是一种反思性观察和批评。请告诉我们一些关于这两者的信息以及它们如何与学习成果联系起来。</p><p><strong>赞·吉拉尼：</strong>当然。我认为讨论一下在添加这两个功能之前我们所处的位置是有用的。在教学上，Duolingo 一直致力于隐性学习，因此无需明确告诉您“这就是您要学习的内容，这就是它的运作方式”。这就是体验的本质，因为我们认为当你这样做时，它会更加自动化。人们也会因为复杂的语法表等而变得非常沮丧和推迟。然后，第二个是你正在应用程序上学习，并且你正在做这种互动的事情 - 这些几乎是游戏般的练习。</p><p>缺失或限制的两件事是，第一，有些人确实想要解释，如果以正确的数量和方式进行解释，这可能会非常高效和有效。因此，“解释我的答案”是该问题的解决方案，而“解释我的答案”的好处确实只有在现代大型语言模型的帮助下才能发挥作用，即大型语言模型非常擅长为您所犯的错误提供通俗易懂的简明解释。制作。即使对于老师来说，在不使用行话且不花钱的情况下尝试做到这一点也确实很困难。因此，我们可以通过“解释我的答案”很好地做到这一点。它可以给你后续的插图，它可以给你例子——所有这些都可以构成大型语言模型，顺便说一句，对任何试图自学任何东西的人来说都是有好处的。对我来说，这改变了我的生活。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>或者任何想要发表演讲的人。</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani：</strong>或者任何想要发表演讲的人，是的。第二个，角色扮演，最终对大多数人来说，语言学习不是一项学术活动。他们试图将其用作现实世界中的一种技能，而这本身就是一种技能。那么如何赋予人们实践这一能力的能力呢？你如何让他们模拟这个？聊天机器人正是做到这一点的一种方法，因为现在，你所拥有的东西可以在你所处的难度级别上与你交谈，具有无限的耐心，然后也可以在事后真正给你反馈。</p><p>即使人们可以接触到以英语为母语的人（他们通常不会这样做），您仍然需要一个具有无限耐心并且真正能够理解您正在寻找的内容的以英语为母语的人。所以 Roleplay 基本上是在尝试在应用程序中提供这种体验，而不是仅仅拥有像 ChatGPT 这样的文本界面，然后让你来回说话。基本上，我们所做的就是将对话或场景分解为这些小规模的体验，你正在与一个聊天机器人交谈，他将成为咖啡师或你要借东西的朋友，然后你尝试经历一个非常具体、短暂的经历。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>山姆，我有一个问题要问你，因为山姆，如你所知，是一位杰出的教授，他一直在教人们——包括像我这样不在他班上的人——很多东西。所以我的问题，萨姆，是......不过，严肃地说，在你看来，什么才是一个好老师？</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>实际上，Zan 突然提到了几件事，这就是为什么我在他的谈话中感到有些内疚的部分原因。他所说的无限耐心——这非常重要，但也非常困难。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>不切实际。</p><p><strong>萨姆·兰斯博瑟姆：</strong>是的。在人们所在的地方与他们见面是我们教育中面临的一个基本问题。我的意思是，我坐在一个有 35、40 人的房间前面，他们并不相同。就地与人见面正是赞所说的。所以，是的，你必须很好地了解材料，你必须让人们参与进来，但你也必须跟踪人们在哪里以及他们知道什么——呈现不太容易也不太难的东西——我非常被这个模型所吸引。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>那么，下一步是什么？</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>嗯，是的，这正是我要去的地方。下一步是什么？我的意思是，如果我们可以用语言做到这一点，我们还能用什么来做到这一点？它在哪里起作用？</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我的意思只是为了语言。因此，与人会面，对学生及其进步有很好的了解，然后能够进行角色扮演和大量的体验式学习，并能够以更通俗易懂的方式和更深入的方式进行解释和指导。这样你就可以重复它，而我不必急于记笔记。我的意思是，所有这些事情，对吧？缺什么？我听到这个，听起来比普通老师要好。但在你看来，在赞看来，这位完美的老师还缺少什么？</p><p><strong>赞·吉拉尼：</strong>我认为，由于多种原因，我们距离成为完美老师还有非常非常非常长的路要走。我还想说，我们不相信，而且我当然不相信，到最后，你所需要的只是一个聊天界面，大多数人将能够真正做到他们想要的一切努力学习。因此，要回答第一部分关于为什么我们远离老师的问题，我认为其中一些是未知的，但在学习时与另一个人建立关系确实会产生影响。</p><p>学习新东西有情感的一部分，也有一种人际关系，这可以很简单，比如你去参加辅导预约，因为你不想让你的老师失望，也可以是这样一个事实：导师可以真正地关注他们的面部表情、他们声音的节奏、他们可以讲述的插图，以及他们与自己生活的联系方式。</p><p>所以说，我们距离还很远。然后，当谈到“嘿，为什么聊天机器人不能教你一切？”对于大多数人来说，你还是得有组织性，而有组织性是相当累人的。例如，决定接下来吃什么通常是您花费所有时间做的事情，或者决定看什么电影。同样，决定接下来要学什么也很困难。因此，产品方面的人员必须找出正确的学习顺序。</p><p>同样，有创造力也很累人。对于现实生活中的导师来说，扮演很多不同的角色并进行大量的角色扮演确实很困难。那么你需要一位导师，他也是一位出色的演员。人工智能让你能够通过虚拟老师来做到这一点，但即便如此，我们也不希望学习者必须一直自己想出这些场景。</p><p>我要提到的最后两件事是学习也是多感官的。这也是上下文相关的。理想情况下，您想要的是某种学习和情境发生，而不仅仅是聊天机器人。</p><p>最后要提到的是，人们确实需要一种进步感，才能坚持学习一门语言，因为实际的进步是如此缓慢且渐进，真的很难看到。所以你要做的是，你必须向人们展示正在填满的进度条，并且你必须检查。我认为你可能有一些方法可以在导师体验中模拟这一点，但这些是其中的一些我认为我们也关心在这之外构建体验并构建一条你可以走的路，以及所有其他使 Duolingo 成为现实的事情。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong> Zan，我想回到你正在谈论的一件我非常感兴趣的事情，[这]就是弄清楚你接下来需要学习什么的想法。我的意思是，从历史上看，我上的每一堂语言课，我们都会有一本书，然后从第一章转到第二章。有人在某个地方真正思考了这一切的顺序。</p><p>但与此同时，我不知道这对所有学生来说一定是最佳的。我们会考虑推荐系统和 Netflix，或者音乐；你知道，我们已经和 Spotify 谈过，Shervin。这似乎是一个很好的机会。我现在可以学到的最能带来改变的一件事是什么？或者我不知道的一件事是什么阻止我打开下一部分？这似乎是一个巨大的机会。</p><p><strong>赞·吉拉尼：</strong>是的。我也会把它分成两部分。其中之一就是，一般来说，什么是有效的学习顺序，什么是有效的教学顺序？它对于那些已经具备一定熟练程度的人特别有用，也就是大多数试图在 Duolingo 中学习语言的人，尤其是英语学习者，因为他们已经在学校以某种方式做到了这一点，而且他们的知识是零散的，正如我们喜欢说的。</p><p>在这些情况下，由于经历不同，每个人的顺序会完全不同。第二个方面是你在需要更多关注的时刻特别遇到麻烦的事情。也许你只是在某个特定概念上犯了更多错误。也许问题出在动词变形上，或者也许你只是不知道如何很好地介绍自己。因此，我们有机会实际上花更多的时间在这部分体验上。</p><p>并不是说每门课程都是为一个独特的学生定制的，而是你的注意力和焦点放在哪里，你投入的数量以及你做的顺序都是由某种导师指导的。我会说这是一件很难做到的事情。这确实是一件很难做到的事情。我们不在那里，但这当然是梦想的一部分。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>所以这个节目是<cite>我、我自己和人工智能</cite>，我们对你和你自己了解不多。所以也许可以告诉我们一些你的背景——你是如何最终担任这个角色的，以及这段旅程是怎样的。</p><p><strong>赞·吉拉尼：</strong>是的。我应该回溯到多远？我是从祖父母开始吗？父母？我？</p><p><strong>萨姆·兰斯博瑟姆：</strong>由你决定。</p><p><strong>赞·吉拉尼：</strong>好的。我将跳过扩展的传记。我在巴基斯坦卡拉奇长大。那是我长大的地方，我来到美国读本科。事实上，我在大学里学习了政治学和东亚研究，因为，第一，我对语言感兴趣，所以我选了中文，当我在大学学习语言时，最令人兴奋的事情之一就是总是尝试使用工具来看看能做什么。是否有效。</p><p>所以，正是对语言和技术的兴趣让我选择了 Duolingo。事实上，我开始从事营销是因为我之前做过一些营销和广告实习。当时，Duolingo 大约有 50 名员工，我们从只有一个开发应用程序的团队发展到拥有致力于盈利、学习和成长的团队。因此，我开始以营销人员的身份致力于增长，然后，大约一年半后，我转而担任产品经理。在 Duolingo 的大部分时间里，我都致力于增长，也就是说用户保留，无论是新用户还是现有用户，从而扩大我们在亚洲的影响力；那太有趣了。像这样的东西。动机以及什么能够激发人们的积极性以及什么能够让他们保持积极性一直是我的兴趣所在。</p><p>然后，去年年底我们开始以人工智能为重点并领导这个实验性人工智能团队，因为基本上我们最终与 OpenAI 合作推出了 GPT-4。我们最终建立这种合作伙伴关系的原因实际上是因为我认识 OpenAI 上 GPT-4 发布的产品经理，当我们聚在一起时，我们很快意识到 Duolingo 是该发布的完美用例，因为对于该发布，他们真正想要的是表明公司实际上正在利用这一点来改变他们的业务，这些公司也是试图为世界做好事等等。所以我们，作为一家公司，基于这种伙伴关系并获得访问权很早就转向了 GPT-4，改变了一系列优先事项并开始真正倾向于人工智能，其中之一就是组建了一个尝试研究实验性功能的团队。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>非常令人兴奋。事实上，从动机的角度来看，你会很高兴知道我儿子为他的西班牙语天赋感到非常自豪，所以……</p><p><strong>赞·吉拉尼：</strong>太棒了。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>我们有一个环节会问你一系列问题，这些问题都是连珠炮般的；说出你想到的第一件事。在人工智能领域，你最自豪的时刻是什么？</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani：</strong>作为一家公司，我们推出 Duolingo Max 非常令人兴奋，并且为新的教学时代铺平了道路。实际上，它是由 Edwin Bodge 和 Bill Peterson 领导的 Duolingo Max 团队创建的，非常令人兴奋。</p><p>我个人想说，实际上，我的团队一直在开发的第一个产品实际上是——实验正在上线。你可以把它想象成用于阅读的 TikTok，但它的所有内容都是由 GPT-4 生成的。它为您提供了广泛的内容，因为人们需要多种不同类型的阅读练习，而且它还需要听力。所以我很高兴看到事情进展如何。</p><p><strong>萨姆·兰斯博瑟姆：</strong>非常酷。您对人工智能有何担忧？</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani：</strong>我总体上非常乐观，但我认为让我担心的是变化的速度太快以至于会破坏稳定。作为一个社会，我们的目标是确保我们能够在面对非常非常快速的变化时保持稳定，因为实际上快速变化正是我们想要的。我们希望快速取得进展，但又不产生任何破坏稳定的影响。这就是恐惧。我认为这是一个可以解决的问题，但这就是恐惧。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>您最喜欢的不涉及技术的活动是什么？</p><p><strong>赞·吉拉尼：</strong>我经常踢足球。有趣的是，事实证明这涉及到技术，但是，是的，我踢了很多足球。这是我最喜欢做的活动之一。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>那么，您想要的第一份职业是什么？政治科学，我想你提到过。当你还是个孩子的时候，你长大后想做什么？</p><p><strong>赞·吉拉尼：</strong>很多不同的事情。从来没有一个答案。我想成为一名作家、记者、板球运动员——一名板球运动员——并从事国际发展工作；我什至想成为一名建筑师。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>你在那里管理桌子。</p><p><strong>赞·吉拉尼：</strong>是的，有很多不同的事情。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>您对人工智能最大的愿望是什么？您希望我们能从中得到什么？</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani：</strong>我认为人工智能是我们能够创造最快进步的方式，这里的“进步”我指的是尽可能多的人[尽可能]过着他们选择的生活——他们是芊芊。我认为这是最高层次的目标，这就是大多数人生命的意义。我很高兴能成为这项努力的一部分。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>嗯，听起来你是的。 Zan，感谢您抽出时间与我们交谈。我真诚地觉得，对于我们人类如何变得更好来说，这是一个非常不同且令人兴奋的机会。听起来 Duolingo 正在做很多这样的事情。感谢您加入我们。</p><p><strong>赞·吉拉尼：</strong>非常感谢。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>感谢您加入我们。下次，Sam 和我将与 Pinterest

But that&#39;s not enough.</p><p> Our research suggests that successfully combating counterfeits requires the attention of a broad collection of organizational functions. It works best with a multilayered strategy encompassing diverse methods and engaging the entire organization and its partners.</p><p></p><p> We recommend that organizations tackle counterfeiting with a cohesive plan for identifying, containing, and preventing it. This comprehensive process means routinely keeping tabs on contract manufacturers and charting how products move through the supply chain. It includes scoping out what is for sale in consumer markets, deploying covert markings, reviewing warranty claims, educating customers, and partnering with key agencies and competitors.</p><h3> Conventional Tactics Aren&#39;t Working</h3><p> Companies that pay any attention to counterfeiting have traditionally relied on a brand security function to track down criminal activity. These teams often detect counterfeiting using tactics such as applying covert and overt markings on legitimate products, attaching RFID tags that track product locations, and using serialization combined with blockchain to create transaction records that are resistant to tampering. For example, barcodes compliant with the GS1 Global Traceability Standard are used to track COVID-19 vaccines. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> For many organizations, though, these tactics are not enough.</p><p> Counterfeiting and illegal diversion of product remains pervasive: Our 2018 survey of 21 supply chain executives revealed that nearly half had an issue that was ongoing or had experienced an incident in the previous year. More than 70% said they&#39;d had an incident in the previous five years. (See “The Research.”) One executive told us that his company discovered that the equivalent of an entire factory&#39;s monthly production of its products was being sent into black markets, largely due to diversion from one of its own suppliers.</p><p> Counterfeiting has grown into a problem that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says was worth $464 billion in 2019, or 2.5% of world trade. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> It was once thought that counterfeiters went after only high-value or luxury items such as pharmaceuticals, designer handbags, or perfume. But now the marketplace is full of fake footwear, pesticides, cosmetics, toys, automotive parts, and medical equipment. Counterfeiters are targeting any industry and any product line where there is an easy profit to be made.</p><p> While companies may never completely eliminate bad actors from copying products or diverting goods from authorized channels, they can significantly reduce counterfeiters&#39; market penetration and restore lost revenue. Successful approaches may involve cutting off counterfeiters&#39; access to markets, eliminating their supply of unauthorized goods, or making a product more difficult to copy. Here, we&#39;ll go into detail on the three activities that a robust action plan comprises: identification, containment, and prevention.</p><h3> Identification: Gain Insight Into the Extent and Nature of the Problem</h3><p> Getting a baseline on the severity of the counterfeiting problem is a critical first step. As the size of the issue becomes clear, the potential return on investment in shutting it down also comes into view. This can help establish performance metrics for the anti-counterfeiting team that can be aligned with business objectives and outcomes. Examples of metrics include the dollar amount or percentage of revenue lost annually due to illegal product trade, total top-line revenues recovered (dollars that were previously unknowingly lost to counterfeit sales), and the number of confirmed incidents of illicit trade, counterfeiting, diversion, and tampering.</p><p> <strong>Create a cross-functional brand security team.</strong> Developing realistic measures of the current problem often requires an intensive investigation that involves applying market channel analyses that explore multiple sources of sales data and other information from both inside and outside the organization. To be effective, a brand security team should include participants from sales, marketing, operations, purchasing, logistics, finance, and accounting, as well as core brand security functions. Such teams are typically led by a global brand protection officer who in many cases has a law enforcement background and usually reports to the chief operating officer.</p><p> <strong>Examine internal and market data to flush out suspicious activity.</strong> Companies can struggle to find, much less measure, counterfeiting activity, given that clues are usually buried in data about sales, warranties, returns, and other product metrics. Unless someone is looking for it, unusual activity can easily go unnoticed.</p><p> A good first step is to start by looking at what&#39;s being sold online. E-commerce has emerged as a perfect channel to fuel the counterfeit goods industry. Consumers may unwittingly buy products from online retailers that don&#39;t verify the source of the products on their platform and whether they are legitimate. Despite counterfeit sites being shut down regularly by Amazon (and, in China, Alibaba), operators trading in fake goods regularly open up again under a different name the next day. Amazon reported that it blocked 10 billion fake listings and destroyed 2 million counterfeit products in 2020 alone. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p> Since e-commerce sites are frequently a counterfeiter&#39;s primary source of sales, companies can begin by investigating where their products — either genuine or fake — are being sold online. Looking for common attributes of counterfeiter websites can narrow down the pool of suspicious activity. For instance, a company might find four different sellers on Amazon offering an exact copy of its handbag, listing the same details and even photos. An indicator of potential counterfeiters might include spelling or grammatical errors, blurry photos, or other details that don&#39;t look quite right.</p><p> Another important data source is warranty returns. When a consumer sends a product back because it is defective (and counterfeits often are), detective work can track down where it was purchased and how. This can lead to the origin of market entry for counterfeit goods and a starting point to find their downstream source. A global medical products company we looked at hired a global brand protection officer who examined warranty and returns data, field service requests, and sales data. In his first 100 days, he found 1,000 confirmed incidents of illicit trade, counterfeiting, diversion, and tampering. This amounted to $1.4 billion — 2% of revenue — lost annually to illegal product trade.</p><p> Estimating counterfeit sales is a difficult but essential task: Companies must establish a baseline against which to gauge the effects of anti-counterfeit measures. Having an accurate understanding of the scope of the problem is a prerequisite for deciding how much to invest and what ROI to expect from anti-counterfeiting measures. In many cases, business decision makers are unaware of the extent to which their revenue and reputation are in jeopardy.</p><p> <strong>Map the supply and distribution chain.</strong> Many companies are surprised to learn that bad actors are active within their own supply chains. Overproduction, black-market sales, and unauthorized distribution are common sources of leakage that may result in a product, or copies of it, being sold through channels that a company knows nothing about. That&#39;s why an important early step is to identify the manufacturing and distribution channels through which the company&#39;s products travel.</p><p></p><p> The brand owner at a large global apparel company told us that he had heard through his distributor network that the brand was being sold in Mexico even though the company had no authorized retail presence there. To track where these products were coming from, the director hunted down bills of lading and shipping records for the ocean freight shipments that were going to Mexico. The paper trail showed that the goods were shipped from a port in Israel — by the same authorized manufacturer that was producing the company&#39;s branded product in the United States. The apparel company eventually tracked down the clothes, which were genuine products, made under the same specifications and from the same materials, but were being illicitly distributed outside of the contractual agreement between the parties. When the apparel company set up a global brand security function and mapped its entire supply network, it found that similar cases of product diversion were occurring all over the world.</p><p> Analyzing how much is being spent on raw materials in the upstream supply chains is a good place to start mapping a supply base. Procurement can reach out to the accounting team to track all third-party purchases being made on the company&#39;s behalf (a document generally known as a <em>spend analysis</em> ). If a supplier is buying more raw materials and is operating at a higher production level than what the company is ordering, this is a telltale sign that the additional product may be moving into the black market. This requires full visibility into the supply chain, beyond just Tier 1 suppliers (which is increasingly important for other reasons, in particular to manage risk related to labor or environmental violations). Some suppliers may be reluctant to disclose their upstream suppliers for competitive reasons but can be reassured that the query is for security purposes and not an attempt to cut them out of the chain.</p><p></p><h3> Containment: Limit the Problem&#39;s Spread</h3><p> With a dedicated team in place, an initial sense of the problem&#39;s scope, and an understanding of the particular counterfeiting and diversion risks that it&#39;s most vulnerable to, a company can begin to manage the problem systematically in order to contain it.</p><p> <strong>Analyze product segments.</strong> One of the key tasks for the investigation team is segmenting products by channel, margin, volume, and risk of counterfeit activity. This ensures that the team&#39;s attention is being directed toward the most vulnerable market channels first.</p><p> In many cases, a current-state analysis of a company&#39;s supply and distribution processes helps reveal a common set of product segments that counterfeiters go after. In particular, our research found that product lines with high complexity based on the variety of finished products, level of finished-product customization, geographical span of suppliers, number of tiers in the supply chain, predictability of demand, and variation in manufacturing volumes. Examples of items in this category include aircraft and automotive replacement parts, toys, high-end apparel, branded pharmaceutical products, and consumer electronics. Counterfeiters are more likely to opportunistically target product segments characterized by a greater level of complexity and exploit this complexity to their advantage.</p><p> We interviewed executives at a biotech manufacturer who knew that counterfeit products were showing up in the market but did not know the source. The brand protection team started by segmenting products into those that were big targets for counterfeiters (in this case, high-margin items) and analyzing data to estimate the number of incidents per brand. The team — formed through a close collaboration among franchises, brand owners, and regional sales managers — then rolled out a plan to franchise partners and country business units. This established brand protection priorities by product line and provided a system to track customer-reported incidents by brand and conduct data reviews every six months.</p><p> At the same time, analysts began collecting market intelligence on supply chain vulnerabilities, including potential logistics disruptions and the threat of regulatory intervention, that posed significant risks for business plans and growth targets by region. Cumulatively, these efforts helped the manufacturer prioritize those businesses and regions where brand protection could best safeguard market revenue from sudden disruptions. In the process, the team identified a significant counterfeit and diversion activity affecting a blockbuster infusion drug that was putting many patients at risk. The company said it was able to eventually reduce the number of incidents from 100 per year to zero. This required persistent efforts to deduce the source of each incident through detailed analysis and the introduction of countermeasures — including sending a message to counterfeiters warning that they would be pursued, in hopes of convincing them to go look for an easier target.</p><p> This kind of analysis begins with identifying an initial clue and following the thread of activity. The initial problem may manifest itself as a minor issue such as a customer warranty problem, a dealer who seems to be ordering too many replacement parts, or a spate of customer returns on a particular brand of product. Any of these issues may be a hint that leads to a channel of counterfeiting activity.</p><p> <strong>Start with e-commerce sites, and reach out to customs and other authorities.</strong> A team of analysts should be hunting down in-the-open counterfeit operations on e-commerce sites on an ongoing basis and reporting them to the platform operator, such as Amazon, and to law enforcement. At the very least, this introduces more friction into some bad actors&#39; businesses to slow them down.</p><p> Counterfeit products almost always have to cross borders and pass through transshipment points and customs inspections overseen by law enforcement entities. These are critical players in the supply chain, and organizations must think of them as partners in the battle against revenue loss and intellectual property theft. These relationships are particularly important in highly regulated environments, such as pharmaceuticals, food, aerospace, and automotive manufacturing, where counterfeit products can endanger their users.</p><p> An official with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) told us that it can be challenging to get brand owners to understand the CBP&#39;s process and play their part in helping the agency fight the problem. “We are in the field, inspecting containers,” he said. “If a CBP officer opens a container and sees something that looks suspicious, they will first look in our internal database of registered brands. If the officer doesn&#39;t see anything, there is nothing they can do.” Registering brands with the CBP and US Patent and Trademark Office is a critical step in containing counterfeiting.</p><p> <strong>Educate (and warn) customers.</strong> It is imperative that consumers are educated about the possibility and risks of buying fake goods. Companies should make customers aware, through brand marketing, that if they buy from an unverified online third-party seller, they bear the risk of not having the product covered by warranty — or, worse yet, having it fail with dire consequences. One company we know of began adding a statement on its Amazon website warning that products returned to it that were not licensed would not be under warranty. Companies should also emphasize to customers the importance of registering the product serial number for warranty purposes, which protects them if a legitimate product they&#39;ve purchased turns out to be flawed or faulty. If a customer tries to register the serial number for a counterfeit product, it will show up as an error and alert the brand security team to a problem.</p><h3> Prevention: Stop Future Counterfeit Ops Before They Start</h3><p> Once an organization discovers how the spread of counterfeit products in its market channels works and has taken initial steps to contain the problem, it must continue to monitor criminal activity and establish strong preventive measures. There are important roles for numerous functions in the company to play at this stage.</p><p> <strong>Product packaging experts should explore digital tracing technology.</strong> Features in current tracing technologies offer positive product authentication, can indicate tampering, can increase the difficulty of replication, and permit product tracking and tracing. Secure markings — which use a variety of packaging, blockchain, and serial marking technologies — are one method for tracking products. Many industries are working with standards organizations like ASTM International or GS1 to develop common methods for verifying products. This can help avoid the problem where counterfeiters try to copy not just the product but the digital marking, too.</p><p> In the biotech example mentioned previously, the brand protection team worked with the business to identify covert and overt authentication capabilities, which created automatic alerts when counterfeit products were being sold through market channels. The team also created a comprehensive customer communication plan using web advertisements, targeted email and Twitter campaigns, and retailer alerts about the dangers of buying from unauthorized sources. The campaign created awareness in the company&#39;s sales partner network and set the stage to identify where new counterfeit sales were occurring.</p><p> <strong>Quality assurance should review data to track down instances of product problems and returns.</strong> QA can create triggers in its data collection processes that flag potential illegitimate activities. We know of a company that noticed an uptick in its product returns, discovered that the products were not legitimate, and tracked them down to the point of sale — which revealed the source of the counterfeiting.</p><p> <strong>Supply management should step up efforts to audit suppliers.</strong> It can be particularly fruitful to track overproduction by suppliers, as well as how they dispose of products that don&#39;t conform to quality standards — products that can end up moving through black market channels and thus avoiding trade compliance policies. One large apparel company began monitoring the inventory levels within its supplier&#39;s facilities and noticed that the supplier&#39;s inbound raw-material inventories were much greater than the volume of finished goods it was shipping to the company. This was an indication that product was being produced and sold elsewhere through other channels.</p><p> <strong>Logistics should map supply routes to document compliance on the part of transportation providers.</strong> This can help ensure chain of custody along global supply chains, particularly at handoff points such as ports, warehouses, and distribution centers. Companies with multitier distributor channels should document every logistics handoff and conduct random audits to determine whether there are proper security personnel and locked gates at all distribution centers.</p><p> <strong>Human resources might want to consider monitoring employees who are dealing directly with targeted products.</strong> This may include conducting background checks, as well as increasing training to enhance staff awareness. If there is a high level of missing inventory or a sudden increase or drop in product sales, investigations may be required.</p><p> <strong>Aftermarket sales should track warranty claims and parts sales to identify product-quality problems.</strong> As with the quality assurance team, those at the front line of aftermarket sales are in a position to learn that products aren&#39;t performing as expected, which, again, may indicate that counterfeits are entering market channels. For example, a large retailer made the decision to limit its distribution channels and authorized resellers, recognizing the high potential for counterfeit products in these particular sales channels, especially e-commerce.</p><p></p><p></p><p> Counterfeiting and product diversion are not crimes that a single organization can combat. They require the diligence of brands, retailers, packaging companies, and logistics businesses. This is a rare instance where joining with competitors can yield important insights. Companies should consider joining a consortium and partnering with industry counterparts. Industry-specific groups include the Automotive Anti-Counterfeiting Council for vehicle manufacturers and Rx-360 for pharmaceutical companies. Members of React, a large anti-counterfeiting network, include Marvel Entertainment, Mattel, Pfizer, Philips, Prada, and Timberland.</p><p> Counterfeiting is also not just a private-sector supply chain problem. Labor and human rights advocates, consumer education agencies, customs agents, federal and state law enforcement agencies, local police, and consumers of counterfeit products all have an interest and role in ferreting out unauthorized activity. While counterfeiting and product diversion cannot be eliminated, dedicated efforts can curtail both significantly.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/taming-the-counterfeiting-epidemic/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Dismantle Career Roadblocks for More Equitable Outcomes</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/dismantle-career-roadblocks-for-more-equitable-outcomes/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/dismantle-career-roadblocks-for-more-equitable-outcomes/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 11:00:51 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Haig R.

Women and people of color continue to face obstacles advancing to more senior roles and are frequently not positioned to succeed in the same ways as their White male counterparts.</p><p> That was the message from Haig R. Nalbantian, cofounder and coleader of the Workforce Sciences Institute, during <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/series/work-23-the-big-shift/">Work/23</a> , an <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> symposium held in May 2023. Nalbantian helps organizations apply evidence-based, empirical methods to strengthen their DEI efforts and retention strategies and asserts that “the surging use of analytics in the HR domain to inform work and workforce management” is a big part of the future of work.</p><p></p><p> While talent and drive are important in shaping careers, situational factors profoundly affect what happens to employees at work. They include employees&#39; access to “accelerator” roles, such as customer-facing jobs; how employees navigate flexible work arrangements, such as part-time status; and employees&#39; reporting relationships, such as whether they report to higher-level or high-performing supervisors. Nalbantian noted that these easy-to-identify circumstances, which he called <em>explained differences</em> , are prevalent.</p><p></p><p> Many organizations also have pervasive and sizable <em>unexplained disparities</em> regarding who gets chosen for promotions. Nalbantian said that in both his own studies and others, “women are actually more likely to be highly rated” by their managers at elite, large employers — all things being equal — “but in the majority of companies, they&#39;re less likely to be promoted.”</p><p> He said it is critical that companies address the explained differences and explore the unexplained disparities.</p><p> Nalbantian wasn&#39;t able to get to all of the questions from attendees during the event, so he answers some of them below. (Questions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity.)</p><h6> Does your research address intersectionality in its analysis? You talked about women and people of color, but what about women of color and other people with multiple intersecting minority identities?</h6><p> In many of the client cases covered in my study, we did indeed examine intersectionality directly. We&#39;ve done this quite a bit in larger US-based organizations that have adequate populations of these demographic groups for modeling purposes.</p><p> One of the areas of particular interest to client organizations is intersectionality with respect to reporting relationships. That is, do the specific demographics of one&#39;s supervisor affect whether the employee is promoted, is highly rated, or gets higher pay increases? For example, do White male supervisors treat Black female reports worse than White male or White female reports? Do White female supervisors help the prospects of their female reports, regardless of color?</p><p> I can say that there are few regularities in these results — certainly far less than the results I&#39;ve reported with respect to performance ratings, roles, supervisor performance and level, and flexible working.</p><p></p><h6> Has this research mapped across socioeconomic status as an intersectional influence?</h6><p> Unfortunately, we&#39;ve had much more limited data on socioeconomic factors, in part because most of our clients focus these studies on their salaried populations, ignoring their hourly workers. This concerns me, as it reveals a tendency to discount front-line workers. I try to remind organizations that what happens in their front-line ranks can have a major impact on business results. I&#39;ve seen and documented this in client assignments. Still, the tendency of organizations is to prioritize their salaried employees — professionals, managers, and executives.</p><h6> You mentioned that being younger than comparable peers is an attribute favorable to success. Can you elaborate more on what your studies have found regarding age inequalities?</h6><p> The negative impact of age is close to universal among our analytical findings with client organizations. The simple fact is that once an employee gets beyond the median age of their cohort, all things turn negative: They&#39;re less likely to be promoted, they&#39;re less likely to receive a high performance rating, and their pay growth levels off or declines.</p><p> The one positive is that there is less turnover with older employees, often substantially less. Indeed, it may be that it is precisely because older employees tend to stay that employers don&#39;t feel the need to promote, pay, or recognize them in the same way as they do their younger employees. The latter have more outside opportunities, so they may need to be constantly wooed.</p><p></p><p> These negative signals about older workers can be very misleading. We often find that groups with more older workers actually outperform those with more younger workers. There&#39;s a discordance between what&#39;s found at the individual level compared with the group or organizational level.</p><p> This suggests that the productivity of older workers shows up not in their own measures of individual performance but in the performance of those with whom they work. We call this a <em>spillover effect</em> . So, for example, if older workers are less likely to turn over, they can cause their younger colleagues to follow suit, thereby bringing more stability to their work groups and making them more productive. For more evidence about the productivity of older workers, see the recent study I conducted with Richard A. Guzzo and Nicholas L. Anderson, which we discuss in the article “ <a href="https://academic.oup.com/workar/article/8/2/208/6574297">Age, Experience, and Business Performance: A Meta-Analysis of Work Unit-Level Effects</a> ” in the journal <cite>Work, Aging and Retirement</cite> .</p><h6> How can organizations ensure that age diversity and inclusion are integrated into their equity and diversity initiatives?</h6><p> Again, it is a common view among business leaders that older workers are less productive. And because they tend to cost more, they are viewed more as a liability than an asset, despite significant evidence to the contrary. For some reason that I find hard to explain, combating ageism is not high on the DEI agenda, certainly not as compared with efforts to address gender and racial inequity. I fault the DEI community for not being more aggressive on this front.</p><p> The aging workforce is a fact of life almost everywhere. Organizations that don&#39;t deal effectively with the repercussions of this secular trend and ensure that they are managing their older workers effectively run the risk of undermining organizational performance. In effect, they may make their unfounded stereotypes a self-fulfilling outcome.</p><p></p><p> I always urge my clients to undertake the kind of disciplined diagnostic work to evaluate the realities of their own workforce — to determine whether spillover effects are indeed at work in their organization, and to respond accordingly. Through this process, many of them will find that they have an asset to protect rather than a liability to discard.</p><h6> Is there any analysis done on the correlation between company performance or share price and the situations demonstrated by the survey?</h6><p> I&#39;ve undertaken client studies in which we link workforce characteristics and management practices to various business outcomes, including profitability, financial and operational productivity, revenue growth, and customer retention, among others. Our results have been mixed. In some, we&#39;ve seen that greater diversity in work group or unit composition improves business performance; in others, we&#39;ve found no effect or statistically negligible results. The most robust review and synthesis of the results of these studies is the meta-analysis of the effects of age and tenure noted above. That study did not focus on the effects of race and gender.</p><h6> What concrete steps can organizations take to battle these biases?</h6><p></p><p> My article in the summer 2023 issue of <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> , “ <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/opening-access-to-the-fast-track-for-career-equity/">Opening Access to the Fast Track for Career Equity</a> ,” speaks directly to this question. I explain how organizations can use the results of this kind of modeling to help eliminate or reduce the influence of demographics on how well employees are positioned to succeed at work. The reality is that all too often, situational factors inordinately affect the ability of employees to succeed and that women and people of color are situationally disadvantaged.</p><p> Employers who recognize that they are not positioning this talent to succeed can deploy an approach I call <em>proactive career management</em> to change this reality on the ground. This may involve getting more women and people of color into supervisory or other accelerator roles, changing reporting relationships, and neutralizing the negative effects of flexible working, among other things. I share a case study in my article to illustrate this approach in action.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/dismantle-career-roadblocks-for-more-equitable-outcomes/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Do Consumers See Your Business as a Force for Good?</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/do-consumers-see-your-business-as-a-force-for-good/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/do-consumers-see-your-business-as-a-force-for-good/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 11:00:04 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Cynthia E.

Last year, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2022/04/55-million-total-ftc-settlements-kohls-and-walmart-challenge-bamboo-and-eco-claims-shed-light">both Kohl&#39;s and Walmart</a> reached settlements of $2.5 million and $3 million, respectively, for falsely claiming that dozens of rayon textile products were actually made from environmentally friendly bamboo.</p><p> When such large, visible companies issue false claims or fail to act, it results in missed opportunities, a growing performance-expectation gap, and, eventually, reputational damage among consumers. So, what makes a business a force for good when it comes to the future of our environment? To find out, Bentley University and Gallup recently conducted a survey of 5,757 Americans to assess how they feel about business and its potential to have a positive impact on society and the environment. The <a href="https://www.bentley.edu/news-Announcing-the-Bentley-Gallup-Force-for-Good-survey-results">results of the Force for Good survey</a> highlight areas in which businesses, small and large, are failing to meet people&#39;s expectations — and how they can do better.</p><p></p><p> The public&#39;s expectations of large companies like Kohl&#39;s, McDonald&#39;s, or Walmart were made clear in our research. A slight majority of our respondents (53%) said that businesses overall have a negative environmental impact. Almost two-thirds (65%) said they feel this way about <em>large</em> businesses, whereas 16% said that <em>small</em> businesses have a negative impact on the planet/environment. Younger respondents in our study had higher expectations of businesses overall, with a whopping 81% of those age 18 to 29 saying that large businesses have a negative impact on the planet, compared with 54% of respondents age 70 or older.</p><p> Drilling down into the data, we found that more than 9 in 10 respondents rated four social and environmental concerns that businesses could act on as extremely or somewhat important: practicing sustainable manufacturing (92%); promoting increased access to education and training (92%); investing time and money into local communities (92%); and operating in a way that is sustainable for the environment (91%). Just 1 in 3 people surveyed said that businesses are currently doing an excellent or good job in any of these areas, and about 1 in 4 (26%) said that businesses are doing an excellent or good job of operating in an environmentally sustainable way.</p><h3> The T-Shirt Experiment</h3><p> One perspective on sustainability is that companies should practice environmental responsibility for the greater good — the “doing good to do good” perspective. Another approach focuses on the importance of “doing good to do well” so that both business and society benefit from leaders&#39; actions. But are these approaches in tension? Need they be?</p><p> One section of the Force for Good survey — what we called our T-shirt experiment — was aimed at getting a better read on how people think about this tension. Amid rising prices for almost everything, we asked whether respondents would be willing to pay extra for a T-shirt depending on a variety of company characteristics. Sixty-three percent of respondents said they would be willing to pay extra — 82% more — for a T-shirt if the company that made it was known for having a positive impact on the environment. The numbers are even higher for respondents age 18 to 29 and for women: Young people were most likely to say they would pay more — about 8 in 10 — and almost 7 in 10 women. (See “Results of the T-Shirt Experiment.”) Both of these consumer groups are key markets for many companies.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Results of the T-Shirt Experiment</h4><p class="caption"> To differing degrees, depending on age and gender, respondents indicated their willingness to pay more for the same product based on a business&#39;s sustainability practices. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-07-26_Clark_fig1-1.png" alt="Results of the T-Shirt Experiment" /><br /></article></aside></div><p> When people were asked how much they would pay for the T-shirt without being given any additional information, the median response was $10. This held true for those with personal incomes between $24,000 and $179,000. In other words, personal income had little effect on the value they assigned to the product.</p><p></p><p> Respondents were then asked how much more they would pay if the company were known for various attributes: having a positive environmental impact, making a positive impact on the local community, treating employees well, and contributing to charities. Among the four attributes, the premium was highest for companies known to have a positive environmental impact, with a median response of $7.</p><p> Our data indicates that Americans are, in fact, willing to reward companies for doing good. A company known for positive environmental performance can charge more for its products — evidence that “doing good to do well” works.</p><p></p><h3> A False Dichotomy?</h3><p> Most of the respondents didn&#39;t see a trade-off between good environmental performance and good financial performance. In other words, they believe that both can happen concurrently, despite business leaders&#39; arguments that sustainable practices harm financial performance. About 7 in 10 respondents (69%) said businesses that prioritize making a positive impact on society are just as profitable (47%) or more profitable (22%) than their competitors. People who said they have expertise in owning, leading, or managing a business were no less likely than those without such expertise to say that businesses that prioritize making a positive impact are at least as profitable as their competitors.</p><p> Members of different political parties had notable differences of opinion regarding the importance of sustainability. For example, 84% of Democrats said it is extremely important for businesses to operate in an environmentally sustainable manner, compared with 31% of Republicans and 59% of independents. However, a large majority of Republicans (80%) said that sustainability is at least <em>somewhat</em> important. These perspectives might affect a host of company actions, such as choosing content and spending amounts for advertising in red versus blue states and the very design of their products.</p><p></p><p> Likewise, we found significant differences across ethnic identities. Seventy percent of Black respondents, 82% of Asian respondents, 65% of Hispanic respondents, and 59% of White respondents said they believe it is extremely important for businesses to operate in an environmentally sustainable manner. When asked how they feel about focusing on long-term benefits like those for the environment versus short-term benefits like profits, 77% of Asian respondents said they are likely to support that focus — compared with 56% of respondents overall. The figures for both Black and Hispanic respondents hovered around 60%.</p><p> Even when we asked the question in a slightly different way, respondents did not see it as a trade-off but as more of a “both and” situation. For example, when asked about meeting the financial goals of investors, 79% said they believe it is somewhat or extremely important. Eighty-eight percent of respondents also said that making the world a better place is somewhat or extremely important.</p><h3> How Can Your Company Become a Force for Good?</h3><p> Results from this deep dive into what a broad and varied set of Americans believe suggest several actions companies can take or plan for.</p><p> <strong>Pay attention to your local footprint.</strong> Small companies are perceived as better at most stakeholder-related activities. Respondents were twice as likely to say small businesses positively impact people&#39;s lives than large businesses (82% and 41%, respectively). What&#39;s more, respondents are more likely to think large businesses have a negative impact on Americans&#39; lives in general (38%) than they are to say the same about small businesses (4%). This data, combined with the results across age and gender in the figure below (see “Sustainability Is Important to Consumers — but Are Businesses Practicing It?”) on positive community impact, suggests that companies — particularly large ones — should improve their relationships with their surrounding communities.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Recognize that younger Americans expect more.</strong> Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) and Gen Zers (born between 1997 and 2012) expect more from businesses in terms of both social and environmental responsibility than older respondents do. In our T-shirt experiment, 82% of respondents age 18 to 29 were willing to pay more for a T-shirt from a company known for having a positive impact on their local community. Again, young respondents (73%) agreed more than any other age group that businesses&#39; efforts to reduce their carbon footprints and/or emissions are important. Companies will need to account for their environmental stewardship among their customers and future employees.</p><p> <strong>Mind the performance-expectation gap.</strong> Environmental stakeholders and regulators are on the lookout for any discrepancy between expectations of a company&#39;s responsible environmental management and what it is actually doing — the performance-expectation gap. The vast majority of respondents (89%) said businesses have “a great deal” or “some” power to make a positive impact on people&#39;s lives, but just 57% said that businesses are very or somewhat effective at doing so. In terms of the environment, the findings revealed performance-expectation gaps of at least 30 percentage points between “the importance of” and “the performance of” several environmental goals. On questions about reducing businesses&#39; carbon footprints, engaging in sustainable manufacturing, and making the world a better place, we found considerable gaps: On those three points, 52% to 57% of respondents indicated that it is extremely important for businesses to do so, but only 24% to 28% thought they are excellent or good at it.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Sustainability Is Important to Consumers — but Are Businesses Practicing It?</h4><p class="caption"> There is a considerable gap between respondents&#39; opinions on the importance of sustainability practices and their perceptions of businesses&#39; actual practices. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-07-26_Clark_fig2.png" alt="Sustainability Is Important to Consumers — but Are Businesses Practicing It?" /><br /></article></aside></div><p> While having a dedicated sustainability leader, support from senior management, and education for employees and executives is necessary, it&#39;s important to stay vigilant in addressing the widening performance-expectation gap. In what has become a hypercritical business environment, leaders must pay greater attention to how perceptions of what their company is doing compare with what they are actually doing.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Set sustainability goals.</strong> Think carefully about how to measure what you&#39;re doing. This is a logical next step after gaining the support of senior management, and it can help your company determine the progress it has made and where it has soft or blind spots. In fact, regulators have proposed requiring companies to disclose how they set climate-related targets and measure their progress toward meeting them. Consider signing on to broadly recognized and accepted goals like the United Nations Global Compact&#39;s (UNGC&#39;s) <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/">Sustainable Development Goals</a> , which can help your company publicly commit to a plan of action, step by step. The UNGC also requires annual statements on progress to help ward off greenwashing.</p><p></p><p> With increasing attention on environmental sustainability, gaining an understanding of how various stakeholders perceive your statements and actions is vital. By identifying and understanding current perceptions and their implications, as the Bentley-Gallup study does, companies can amend their environmental commitments and processes to ensure that they invigorate their efforts to be a force for good, which will benefit the company, its stakeholders, and, most importantly, the environment.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/do-consumers-see-your-business-as-a-force-for-good/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Myth of the Mainstream</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-myth-of-the-mainstream/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-myth-of-the-mainstream/#comments</comments><pubDate> Mon, 24 Jul 2023 11:00:22 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Marcus Collins. <p>Marcus Collins is a clinical marketing professor at the University of Michigan&#39;s Ross School of Business and former head of strategy at Wieden+Kennedy New York.

The brand had become a symbol of food choices that were driving escalating rates of obesity and hypertension.</p><p> The company spent more than a decade trying to fight this perception among American consumers by targeting them with messaging about its updated menu, which offered healthier alternatives more in line with contemporary diet trends — but to no avail. Year over year, McDonald&#39;s sales declined, and its brand perception continued to spiral downward.</p><p></p><p> Finally, the company decided to go on the offensive. Instead of combating the opposition&#39;s hate and attempting to win over those in the middle, McDonald&#39;s decided to focus on its fans — the people who self-identify as McDonald&#39;s devotees despite the vitriol directed at the brand. The company&#39;s tactics included launching its Famous Orders campaign, which celebrated the favored menu items of superstar fans (like hip-hop mogul Travis Scott and K-pop megastars BTS); creating adult-targeted Happy Meals; and promoting fans&#39; own menu hacks. In doing so, it tapped into what these devotees love about McDonald&#39;s and not only activated their collective consumption but also inspired them to spread the word on behalf of the brand. The result of this strategy was a 10.4% increase in global revenue for McDonald&#39;s from 2018 to 2021 and the return of dormant customers: more than a quarter of those who came in to buy the Travis Scott meal, for example, hadn&#39;t visited the chain in over a year. Seemingly overnight, McDonald&#39;s went from being a cautionary tale to the darling of brand marketing and a case study for advertising effectiveness.</p><p></p><p>这里发生了什么？ Conventional wisdom would tell us that in a world of increasingly polarized opinions, our best bet is to appease the middle, if only because that&#39;s where the majority of the market is. That also seems like a safe bet to many companies, as a middle-of-the-road position is less likely to alienate potential customers. But McDonald&#39;s demonstrated what can happen when you dismiss this conventional approach. Instead of trying to speak to the mass market, it chose a side. It chose to embrace the love instead, fighting the hate, and it abandoned the notion of enticing the large but indifferent middle of the market. By doing so, McDonald&#39;s marketing efforts activated a legion of fans who not only consumed but also won over others as well. What McDonald&#39;s realized is an important lesson for contemporary marketers: If you want to get people to move, you must choose a side. The notion that you can win by playing to the middle is a misleading myth.</p><p></p><h3> Choose a Side</h3><p> The core function of marketing is to influence people to adopt a desired behavior. That is to say, we go to market to get people to move — to buy, to vote, to recycle, to subscribe, to download, to watch, to evangelize, to wear a mask — and to drive a host of other desirable behavioral outcomes that will benefit our organization or interests. And what influences people the most? Well, according to everything we know about human behavior, we are most influenced by other people — not ads, not value propositions, but other people. More specifically, we are most influenced by <em>our</em> people: the individuals who abide by the same culturally established conventions and expectations that dictate what is considered acceptable behavior for people like us. These individuals typically share a similar worldview and, therefore, adhere to a shared way of life in an effort to promote social solidarity among themselves — their subculture. They consume the way the subculture consumes, vote the way it votes, and behave the way it behaves, because that is what is expected of people like them.</p><p> If these people are against you because of the shared conventions and expectations of people like them (their culture), then the likelihood of getting them to take action on your behalf will be slim. That&#39;s why right-wing Republicans won&#39;t bother trying to convert left-leaning Democrats. Instead, Republicans speak to their base — the collective of people who see the world similarly, express a similar set of cultural characteristics as the brand, and are more inclined to move in step with the brand as an act of social solidarity. They identify as members of this group and follow its behavioral norms.</p><p> Those in the unaffiliated middle of the population, on the other hand, are by nature indifferent and risk averse. While they may have opinions, they lack strong convictions in either direction and are therefore less likely to take action. In politics, they don&#39;t vote in primaries or campaign for candidates; instead, they sit on the sidelines and wait to see how things shake out. Their behavior is the same when it comes to brands.</p><p> The middle doesn&#39;t adopt new products with any urgency. They are not the first to respond to marketing communications, nor are they likely to weigh in on a debate between advocates and detractors. They mitigate their own risk of moving out of step with what might be considered generally acceptable by stepping back and observing other people&#39;s responses first.</p><p> The red herring is that we perceive this indifference as an opportunity to persuade them to one side or the other. But the truth is, they are not typically convinced by any marketing communications. Instead, they, too, take cues from other people — sometimes those who are for you, and at other times those who are against you.</p><p></p><p> With this in mind, it becomes abundantly clear that in a polarized scenario, the chances of marketers getting people to move are far greater when we activate the collective of the willing as opposed to trying to convince detractors or even persuade the indifferent. And yet, historically, marketers have focused their efforts on the middle because it represents the biggest market opportunity. However, our chances of successfully influencing behavior increases when we choose to address the people who are most likely to take action. When we do so effectively, we catalyze a propagation effect that causes the product, behavior, or idea to cascade throughout the population, thanks to the process of social contagion — the spread of affects, behaviors, cognitions, and desires due to direct or indirect peer influence of people “like us.”</p><h3> The Power of Propagation</h3><p> The idea of propagation demands that marketers leave behind the conventional approach of targeting the middle, where the majority of the population resides. Besides being of questionable effectiveness, as discussed above, reaching the middle requires costly media spending (think prime-time TV and Super Bowl ads) and places marketing messages in an arena that is noisy and saturated with competing messages. Marketers pay little attention to the fringe, a population that conventional wisdom tells us is too small and too niche. But everything that is now mainstream once started on the fringe: It started within a subculture and propagated out to become popular culture.</p><p> For instance, if you were into comic books 20 years ago, you would have been considered a nerd. Today, however, many of the most-viewed movies across the globe, such as Marvel&#39;s <cite>Avengers</cite> series, originated from comics. Twenty years ago, if you were into video games, you would have been perceived as an immature adult. Today, gaming is not only considered cool but is also a multibillion-dollar industry. Indeed, what is now normal was once fringe. Thanks to social contagion, the cultural characteristics of a community propagate from the fringe to the middle — from the subculture to popular culture. It happens from the outside in, not the inside out.</p><p></p><p> Unlike traditional marketing communications, the reach and subsequent adoption that is achieved through this kind of propagation does not rely on people hearing a message from a company or brand. (It helps, but it&#39;s not necessary.) Instead, people hear about it from someone they trust — someone like them — which increases their likelihood of adoption. As the network scientists Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler contended, “When a small group of people begin acting in concert — displaying similar visible symptoms — the epidemic can spread along social network ties via emotion contagion and large groups can become quickly emotionally synchronized.” This is the network effect that is catalyzed when you activate the collective of the willing. Don&#39;t focus on the middle: Focus on the people who see the world the way you do. Choose a side, and they will convince the bystanders, the passive, the indifferent.</p><p></p><p> Although broadcast messaging might get our attention, it&#39;s the influence of people like us, people with whom we identify, that changes our outlook and, subsequently, our behaviors. This provides a new perspective, and corresponding strategies, for marketers who aim to communicate with consumers in a culture where ideological binaries seem to divide the market. Like McDonald&#39;s did, marketers benefit from choosing a side that is most likely to move and then activating its members so that they might convert people on the brand&#39;s behalf. Status quo practices position the middle as a safe bet. However, the dynamics of cultural diffusion subvert these long-standing best practices for connecting with consumers and influencing behavioral adoption, and demand that today&#39;s practitioners develop new strategies and accompanying tactics.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-myth-of-the-mainstream/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 1</slash:comments></item><item><title> Sustainability Progress Is Stalled at Most Companies</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/sustainability-progress-is-stalled-at-most-companies/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/sustainability-progress-is-stalled-at-most-companies/#comments</comments><pubDate> Thu, 20 Jul 2023 11:00:23 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[CB Bhattacharya and Rob Jekielek. <p>CB Bhattacharya is director of the Center for Sustainable Business and the HJ Zoffer Chair in Sustainability and Ethics at the Katz Graduate School of Business at the University of Pittsburgh.

This means that they have endowed their employees with a sense of sustainable ownership, spurring them to engage in more sustainability-supporting behaviors. When every employee integrates environmental and social concerns into every business decision, sustainability progress is accelerated — an aspirational goal for all companies.</p><p> To shed light on the state of play in embedding sustainability and identify key bottlenecks, the Center for Sustainable Business at the University of Pittsburgh collaborated with The Harris Poll to conduct a survey of US employees. We wanted to find out whether their employers were taking measures that our earlier research had identified as important to prompting employees to conduct business through a sustainability lens. Our survey drew responses from 1,056 employees, representative of the US employee base. We defined sustainability for the respondents as “integrating environmental and societal concerns into business decisions and actions.”</p><p></p><p> We asked respondents to rate their level of agreement with a series of 19 statements about the status quo, such as “My company has a clear business case for improving our sustainability performance,” on a 4-point Likert scale (from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”). We also presented respondents with a series of 12 issues that could pose challenges to sustainability progress, such as “Sustainability is not built into our business strategy,” and asked them to rate the extent to which that is an actual challenge at their company (from “major challenge” to “not at all a challenge”).</p><p> Roughly one-third of the respondents asserted that their employers have made significant strides in their sustainability journeys. Although that number might sound low given the enormity of the task facing us, the good news is that there is momentum, which we can help accelerate by pointing out the roadblocks as perceived by employees. Below, we provide six key recommendations that emerged from our data for managers seeking to embed sustainability in the organizational culture and business models.</p><p> <strong>Establish a purpose based on values.</strong> Purpose is a business&#39;s raison d&#39;être — the answer to the all-important question, “Why do we do what we do?” Paul Polman, former CEO of Unilever and a leader in the corporate sustainability movement, has said, “Sustainability is totally driven by purpose.” <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> Organizations that are successful at embedding sustainability articulate the societal benefit they aim to deliver to their stakeholders, and this overarching purpose guides everything the organization does.</p><p> In our study, 36% of the respondents strongly agreed with the statement “My company wants to make a difference in people&#39;s lives, not just make profits,” while 33% strongly agreed with “My company has a higher purpose beyond profit maximization.” If purpose is the starting point for sustainability, we aren&#39;t doing very well; it is apparent that the profit-maximization narrative is alive and well. Consistently, 43% of employees cited short-term focus, a lack of investor interest, and, importantly, “Our leaders don&#39;t believe in sustainability,” as challenges. Unless CEOs and top management teams realize that profit is the <em>consequence</em> of value creation for all stakeholders and not the starting point for strategy development and execution, progress will be stifled. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p></p><p></p><p> <strong>Bake sustainability into corporate strategy.</strong> Academic researchers and others have noted that efforts to make meaningful progress toward sustainability must be driven by corporate strategy. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> Doing so increases the likelihood that, over time, “doing the green thing” will be seen as a normal part of employees&#39; jobs, and more and more decisions will be made through the lens of sustainability. With only 29% of respondents strongly agreeing with the statement “My company has a clear business case for improving our sustainability performance” and 27% with “Sustainability is core to how my company executes our business strategy,” it appears that we have a long way to go. Consistent with the status quo, 43% agreed that their company&#39;s failure to build sustainability into its business strategy represents a challenge.</p><p> <strong>Train employees, and incentivize actions that advance sustainability.</strong> Companies that are successful in engaging their workforce have invested in training that gives employees guidance on how to improve sustainability. With only 30% of employees surveyed strongly agreeing with the statement “I understand how I can improve my company&#39;s sustainability performance through my role,” there seems to be a dearth of role-specific knowledge at the individual employee level. Lack of training was cited as a major/moderate challenge by 44%, while a similar number (45%) indicated that they don&#39;t know what actions to take to improve sustainability performance. Companies need to invest more in training and sustainability knowledge creation so that employees know <em>what</em> they can do in their roles and <em>how</em> to do what needs to be done.</p><p> Managers must also do more to provide employees with incentives to advance the sustainability agenda: Forty-nine percent of those surveyed found the lack of such incentives to be a major or moderate hurdle to improving sustainability performance. Leaders should also consider whether the management culture encourages engagement and intrinsic motivation by giving employees the autonomy to solve sustainability challenges, which often require creative thinking. However, when we asked survey respondents to rate their level of agreement with the statements “My company allows me to make a lot of sustainability-related decisions on my own” and “My company gives me a chance to use my personal initiative or judgment in carrying out sustainability initiatives,” we found that, at most, 29% of respondents strongly agreed.</p><p> <strong>Create a sustainability culture in your organization.</strong> Managers can keep sustainability salient in the organizational culture by communicating progress, celebrating milestones, recognizing achievements, and collaborating on solutions both internally and with industry partners. Our research has identified the lack of a sustainability culture as one of the biggest impediments to progress, with 48% of respondents indicating that that is a major or moderate impediment at their organization. Communicating sustainability progress to employees is a key component of a sustainability culture, because it keeps issues top of mind. Celebrating successes will pique employee interest and legitimize the importance of sustainability to the organization — but only 31% of respondents strongly agreed that their company celebrates sustainability successes.</p><p></p><p> Collaborating with traditional competitors — which is increasingly necessary to address those complex “ <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/tragedy-of-the-commons-impact-on-sustainability-issues">tragedy of the commons</a> ” problems — signals to employees that the company is serious about transformational change and reinforces the culture to employees. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> With only 25% of survey respondents strongly agreeing with the statement “My company collaborates with other organizations to address complex sustainability issues,” it is evident that much work is required to open corporate leaders&#39; eyes to the potential of progress via collaboration.</p><p> <strong>Conduct business through a sustainability lens.</strong> Imagine the progress we would make if every employee in every company — from the mailroom to the boardroom — integrated environmental and social issues into every business decision they made. This, in our view, is conducting business through the lens of sustainability — an aspirational but necessary goal to reach if we are to surmount our existential crises. As previous research has shown, employees taking individual ownership of sustainability is a key driver for engaging in sustainability behaviors. In our survey, 28% of respondents strongly agreed with the statement “Employees at my company take ownership of improving sustainability performance,” while 45% identified a belief among employees that “sustainability is someone else&#39;s responsibility” as a challenge. This lack of personal ownership of sustainability performance is reflected in our survey results: Only 27% of respondents strongly agreed that they “invested ideas and creativity” to help their company be more sustainable, and just 24% strongly agreed that every business decision they make is viewed through the lens of sustainability.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Bridge the last mile.</strong> We noted a significant difference between how corporate and front-line employees responded to our questions. Compared with front-line nonmanagers working in roles such as customer support, managers working in corporate roles were, on average, about 15% more likely to see sustainability as embedded.</p><p> To ensure that their commitment to sustainability is real and provides tangible benefits to their organizations, leaders must address this last-mile gap between corporate and front-line employees. Broadly communicated messaging about the corporate purpose and environmental, social, and governance targets might not suffice in this instance; there is a real need to drive sustainability through practical initiatives and actions that can be integrated into daily tasks and routines that employees perform across the entire organization.</p><p></p><p> Interestingly, perceiving sustainability as more embedded in the organization also opens employees&#39; eyes to the roadblocks and challenges that impede progress. Our data shows that employees who are more engaged and perceive sustainability to be more embedded also perceive more roadblocks, on average, than those who are less engaged.</p><p> The implication here is that as companies bridge the last-mile gap in embedding sustainability, they should be prepared to field more questions and listen to more opinions as employee engagement on the issue increases. Companies should use one-on-one coaching, action playbooks, and tailored communication to make sustainability everyone&#39;s job. Companies need to be prepared to invest more resources into embedding sustainability — and get the entire organization to conduct business through the sustainability lens.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/sustainability-progress-is-stalled-at-most-companies/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 1</slash:comments></item><item><title> How Robots Can Enhance Performance Management for Humans</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-robots-can-enhance-performance-management-for-humans/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-robots-can-enhance-performance-management-for-humans/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 19 Jul 2023 11:00:50 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Bryan Hong and Lynn Wu. <p>Bryan Hong is associate professor of entrepreneurship and management at the Bloch School of Management at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.

The past decade has seen dramatic growth in robot adoption across an increasing number of industries, and it shows no signs of slowing. In a recent McKinsey survey of companies worldwide, 88% of respondents said they plan to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/advanced%20electronics/our%20insights/growth%20dynamics%20in%20industrial%20robotics/industrial-robotics-insights-into-the-sectors-future-growth-dynamics.ashx">invest in robotics</a> for their business. Our research has found an equally and perhaps more important transformation taking place: The adoption of robots is improving companies&#39; ability to recognize and reward good employee performance.</p><p> Within every organization, leaders face a fundamental question: How do we get the best from our people? One of the most common methods is offering monetary rewards — usually, periodic bonuses — that are linked to performance. This practice is grounded in the idea that better performance should be more highly rewarded. But that approach is rarely simple to implement in practice because it requires that performance be measured well enough to be evaluated effectively. This is challenging to accomplish for most roles and even more so for individual employees. Because so much work is done in teams and managers can&#39;t monitor the specific activity of each employee or accurately measure individual performance, many organizations choose to pay bonuses based on team or company performance rather than on individual performance. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p></p><p></p><h3> Measuring Human Performance When Colleagues Are Robots</h3><p> What does all this have to do with robots? In our research, we have found that companies that adopt robots improve their ability to measure human performance. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> To illustrate, let&#39;s say you&#39;re working in a team of two. Your manager can see and evaluate your combined productivity as a team but not what each of you is doing individually at all times. In theory, both of you are supposed to be contributing equally; in practice, you&#39;re doing far more of the work, which isn&#39;t visible to your busy manager.</p><p> Then, let&#39;s say your teammate is replaced with a robot. As a machine, the robot is much more precise and consistent in doing its work tasks and might even provide data about its performance while operating. Because it&#39;s so consistent and transparent, any disruptions or spikes in productivity can much more clearly be identified as coming from either the robot or from you. If there are others in your organization who work with the same type of robot in a similar way, then it&#39;s much easier to see how their individual productivity varies from yours.</p><p> In other words, because robots are, by their very nature, much more consistent and transparent than humans, human activity becomes easier to observe if robots join the team. The more robots there are relative to humans, the easier it is to distinguish and measure individual human performance.</p><p></p><p> In one real-world example, a repair facility at a major US-based electronics company experienced a dramatic improvement in its ability to observe employee productivity after robots were implemented to assist workers in the repair process. Because robots, unlike humans, do not get physically tired while performing repetitive tasks, they were able to perform more consistently. This reduced variance in the production process and allowed managers to more clearly observe individual employee behaviors. Many employees followed a regular pattern of being more productive in the morning than in the afternoon, with substantial variance in their afternoon productivity. As a result, many workers ended up with more repairs to finish later in the day as they rushed to meet their daily quotas. This “cramming” of work was especially problematic because it typically resulted in more errors due to the workers having rushed.</p><p> Integrating robots into the repair process eased the tracking of individual employee productivity in two ways. First, robots made different types of errors than humans. The robots&#39; errors were consistent, which made human errors easier to distinguish. Second, the robots themselves provided precise data about their own performance, which made it easier to isolate performance outcomes, both positive and negative, caused by human behavior. This data generation capability allowed managers to better monitor productivity overall and to more easily detect weaknesses in the production process. Managers at the repair facility, for example, hadn&#39;t been aware of the extent of the afternoon cramming behavior until robots were incorporated into the production process. Once the problem was clearly identified, they were able to reorganize the work process to reduce errors; overall error rates at the facility have since improved.</p><p></p><p> These types of improvements in performance measurement can have especially dramatic effects on productivity in combination with performance-based incentives. If it&#39;s easier to observe and measure the performance of individual employees within organizations, good performers — who may have received little reward or recognition because of measurement challenges — become easier to identify and reward, and leaders really can do better in getting the best from their teams. And this is exactly what we find in our research: Companies that adopt robots are also more likely to adopt bonus incentives tied directly to individual performance as opposed to team or organizational performance. With better measurement comes increased rewards for an organization&#39;s good performers, and a more productive workplace. Using robots is fairer for the people who work at an organization.</p><p></p><p> Robots are changing the nature of work. Beyond eliminating some jobs and creating new ones, robots are also changing organizations&#39; ability to get the best from their people, as well as the way we experience work itself. Robots offer an exciting opportunity for businesses to redesign the roles and responsibilities of the humans that work with them, giving those companies a competitive edge over rivals not because of superior technology but because of better processes. The robot revolution isn&#39;t going to eliminate the need for humans. Rather, it&#39;s bringing both new challenges and opportunities for identifying, rewarding, and managing human talent.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-robots-can-enhance-performance-management-for-humans/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Detecting the Good and the Bad With AI: Airbnb&#39;s Naba Banerjee</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/detecting-the-good-and-the-bad-with-ai-airbnbs-naba-banerjee/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/detecting-the-good-and-the-bad-with-ai-airbnbs-naba-banerjee/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 18 Jul 2023 11:00:04 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. <p>Sam Ransbotham ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ransbotham">@ransbotham</a> ) is a professor in the information systems department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College, as well as guest editor for <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> &#39;s Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy Big Ideas initiative.

Each episode, we introduce you to someone innovating with AI. I&#39;m Sam Ransbotham, professor of analytics at Boston College. I&#39;m also the AI and business strategy guest editor at <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> .</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And I&#39;m Shervin Khodabandeh, senior partner with BCG and one of the leaders of our AI business. Together, <cite>MIT SMR</cite> and BCG have been researching and publishing on AI since 2017, interviewing hundreds of practitioners and surveying thousands of companies on what it takes to build and to deploy and scale AI capabilities and really transform the way organizations operate.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Today, Shervin and I are speaking with Naba Banerjee, director of trust product and operations at Airbnb. Naba, thanks for joining us.</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> Thank you; a pleasure to be here.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I think most people know Airbnb, but maybe tell us a brief overview of the company and what you do.</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> Airbnb stands for a place which fosters connection and belonging. Millions and millions of hosts open up their homes to complete strangers, and you and I and our families get to travel to an exotic destination, and instead of staying at a hotel, you actually get to truly immerse yourself in the local culture. And at times, if you&#39;re really lucky, you get to stay at the house of a host and actually experience hosting as it&#39;s meant to be, thereby creating and fostering connection and belonging.</p><p> And in this world that is increasingly becoming insular and connection is becoming a rare thing, I am so glad to be part of a company that is trying to create more connection. And what my team does, the trust and safety team at Airbnb, is along the entire customer journey, right from the time that you create an account on Airbnb throughout the journey. At times, it is possible that something could go wrong: A fake account could get created, or your account could get taken over. The listing you&#39;re trying to stay at could be a fake listing; the reviews you&#39;re looking at may not be exactly genuine. But our job is to make sure that you can focus on your magical stay, the host can focus on being the perfect host, and we try to anticipate some of these risks, and we minimize the risk of those kinds of issues from happening. And using technology and data to enable that magical user journey is what my team does.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I think we all hear headlines where something goes wrong. How much goes wrong in the course of the gazillions of transactions that you do?</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> That&#39;s a great question. In 2021, we had around 70 million trips that happened on Airbnb, and less than 0.1% of those trips resulted in a host or a guest reporting potentially an issue that happened in that stay. And when our team went in and investigated and actually looked at where the real harm happened or somebody had to be removed from the platform, that number is even smaller.</p><p> I know that even one bad incident is probably too bad and should not be happening, but in the bigger scale of things, what you come back to realize is the majority of people are actually good. Ninety-nine point nine percent of people are meaning to just go about their daily business, enjoy a great stay, or be a great host. But sometimes, [on] that very rare occasion when that bad thing happens, we want to make sure that we reduce the risk of that.</p><p> If you really look at where a person is causing harm to another person, those incidents are like a fraction of a fraction of a fraction. But when we talk about safety, we&#39;re looking at [things like] a carbon monoxide gas leak. It could be slip and fall; it could be property damage, where glass broke and you probably had a stain on your carpet. We are also looking at those kinds of issues.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What I&#39;m hearing from what you&#39;re saying is, your role is, No. 1, a good role. You&#39;re the protector of the good and the “warder-offer” of evil, right?</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> I love that. You should be part of our branding team.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> It&#39;s a good thing, right? It&#39;s a very purposeful role. And the second part of it is, you&#39;re talking about microscopically small incidents.</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> Yeah, needles in a haystack.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Right? And those are fun problems. Tell us more about under the hood — what happens?</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> I would say it&#39;s three parts. One is, we start with the “why,” which is — you framed it really well — that we are the protector of the good and trying to ward off the bad. We can never say that we stop everything bad. Like, to Sam&#39;s point, you cannot do that. But how are we learning and getting better? And that&#39;s where AI and ML [machine learning] comes in, where [we ask], “How can we use [the] power of data and technology to learn and get better?” And every year, the risks don&#39;t stay the same; the data keeps growing.</p><p> And then the second thing is, “How do we use technology responsibly?” Which is, you could go too blunt and try to block as much as possible to specifically look at fraud and safety incidents and keep them down, but then, if the data that you are using to make these decisions has bias in it, is potentially creating unfairness, then you could close off your doors to a lot of good people who genuinely are just trying to have a good stay. So [it&#39;s about] using technology responsibly. … It is having self-governing mechanisms, which is, we have our privacy team, our data privacy team, our infosec team, our anti-discrimination teams, which are … almost like mirrors to the trust team. [There are also] other teams in Airbnb, where every time we are really laser-focused on this particular fraud vector, this bot detection, this account-takeover detection or party detection, they are constantly making sure that are we using the data in a safe way and a transparent way, giving users control and then not introducing bias.</p><p> And then, lastly, having ways for us to give people a path back, which is, we are going to — based on the data available to us, and the technology available to us, and the maturity of that technology — make our best possible decision. But if we get it wrong, can we create transparency and a process for users to appeal and get back on the platform when we do block them or remove them so that, again, we can learn and get better? So that, at the highest level, is how my team is working under the hood.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And what are some of the use cases?</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> One of the use cases that we have talked about quite a bit is, you know … I&#39;ll take you on a little story, which is, when I joined the trust team in 2020, the world had just shut down; the pandemic was raging. And very similar to how the world was waiting for a vaccine, while waiting for a vaccine, we went into lockdown mode.</p><p> That was a blunt instrument … to prevent people from exposing themselves to situations which would make them unsafe. Similarly, Airbnb became an unfortunate product-market fit for unauthorized house parties. When the hotels and bars shut down, unfortunately that less than 1% or 0.1% of users who were looking for places where they could throw these parties, they started renting out Airbnbs. And as a result, we realized that it was causing a lot of pain to our communities of hosts and guests who use this platform, which was based on a foundation of trust. So initially, we had to use some very blunt instruments.</p><p> We first instituted our global party ban, saying that Airbnb does not allow for any kind of party whatsoever. Second, we started looking at some patterns and found that someone under 25 booking an entire home for just one night or two nights less than 50 or so miles away from their home — those seem to be all signals that lead to parties. When parties happen, we usually find … that account was created yesterday. Then we implemented a blunt rule called “under 25,” and we put that in place. Now, we had to be careful, because those rules don&#39;t exactly work globally. But that worked in North America, and we saw right away that there was a reduction in the number of unauthorized parties.</p><p> But over time, just as it happens with rules, we saw that people started to game those rules. They would get an older friend to book the reservation for them. And instead of one night, they would book it for three nights, and so on and so forth. [And] the impact on good users was so high that we said, “We kind of need to move to machine learning. We need to get smarter.” And so we did our first pilot in Australia, where we segmented the place and looked at the place that had this new party model that we&#39;d built versus the other. Do we see a reduction? And again, this is like looking for a needle in the haystack, but we still saw 35% fewer parties in the area that had the party model versus not. And when we started experimenting in North America, we did see that it was as effective as the heuristic, with lesser impact to good users.</p><p> And that kind of gave us the confidence to keep moving forward, because not doing anything was not an option. We had to do something and had to be smart about it. That was one of the use cases where we could go out and talk about it — not claiming that we are stopping all parties, but at least Airbnb is taking a strong stance about it.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> One common thread that I&#39;m hearing in how you&#39;re describing the problem and the solution is a need for constant adaptability and ongoing learning, and using the right instrument for the right job. At times it&#39;s a rule, then maybe its unsupervised learning, then there&#39;s a human intervention. It does sound quite multidisciplinary, including the part where the rules change, or the fraudster&#39;s mode of operation changes, and you also have the issue of “Is it too blunt? Does it limit some unintended but good or benign behaviors?” How does the human and machine collaboration or interaction work in these situations?</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> You summarized it really well, Shervin, which is, it&#39;s not a one-and-done thing. You build it, and then you have to constantly learn and optimize from even the kind of decisions you are making, as well as how the world around you is evolving. And that is an area [that] humans are really good at, which is, you do have to have the discipline of training your models with the latest data, with the right data, making trade-off decisions on what is the optimal threshold at which you are going to say, “OK, this is risky, and we are ready to use that risk.”</p><p> At Airbnb, we have been constantly on this journey of how to leverage humans in the loop. I have a trust operations team in addition to the product and planning teams. This operations team constitutes full-time employees as well as agents globally. And whenever we build a new model, in the beginning we often have the model make a risk threshold-based decision: “This is the top 1%. This is the next tranche. This is the next tranche.” And at times, we will route that to human beings to then create labels on top of that to say, “I agree with the model&#39;s decision,” or, “I don&#39;t agree with the model&#39;s decision,” which then serves as training data back to the model.</p><p> And then, when we have more confidence in the decision-making capability of the model, we would go toward auto-decisioning. This party model, to your point, right now it&#39;s completely auto-decisioned. But what ends up happening is, when we get an appeal back from a user saying, “I was incorrectly blocked,” that then serves as data that&#39;s coming by the customer telling us. And then an agent looks at that appeal and says, “Actually yes, this decision was incorrect.” And if the agent made a correct decision, that customer appealed correctly, and no incident happened, we know that that was a false positive.</p><p> But let&#39;s say the agent approved, and then that customer went on to throw a party; that was a false negative. We are learning from that continuously, but we do it iteratively. First, we try to have the model direct to a human. And again, there is no guarantee that the human is better at decision-making than the model, but we constantly measure the performance. Then we go toward higher-order decisioning [with less] human decisioning. And sometimes we will also have … let&#39;s say the party model makes decisions. People go about their merry way, have the reservation. Sometimes after the reservation has been booked, we will also still have humans look at the top 1% risky reservations to try and correct anything that they can.</p><p> So it is either trying to balance that out as to, when are humans the right people to make the decision? When should the machine make the decision? It&#39;s been a not-easy, nonlinear journey that we have been on.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> You mentioned at first you&#39;re maybe reviewing more cases and then learning from those cases. But at the same time, you have people … these 70 million transactions are happening constantly. And, for example, when you gave the illustration of the hotel … shutdown at the beginning of the pandemic, that&#39;s a time where it&#39;s happening to individual hosts and customers. How do you balance that trade-off of needing to get something in place quickly [while] at the same time needing to go through a process?</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> That probably is the hardest thing, and the hardest thing in my entire career I would say that I have dealt with. Before this, I was managing all of product for Samsclub.com, which is part of Walmart, and I thought my job was hard then. And while we were serving customers, helping them check out, it still felt like we were on a growth path, and we could choose how fast we grew or how slowly we grew. And I always had teams that were looking at people who were trying to check out [but] couldn&#39;t and serving them while we were building longer-term architecture, but people&#39;s lives were not at stake; [it was] people&#39;s money — fraudsters using stolen credit cards and swindling the company of millions of dollars.</p><p> There is a team at Airbnb that is trying to protect the good and ward off the bad. What we do is that you have to get really good at prioritization, which is also very hard to do in the world of trust and safety.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And in many ways, I mean, the choices are what, Sam, you said in the beginning: These kinds of economies are not risk-free. They cannot be risk-free. And the good collectively outweighs the evil, so then it becomes all about prioritization. But I have to say, we&#39;ve talked to many people in analogous roles that you have, in other organizations — you mentioned Sam&#39;s Club, others — where they&#39;re using technology, digital AI/ML to drive a variety of use cases. I think yours stands out in the sense that it is a continuous balancing act, and the stakes are high. And then you have this sort of thread of purpose and the humility of saying, “Well, we believe that we&#39;ll make mistakes, and the system cannot be mistake-free.”</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> Yeah.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> But over time, things are getting better. Which brings me to my next question: How do you measure this, your effectiveness? Is it in terms of number of incidents, and some severity and frequency of bad things happening?</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> I&#39;m glad you asked this question, because I was naturally going to go toward this, which is, at the highest level, the metrics that we measure ourselves on are number of fraud incidents per million trips, number of safety incidents per million trips, as well as good user impact. That&#39;s the balancing metric to see “How many good listings did we block? How many good hosts and good guests did we prevent from moving forward to truly understand our false positives and false negatives?” But at the end of the day, it&#39;s good trips that we are looking at across the board.</p><p> We are also looking at dollars in terms of fraud loss that is potentially happening. We are looking at customer support tickets that are coming in, user NPS [Net Promoter Scores] resulting from anyone who encounters a friction that is thrown by our teams. So at a basic level, we are looking at these metrics. But one of the challenges that, for the first time, again, in my career I&#39;ve run into — not so much in the fraud world, where we can A/B test — we are constantly iterating our models.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> You are probably also, when you do that, preventing quite benign behaviors and intentions as well. But as you said, there is a point where the human judgment needs to trump and say that this is something where even the risk to one person might be too high. And yes, I mean, we always talk about exploration and exploitation when it comes to machine learning, and sort of ongoing feedback loops, but there&#39;s a cost to learning, always, right? But when I send you a marketing message you may not like, the cost of learning is very minimal, so I will send you many of them, and I&#39;ll do all kinds of A/B/X testing. But when I do that kind of A/B testing to groups or populations where the stakes are higher, then you might as well make that human judgment call of not doing it and relying on retrospective data.</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> Yeah.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And I think you elucidated that point quite well for us.</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> Yeah. And one question that we ask ourselves is, what makes a human being trust another human being? What makes a human being trust Airbnb? And we are realizing that we can [train] all kinds of models in the background, and you wouldn&#39;t even know whether you were in the risk threshold 1% or 2%, or marked as a good user.</p><p> But there is also a dialogue that needs to happen between Airbnb and you as a guest or you as a host, or between the host and the guest, that truly instills trust. Like when we ask someone, “Would you be comfortable sending your 17-year-old girl to a stranger&#39;s house in Greece, when she wants to backpack before joining college?” You can probably tell this is a personal experience. I have a 17-year-old who&#39;s about to go to college. And I realized that the first thought is, “No — not happening,” and I run trust and safety at Airbnb. But then when I think, “Well, if I could talk to the host; if she&#39;s going to stay with someone else in a house; if that person is a mom like me …”</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yes.</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> And we as Airbnb could say, “We are running all these models in the background; don&#39;t worry, your daughter is safe” — I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to fly. I think as a parent, you will want to have the information you need to see, even though your judgment may not be better than the machine&#39;s. So we are also working on, what is it that we need to say, that we need to do? And sometimes when we say things like, “Airbnb is not going to allow one-night stays that are booked at the last minute within the same neighborhood,” I think it makes a lot of parents feel better too, that OK, at least this option is gone. They will probably figure something else out. And that message cannot be convoluted. That message has to be simple. That message has to be clearly understood. And in addition to asking people what not to do, we also need to encourage people on what good behaviors they should do, like, talk to the host, talk to the guest, ask questions.</p><p> We have launched a program for solo female travelers because we were starting to see a slightly higher rate of maybe personal safety incidents in private rooms with solo female travelers. We started encouraging [women to] find out, is there going to be a lock in your room? Is that lock going to be working? Will you have access to the bathroom just by yourself? Which spaces are shared? Which are not? So this was not a model that was stopping anything. This was simply an educational module that we had published in multiple languages, which was really helpful for our solo travelers. Part of my team&#39;s work is not just to build invisible defenses but also to create trust and the perception of trust upfront through education and messaging.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Very well said. I have to say, you mentioned you&#39;re a mother of five. And I have to say, I think you stand on very solid ground when it comes to telling your kids what they can and cannot do, because you have so much data and so much experience, versus me when I say something and they&#39;re like, “Well, how would you know?” And you could say, “Well, trust me; I do 70 million transactions a year, and I know what&#39;s going on.”</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> And growing.是的。 I&#39;m happy to talk to your kids, by the way. Anytime.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yes, that would be great. I&#39;ll take you up on that.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> One thing about your measurements that I thought was interesting, maybe come back a little bit to that. You mentioned some positive metrics, too. So I think it&#39;s a little tempting, and I think even in this conversation we&#39;ve done that, is we titrate toward the negative. And that&#39;s the news problem in general — is that bad news sells papers. Well, I think in the course of this conversation, we&#39;ve shifted toward that. But some of the metrics you mentioned I thought had a more positive ring to them, didn&#39;t they?</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. And this was an epiphany that we have been having over the past few years, because any kind of machine learning model typically does well when there is a lot of data to learn from. And with these kinds of cases, where out of 70 million-plus trips, when 0.1% of those result in even a report, and a fraction of a fraction of those results in an actual incident where someone gets removed, there is very little to learn from, and as a result, these models take time to mature. Of course, with technology evolving, that is going to get better, but we realized that we have a lot more data about good user behavior.</p><p> We have a lot more users who are actually coming in, booking their stay months in advance; they are probably checking in on time, leaving the property even better than they found it, communicating with the host and the guests, leaving honest reviews. So if we can actually flip the switch, and while we need to continue to look for the anomalies and the trends and the bad actors, if we can get really good at learning what good behavior looks like while making sure that we are also measuring for potential bias or discrimination and privacy compliance in how we collect and use this data, then that can be really powerful in informing when something does look risky. For example, if an account typically is accessed from the US, [and] suddenly we see that that IP is now accessing from the Philippines, and it feels like “Oh, this is an account takeover.” But if this is a good user who has typically been traveling around the world quite a bit, maybe this is not an account takeover, and there is history there from the good user behavior for us to be smarter about “What does normal look like and what does an anomaly look like?” Not broadly, but very specifically, based on the user segment.</p><p> So this is not new stuff, but I think we sometimes tend to obsess about just really learning what bad behavior looks like and getting good at detecting that, as opposed to complementing what an anomaly looks like [compared] to what normal behavior looks like.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah. And you have such a wealth of insights and information in a field that is really an evolving field. I mean, it&#39;s not like a typical collaborative filtering situation where “users like you also bought this.” I mean, so much more goes on in terms of matching. This must be a very interesting and worthwhile problem to get your arms around.</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> Yeah. And it requires us to get out of our trust and safety silo and work really closely with our search, relevance, and personalization teams because our job — unlike my job when I used to work in e-commerce — is not just to do the collaborative filtering and say, “People like you bought this, so you should buy this,” or, “You traveled to Paris, so maybe next you want to go to Rome.”</p><p> It&#39;s about … you&#39;re traveling with the family this time. You have little kids; you probably want day care, and we know that this host offers day care, and this location might be great for you. Or with the same customer maybe traveling alone, maybe we need to offer up different recommendations. And having these trust and safety signals embedded into our search-relevance algorithms can get really powerful in matching the right person with the right listing.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Naba, you didn&#39;t start at Airbnb. Tell us a bit about how you got there. You referenced Walmart and some background there, but how did you end up in your current role?</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> I was the first female engineer in my family. My father took a chance on me and said, “You&#39;re curious. You&#39;re a forever learner. Do you want to do engineering?” And I had no idea what engineering was at that time, but I signed up anyway and went on to become the first female engineer in my family.</p><p> I worked with Tata Consultancy Services, then went on to join Cognizant, came through Cognizant to the US, and worked for some time at AAA. I would just keep going to different projects and different jobs that would help me learn something completely new.</p><p> Walmart happened around 2006. I was asked to work on supply chain at Walmart, which is probably, if you want to learn supply chain at a company, that&#39;s the company to go to. And while I was doing supply chain, every year I kept getting bigger and bigger responsibilities and projects until I found myself, from Walmart, leading almost all of the supply chain teams to going to Sam&#39;s Club, which is a part of Walmart — leading all of product and front end and cart and checkout and marketing and pricing, which I had never done before. But it gave me a chance to get a well-rounded experience learning how the back end of a large retailer works, as well as [how] front-end customer experience works.</p><p> And right after Sam&#39;s Club, I was asked to lead search. Right around that time, I was starting to get really interested in a world that runs on machine learning and AI, and search was a great landing ground for me. I did a course from MIT, interestingly, to learn about the application of AI and ML, and that gave me the courage to take on the search job.</p><p> And from there, Airbnb happened, after 13 years, almost, at Walmart. I was so curious about the travel industry and this marketplace that was so different from anything I had done in Walmart. So the theme here is that I have always gravitated toward something that helps me leverage the skills that I have but then use my curiosity and learning to do something completely new and build myself up as I go along. That&#39;s kind of my background.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Naba, we have a section now where we ask you a series of rapid-fire questions, and just tell us the first thing that comes to your mind. What is your proudest AI/ML moment?</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> You&#39;re asking me to choose between my different teams, which is career-limiting for me. But I will say that the work that we did on party detection and party risk reduction was groundbreaking, and there&#39;s no one else in the industry who did it the way we did, so that is [a] really proud [moment for me]. But I am proud of all my teams, just for the record.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That&#39;s a great answer. What worries you about AI?</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> What worries me is how powerful it is. We had a chance to get to see [OpenAI CEO] Sam Altman up close and in person as he came to Airbnb. And just how fast this technology is improving and how much capability it has … I worry about it falling into the wrong hands. I worry that while my team has this technology, the fraudsters have this technology too, and so I worry about, if today we are worried about fake IDs and fake spam messages being sent to our hosts and guests, how much more advanced this technology is going to get and how much more difficult it is going to get for us to detect the good from the bad. And I think it&#39;ll be AI to the rescue as well in detecting fake AI.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Your favorite activity that involves no technology?</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> Painting with watercolors. I love painting nature. And so paper, watercolors, and just peace and tranquility, no technology, is my favorite thing to do. And of course hugging my kids and spending time with them just listening to their day, trying to make them not be on their cellphones while they talk to me. Those two.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Very well said. The first career you wanted: What did you want to be when you grew up?</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> I wanted to be a teacher. I come from a family of teachers, and I feel so much joy when I&#39;m seeing someone&#39;s eyes light up with the gift of knowledge. I am a forever learner. Every job that I take has been completely different from my previous job; it&#39;s because I love to learn. And so, yeah, that&#39;s what I wanted to be.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And you probably do a fair amount of teaching in your current role anyway.</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> I do a lot of mentoring.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> You&#39;ve taught us quite a lot.</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> Thank you, thank you. I do do a lot of mentoring, because I feel like if someone else can see me do what I do, that will make them feel that they can do it too. So if I can just do that, that&#39;s my life&#39;s mission accomplished.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What&#39;s your greatest wish for AI in the future?</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> My greatest wish for the world, actually, is to not be so afraid; to give it a chance. Because I think sometimes our fear of the bad holds us from embracing the good. There is so much wasted effort that goes into activities that should be automated through AI — so many patients who are not getting treatment; so many companies that probably need help and need so much funding to stand up basic things that can be done by AI; so many countries, probably, who are underdeveloped [but could] get so much advantage. I know that when it falls into the wrong hands, it can be used for bad, but the world has more good people than bad people, and I believe in the power of us using AI for good — using our collective goodness.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I think everyone will probably resonate with your idea that the world is better than it is bad. We do tend to hear most of the negative stories, but it&#39;s refreshing to hear how, one, how much attention you&#39;re paying to try and to prevent those, but also to hear something about the good stories too that your platform enables. Thank you for taking the time to talk with us today. We&#39;ve enjoyed it.</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Shervin.

The ubiquitous corporate practice of repurchasing shares has been the focus of much political and media scrutiny. The federal Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 included a 1% excise tax on repurchases (which President Biden has proposed increasing to 4% in his 2024 budget). In addition, senior Democrats have shown interest in barring executives from selling shares for three years after a repurchase, the federal government has suggested that companies that give up buybacks will receive preferential treatment, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed a significant increase in the extent and frequency of repurchase reporting.</p><p> The debate on the economic consequences of stock buybacks has so far tended to focus on small samples or cherry-picked examples. Given that thousands of companies repurchase their shares each year, and aggregate repurchases have exceeded $500 billion annually for the past five years, we decided that a large-sample study of repurchasing behavior was warranted. Our study, published in the journal <cite>Financial Management</cite> , outlines the benefits of the practice, as stated by its proponents, and provides evidence that casts doubt on the alleged costs cited by its critics.</p><p></p><p> Critics of buybacks typically make three arguments against the practice. First, they claim that share repurchases enable companies to manipulate the market either by increasing the demand for — and therefore the price of — shares or by tricking naive investors by inflating earnings per share (EPS). Second, they allege that share repurchases enable insiders to benefit through compensation contracts or the sale of shares at inflated prices. And lastly, critics charge that share repurchases crowd out investment and thus sacrifice innovation and long-term economic growth.</p><p> Meanwhile, those who support or engage in stock buybacks offer several justifications for the practice. First, payouts to shareholders align manager and shareholder incentives by reducing the potential misuse of free cash flow. Second, using repurchases instead of or in addition to dividends gives corporations flexibility in the amount of cash returned to shareholders, the ability to award repurchased shares to employees as equity compensation, a modest tax advantage to shareholders (less pronounced since the 2003 dividend tax cut), and the ability to signal the company&#39;s good prospects to the market. Finally, share repurchases represent well-disclosed and regulated arm&#39;s length transactions at current market prices between willing participants.</p><p> Given the drive to regulate share repurchases, we would expect evidence of their drawbacks to be observable in public data. To test this, we documented trends in repurchases and compared trading volume, share price performance, CEO pay, and corporate financial activities (evidenced by investment and profitability) of companies that do and do not repurchase shares. We segmented the businesses that repurchased shares in two ways: (1) small positive versus large positive repurchase amounts (defined as below versus above median values), and (2) frequent versus infrequent repurchasers (defined as companies that repurchase in one or two quarters as opposed to three or four quarters of the year).</p><p> Our large-sample evidence on thousands of US exchange-listed companies over the past three decades shows that repurchases in the US are a mainstream corporate financial activity that returns several hundred billion dollars of capital to shareholders annually. At an aggregate level, we found that this activity neither creates nor destroys much wealth (that is, it does not produce significant changes in share price). In addition, while repurchases are associated with higher past profitability, they are not associated with excessive CEO pay or underinvestment.</p><p> Trends in aggregate repurchasing activity over time indicate that while repurchases have quickly grown in value, much of the growth can be attributed to inflation and increases in market capitalization. In addition, repurchases are now similar in size to dividends and have not grown faster than dividends for quite some time. However, unlike dividends, repurchases drop precipitously (and temporarily) in times of corporate stress, indicating that they do in fact provide companies with the aforementioned benefit of payout flexibility.</p><p></p><h3> A Closer Look at the Data</h3><p> Through our analysis, we were able to systematically address each of the stated criticisms of stock buybacks.</p><p> First, do companies use share repurchases to manipulate the market by creating excess demand to drive up stock prices? If they do, companies that repurchase shares should have higher trading volumes than those that do not. But average trading volumes have largely remained quite similar for all listed companies, regardless of whether or how often they repurchase shares. In fact, in recent years, the trading volumes for companies that do not repurchase shares have greatly exceeded those of repurchasing companies, suggesting that any excess volume arising from repurchases is dwarfed by other forces.</p><p> If naive investors are tricked into buying shares of companies that engage in repurchasing behavior because of the resulting EPS inflation, we should observe short-term price bumps followed by poor long-term performance. However, regardless of whether or how intensely and frequently companies repurchased shares, we found no evidence that companies significantly outperformed in the quarters with repurchases. While we did find some marginal evidence that companies that intensely repurchase do outperform slightly in the quarter after repurchases, we found no evidence of future reversals in the short or long terms. This pattern of outperformance is more consistent with companies using repurchases to signal undervaluation — a benefit to investors — rather than to manipulate the market.</p><p></p><p> The second critique is that repurchases allow insiders to unfairly profit. If share repurchases as rent-seeking behavior by insiders were a common, systematic abuse, CEOs whose companies buy back shares would receive abnormally high pay, including salary, bonuses, and the value of equity awards. Using a model-generated measure of excess pay that has been vetted in earlier academic literature, we estimate that CEOs of companies that make large positive repurchases earn only $51,000 more than CEOs of companies that do not repurchase shares — a statistically and economically insignificant amount of excess pay. The difference is even smaller — $4,000 — when we compare CEOs of companies that repurchase frequently with those that do not repurchase. These differences are economically tiny in relation to the average CEO&#39;s pay of several million dollars. Surprisingly, CEOs of companies that repurchase infrequently or repurchase small positive amounts earn the least excess pay, less than even the CEOs of non-repurchasing companies. None of this evidence suggests that companies use repurchases to boost CEO pay.</p><p> The third and final critique is that repurchases reduce companies&#39; ability to take advantage of investment opportunities, thereby sacrificing innovation and economic growth. We found that companies that do not repurchase shares invest more but are significantly less profitable than those that do repurchase shares. The companies that repurchase frequently and in large amounts are highly profitable and have steadily made investments in the past, and they continue to make large investments and, at the same time, return capital to shareholders. This suggests that profitable companies repurchase shares while maintaining a steady level of investment, whereas less profitable or loss-making companies do not (or maybe cannot) repurchase shares but are more investment-intensive in the hope of becoming profitable. While there might be isolated examples of poorly governed companies that choose to avoid profitable investments and instead return capital to willing shareholders, it is hard to see how directives encouraging or incentivizing such poorly run companies to retain cash would lead them to make good investments.</p><p> Potential stakeholders who may be affected by repurchase regulations include managers, other employees, shareholders, governments, and society at large. If a company is profitable, a CEO can pay excess cash out to shareholders in the form of buybacks or dividends, keep the money on their balance sheets, or invest in new projects. A small tax on share repurchases may not change corporate behavior significantly and might raise a small amount of revenue for the government. But if the tax rate grows high enough, companies will choose to not buy back shares and instead pay out exclusively via dividends or retain cash. In that case, the government raises no revenue but implements a de facto ban on share repurchases.</p><h3> How a Buyback Ban Could Backfire</h3><p> If a company were to switch to only paying out dividends, shareholders would lose the ability to choose whether to receive a cash payout and could face negative tax ramifications, given that dividends are taxed as income while capital gains are often taxed at a lower rate, and only when gains are realized. In addition, the company would lose important flexibility in difficult times, because cutting dividends is punished more by the market than cutting repurchases.</p><p></p><p> However, the move to restrict stock buybacks seems intended not to motivate companies to shift to paying back shareholders through dividends but to invest more in the business. There is evidence that retained cash is correlated with CEOs making value-destroying decisions, such as pursuing empire-building mergers, accruing personal expenses, or funding pet projects. It seems implausible that restrictions on share repurchases would induce CEOs of poorly governed companies to invest in value-enhancing projects that they otherwise would not have been funding.</p><p></p><p> From an employee standpoint, there is some evidence that labor unions are able to negotiate more successfully if their employers have excess cash, but there is plenty of evidence that constraints on a company&#39;s flexibility to raise and distribute capital is bad for employees, especially during downturns. Empire-building mergers can also be bad for employees, given that M&amp;As often result in the employees of the acquisition target being laid off and employees of the acquiring company being misallocated. In addition, some repurchased shares are reissued to employees, making any actions that are bad for shareholders also bad for stockholding employees.</p><p> Overall, our results show an absence of correlation between share repurchases and price manipulation, return reversals, excess CEO compensation, and underinvestment, which makes it highly implausible that economically significant causal effects of share repurchases still underlie the data. Corporations lose flexibility if they have to rely only on dividends, and evidence shows that poorly governed CEOs who retain cash often spend it on value-destroying mergers, expenses, or pet projects. It is implausible that policies designed to reduce repurchases will also reduce alleged but unobserved malpractices without imposing costs on US public companies and other stakeholders.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-case-against-restricting-stock-buybacks/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Are You Ready for the Next Supply Disruption?</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/are-you-ready-for-the-next-supply-disruption/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/are-you-ready-for-the-next-supply-disruption/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 13 Jul 2023 13:46:34 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[M.

But it&#39;s possible to have a high-performing, healthy workplace culture in a hybrid workplace, with flexibility in when and where people work. It just needs to be managed differently.</p><p> That was the message of Future Forum&#39;s Brian Elliott, who presented on a panel with N. Sharon Hill of the George Washington University School of Business and Julie Dervin of Atlassian during <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/series/work-23-the-big-shift/">Work/23</a> , an <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> symposium held in May 2023.</p><p> Elliott said that 93% of the 10,243 knowledge workers his company polled said they want flexibility in when they work. Those who were given some choice, he said, had <a href="https://futureforum.com/research/future-forum-pulse-winter-2022-2023-snapshot/">productivity scores 39% higher</a> than those who were not. Those with some flexibility about <em>where</em> they work also scored higher (8%).</p><p></p><p></p><p> Finding an equilibrium between employees&#39; desire for flexibility and an organization&#39;s strategic goals requires a reexamination of the kinds of work that need to be done in person. It also may require different work configurations for different groups within the same organization, and it certainly requires different ways of benchmarking the work employees accomplish.</p><p> Attendees had more questions for the presenters than there was time for, and Elliott agreed to answer some after the event. (Questions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity.)</p><h6> How do you measure productivity? Most workers say they are more productive working from home and on their own schedule, but are they really?</h6><p> Here&#39;s a heretical take: We need to stop trying to measure productivity in knowledge work and focus all that time and energy on measuring outcomes.</p><p> Productivity metrics take outputs (emails sent, cases closed) and divide them by inputs (hours active), and the better ones adjust for quality (cases reopened). That can work, somewhat, for rote, routine tasks, which are what get automated over time. But also, those metrics can be gamed, and people will game them — up to and including buying <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHBQQVG">mouse jigglers</a> . As Dominic Price of Atlassian has <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/the-problem-with-productivity-metrics">written</a> , “Productivity has always been a good way to measure the impact of machines and capital. It&#39;s just never been a good way to measure the impact of <em>humans</em> .”</p><p> At Future Forum, we&#39;ve ventured into this; we compared populations with and without flexibility to see that those with location flexibility report higher productivity scores, and those with schedule flexibility have an even bigger advantage. There are also academic studies by Stanford&#39;s <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30292">Nick Bloom</a> , HBS&#39;s <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30292">Raj Choudhury</a> , and others that show the same thing.</p><p> But it&#39;s an odd question in that we didn&#39;t ask it when people were in the office. We simply assumed that because people were present, they were doing something productive. We all know that&#39;s not accurate.</p><p> Instead, let&#39;s skip the whole mess and take the time to get clear on our organization&#39;s objectives and key results (OKRs), and do it in a way that those can cascade down by business unit and function, and to the team level. From the team level, much can be taken to the individual level to find the individual&#39;s impact both in terms of what they did and how they were as a teammate.</p><p> Assessing people on the impact they have on a team&#39;s goals is harder but will take us a lot further than installing more productivity metrics that measure their inputs and outputs.</p><h6> Random collisions seem to be key in driving innovation. How do you promote serendipity in terms of making connections across teams?</h6><p> Connections are an essential part of employee engagement and retention, but the connection to innovation is at best spurious. <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=991">Study</a> after <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4093796">study</a> has shown that what really enables innovation is psychological safety.</p><p> In research we conducted in 2021, Future Forum found that location (whether fully onsite, hybrid, or fully remote) had little to no correlation to team innovation. Instead, what <em>did</em> matter were factors like whether people felt they could ask questions and whether teams were willing to take risks — that is, whether they felt psychological safety.</p><p> Building connections is important, but we should do it intentionally in organizations instead of relying on random chance. Here are three ways you can do this:</p><p> <strong>1. Intentional cross-team connections.</strong> Programs like open brown-bag lunches where a rotating cast of internal experts present or host an “ask me anything session,” bringing leaders from other functions into your quarterly planning cycles, and creating public channels in Slack or Teams for sharing insights based on topics (like AI) can go a long way.</p><p> <strong>2. Leverage tools to build connections.</strong> Products like Donut, an app for Slack or Teams that pairs up individuals across teams programmatically, help ensure that everyone gets connected, not just those who work on the same floor or in the same building.</p><p> <strong>3. Help new employees build a network.</strong> One of the big challenges of the past few years is that too many companies hired people without rethinking how they build connections and get to understand the culture. One of my favorite tips comes from Genpact in Europe, where new employees are given six people to meet outside their team, either in person or at a virtual coffee, and each of those is supposed to provide two to three more contacts.</p><p> Investing in new tools and processes can also be a big boost. Think about processes like <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/12/using-brainwriting-for-rapid-idea-generation/">brainwriting</a> before a brainstorming session: Allowing people the heads-down space to think about some research results or a problem, write out their thoughts ahead of time, and then share with the group at the same time brings out more new ideas. It also lowers the odds of groupthink.</p><p></p><h6> How can you communicate an expectation that people should come into the office one or two days a week in a way that is inspiring and inclusive, and not forceful and dictatory?</h6><p> The last two years are littered with companies that declared that three days a week in person is the answer and saw 1.5 days a week as an average. This hides the fact that there&#39;s typically a more junior group of employees coming in two or three days a week, while more senior employees are coming in less often.</p><p> Repeating the policy doesn&#39;t work, and threatening to fire people who don&#39;t come in more often is unrealistic and breeds resentment. Leadership knows that it&#39;s some of the more experienced, critical talent that&#39;s coming in less often. The junior staff knows this too.</p><p> Instead, what we&#39;ve seen work is focusing on helping teams figure out their own rhythms through team-level agreements. The needs of a sales team and an engineering team, for instance, are different. The sales team might end up mandating two days a week that are default days in the office, and stacking those days with specific activities that are more “heads-up” than heads-down, such as training sessions, mentoring hours, and one-on-ones. The engineering team, on the other hand, might end up with one week of the month in person for planning, lunches together, and demo days.</p><p> Encouraging senior staff to come in at least one day a week for mentoring sessions, to be available for training, and for coffee with junior staff goes a lot further than simply telling them to show up.</p><p> The other critical element is that coming to the office can&#39;t be consistently worse than working at home. People don&#39;t want free lunch all the time, they want a place for team meetings, the ability to find a quiet spot for customer calls, and Wi-Fi that works. For a large number of companies, that requires redesigning the workspace.</p><h6> What should managers do to avoid having flexible work perpetuate or even exaggerate existing biases in the workplace? Being “out of sight, out of mind” is a real concern.</h6><p> Proximity bias and the chances of presenteeism leading to better opportunities as well as rewards is a real risk. We need to create a level playing field, and that starts with training managers and leaders to assess team and individual performance on the outcomes they generate, not the inputs (hours in the office, speed of response, being always-on). Leaders and their people partners need to look not only at the promotion and rewards cycle but also at their talent development pipeline and who&#39;s getting the new, shiny projects.</p><p> Working with the Slack executive team, we set a rule that all of the senior executives&#39; regular reviews — such as the CMO&#39;s weekly review of new project proposals — be done entirely virtually. That helped not only the usual challenges of people not hearing those at the other end of the room but also the pressure to be “in the room where it happens” for those meetings, which more junior staff might attend only once or twice a year.</p><h6> Many companies and industries outside of tech have a split between knowledge workers and those who need to be present in person to do their job (such as retail and manufacturing). How would you recommend positioning flexibility so as not to create an unfair dual standard?</h6><p> The differences between desk (office) workers and deskless (or front-line) workers extend far beyond the ability to work remotely: They include pay, benefits, facilities, training, and more.</p><p> The talent shortage in deskless workers is a massive challenge for many companies. But I don&#39;t think the answer is to force desk workers back into offices full-time. That doesn&#39;t really solve any issues for deskless workers.</p><p> The answer here is investing in the specific needs of deskless workers. According to <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/why-deskless-workers-are-leaving-and-how-to-win-them-back">research by Boston Consulting Group</a> , schedule flexibility and choice are top factors in talent retention. Leaders are investing in programs like the ability to swap shifts and having multiple types of schedules for call center workers. Neiman Marcus Group reduced turnover by 20% by offering sales associates flexibility in choice of stores and departments, as well as hours.</p><h6> I&#39;m at a startup. In a budding company, management focuses a lot on work culture as they grow. How does a startup, or any enterprise for that matter, build culture while allowing a remote or hybrid model?</h6><p> I&#39;m a strong believer that culture is built regardless of where you are located, the slogans on the wall, or the quality of the happy hours. Culture gets built based on the everyday experiences your employees have and the decisions you make: what you prioritize as a company, how you treat your customers and employees, what projects you resource, and whom you reward.</p><p></p><p> That said, there are a set of practices that I&#39;ve seen used that really help build a solid foundation. Here are three of them:</p><p></p><p> First, digital-first doesn&#39;t mean “never in person.” Getting people together, even if widely distributed, is an important part of building culture. For teams, I&#39;d recommend — at least quarterly — a few days focused primarily on team building, socialization, and connection. As a startup grows, this often goes from everyone quarterly to teams quarterly and everyone once a year.</p><p> Second, get clarity on how you work together, and share more about yourself. Your <a href="https://futureforum.com/2022/06/23/team-level-agreements/">team-level agreement</a> shouldn&#39;t just focus on how often people are together, it should also get into how you communicate, how you make decisions, and more. Sharing tools like <a href="https://futureforum.com/2022/07/15/personal-user-manual/">personal user manuals</a> can also go a long way toward establishing a culture of trust.</p><p> And third, create transparency at work. One of the key factors that drive culture is leadership communication, and as a company scales, it&#39;s important to remain transparent while putting in place guardrails. What topics matter to your company and mission most? How do we interact with one another? Scaling internal communications from CEO “ask me anything” sessions to public forums for knowledge sharing takes time and effort; <a href="https://slack.com/blog/transformation/a-modern-leaders-guide-to-organizational-transparency">guidelines from others</a> can help.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/flexible-and-effective-leadership-strategies-for-the-hybrid-workplace/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
