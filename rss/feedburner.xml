class="attribution">布莱恩·斯托弗/theispot.com</p></figcaption></figure><p>领导者喜欢表现出他们重视员工。他们宣称团队中的每个人对于组织的成功都至关重要。尽管这种情绪令人振奋，但事实并非如此。只有优秀的人担任最关键的角色，人才才能成为竞争优势的源泉。让明星从事不重要的工作只是浪费人才。</p><p>战略执行中公认的智慧是，集中力量的集中应用——识别、开发和利用关键能力——是成功的必要条件。然而，除非这些能力转化为具体的角色，并建立适当的制度来确保高素质的员工担任这些职位，否则战略只是一个意图。不幸的是，太多的组织围绕他们当时拥有的人员和当前的技能来制定战略——而他们应该制定最有前途的战略，更好地了解执行战略时最关键的角色，然后配备人员这些角色拥有最优秀的人才。正如我们将演示的，将数据和分析应用于该问题可以帮助您准确确定需要将顶尖人才安置在哪里。</p><p></p><p>有两种方法可以确定哪些角色对关键结果影响最大：使用数据自下而上推断和自上而下推断。在上下文合适且数据可用的情况下，采用自下而上的方法可能会产生令人惊讶的答案。在这种情况下，领导者必须准备好让见解指导他们的决策。</p><h3>数据揭示差异制造者</h3><p>数据可以用来帮助弄清楚谁是你当前的明星，以及哪些职位对组织成果影响最大。在绩效是团队努力的情况下，它可以帮助识别隐藏的人才，并指出对成功可能比领导层意识到的更重要的角色。</p><p>以足球为例：关于场上哪些位置最有价值存在很多争论。前锋，包括前锋，是主要得分手——他们通过进球而成为众人瞩目的焦点，并获得最高的薪水。根据 2023 年<cite>《福布斯》</cite>报告，全球收入最高的 50 名运动员中包括 6 名足球运动员，而且他们都是前锋。</p><p>由于足球是一项低得分运动，因此每个进球都很重要，因此阻止对手进球同样重要。因此，有些人认为防守者是最有价值的球员。中后卫在配合反击中起着至关重要的作用，关键时刻停球失败会给对手创造很大的得分机会。中后卫比其他位置球员更频繁地担任球队队长也就不足为奇了。</p><p></p><p>当然，守门员是最后的防守者：他们在面对极端压力时的判断力和技巧可能决定胜败。还有一些人认为中场球员推动了比赛的节奏。正如控制棋盘的中心对于赢得国际象棋比赛至关重要一样，中场球员可以通过关闭对手的传球路线或通过从防守球员到进攻前锋的适时分配来发起进攻，从而放大每个人贡献的影响。最后，特级大师可能是教练，他对阵容、位置和总体策略做出决定。</p><p>为了确定每个角色的相对贡献，我们收集并分析了德国顶级足球联赛德甲联赛五年的数据，并评估了 2014 年至 2019 年间足球场上各个位置的重要性。</p><p>通过分析玩家在不同角色和团队之间转换时结果的变化，我们按位置隔离贡献，同时观察财富随着这种转换而上升和下降。建立了每个位置如何对结果做出贡献的模型，我们通过测量当我们依次从模型中省略每个角色时模型的获胜预测恶化的程度来加权位置的重要性。</p><p>我们的分析表明，后卫和守门员对于赢得比赛最为关键；它们在我们开发的两种不同型号中占据了前三名。前五名中始终存在四个位置：左后卫、右后卫、守门员和进攻型左中场。尽管防守球员可能不会得到那么多球迷的喜爱，但数据表明他们是获胜的最大因素。</p><p>无论行业如何，这种分析都有效。每个组织或职能部门都可能有自己未被充分重视的角色。虽然销售团队可能会获得该帐户，但服务部门可能会每年更新该帐户。</p><p>人才稀缺也很重要。比较后卫、中场和中后卫的左右位置，左侧的角色贡献不成比例地更多。为什么？虽然左脚足球运动员在这些角色上自然具有优势，但世界级左脚球员的数量比右脚球员要少得多。在杰出人才稀缺的关键职位上，让优秀的人才担任这些职位就显得尤为重要。</p><p>组织领导和结构也很重要。当纳入模型时，教练是第三重要的因素，仅次于后卫位置。团队组织、游戏系统和人员配置决定了关键角色的部署方式。在德甲联赛中，4-5-1阵型——四名后卫、五名中场和一名前锋——是最成功的阵型。它支持优先考虑防御阵地的战略，并且是战略与组织如何围绕关键角色配置自身之间一致性的一个很好的例子。</p><p></p><h3>使用数据来填补关键角色</h3><p>通过结合绩效和人力资源数据，可以将类似的分析方法应用于企业。对于拥有多单位结构（例如多个商店、配送中心或服务团队）的公司来说，好消息是您不需要足球联赛的数据 — 您可以自己完成此操作。具有共同角色的多单位组织提供了跨单位捕获数据并隔离差异角色的机会。</p><p>首先，收集按位置、角色和时间来识别员工的数据。其次，一定要了解影响结果但与人员配置无关的背景因素（例如，商店的表现可能因位置、年龄、业态或季节而异）。这使您可以将个人对结果的影响与环境因素分开。第三，收集本单位的绩效成果数据；最好获得多种类型的指标，因为结果是多维的。</p><p>在我们与一家全国性零售商的合作中，我们在五年内从数百家商店收集了此类数据。我们通过收入、利润、增长、员工流动率和破损率来衡量每月商店绩效。我们发现商店经理非常重要：21% 的收入业绩可归因于商店经理——比商店属性重要三倍多——而且他们对利润率有着巨大的影响。区域经理也产生了可衡量的效果，但他们的影响力不如商店经理。正如预期的那样，地区和区域经理的影响因指标而异。虽然商店经理对收入的影响最大，但利润率表现更受地区和区域经理的影响，他们对采购决策有重要影响。</p><p>就像足球一样，结构和系统很重要。我们的研究发现，距离总部较近的门店表现较好，这促使我们进一步探索如何支持较远的门店。从员工流动性中还可以获得宝贵的见解。当人们停留在自己的角色和位置时，不可能使用数据来区分人们与周围环境的影响。让人们经历不同的环境不仅让他们有机会发展和成长，还增强了数据，可以更精确地衡量角色和执行角色的人员的影响。</p><p></p><p>对于我们合作的零售商来说，这些见解改变了人才战略。最初，领导者们打算为地区和区域经理创建一个培训学院计划，因为他们认为职责范围更广的高层管理人员对绩效更重要。在考虑了我们的分析结果之后，他们转而探讨哪些行为和实践对于商店经理的关键角色至关重要。他们在全公司范围内发起了一项努力，以谷歌名为“氧气计划”的内部研究为模型，提取出对公司业绩产生积极影响的管理者的特质。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a>一旦他们确定了这一关键角色的细节，他们就能够集中投资来大规模开发和复制该工作的能力。</p><h3>人才洞察和可持续竞争优势</h3><p>奥克兰运动家队的比利·比恩利用数据以惊人的低成本组建了一支高绩效球队。作为总经理，他的策略是使用不同的表现指标来寻找被低估的球员，这些球员对赢得比赛的贡献比在传统衡量标准上表现良好的球员更多。这种方法的成功很快被整个联盟效仿，削弱了A队的战略优势。数据驱动的关键岗位人才决策带来的优势也会如此短暂吗？</p><p>有一个关键的区别需要注意。田径运动研究了识别优秀球员的措施——但这些球员在任何球队都可能表现出色。良好战略的标志是竞争优势的来源与其他战略承诺相互关联，因此难以复制。寻找关键角色并围绕这些角色建立一个组织可能比寻找隐藏的明星更具有防御性，因为战略优势与组织如何支持这些角色并开发填补这些角色的渠道息息相关。</p><p>德甲联赛不仅以其防守而闻名，还以其人才来源而闻名。它缺乏英超联赛等拥有亿万富翁老板的联赛的财务实力。然而，德国足球体系致力于培养年轻人才，而不是依赖高价转会成熟球星，这对于需要在球场上证明自己的年轻球员（包括来自德国以外的年轻球员）来说是一个有吸引力的选择。由于其他为高价转会付出高昂代价的联盟有义务让这些天才球员上场时间更长，因此他们削弱了对年轻新兴人才的价值主张。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a>就像比恩的获胜运动队一样，对被低估的球员进行套利有一个优势，无论是防守球员还是年轻球员。然而，与美国职业棒球大联盟的案例不同，模仿德甲的优势需要对策略进行重大调整——这是许多球队甚至联盟都没有准备好的。</p><h3>基于差异化能力执行</h3><p>战略就是定义如何取胜——它需要致力于打造一流的能力。但没有一家公司能够在所有方面都做到最好。成功的战略需要专注并敏锐地意识到哪些角色是极其重要的，并进行适当的投资。如果不承认这一点，整个战略就会面临风险。通过将抽象能力转化为具体工作，组织可以更好地将其战略变为现实。</p><p>领导者可以借鉴足球战术，为自己的组织考虑以下教训：</p><p><strong>了解您的关键角色以及您需要投资的地方。</strong>尽管后卫的作用不太明显，但对于赢得足球比赛来说，后卫比其他位置更重要。在招聘、培养和留住人才时，对存在差异性角色的洞察应该引导注意力和投资。虽然了解你的关键贡献者很重要，但了解你在关键角色中的不足也同样重要。</p><p>此外，关键角色可能会随着时间的推移而发生变化。随着竞争格局的演变，差异化地位也会发生变化。要想持续获胜，不仅需要监控关键角色是什么，还需要监控它们可能如何转变。</p><p></p><p>对关键职位的投资不仅仅是为了寻找优秀的人才，还在于创建所需的系统和实践，首先关注职位，然后关注填补这些职位的人员。人们很容易被星星的亮度所蒙蔽，并屈服于热切地吸收它们，无论它们处于什么位置。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a>围绕这些明星建立一个系统会使组织变得脆弱：他们变得过度依赖这些明星，并偏离了战略与人才部署相一致的目标。</p><p><strong>尽可能使用数据，并投资使其信息丰富。</strong>当您的组织中有多单位结构时，您可以利用它来系统地研究角色。许多公司都投资了衡量业务部门、产品、地区或商店绩效的系统。由于大多数组织没有明确地将组织绩效和人力资源信息联系起来，因此需要额外的投资才能将这些信息与人员数据连接起来。此外，通常选择将人员留在固定位置，而不是在不同的环境中轮换。但是，在人们的工作方式和地点上引入一些差异的做法可以让我们深入了解哪些角色可以推动绩效。这些见解可以突显无名英雄的贡献，并突显培训和招聘方面的投资可以在哪些方面带来最大的绩效收益。</p><p><strong>根据关键技能进行招聘和发展。</strong>如今，资历和血统在人才市场上的影响力太大；此外，它们还具有巩固关于角色中重要事项的常识的作用。正如领导者可能会被误导，不知道什么角色最重要一样，他们也可能会误入歧途，不知道这些角色中的哪些技能和行为会产生影响。通过识别关键角色中的关键能力，组织既可以奖励重要的事情，又可以制定招聘、留住和培养具有此类技能的员工的蓝图。</p><p><strong>调整系统和结构。</strong>担任关键角色的才华横溢的员工需要得到能够发挥其优势的系统和结构的支持。与德甲球队发现的在场上定位中优先考虑防守角色可以增加成功几率的方式类似，组织需要创造性地思考什么样的结构可以让那些从事关键工作的人释放出最好的工作。这些投资既可以让您的关键角色做出更多贡献，又可以让您的战略不易被复制。</p><p></p><p><strong>认识到领导力的关键作用。</strong>在足球队中，教练是赢得比赛的第三重要因素。领导者制定战略，然后建立并激励支持战略的团队。由于整个组织的协调非常重要，任何识别、投资和培养关键角色的有意义的步骤都需要来自高层的支持。当战略的改变需要培养历史上薄弱的关键角色的人才时，这一点尤其重要。领导者需要加强承诺，为团队和潜在员工支持新的关键角色。</p><p></p><p>在足球比赛中，胜利可能取决于很小的差异。虽然良好的团队合作至关重要，但这项运动的高度集成性掩盖了关键角色的含义。深思熟虑地使用数据可以揭示团队中的关键角色，并发现挑战传统智慧的令人惊讶的结果。对关键角色的洞察力不仅可以为您的战略提供信息——它本身也可能是竞争优势的来源。</p><p></p>

Making public statements in support of DEI can help establish accountability goals, but unfortunately, it seems that a growing number of leaders are choosing silence or capitulation in response to anti-diversity activists.</p><p> We see a similar phenomenon in how the right-wing rejection of climate science has led some leaders to downplay sustainability goals, a practice known as <em>greenhushing</em> . A recent <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0047287520930087">study</a> examining this dynamic in the hospitality industry found that consumers preferred when hotels communicated their corporate social responsibility efforts rather than engaging in greenhushing. Interestingly, the study found that such communications also prompted consumers to consider the ethics of their own choices. Similarly, we believe that openly discussing an organization&#39;s commitment to address systemic issues through accountability reduces resistance to initiatives that can change behaviors and attitudes and lead to progress.</p><p></p><p> Organizations should confront the diversity backlash, along with the empty nature of superficial diversity policies, head-on. With diversity training increasingly criticized and White fatigue derailing serious discussions of racism, racial inclusion in organizations faces an existential threat. Resisting this diversity retreat requires organizational accountability to the broad array of commitments made in response to acknowledged racial injustices.</p><p> For organizations committed to embedding equity within their mission, values, culture, and practices, we recommend taking a strategic planning approach. Expectations for overnight results must be regulated by realistic goals that are results-oriented and measurable, with targeted dates for completion. This process must include a feedback loop design that allows for corrections in planning, implementing, and executing, thus providing managers with openings to check for impact and progress. Recent events give organizations an opportunity to reaffirm and strengthen their commitments to working toward creating an equitable organization by stamping out inequality.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/countering-the-corporate-diversity-backlash/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> How Outlawing Collegiate Affirmative Action Will Impact Corporate America</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-outlawing-collegiate-affirmative-action-will-impact-corporate-america/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-outlawing-collegiate-affirmative-action-will-impact-corporate-america/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 11:00:59 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Derek R.

This was a momentous decision that stands to have widespread societal and organizational implications. Although the scope of the ruling was limited to college admissions, we can draw upon existing data to forecast the impact on corporate America. The evidence clearly points to two key outcomes: First, collegiate patterns of racioethnic diversity will change fairly dramatically; and second, these changes will have considerable downstream consequences for workplace composition as well as patterns of racioethnic inequity across a host of other measures.</p><p> As tempting as it might be to view those conclusions as hyperbolic, research on three decades of state-level affirmative action bans strongly suggests otherwise. In fact, eradicating affirmative action has led to reductions in the proportions of underrepresented (Black and Hispanic) students in undergraduate and graduate programs, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and math; it has also led to fewer underrepresented students enrolled in and graduating from medical and law schools. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> These effects tend to be lasting — and, importantly, implementing alternative policies that don&#39;t explicitly consider race and ethnicity has done little to counter them. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a></p><p></p><p> Extending these state-level findings to the national level suggests that employers will have less racioethnically diverse college-educated talent to draw upon when filling their vacancies, particularly from premier institutions. Alternatively, the Black and Hispanic candidates within their applicant pools are less likely to be selected because they will be less credentialed as a result of having fewer degrees or having graduated from lower-ranked colleges, where they are more likely to apply and be accepted post-affirmative action. A somewhat less-intuitive consequence is that the White (and Asian) graduates of more prestigious colleges and universities will have had less exposure to people of other racioethnic backgrounds. This has implications for their multicultural competence — the ability to relate to those dissimilar from oneself — and may help account for why employers tend to pay higher starting salaries to graduates of more racioethnically diverse business schools and universities. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p> The fallout within Black and Hispanic communities stands to be devastating. Most notably, there will be fewer minority professionals to help meet the needs of racioethnically similar minority clientele. Though this might seem to be more a matter of convenience, it is especially troubling in fields like medicine or law (which employs attorneys and members of law enforcement), where minority underrepresentation is often noted as a contributing factor to well-documented racioethnic health care and criminal justice disparities. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p> Lower odds of graduating from a more prestigious school or graduating at all also have implications for racioethnic inequality within organizations. This begins with underrepresented minorities being less apt to obtain a job or more likely to land a lower-quality one. It goes on to influence outcomes spanning the entire human resources management landscape, from entry to exit, because initial placements have lasting consequences for things like compensation, promotions, training/development, retention/separation, and deployment. For instance, even Black and Hispanic professionals who gain access to employment opportunities may be more likely to find themselves facing the “last hired, first fired” phenomenon. Moreover, a low starting salary can affect the size of raises or competitive offers from other companies and has deleterious compounding effects on one&#39;s retirement savings.</p><p></p><p> Those seeking even more concrete evidence that outlawing collegiate affirmative action can influence diversity in corporate America need look no further than recent research by Harvard Business School professor Letian Zhang. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> He examined affirmative action bans&#39; effect on whether people from different racial backgrounds became managers, using data from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on more than 11,000 private-sector US businesses from 1985 to 2015. He anticipated that executives might interpret bans as a sort of license to discriminate and, therefore, be less likely to hire Black managers or promote Black candidates. The results showed that “after a state adopts the affirmative action ban, growth in the proportion of Black managers in establishments with corporate headquarters in that state slows down by more than 50% and this slowdown is mostly concentrated in firms with politically conservative CEOs.”</p><p> By widening the collegiate achievement gap, the ban on affirmative action in colleges actually kicks the proverbial can of equal opportunity further down the road by adding larger higher education differentials to existing racial differences in wealth and access to quality preschool and K-12 education that also disfavor underrepresented minorities. Ironically, this further enhances the need for workplace affirmative action strategies just to maintain the racial status quo. That said, any such efforts will almost certainly be challenged along legal grounds, and the Supreme Court (at least as currently constituted) has shown itself highly unlikely to view such efforts favorably.</p><p></p><p> In fact, in a form of preemptive strike, 13 state attorneys general recently informed companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Uber that they should expect greater scrutiny of any policies perceived as promoting race-based preferences in employee selection. They went on to promise legal action against “violators,” signaling their intention to extend the parameters of the Supreme Court ruling to US workplaces. This raises the question, what can organizations that remain committed to racial equal employment opportunity do to limit any losses they might suffer in this new, evolving employment landscape? Below, I provide four suggestions to help practitioners, managers, and organizations navigate this challenge.</p><p></p><h3> Don&#39;t Wait on the Sidelines</h3><p> President Theodore Roosevelt is often credited with saying, “In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing.” In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling, it is probably tempting to maintain business as usual, wait and see how things proceed, and adopt a reactionary approach as the dust settles. Doing so, however, promises to have considerable consequences. Namely, continuing to source applicants from the same schools while making no adjustments based on the predictable changes to student-body compositions leaves an organization entirely dependent on college admissions staffs to retool their strategies to solve a problem that few have been able to address in the past 30 years.</p><p> Accordingly, continuing to use degrees and degree-granting institutions as proxies for human capital, as many organizations historically have, will likely result in race differentials widening across virtually all employment outcomes, with cascading effects for nonemployment outcomes. For instance, a recent study showed that underrepresented minority youth tend to increase their engagement in risky behaviors (smoking cigarettes, alcohol use, and binge drinking) immediately following an affirmative action ban. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a> In short, expect to have fewer underrepresented minority employees and greater racial inequity, including larger differentials in earnings and advancement.</p><h3> Question Everything</h3><p> Well, you might not have to question everything, but if an organization wants to get better at something, it will need to do some things differently and examine how they&#39;ve been done in the past. For instance, an HR executive once told me that it was company policy to recruit only from the country&#39;s top 10 engineering programs. An unintended consequence of this practice was that new recruits came from geographic regions that were quite dissimilar to the company&#39;s locale, and new-hire turnover was unusually high for its industry. There was no qualitative difference between the No. 10 program and the No. 12 program, which was located within 100 miles. Why not recruit from the No. 12 program to reduce the chance of a new employee experiencing extreme culture shock and leaving within the first year?</p><p> Applying this logic in the current context, companies might need to broaden their search parameters to attract applicant pools that are demographically consistent with those of their recent past. Recruiting at historically Black colleges and universities and Hispanic-serving institutions is a good way of engaging in targeted recruitment — a strategy that is presently legally permissible. Placing online advertisements in places frequented by underrepresented minorities conveys that your organization is interested in receiving applications from members of these groups. Moreover, when it comes to selection and compensation, companies will need to reevaluate the implicit and explicit weights assigned to degree-granting institutions. The spoils of graduating from a premier institution are already distributed inconsistently, with larger benefits for White graduates than for Black degree holders. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> Why not make that benefit smaller for everyone and simultaneously open more employment opportunities to a larger group?</p><h3> Lean Into the Data</h3><p> To address the issues raised by questioning everything, organizations can turn to what their data reveals. For instance, though inertia and benchmarking against competitors may suggest that a job requires a college degree, does the data support that contention? Job requirements that are linked to racial differences, like degree attainment and earning degrees from highly prestigious schools, tend to have an adverse impact on underrepresented groups — a form of statistical discrimination. In the context of selection, adverse impact occurs when a particular decision-making tool advantages members of one racial group (or any other legally protected category) relative to members of another racial group. While such differences are not illegal if the difference is job relevant, data is needed to establish such relevance.</p><p> Requiring degrees, favoring graduates of elite schools, and using minimum GPA cutoffs can adversely impact underrepresented minorities when such requirements are not directly related to job performance. In the past several years, there&#39;s been more discussion of eliminating these types of requirements, not only to enhance racial justice but also to simply tap a larger pool of high-potential candidates in a tight job market. Although some may interpret this as a form of “lowering standards” to enhance diversity, it should be noted that standards unrelated to performance are unnecessary and potentially illegal and may result in employee overqualification, which can have negative implications for hires&#39; attitudes, well-being, and performance. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> Use your data (and that of relevant others) to determine job relevance and get rid of barriers that aren&#39;t boosting your bottom line.</p><h3> Select for Potential, and Train for Performance</h3><p> Though colleges invest considerable resources in preparing students for careers, there are inevitable shortfalls in the competency levels that graduates possess and employers desire. For instance, the National Association of Colleges and Employers indicates that employers are nearly unanimous in naming communication as the most important competency, and almost all students know this. Nevertheless, though 80% of students rate themselves extremely proficient at communication, only 47% of employers see students in this same light. The point is that more than half of employers see graduates as lacking the most important competency. Clearly, the 53% of employers that consider college graduates less than extremely proficient communicators are not leaving their vacancies unfilled. If they were, the unemployment rate for 2022 college graduates would not be 4%. Rather, many, if not most, employers recognize that they will need to invest in training to get new hires up to speed.</p><p></p><p> Identifying potential in a race-neutral yet valid way is certainly easier said than done. Generally speaking, the more closely the indicators used to select employees relate to what employees actually do, the better. This suggests that tools like high-fidelity simulations, work samples, and behaviorally anchored structured interviews may be particularly useful. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a> Selection approaches should also focus on identifying trainability to ensure that organizations are able to maximize returns on their training investments. This could entail giving top candidates an opportunity to demonstrate their trainability by actively learning a new job-relevant competency and subsequently demonstrating their proficiency.</p><p></p><p> Over the past half century, affirmative action and its progeny have helped transform the racioethnic landscape of American colleges, universities, and organizations. These programs have done so by providing opportunities to those who history suggests would otherwise have been unlikely (or at least considerably less likely) to receive them. The choice of word — <em>opportunity</em> — is both intentional and important, as many people often lose sight of the fact that these programs grant beneficiaries only the chance to show that they belong. Although the Supreme Court decision eliminated one means of helping to level the playing field, as Alexander Graham Bell once said, “When one door closes, another opens.” Though the path may seem somewhat less clear, innovative companies will create and maintain competitive advantages by finding, attracting, and selecting the most talented people from <em>all</em> racial and ethnic backgrounds.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-outlawing-collegiate-affirmative-action-will-impact-corporate-america/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Make Your Case for Communication Upskilling</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/make-your-case-for-communication-upskilling/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/make-your-case-for-communication-upskilling/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 11:00:21 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Nancy Duarte. <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nancyduarte/">Nancy Duarte</a> is CEO of <a href="https://www.duarte.com/">Duarte Inc.</a> , a communication company in the Silicon Valley.

It&#39;s hard to find a job posting that <em>doesn&#39;t</em> mention the communication skill set as a key requirement. And yet, when faced with the skills that candidates actually have and those that they&#39;re weak in, hiring managers find themselves making trade-offs, particularly to meet pressing technical needs: <em>This guy can code like there&#39;s no tomorrow, but his communication is a challenge. Let&#39;s get him in here fast. We&#39;ll coach him up. It can wait.</em></p><p> The thing is, communication skills <em>can&#39;t</em> wait. Executives in “people functions” like human resources and learning and development (L&amp;D) understand that communication and persuasion skills are critical in all areas of business — even software development and accounting. Those who design, manage, implement, and track employee development programs already know the business benefits of being adept at influencing colleagues and others in an organization.</p><p></p><p> So how do you also show the deep skeptics in your organization — for instance, data scientists who view the word <em>persuasion</em> with disdain, as a euphemism for <em>manipulation</em> — that a serious investment in communication skills is worth making?</p><p> You do it by making a solid case for the return on that investment. And you can take your cues from those folks in L&amp;D. They&#39;ve thought long and hard about ways to measure the ROI of their training programs and the best ways to communicate the benefits of those talents.</p><h3> A Measurement-Based Case for Better Soft Skills</h3><p> At a recent event for my company&#39;s customers, our executive vice president of customers led a panel discussion on the ways that large technical brands are building soft skills and what the ROI has been for them. Two L&amp;D executives shared what they&#39;ve discovered about conveying that value in their organizations: Catherine (Cat) Lang, who heads up product training and certification for customers and partners at ServiceNow, a digital workflow company based in Santa Clara, Calif.; and Noelle Anderson, the director of enablement at Snap, the parent company for visual messaging app Snapchat. Here are five key insights from their conversation.</p><h4> Collect examples of the ROI you&#39;ve seen from previous training.</h4><p> One way to start is to think back to previous learning efforts in your organization and see what dots you can connect for stakeholders. For instance, did an in-house workshop on presenting data precede a big win for your organization — like landing a lucrative project or winning a major client? Make that correlation explicit and point to others like it. You might already have more of an ROI track record for some of your soft skills training than you realize.</p><p></p><h4> Help identify the value of future training.</h4><p> When you&#39;re considering or developing future training, look for more direct ways to measure upskilling outcomes. At Snap, for instance, the enablement team has developed a pitch-coaching program in which salespeople, account managers, and creative strategists work together to develop pitches for existing clients. Participants receive lots of coaching and developmental feedback from seasoned communicators while formulating, framing, and practicing their pitches — a big incentive to sign up for the program. They also create real, measurable value by workshopping real pitch content.</p><p> The payoff — whether it&#39;s a renewed contract or the sale of a new product or service — is quantifiable. “What we&#39;ve done on the back end,” Anderson said, “is work with our CRM teams to create a check box in Salesforce to denote whether or not each presentation was part of our pitch program.” From there, the team can filter to see which pitches brought in revenue.</p><p> Although Anderson&#39;s group at Snap reports to the sales team rather than to corporate L&amp;D, they collaborate with L&amp;D as a “sister team” to identify and build soft skills needed on the sales side. That&#39;s an approach that can pay dividends in both directions: Teams throughout organizations can report back to L&amp;D with evidence of ROI in their areas, which supports further investment in companywide learning programs. For its part, the learning organization can share broader insights on what types of development drive employee satisfaction and retention. And L&amp;D can hone its skill-building programs in light of where teams are seeing the greatest impact on day-to-day performance and sales.</p><h4> Recognize qualitative impact — including better employee retention.</h4><p> Even with something like a pitch program in place, it&#39;s tough to tally up the costs of soft skills training in cold, hard dollars — especially when the training is conducted internally by HR staff members or informally by managers and colleagues. The benefits can be tricky to gauge, too, since much of the value in upskilling is indirect.</p><p> For instance, consider one of the pitch program&#39;s key benefits for employees: greater visibility with senior leadership. That pays off for both individuals and the organization, but not in a way that shows up immediately on the balance sheet. Anderson said that batches of pitches are developed and presented in rounds, and by the third round, the two groups with the best pitches get to present their ideas to the executive team for more feedback before sharing anything with clients.</p><p> Sure, these interactions with executives make the pitches themselves better. But think about the other benefits: They kick-start mentoring relationships, and they open up more development and growth opportunities and more doors to advancement — all of which can enhance the employee experience, motivation, and loyalty.</p><p> Can you quantify these results? Sometimes you can&#39;t, so you gauge value qualitatively. That can mean soliciting input from managers and team leaders on a training program&#39;s impact on employees&#39; behavior, effectiveness on the job, and approach to teamwork. Considering the qualitative impact from the employee&#39;s perspective is essential, too, because talent retention has major implications for ROI. For proof of why these intangibles matter, consider a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/03/09/majority-of-workers-who-quit-a-job-in-2021-cite-low-pay-no-opportunities-for-advancement-feeling-disrespected/">Pew Research Center 2022 survey</a> that found a tie between “no opportunities for advancement” and “pay was too low” as the top reasons US workers cited for leaving their jobs. Or consider the findings of LinkedIn&#39;s March 2022 “ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220506202443/https://business.linkedin.com/glint/resources/employee-well-being-report-march-2022">Employee Well-Being Report</a> ,” which found the No. 1 driver of work culture to be “opportunities to learn and grow.”</p><p> Lang said that at ServiceNow, her team is “looking at employee retention and satisfaction with development” and tying those “very, very closely to our employee voice surveys as well” to get a holistic view of the effects of upskilling on retention. She said she saw “quick uptake as we started piloting new soft skills programs.” People have demonstrated keen interest in this type of upskilling at Snap, too: Anderson said employees view it as evidence that the company values them because it&#39;s “demonstrating [its] belief in an individual by investing in them and their development.” She also noted, “These are the types of skills that can help people internally get their own momentum, their own movement, and get their own thoughts put forth in a way in which folks will actually respond.”</p><h4> Strategize about which kinds of jobs to focus on first.</h4><p> Like any organizational change effort, upskilling a workforce requires strategic planning. To help such an initiative gain traction, it&#39;s useful to identify where you&#39;ll see the greatest immediate payoff and plan to concentrate there before you roll things out more broadly.</p><p></p><p> Lang&#39;s group at ServiceNow focuses first on people at the director and senior director levels because they have such a big say in how work gets done day to day and are responsible for keeping employees&#39; efforts aligned with organizational goals. The sooner they&#39;re communicating those goals clearly and framing performance objectives compellingly, the sooner the company will reap the rewards of hitting those targets. Attending to people at the director and senior director levels first also creates a cascade effect, equipping them to share what they&#39;re learning with their teams through one-on-one coaching, mentoring conversations, and even recommendations for courses or other learning content.</p><p> Snap, on the other hand, prefers to upskill front-line managers first, Anderson said. Because she oversees learning in a sales organization, where employees&#39; communication skills have an immediate impact on client relationships, the front line is where she sees the quickest return on investment.</p><h4> Address the time crunch head-on.</h4><p></p><p> Even if an organization&#39;s stakeholders agree that, in an ideal world, they should prioritize helping employees with soft skills, time constraints can make it tough. In the perennial battle between the important and the urgent, the urgent tends to win leaders&#39; attention and resources. Anderson described how what she calls “the here and now” sometimes gets in the way of broader learning goals at Snap: “There have been many classes where folks are like, &#39;I&#39;m so excited. I can&#39;t wait to go.&#39; And they show up, but then they have to drop out.” Work commitments and deadlines often tear people away.</p><p></p><p> One way to address that challenge culturally is by openly acknowledging it and showing how you can accommodate it in your learning schedule and course design. Create the expectation that it&#39;s more than OK for people to engage only as they&#39;re able. Think about dicing up the content into shorter modules or mini-workshops that busy employees can more easily digest. Set aside time in the workday for skill development. Learners need this type of support in the workplace, and the organization benefits too. If executives balk, remind them that making learning doable increases the ROI <em>and</em> shores up employee commitment to the organization in a tight labor market.</p><p> You might need to adjust project deadlines a bit or give people fewer tasks while they&#39;re doing development work so they don&#39;t feel pressure to do their “real” work after hours. Development <em>is</em> real work. Treat it that way as a manager — and discuss it that way with your stakeholders. It&#39;ll be an easier sell if you&#39;ve taken steps to help them see all of the benefits of the investment.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/make-your-case-for-communication-upskilling/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> CEOs Can Make (or Break) an Organization Redesign</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ceos-can-make-or-break-an-organization-redesign/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ceos-can-make-or-break-an-organization-redesign/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 02 Aug 2023 11:00:41 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Herman Vantrappen and Frederic Wirtz. <p><a href="https://akordeon.com/who-we-are/">Herman Vantrappen</a> is the managing director of Akordeon, a strategic advisory firm based in Brussels.

Some redesigns are major companywide overhauls, such as Procter &amp; Gamble&#39;s creation of six industry-based sector business units in 2019, which its CEO described as “the most significant organization change we&#39;ve made in the last 20 years.” <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> Other redesign efforts have a narrower scope, focusing on a particular division, function, or issue.</p><p> For a CEO, organization redesign is different from other large-scale change initiatives. In a corporate strategic reorientation, for instance, the CEO is bound by the decisions of the board of directors and follows a strongly analytical approach. In a functional initiative, such as setting the company&#39;s digital strategy, the CEO can delegate the lead to someone on the management team and assume a supervisory role. But in a corporate organization redesign initiative, the CEO must actively take the lead, both because of the profound impact that the resulting changes will have on the culture and employees and because only the CEO has the all-encompassing view required to reduce the risk of serious unintended and undesirable consequences from any particular redesign choice.</p><p></p><p> We have witnessed many redesign initiatives in our work with organizations over the years and have confirmed that the CEO&#39;s leadership of these efforts is key to their success. But we continue to be surprised by how many CEOs still struggle to get to effective outcomes. We&#39;ve found that plans frequently go astray or run into dead ends despite the abundant and often sensible advice in the management literature. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li> The new CEO of a business services provider wants to reconsider the role of the corporate center and the organization more broadly. Each member of the management team has their own pet idea for restructuring: One is under the spell of self-organizing teams, another is adamant about a framework used at their previous employer, and a third thinks the company should simply be a holding of small regional enterprises. It takes a long time to build even minimal alignment.</li><li> The CEO of a multilateral agency launches an exercise to make the organization less siloed. Heated debate and a couple of offsites with the management team lead to a number of major decisions, including plans for sharing resources and broadening the CEO&#39;s span of control. But after some backroom maneuvering, decisions are undone.</li><li> The founder-CEO of a family-owned engineering and construction company retires, handing over the reins to one of his children. The new leader has plans to professionalize the company&#39;s business processes and governance, but the retired founder keeps finding ways to short-circuit the CEO, undermining any effort to improve the company&#39;s functioning.</li></ul><p> When we looked back on the major organization redesigns we&#39;ve accompanied in the past 30 years (see “The Research”) and reflected on why some initiatives were less effective than others, we recognized that CEOs can fall into one of two traps: failing to use an appropriate framework, and, quite simply, failing to maintain sufficient leadership throughout the process. In this article, we&#39;ll present a systematic approach to organization redesign that CEOs can follow, and address specific behaviors that executives must guard against if they are to retain full ownership throughout the organization redesign and implementation processes.</p><h3> A Framework for Tackling Organization Redesign</h3><p> Many scholars and consultants have developed frameworks that support systematic thinking about organization design. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> The framework we are presenting here emphasizes two aspects that are often underexposed.</p><p> First, the framework recognizes that managers never start with a blank slate when redesigning their organization. There is always an existing organization in place that heavily informs any redesign. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> Even if the existing design has become dysfunctional, there are usually good reasons why it was adopted in the first place, and those reasons shouldn&#39;t be ignored. As a consequence, a good framework needs to incorporate a dynamic link between the past and the future.</p><p> Second, much of the current advice in the management literature focuses on either upstream aspects of an initiative (for instance, identifying the company&#39;s purpose, values, and vision) or downstream aspects (such as execution and change management). Less is said about the midstream core of the discipline — that is, the hard stuff, such as structure, processes, and systems. A good framework should rehabilitate this essential midstream part while integrating it seamlessly with the upstream part (by considering the drivers of change) and the downstream part (by ensuring readiness for the go-live on Day One).</p><p> The framework that we have gradually developed through our work aims to overcome those two shortcomings by respecting the dynamic nature of change and focusing on the hard organization design variables. Starting from the first principle, it brings together the building blocks of organization design thinking into a logical flow, from understanding an organization&#39;s <em>drivers of change</em> to the options for <em>concept design</em> , the operationalization in <em>detail design</em> , the implementation at the <em>transition</em> stage, and the course corrections necessary during the reorganization&#39;s actual <em>performance</em> . (See “The Organization Redesign Guide.”) </p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand-column callout-highlight--transparent"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> The Organization Redesign Guide</h4><p class="caption"> This framework integrates familiar building blocks into a logical process flow to steer reorganization initiatives. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MAG_Vantrappen_Fig1.jpg" alt="The Organization Redesign Guide"></p><p class="attribution"> Source: Herman Vantrappen and Frederic Wirtz</p></article></aside></div><p> CEOs at the front end of an organization redesign need to be aware of five overarching principles that stand out in this framework:</p><p> <strong>1. Organization is a means to an end.</strong> Managers change an organization design with the expectation that the new design will better enable the company to achieve its business goals. That expectation is based on the assumption that those goals will be made explicit, embraced by the management team, endorsed by stakeholders, and remain reasonably stable. A company whose goals are vague or fluctuating is likely to cycle through disruptive organizational rearrangements without much improvement in its performance. That&#39;s why our design framework starts with identifying both the external and internal drivers of change.</p><p> <strong>2. The best possible design is unknowable.</strong> Making organization design choices is arguably more difficult than making business strategy choices. A strategy choice comes down to selecting the one of various alternatives that maximizes the defined objective — say, EBITDA growth. With strategy, leaders weigh the available information, the assumptions and uncertainties, resource constraints, and their own appetite for risk. Not so for organizational choices. They do not flow from a mathematical optimization but from a judgment about the weight of the arguments in favor of and against each of a number of design alternatives. That is why the design framework encourages CEOs to consider alternative organizational concepts.</p><p> <strong>3. Concept design precedes detail design — and only the latter is participative.</strong> At the concept stage, the principles for the new design are defined. Those involve fundamental organizational variables, in particular the architecture (for example, what to centralize and what to decentralize). <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> After considering alternative design concepts, one is selected and taken forward for detail design (for example, the roles of various functions in an end-to-end business process). The detail design can and should be done with the broad involvement of the managers and people directly concerned: They know best what works, will have to operate within the design outcome, and can act as change ambassadors. However, such a participative approach is rarely advised for concept design, which tends to require familiarity with the company&#39;s (often still confidential) vision and strategic options, freedom from conflicts of interest concerning the fate of various company functions, and speed.</p><p> <strong>4. An organization design evolves through a pattern of deliberate leaps and emergent hops.</strong> The notions of deliberate and emergent strategy are well entrenched in the discipline of strategy formulation: Guided by the company&#39;s deliberate strategy, managers at all levels in the organization make myriad decisions every day that gradually alter the exact form of that strategy. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> A similar pattern is observed in organization design: Senior management deliberately decides on a major rearrangement (leap) of the organization, after which a series of adjustments (hops) are made to compensate for the inevitable imperfections of the original design. This leap-and-hops pattern is totally normal and even desirable, since the perfect design is elusive and a company&#39;s environment changes all the time. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a> That is why the design framework shows loops that feed imperfections back into the design so that they can be addressed.</p><p> <strong>5. The proof of the design is revealed only after Day One.</strong> Day One refers to the moment at which the approved detail design goes live and the redesign starts to have a direct impact on the daily functioning of a large number of people: what they do, how they do it, and with whom. As little as possible should go wrong, for the sake of managerial credibility, respect for people, and impact on the business. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> That is why it is crucial to start a careful change management process well ahead of Day One. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> No employee should be left in the dark about their place in the redesigned organization.</p><p></p><h3> Why the CEO&#39;s Continuous Engagement Matters</h3><p> In strategy formulation exercises, it may be perfectly adequate for the CEO to stay involved through ad hoc interventions spaced over time, such as participating in an executive offsite, leading the steering committee, or presenting to the board of directors. In organization design exercises, on the other hand, we find that the most effective CEOs keep their finger on the pulse of the process on an almost daily basis, from start to finish.</p><p> One reason they do this is that it provides them the opportunity to form their own ideas about a fit-for-purpose design and to possibly shift their mental model quite radically. They take their time to allow their thinking to mature, as there is no single best design and the eventual choice is a largely qualitative judgment about a number of valid alternatives.</p><p> They also consistently engage because they realize that the organization design process is quite unforgiving. Each phase builds on the choices made in the previous phase, gradually involving more and more people. The number of explicit or implicit micro-commitments made along the way — about roles, borders, lines, people, head count, and other factors — keeps growing. Having to backtrack is painful, in part because it is widely visible. If strategy formulation is like planting trees, organization design is like sowing grass: Its effect is immediate, all over the place, and in need of attention.</p><p></p><p> A third reason for daily engagement is to help build buy-in for the new design within the organization. Effective CEOs insist on participating fully in communications about the outcomes of the design exercise, not so much through the proverbial “memo to all staff” as by talking with people in the field. They can only do so credibly and convincingly if they have immersed themselves in the actual design work.</p><p> Most importantly, CEOs involve themselves in the process daily because they recognize that people and interactions will eventually make (or break) the organization. Fully participating in the design process gives CEOs a unique opportunity to observe and influence the people side of the business beyond their direct reports.</p><h3> How Leadership Weakness Can Derail Redesign</h3><p> In situations where we&#39;ve observed a leader&#39;s inability to remain fully in control of the redesign process as laid out above, their weaknesses have tended to reflect one of four characteristics: half-heartedness, appeasement, indecisiveness, or incapacitation. We&#39;ve distilled the following four archetypes from our observations of organization redesign efforts that have faltered:</p><p> <strong>The half-hearted CEO.</strong> Whereas the trigger of a strategy formulation exercise tends to be clear, an organization design exercise may be prompted by lobbying by certain stakeholders rather than a clear business need. In some cases, a member of the management team or the board of directors may raise a concern. The CEO might not initially find that concern important or be inclined to initiate change, but they might want to satisfy that stakeholder to end the debate and thus agree to consider organization redesign — with the private thought that the plans will go nowhere. Or the CEO may be confused, unclear, or cagey about the motivation for a redesign, leaving it to the project team to fill in the blanks. In still other cases, the CEO might be on their way out, voluntarily or involuntarily. In all of those situations, the CEO lacks a full-throated commitment at the inception of the project, getting it off to a bad start.</p><p> <strong>The appeasing CEO.</strong> Every transformation requires careful change management, with deliberate activities to move the company from its present state to the desired future state and help people adopt the changes. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a> However, CEOs can go overboard when it comes to inviting people&#39;s involvement, which can result in an excessively complex process with too many steps, participants, and approval points. For example, inviting more comments instead of deciding and freezing the process can drag out the design phase. Appeasing behavior aimed at demonstrating a willingness to listen is often well intentioned and meant to function as stakeholder management — but it can also reflect the CEO&#39;s own uncertainty about the design concept.</p><p> <strong>The indecisive CEO.</strong> The decision-inept CEO who fails to make decisions or stick to firm decisions is rare but not extinct. A typical symptom is the CEO giving in to a late-stage “over my dead body” threat by a manager who disagrees with a well-thought-out executive team decision. CEOs will sometimes compromise in the final stretch out of a fear of negative fallout. In such organizations, things happen in spite of the CEO.</p><p> <strong>The incapacitated CEO.</strong> Defective governance can make it hard for the CEO to keep a grip on the redesign throughout the entire process. In companies where the CEO is not also the chair of the board of directors, the board might interfere with the CEO&#39;s handling of the organization redesign. In privately owned companies, powerful board members such as retired founders can meddle in the design and short-circuit the CEO, protecting old favorites or otherwise disrupting an orderly process. Such impairing of the CEO — whether during the concept design, detail design, or transition phase — is often visible at lower levels and highly damaging.</p><p> CEOs planning an organization redesign would be well advised to consider these patterns of weak leadership. They should assess their own vulnerability in terms of both their own traits and the contextual factors that hamstring their leadership, and then consider how to overcome them.</p><p> They can begin by asking themselves four questions:</p><ol><li> Do I fully believe in this initiative?</li><li> Will I listen to the right people without letting the process go off track?</li><li> Am I prepared to make tough decisions where needed and stick to them?</li><li> Am I in control of all the levers I will need to pull?</li></ol><p> Such soul-searching is important because once CEOs understand where their leadership of this critical change effort may be weak, they can work to mitigate those weaknesses. (See “How CEOs Can Diminish Their Vulnerability.”) Imagine a CEO who knows they tend to be appeasing. They might recognize that during the concept phase, they should consult with a restricted group of senior managers, and during the transition phase, they should adopt a kind of comply-or-explain process (when any deviation from the concept design must be explained and can only be accepted after approval by the governance body that had approved the concept) and freeze the design, reassuring employees that the company will make course corrections after launch as needed. </p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand-column callout-highlight--transparent"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> How CEOs Can Diminish Their Vulnerability</h4><p class="caption"> CEOs who tend toward any of the four behavioral archetypes that can undermine organization redesign can take action at each stage of the process to strengthen their leadership. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MAG_Vantrappen_Fig2.png" alt="How CEOs Can Diminish Their Vulnerability"></p><p class="attribution"> Source: Herman Vantrappen and Frederic Wirtz</p></article></aside></div><p> We worked with the CEO of an industrial company who acknowledged that he had some elements of the incapacitated and indecisive archetypes. He was able to compensate for the tendencies that might have otherwise derailed the process, in a few smart, specific ways:</p><ul><li> Because the CEO traveled almost constantly, he appointed a chief change officer with complementary skills who worked closely with him and took care of day-to-day project matters at the head office. However, the CEO remained in charge of the effort.</li><li> The CEO proposed having the company&#39;s nomination and compensation committee act as a steering committee during the concept design phase. This provided a managed channel to the board chair, whose frequent intervention in operational matters sometimes undermined the CEO.</li><li> After the results of the concept design phase were formally endorsed by the nomination and compensation committee and approved by the board, the CEO was able to more easily implement the comply-or-explain rule during the detail design phase. To avoid concept creep, any deviation from the concept would have to pass through the committee again.</li><li> The CEO encouraged the company&#39;s divisions and functions to each appoint an ambassador for the transition phase. These representatives were on the management team of their respective divisions and functions and had participated in the detail design phase. They met with the chief change officer monthly to share progress information in both directions.</li><li> A simple tracker was used to monitor progress toward a range of specific transition targets in advance of the go-live. The percentage-of-completion statistics were regularly reviewed by the CEO and openly published based on division and function. This generated some healthy peer pressure and helped the process maintain traction.</li></ul><p></p><p> The example demonstrates that it pays for CEOs to do some upfront, explicit, and honest introspection about their visible behavioral tendencies and the actions that can prevent the redesign exercise from derailing.</p><p></p><p> Continual organization redesign is a fact of corporate life. In most cases, there are good business reasons to consider a redesign, despite the significant extra time, resources, and emotional energy it tends to consume. But the CEO&#39;s full-on engagement is needed to make the redesign succeed. Even then, however, redesign exercises often go astray. CEOs may lack an appropriate design framework or simply fail to maintain sufficient leadership throughout the process. They should start with an assessment of their vulnerabilities — both their own behavioral tendencies and governance-related constraints. And they should find ways to demonstrate that they are full-hearted, conclusive, decisive, and, ultimately, in control.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ceos-can-make-or-break-an-organization-redesign/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Learning From and With AI: Duolingo&#39;s Zan Gilani</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/learning-from-and-with-ai-duolingos-zan-gilani/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/learning-from-and-with-ai-duolingos-zan-gilani/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 01 Aug 2023 11:00:27 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. <p>Sam Ransbotham ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ransbotham">@ransbotham</a> ) is a professor in the information systems department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College, as well as guest editor for <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> &#39;s Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy Big Ideas initiative.

Today, Shervin and I talk with Zan Gilani, principal product manager at Duolingo. I&#39;m personally pretty excited about today&#39;s episode because Duolingo is in a really interesting position. In a lot of our show, we end up talking about how organizations are using AI to augment or to improve human decision-making, and that&#39;s great. But Duolingo goes further and focuses on how humans are learning with AI — personalized education at scale, which is something that appeals to me. Anyway, that&#39;s enough from me. Let&#39;s hear it from Zan. Zan, thanks for joining us.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Thank you. It&#39;s a pleasure to be here.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Zan, first, can you give us an overview of Duolingo and the company, and what your role is?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Absolutely. Duolingo is basically an app that teaches languages. We teach 40-plus languages right now. Most of those people, by the way, are learning English, and most of our learners are also learning on mobile phones, so Android and iOS devices. And we are the most-downloaded and the most-used educational app there is, languages and otherwise. We have around 16 million DAU, or daily active users, and 40-plus million monthly active users as well. And I&#39;ve been at the company just coming around to eight years, where I am a principal product manager for the Experimental AI team.</p><p> My primary role is leading this team that is working to teach more effectively using generative AI, and also, more broadly, I help set the company up for success when it comes to generative AI.</p><p> One of the main use cases we have now specifically for generative AI is a new subscription tier. Duolingo is a freemium product. The mission is to provide the highest-quality education possible [and] make it accessible to as many people [as possible]; all you need is an internet connection. So we have this free version of the app, which is what most people are on. That&#39;s really good; most people at the company spend time on that. And then we have subscription tiers.</p><p> And we recently just launched a new AI-powered subscription tier called Duolingo Max, and I&#39;m happy to go into the features [of that] as well.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> So Experimental AI … it&#39;s sort of like your R&amp;D lab, if you will?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Well, I&#39;d say actually more than half of the company is working on R&amp;D broadly — kind of all of the people who work on product, and [among] the folks who work on learning or teaching effectively, you could think of it as a lab, yes.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Great. Maybe, for our audience, you could list the variety of use cases or places that AI is being used. I mean, of course, [aside] from the obvious one — personalization and gamification — that a lot of the apps have. But just tell us how AI is being used.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Duolingo has been using AI for as long as the app has been around, which is coming up to a decade. In fact, it was founded by a computer science professor, Luis von Ahn at Carnegie Mellon University, and his graduate student at the time, Severin Hacker. Right now, it&#39;s used in a number of different ways. On the growth side, for example, a lot of work goes into optimizing notifications.</p><p> The thing about Duolingo that makes it different from other apps is that it really tries to help you stay motivated. For us, pedagogically, we think that the hardest thing about learning a language is actually staying motivated, because remember: This is something tough to do. It&#39;s especially tough to do by yourself, on a phone — that&#39;s really a tough thing. So notifications and the timing of when you get them, the messaging that it has, really does affect someone&#39;s ability to stick with it in the long term. So we put a lot of effort into machine learning for notifications.</p><p> We also use it on the content-generation side, so we are trying to create useful, appropriate content; we use it there as well. And then, in a separate arm of the company, which is the Duolingo English Test, which is basically an English proficiency test that students have to take when going to university — kind of a competitor to the TOEFL or TOEIC or IELTS; most Americans haven&#39;t had to experience this — we use it for detecting cheating. We use it for generating content in a bunch of different places as well.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That&#39;s fascinating. And on the actual core of the app, which is teaching you language, how dynamic is that? How personalized is it when it adjusts to a person&#39;s way of learning?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Personalization plays a role, but a lot of the experience is curated by learning scientists, by educational content developers. For most people, the order in which you want to learn things is going to be roughly similar. For example, everyone learns the present tense before you then go on into other complicated tenses. But where we do use AI for personalization specifically is for something called Birdbrain, and this is basically a system we have that is optimizing for the difficulty of questions that you are going to see in practice sessions.</p><p> And one thing to note over here about Duolingo is that it&#39;s completely interactive. It&#39;s meant to feel like a game. So every time you&#39;re learning, you&#39;re kind of answering a mini exercise, and then you get it right or wrong. You always get feedback. So the point of Birdbrain is to try to come up with a Goldilocks level of difficulty, because basically, if something is too hard, it&#39;s frustrating and you lose motivation. If something&#39;s too easy, it&#39;s boring and you lose motivation. Birdbrain is one of those things that we use for personalizing practice in particular.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Shervin, one thing I think that&#39;s funny about that is that, in describing his product, we just took for granted the speech synthesis, speech recognition. These were avant-garde things 10 years ago, and now, Zan, you didn&#39;t even bother to mention those as applications of AI. I think that&#39;s sort of stepping back [and] seeing what now is normal.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That&#39;s right. And I think one thing you have that&#39;s quite interesting and maybe unique is just the number of feedback loops you must have. I mean, usually, in a lot of other applications, when you think about corporations and retail and banks and telecom, etc., it takes some time to get feedback. And you&#39;re almost getting instantaneous feedback on so many experiments or mini experiments from so many people. Maybe tell us a little bit more about just the speed of learning and the speed of adaptation of your algorithms.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> There&#39;s a nice bit of mirroring over here, which is that there are principles for learning effectively that we try to impart into the product itself. And then, as a company and as an organization, we are trying to operate on those principles as well. Getting fast feedback really matters when you&#39;re learning a language. But it also matters when you are working on the product itself, and, from a very early time, we basically built out our own A/B testing infrastructure, and it&#39;s pretty core to the product process; that&#39;s the central component of how we do product at Duolingo.</p><p> At any given moment in time, you have hundreds of experiments being run on things that are very granular — the positioning of buttons [indicating] the pricing on the page for the price of our subscriptions, your classic bread-and-butter experiments — to also huge new features, new tabs. Basically, if it&#39;s not a bug, it&#39;s probably the case that we&#39;re running this in the form of an experiment. We&#39;ve gotten very, very good and very, very sophisticated at doing this.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Shervin&#39;s going to roll his eyes because I&#39;m going to go academic for a minute, but you&#39;re a classic case of experiential learning. And actually, I&#39;m going to give you a little bit of segue to talk about your <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/">Max product</a> here, because I think there are two pretty exciting parts of that. There&#39;s Roleplay, which is getting to the academic, concrete experience part of experiential learning, and then this Explain My Answer, which is a reflective observation and critique. So tell us a little bit about both of those and how those are tied to learning outcomes.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Definitely. I think it&#39;s useful to talk about where we were before adding those two features. Pedagogically, Duolingo has always been about implicit learning, so learning without telling you explicitly, “This is what you&#39;re going to learn, and this is how it works.” And that is the DNA of the experience, because we think it&#39;s just more automatic when you do it that way. People also get really demotivated and put off by complicated grammar tables, etc. And then, the second is that you&#39;re learning on an app, and you&#39;re doing this interactive thing — these almost gamelike exercises.</p><p> The two things that have been missing or limited is that, one, some people do actually want explanations, and that can be really efficient and effective when done in the right amount and in the right way. So Explain My Answer is a solution to that problem, and the nice thing about Explain My Answer that really only works thanks to modern large language models is that the large language models are really good at providing jargon-free, concise explanations of the mistakes you make. It&#39;s really tough, even for teachers, to try to do that without using jargon and also without being right on the money. And so we are able to do that with Explain My Answer pretty well. It can give you follow-up illustrations, it can give you examples — all of these things that make large language models, by the way, just good for anyone trying to learn anything by themselves. For me, it&#39;s life-changing.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Or anyone trying to give a speech.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Or anyone trying to give a speech, yes. And then the second one, Roleplay, is that, ultimately, for most people, language learning is not an academic exercise. They&#39;re trying to use it as a skill in the real world, and that&#39;s a skill in and of itself. So how do you give people the ability to practice that? How do you get them to simulate this? Chatbots are exactly one way to do so, because now, what you have is something that can speak to you at the level of difficulty that you&#39;re at, has infinite patience, and can then actually give you feedback afterward as well.</p><p> Even if people had access to native speakers, which they don&#39;t generally, you&#39;d still need a native speaker who has infinite patience and who really, really can understand what you&#39;re looking for. So Roleplay is basically trying to provide that experience in the app, rather than just having a text interface like ChatGPT and just having you speak back and forth. Basically, what we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve broken down conversations or scenarios into these bite-size experiences, where you&#39;re talking to a chatbot who&#39;s going to be a barista or a friend that you&#39;re borrowing something from, and then you try to go through a very specific, short experience.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Sam, I have a question for you because, Sam, as you know, is a distinguished professor, and he&#39;s been teaching people — including people that are not in his class, like me — a lot of things. So my question, Sam, is … in all seriousness, though, what makes a good teacher, in your opinion?</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Actually, Zan hit on a couple things right there, and that&#39;s part of why I was feeling somewhat convicted in his conversation. This infinite patience that he talks about — that&#39;s really important, and it&#39;s also really hard.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Impractical.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Yeah. And meeting people where they are is a fundamental problem that we have in education. I mean, I sit in front of a room with 35, 40 people, and they are not homogeneous. And meeting people where they are is exactly what Zan was talking about. So, yeah, you have to know the material well, you have to keep people engaged, but you also have to keep track of where people are and what they know — present stuff that&#39;s not too easy and not too hard — and I&#39;m very attracted to this model.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> So, what&#39;s next?</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Well, yeah, that&#39;s exactly where I was going.下一步是什么？ I mean, if we can do this with language, what else can we do this with? Where does it work?</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I meant just for language. So meeting people where they are, having very good knowledge of the student and their progress, and then being able to do role-playing and lots of experiential learning, and being able to explain and guide in a more jargon-free way and in a way that you could repeat it and I don&#39;t have to rush to take notes. I mean, all of these things, right? What is missing? I&#39;m hearing this and this is better than a regular teacher, it sounds like. But in your view, what is missing for this to be a perfect teacher — in Zan&#39;s view?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> I think we are still a very, very, very long way away from being the perfect teacher, for a number of reasons. I&#39;d also say, we don&#39;t believe, and I certainly don&#39;t believe, that at the end of the day, all you need is a chat interface and most people will be able to get really far with whatever they&#39;re trying to learn. So, to answer the first part about why we&#39;re far away from a teacher, well, some of this, I think, is unknown, but there is a real impact to developing a relationship with another human being when you&#39;re learning.</p><p> There is an emotional part of learning something new, and there is a human connection that can be as simple as the fact that you show up for your tutoring appointments because you don&#39;t want to let your teacher down, to also the fact that that tutor can be really engaging with their facial expressions, with the cadence of their voice, with the illustrations that they can tell, the way they can relate to maybe their own lives.</p><p> So that, we&#39;re still very far away from. And then, when it comes to just “Hey, why can&#39;t a chatbot teach you everything?” for most people, you still have to be organized, and being organized is quite exhausting. For example, just deciding what to eat next is often what you spend all your time doing, or deciding what movie to watch. And, similarly, deciding what to learn next is tough. So someone on the product side has to figure out the right sequencing of things for you to learn.</p><p> Similarly, being creative is exhausting as well. For a real-life tutor, it would be really difficult for them to put on a lot of different personas and do a lot of role-playing. Then you&#39;d need a tutor who is also an amazing actor. And AI gives you the ability to do that with a virtual teacher, but even then, we don&#39;t want a learner to have to come up with these scenarios all the time themselves.</p><p> The last two things I&#39;ll mention is that learning is also multisensory. It&#39;s also contextual. What you&#39;d want, ideally, is some kind of learning and context happening as well instead of just with a chatbot.</p><p> And the last thing to mention is, people really do need a sense of progression in order to stay bought into learning a language, because actual progress is so slow and so incremental, it&#39;s really hard to see. And so what you have to do is, you have to show people progress bars that are filling up, and you have to check in. I think there are probably ways that you could simulate that in a tutor experience, but those are some of the reasons why I think we care about building the experience outside of that as well and building a path that you go along, and all of these other things that go into making Duolingo what it is.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Zan, I want to come back to one thing you were talking about that I&#39;m pretty attracted to, [which] is this idea of figuring out what&#39;s the next thing that you need to learn. I mean, historically, every class that I had in languages, we had a book and we moved from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2. And somebody, somewhere, really thought through the sequence of that.</p><p> But at the same time, I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s necessarily optimal for all students. And we think about recommendation systems and Netflix, or in music; you know, we&#39;ve talked to Spotify, Shervin. This seems like a great opportunity here. What&#39;s the one thing that I could learn right now that would make the most difference? Or what&#39;s the one thing that I don&#39;t know that&#39;s keeping me from opening up this next section? That seems like a huge opportunity.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Yeah. And I would break that into two pieces as well. One of them is just, generally, what&#39;s an effective order to learn in, and what&#39;s an effective order to teach in? And it&#39;s especially useful for people who have some prior proficiency, which is most people who are trying to learn a language in Duolingo — particularly English learners, because they&#39;ve done it in school in some kind of way, and their knowledge is patchy, as we like to say.</p><p> And in those cases, the order is going to be quite different person to person because of different experiences. And then the second aspect of it is the things that you specifically are having trouble with in the moment that you need to focus on more. Maybe you&#39;re just making way more mistakes for a particular concept. Maybe it&#39;s verb conjugations that are the problem, or maybe you just don&#39;t know how to introduce yourself well. And so there&#39;s an opportunity to, say, actually spend more time in that part of the experience.</p><p> It&#39;s not that every curriculum is custom made for a unique student, but it is that where you put your attention and your focus, and the amount you put in, and the order in which you do it in is directed by some kind of tutor. I will say that&#39;s a tough thing to do. It really is a tough thing to do. We&#39;re not there, but that&#39;s part of the dream, certainly.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> So the show is <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> , and we didn&#39;t learn a lot about you and yourself. So maybe tell us a bit about your background — how you ended up in this role, and what the journey was like.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Yes. How far back should I go? Do I start with grandparents? Parents? Myself?</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Up to you.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> OK. I&#39;ll skip the extended biography. I grew up in Karachi, Pakistan. That&#39;s where I was raised, and I came to the US for undergraduate studies. And I actually studied political science and East Asian studies in college because, one, I was interested in languages, so I took Chinese, and when I was learning languages in college, one of the most exciting things was always trying out tools to see what was effective or not.</p><p> So it&#39;s the interest in languages, it&#39;s the interest in technology that got me to Duolingo. And actually, I started in marketing because I&#39;d done some marketing and advertising internships before that. At that time, we were around 50 people at Duolingo, and we went from having just one team that worked on the app to having teams that worked on monetization, learning, and growth. And so I started working on growth as a marketing person, and then, about a year and a half in, I switched to being a product manager. And for most of my time at Duolingo, I have worked on growth, which is to say user retention, whether that&#39;s new users or existing users, growing our presence in Asia; that was super interesting. Things like that. And motivation and what gets people motivated and what keeps them motivated has always just been an interest of mine.</p><p> And then, the switch to working on AI as the focus and leading this Experimental AI team came at the end of last year because, basically, we ended up partnering with OpenAI for their GPT-4 launch. And the reason why we ended up doing this partnership was actually because I knew the product manager for the GPT-4 launch at OpenAI, and when we got together, we quickly realized Duolingo is the perfect use case for the launch, because for the launch, what they really wanted was to show that companies are actually using this to transform their businesses and these are also companies that are trying to do good for the world, etc. And so we, as a company, based on that partnership and getting access to GPT-4 early, shifted a bunch of priorities [and] started really leaning into AI, and one of those things was to start this team that&#39;s trying to work on experimental features.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Very exciting. And actually, from a motivation standpoint, you&#39;ll be thrilled to know that my son is very proud of his Spanish language streak, so …</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Amazing.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> We&#39;ve got a segment where we ask you a series of questions, and these are just rapid-fire; say the first thing that comes to your mind. What&#39;s your proudest moment in AI?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> We, as a company, launching Duolingo Max has been super exciting and just paving the way for a new era of teaching. It&#39;s been created, actually, by the Max team at Duolingo, which is led by Edwin Bodge and Bill Peterson, and it&#39;s super exciting.</p><p> I&#39;d say personally, actually, the first product that my team has been working on is actually — the experiment is going live. You could kind of think of it like TikTok for reading, but it&#39;s something where all the content is generated by GPT-4. It&#39;s giving you a huge breadth of content because people need reading practice in lots of different varieties, and it&#39;s also listening as well. So I&#39;m very excited to see how that goes.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Very cool. What worries you about AI?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> I&#39;m generally very optimistic, but I think the thing that worries me is just that the pace of change is so quick that it will be destabilizing. And the goal for us as a society is to make sure we can stay stable in the face of very, very rapid change, because rapid change is what we want, actually. We want progress to come quickly but without all of the destabilizing effects. So that&#39;s the fear. I think it&#39;s a solvable problem, but that&#39;s the fear.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your favorite activity that does not involve technology?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> I play a lot of soccer. Funnily, there is technology involved with that, as it turns out, but, yes, I play a lot of soccer. That&#39;s one of my favorite activities to do.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So, what first career did you want? Poli-sci, I think you mentioned. What did you want to be when you grew up when you were a kid?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Lots of different things. There was never one answer. I wanted to be a writer, a journalist, a cricket player — a cricketer — and work in international development; I even wanted to be an architect.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> You ran the table there.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Yeah, a lot of different things.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your greatest wish for AI? What are you hoping we can get from this?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> I think AI is the way that we can create the fastest progress, where [by] “progress” here I just mean as many human beings [as possible] are living the lives that they choose to live — that they&#39;re flourishing. I think that is the highest-level goal, and that is the meaning of life for most people. I&#39;m very excited to be part of that effort.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Well, it sounds like you are. Zan, thanks for taking the time to talk to us. I genuinely feel like this is a hugely different and exciting opportunity for how we as humans can get better. And it sounds like Duolingo is doing a lot of that. Thanks for joining us.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Thank you so much.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Thanks for joining us. Next time, Sam and I speak with Jeremy King, senior vice president and head of engineering at Pinterest.

Anyone perusing handbags at a street market knows how common it is to find fake products that look identical to the real thing but might not function the same way. In some cases, this can put consumers at risk: A pharmaceutical company, for instance, discovered counterfeit versions of its product on the black market that contained no active pharmaceutical ingredients. As well, a company&#39;s legitimate product may be diverted for unauthorized sales, as when a global electronics company discovered that distributors in its network, who had ordered components supposedly for customer repairs, were selling them on the gray market.</p><p> High-demand products in every industry are lucrative targets for fraudulent criminal activity. Unfortunately, counterfeit products are a problem that many companies do not want to acknowledge or raise to their boards or shareholders. Senior executives often try to explain away the problem, rationalizing that counterfeiters will always find a way to copy products or that piracy represents only a small percentage of sales and is not worth going after. That plays right into the hands of what counterfeiters want businesses to do: ignore them.</p><p></p><p> When companies do begin to quantify the level to which counterfeiters are affecting their bottom lines, they may attack the problem with piecemeal approaches to try to prevent it from growing. But that&#39;s not enough.</p><p> Our research suggests that successfully combating counterfeits requires the attention of a broad collection of organizational functions. It works best with a multilayered strategy encompassing diverse methods and engaging the entire organization and its partners.</p><p></p><p> We recommend that organizations tackle counterfeiting with a cohesive plan for identifying, containing, and preventing it. This comprehensive process means routinely keeping tabs on contract manufacturers and charting how products move through the supply chain. It includes scoping out what is for sale in consumer markets, deploying covert markings, reviewing warranty claims, educating customers, and partnering with key agencies and competitors.</p><h3> Conventional Tactics Aren&#39;t Working</h3><p> Companies that pay any attention to counterfeiting have traditionally relied on a brand security function to track down criminal activity. These teams often detect counterfeiting using tactics such as applying covert and overt markings on legitimate products, attaching RFID tags that track product locations, and using serialization combined with blockchain to create transaction records that are resistant to tampering. For example, barcodes compliant with the GS1 Global Traceability Standard are used to track COVID-19 vaccines. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> For many organizations, though, these tactics are not enough.</p><p> Counterfeiting and illegal diversion of product remains pervasive: Our 2018 survey of 21 supply chain executives revealed that nearly half had an issue that was ongoing or had experienced an incident in the previous year. More than 70% said they&#39;d had an incident in the previous five years. (See “The Research.”) One executive told us that his company discovered that the equivalent of an entire factory&#39;s monthly production of its products was being sent into black markets, largely due to diversion from one of its own suppliers.</p><p> Counterfeiting has grown into a problem that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says was worth $464 billion in 2019, or 2.5% of world trade. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> It was once thought that counterfeiters went after only high-value or luxury items such as pharmaceuticals, designer handbags, or perfume. But now the marketplace is full of fake footwear, pesticides, cosmetics, toys, automotive parts, and medical equipment. Counterfeiters are targeting any industry and any product line where there is an easy profit to be made.</p><p> While companies may never completely eliminate bad actors from copying products or diverting goods from authorized channels, they can significantly reduce counterfeiters&#39; market penetration and restore lost revenue. Successful approaches may involve cutting off counterfeiters&#39; access to markets, eliminating their supply of unauthorized goods, or making a product more difficult to copy. Here, we&#39;ll go into detail on the three activities that a robust action plan comprises: identification, containment, and prevention.</p><h3> Identification: Gain Insight Into the Extent and Nature of the Problem</h3><p> Getting a baseline on the severity of the counterfeiting problem is a critical first step. As the size of the issue becomes clear, the potential return on investment in shutting it down also comes into view. This can help establish performance metrics for the anti-counterfeiting team that can be aligned with business objectives and outcomes. Examples of metrics include the dollar amount or percentage of revenue lost annually due to illegal product trade, total top-line revenues recovered (dollars that were previously unknowingly lost to counterfeit sales), and the number of confirmed incidents of illicit trade, counterfeiting, diversion, and tampering.</p><p> <strong>Create a cross-functional brand security team.</strong> Developing realistic measures of the current problem often requires an intensive investigation that involves applying market channel analyses that explore multiple sources of sales data and other information from both inside and outside the organization. To be effective, a brand security team should include participants from sales, marketing, operations, purchasing, logistics, finance, and accounting, as well as core brand security functions. Such teams are typically led by a global brand protection officer who in many cases has a law enforcement background and usually reports to the chief operating officer.</p><p> <strong>Examine internal and market data to flush out suspicious activity.</strong> Companies can struggle to find, much less measure, counterfeiting activity, given that clues are usually buried in data about sales, warranties, returns, and other product metrics. Unless someone is looking for it, unusual activity can easily go unnoticed.</p><p> A good first step is to start by looking at what&#39;s being sold online. E-commerce has emerged as a perfect channel to fuel the counterfeit goods industry. Consumers may unwittingly buy products from online retailers that don&#39;t verify the source of the products on their platform and whether they are legitimate. Despite counterfeit sites being shut down regularly by Amazon (and, in China, Alibaba), operators trading in fake goods regularly open up again under a different name the next day. Amazon reported that it blocked 10 billion fake listings and destroyed 2 million counterfeit products in 2020 alone. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p> Since e-commerce sites are frequently a counterfeiter&#39;s primary source of sales, companies can begin by investigating where their products — either genuine or fake — are being sold online. Looking for common attributes of counterfeiter websites can narrow down the pool of suspicious activity. For instance, a company might find four different sellers on Amazon offering an exact copy of its handbag, listing the same details and even photos. An indicator of potential counterfeiters might include spelling or grammatical errors, blurry photos, or other details that don&#39;t look quite right.</p><p> Another important data source is warranty returns. When a consumer sends a product back because it is defective (and counterfeits often are), detective work can track down where it was purchased and how. This can lead to the origin of market entry for counterfeit goods and a starting point to find their downstream source. A global medical products company we looked at hired a global brand protection officer who examined warranty and returns data, field service requests, and sales data. In his first 100 days, he found 1,000 confirmed incidents of illicit trade, counterfeiting, diversion, and tampering. This amounted to $1.4 billion — 2% of revenue — lost annually to illegal product trade.</p><p> Estimating counterfeit sales is a difficult but essential task: Companies must establish a baseline against which to gauge the effects of anti-counterfeit measures. Having an accurate understanding of the scope of the problem is a prerequisite for deciding how much to invest and what ROI to expect from anti-counterfeiting measures. In many cases, business decision makers are unaware of the extent to which their revenue and reputation are in jeopardy.</p><p> <strong>Map the supply and distribution chain.</strong> Many companies are surprised to learn that bad actors are active within their own supply chains. Overproduction, black-market sales, and unauthorized distribution are common sources of leakage that may result in a product, or copies of it, being sold through channels that a company knows nothing about. That&#39;s why an important early step is to identify the manufacturing and distribution channels through which the company&#39;s products travel.</p><p></p><p> The brand owner at a large global apparel company told us that he had heard through his distributor network that the brand was being sold in Mexico even though the company had no authorized retail presence there. To track where these products were coming from, the director hunted down bills of lading and shipping records for the ocean freight shipments that were going to Mexico. The paper trail showed that the goods were shipped from a port in Israel — by the same authorized manufacturer that was producing the company&#39;s branded product in the United States. The apparel company eventually tracked down the clothes, which were genuine products, made under the same specifications and from the same materials, but were being illicitly distributed outside of the contractual agreement between the parties. When the apparel company set up a global brand security function and mapped its entire supply network, it found that similar cases of product diversion were occurring all over the world.</p><p> Analyzing how much is being spent on raw materials in the upstream supply chains is a good place to start mapping a supply base. Procurement can reach out to the accounting team to track all third-party purchases being made on the company&#39;s behalf (a document generally known as a <em>spend analysis</em> ). If a supplier is buying more raw materials and is operating at a higher production level than what the company is ordering, this is a telltale sign that the additional product may be moving into the black market. This requires full visibility into the supply chain, beyond just Tier 1 suppliers (which is increasingly important for other reasons, in particular to manage risk related to labor or environmental violations). Some suppliers may be reluctant to disclose their upstream suppliers for competitive reasons but can be reassured that the query is for security purposes and not an attempt to cut them out of the chain.</p><p></p><h3> Containment: Limit the Problem&#39;s Spread</h3><p> With a dedicated team in place, an initial sense of the problem&#39;s scope, and an understanding of the particular counterfeiting and diversion risks that it&#39;s most vulnerable to, a company can begin to manage the problem systematically in order to contain it.</p><p> <strong>Analyze product segments.</strong> One of the key tasks for the investigation team is segmenting products by channel, margin, volume, and risk of counterfeit activity. This ensures that the team&#39;s attention is being directed toward the most vulnerable market channels first.</p><p> In many cases, a current-state analysis of a company&#39;s supply and distribution processes helps reveal a common set of product segments that counterfeiters go after. In particular, our research found that product lines with high complexity based on the variety of finished products, level of finished-product customization, geographical span of suppliers, number of tiers in the supply chain, predictability of demand, and variation in manufacturing volumes. Examples of items in this category include aircraft and automotive replacement parts, toys, high-end apparel, branded pharmaceutical products, and consumer electronics. Counterfeiters are more likely to opportunistically target product segments characterized by a greater level of complexity and exploit this complexity to their advantage.</p><p> We interviewed executives at a biotech manufacturer who knew that counterfeit products were showing up in the market but did not know the source. The brand protection team started by segmenting products into those that were big targets for counterfeiters (in this case, high-margin items) and analyzing data to estimate the number of incidents per brand. The team — formed through a close collaboration among franchises, brand owners, and regional sales managers — then rolled out a plan to franchise partners and country business units. This established brand protection priorities by product line and provided a system to track customer-reported incidents by brand and conduct data reviews every six months.</p><p> At the same time, analysts began collecting market intelligence on supply chain vulnerabilities, including potential logistics disruptions and the threat of regulatory intervention, that posed significant risks for business plans and growth targets by region. Cumulatively, these efforts helped the manufacturer prioritize those businesses and regions where brand protection could best safeguard market revenue from sudden disruptions. In the process, the team identified a significant counterfeit and diversion activity affecting a blockbuster infusion drug that was putting many patients at risk. The company said it was able to eventually reduce the number of incidents from 100 per year to zero. This required persistent efforts to deduce the source of each incident through detailed analysis and the introduction of countermeasures — including sending a message to counterfeiters warning that they would be pursued, in hopes of convincing them to go look for an easier target.</p><p> This kind of analysis begins with identifying an initial clue and following the thread of activity. The initial problem may manifest itself as a minor issue such as a customer warranty problem, a dealer who seems to be ordering too many replacement parts, or a spate of customer returns on a particular brand of product. Any of these issues may be a hint that leads to a channel of counterfeiting activity.</p><p> <strong>Start with e-commerce sites, and reach out to customs and other authorities.</strong> A team of analysts should be hunting down in-the-open counterfeit operations on e-commerce sites on an ongoing basis and reporting them to the platform operator, such as Amazon, and to law enforcement. At the very least, this introduces more friction into some bad actors&#39; businesses to slow them down.</p><p> Counterfeit products almost always have to cross borders and pass through transshipment points and customs inspections overseen by law enforcement entities. These are critical players in the supply chain, and organizations must think of them as partners in the battle against revenue loss and intellectual property theft. These relationships are particularly important in highly regulated environments, such as pharmaceuticals, food, aerospace, and automotive manufacturing, where counterfeit products can endanger their users.</p><p> An official with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) told us that it can be challenging to get brand owners to understand the CBP&#39;s process and play their part in helping the agency fight the problem. “We are in the field, inspecting containers,” he said. “If a CBP officer opens a container and sees something that looks suspicious, they will first look in our internal database of registered brands. If the officer doesn&#39;t see anything, there is nothing they can do.” Registering brands with the CBP and US Patent and Trademark Office is a critical step in containing counterfeiting.</p><p> <strong>Educate (and warn) customers.</strong> It is imperative that consumers are educated about the possibility and risks of buying fake goods. Companies should make customers aware, through brand marketing, that if they buy from an unverified online third-party seller, they bear the risk of not having the product covered by warranty — or, worse yet, having it fail with dire consequences. One company we know of began adding a statement on its Amazon website warning that products returned to it that were not licensed would not be under warranty. Companies should also emphasize to customers the importance of registering the product serial number for warranty purposes, which protects them if a legitimate product they&#39;ve purchased turns out to be flawed or faulty. If a customer tries to register the serial number for a counterfeit product, it will show up as an error and alert the brand security team to a problem.</p><h3> Prevention: Stop Future Counterfeit Ops Before They Start</h3><p> Once an organization discovers how the spread of counterfeit products in its market channels works and has taken initial steps to contain the problem, it must continue to monitor criminal activity and establish strong preventive measures. There are important roles for numerous functions in the company to play at this stage.</p><p> <strong>Product packaging experts should explore digital tracing technology.</strong> Features in current tracing technologies offer positive product authentication, can indicate tampering, can increase the difficulty of replication, and permit product tracking and tracing. Secure markings — which use a variety of packaging, blockchain, and serial marking technologies — are one method for tracking products. Many industries are working with standards organizations like ASTM International or GS1 to develop common methods for verifying products. This can help avoid the problem where counterfeiters try to copy not just the product but the digital marking, too.</p><p> In the biotech example mentioned previously, the brand protection team worked with the business to identify covert and overt authentication capabilities, which created automatic alerts when counterfeit products were being sold through market channels. The team also created a comprehensive customer communication plan using web advertisements, targeted email and Twitter campaigns, and retailer alerts about the dangers of buying from unauthorized sources. The campaign created awareness in the company&#39;s sales partner network and set the stage to identify where new counterfeit sales were occurring.</p><p> <strong>Quality assurance should review data to track down instances of product problems and returns.</strong> QA can create triggers in its data collection processes that flag potential illegitimate activities. We know of a company that noticed an uptick in its product returns, discovered that the products were not legitimate, and tracked them down to the point of sale — which revealed the source of the counterfeiting.</p><p> <strong>Supply management should step up efforts to audit suppliers.</strong> It can be particularly fruitful to track overproduction by suppliers, as well as how they dispose of products that don&#39;t conform to quality standards — products that can end up moving through black market channels and thus avoiding trade compliance policies. One large apparel company began monitoring the inventory levels within its supplier&#39;s facilities and noticed that the supplier&#39;s inbound raw-material inventories were much greater than the volume of finished goods it was shipping to the company. This was an indication that product was being produced and sold elsewhere through other channels.</p><p> <strong>Logistics should map supply routes to document compliance on the part of transportation providers.</strong> This can help ensure chain of custody along global supply chains, particularly at handoff points such as ports, warehouses, and distribution centers. Companies with multitier distributor channels should document every logistics handoff and conduct random audits to determine whether there are proper security personnel and locked gates at all distribution centers.</p><p> <strong>Human resources might want to consider monitoring employees who are dealing directly with targeted products.</strong> This may include conducting background checks, as well as increasing training to enhance staff awareness. If there is a high level of missing inventory or a sudden increase or drop in product sales, investigations may be required.</p><p> <strong>Aftermarket sales should track warranty claims and parts sales to identify product-quality problems.</strong> As with the quality assurance team, those at the front line of aftermarket sales are in a position to learn that products aren&#39;t performing as expected, which, again, may indicate that counterfeits are entering market channels. For example, a large retailer made the decision to limit its distribution channels and authorized resellers, recognizing the high potential for counterfeit products in these particular sales channels, especially e-commerce.</p><p></p><p></p><p> Counterfeiting and product diversion are not crimes that a single organization can combat. They require the diligence of brands, retailers, packaging companies, and logistics businesses. This is a rare instance where joining with competitors can yield important insights. Companies should consider joining a consortium and partnering with industry counterparts. Industry-specific groups include the Automotive Anti-Counterfeiting Council for vehicle manufacturers and Rx-360 for pharmaceutical companies. Members of React, a large anti-counterfeiting network, include Marvel Entertainment, Mattel, Pfizer, Philips, Prada, and Timberland.</p><p> Counterfeiting is also not just a private-sector supply chain problem. Labor and human rights advocates, consumer education agencies, customs agents, federal and state law enforcement agencies, local police, and consumers of counterfeit products all have an interest and role in ferreting out unauthorized activity. While counterfeiting and product diversion cannot be eliminated, dedicated efforts can curtail both significantly.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/taming-the-counterfeiting-epidemic/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Dismantle Career Roadblocks for More Equitable Outcomes</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/dismantle-career-roadblocks-for-more-equitable-outcomes/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/dismantle-career-roadblocks-for-more-equitable-outcomes/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 11:00:51 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Haig R.

Women and people of color continue to face obstacles advancing to more senior roles and are frequently not positioned to succeed in the same ways as their White male counterparts.</p><p> That was the message from Haig R. Nalbantian, cofounder and coleader of the Workforce Sciences Institute, during <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/series/work-23-the-big-shift/">Work/23</a> , an <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> symposium held in May 2023. Nalbantian helps organizations apply evidence-based, empirical methods to strengthen their DEI efforts and retention strategies and asserts that “the surging use of analytics in the HR domain to inform work and workforce management” is a big part of the future of work.</p><p></p><p> While talent and drive are important in shaping careers, situational factors profoundly affect what happens to employees at work. They include employees&#39; access to “accelerator” roles, such as customer-facing jobs; how employees navigate flexible work arrangements, such as part-time status; and employees&#39; reporting relationships, such as whether they report to higher-level or high-performing supervisors. Nalbantian noted that these easy-to-identify circumstances, which he called <em>explained differences</em> , are prevalent.</p><p></p><p> Many organizations also have pervasive and sizable <em>unexplained disparities</em> regarding who gets chosen for promotions. Nalbantian said that in both his own studies and others, “women are actually more likely to be highly rated” by their managers at elite, large employers — all things being equal — “but in the majority of companies, they&#39;re less likely to be promoted.”</p><p> He said it is critical that companies address the explained differences and explore the unexplained disparities.</p><p> Nalbantian wasn&#39;t able to get to all of the questions from attendees during the event, so he answers some of them below. (Questions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity.)</p><h6> Does your research address intersectionality in its analysis? You talked about women and people of color, but what about women of color and other people with multiple intersecting minority identities?</h6><p> In many of the client cases covered in my study, we did indeed examine intersectionality directly. We&#39;ve done this quite a bit in larger US-based organizations that have adequate populations of these demographic groups for modeling purposes.</p><p> One of the areas of particular interest to client organizations is intersectionality with respect to reporting relationships. That is, do the specific demographics of one&#39;s supervisor affect whether the employee is promoted, is highly rated, or gets higher pay increases? For example, do White male supervisors treat Black female reports worse than White male or White female reports? Do White female supervisors help the prospects of their female reports, regardless of color?</p><p> I can say that there are few regularities in these results — certainly far less than the results I&#39;ve reported with respect to performance ratings, roles, supervisor performance and level, and flexible working.</p><p></p><h6> Has this research mapped across socioeconomic status as an intersectional influence?</h6><p> Unfortunately, we&#39;ve had much more limited data on socioeconomic factors, in part because most of our clients focus these studies on their salaried populations, ignoring their hourly workers. This concerns me, as it reveals a tendency to discount front-line workers. I try to remind organizations that what happens in their front-line ranks can have a major impact on business results. I&#39;ve seen and documented this in client assignments. Still, the tendency of organizations is to prioritize their salaried employees — professionals, managers, and executives.</p><h6> You mentioned that being younger than comparable peers is an attribute favorable to success. Can you elaborate more on what your studies have found regarding age inequalities?</h6><p> The negative impact of age is close to universal among our analytical findings with client organizations. The simple fact is that once an employee gets beyond the median age of their cohort, all things turn negative: They&#39;re less likely to be promoted, they&#39;re less likely to receive a high performance rating, and their pay growth levels off or declines.</p><p> The one positive is that there is less turnover with older employees, often substantially less. Indeed, it may be that it is precisely because older employees tend to stay that employers don&#39;t feel the need to promote, pay, or recognize them in the same way as they do their younger employees. The latter have more outside opportunities, so they may need to be constantly wooed.</p><p></p><p> These negative signals about older workers can be very misleading. We often find that groups with more older workers actually outperform those with more younger workers. There&#39;s a discordance between what&#39;s found at the individual level compared with the group or organizational level.</p><p> This suggests that the productivity of older workers shows up not in their own measures of individual performance but in the performance of those with whom they work. We call this a <em>spillover effect</em> . So, for example, if older workers are less likely to turn over, they can cause their younger colleagues to follow suit, thereby bringing more stability to their work groups and making them more productive. For more evidence about the productivity of older workers, see the recent study I conducted with Richard A. Guzzo and Nicholas L. Anderson, which we discuss in the article “ <a href="https://academic.oup.com/workar/article/8/2/208/6574297">Age, Experience, and Business Performance: A Meta-Analysis of Work Unit-Level Effects</a> ” in the journal <cite>Work, Aging and Retirement</cite> .</p><h6> How can organizations ensure that age diversity and inclusion are integrated into their equity and diversity initiatives?</h6><p> Again, it is a common view among business leaders that older workers are less productive. And because they tend to cost more, they are viewed more as a liability than an asset, despite significant evidence to the contrary. For some reason that I find hard to explain, combating ageism is not high on the DEI agenda, certainly not as compared with efforts to address gender and racial inequity. I fault the DEI community for not being more aggressive on this front.</p><p> The aging workforce is a fact of life almost everywhere. Organizations that don&#39;t deal effectively with the repercussions of this secular trend and ensure that they are managing their older workers effectively run the risk of undermining organizational performance. In effect, they may make their unfounded stereotypes a self-fulfilling outcome.</p><p></p><p> I always urge my clients to undertake the kind of disciplined diagnostic work to evaluate the realities of their own workforce — to determine whether spillover effects are indeed at work in their organization, and to respond accordingly. Through this process, many of them will find that they have an asset to protect rather than a liability to discard.</p><h6> Is there any analysis done on the correlation between company performance or share price and the situations demonstrated by the survey?</h6><p> I&#39;ve undertaken client studies in which we link workforce characteristics and management practices to various business outcomes, including profitability, financial and operational productivity, revenue growth, and customer retention, among others. Our results have been mixed. In some, we&#39;ve seen that greater diversity in work group or unit composition improves business performance; in others, we&#39;ve found no effect or statistically negligible results. The most robust review and synthesis of the results of these studies is the meta-analysis of the effects of age and tenure noted above. That study did not focus on the effects of race and gender.</p><h6> What concrete steps can organizations take to battle these biases?</h6><p></p><p> My article in the summer 2023 issue of <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> , “ <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/opening-access-to-the-fast-track-for-career-equity/">Opening Access to the Fast Track for Career Equity</a> ,” speaks directly to this question. I explain how organizations can use the results of this kind of modeling to help eliminate or reduce the influence of demographics on how well employees are positioned to succeed at work. The reality is that all too often, situational factors inordinately affect the ability of employees to succeed and that women and people of color are situationally disadvantaged.</p><p> Employers who recognize that they are not positioning this talent to succeed can deploy an approach I call <em>proactive career management</em> to change this reality on the ground. This may involve getting more women and people of color into supervisory or other accelerator roles, changing reporting relationships, and neutralizing the negative effects of flexible working, among other things. I share a case study in my article to illustrate this approach in action.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/dismantle-career-roadblocks-for-more-equitable-outcomes/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Do Consumers See Your Business as a Force for Good?</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/do-consumers-see-your-business-as-a-force-for-good/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/do-consumers-see-your-business-as-a-force-for-good/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 11:00:04 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Cynthia E.

Companies such as Burger King, KFC, and McDonald&#39;s have all been recent targets of government and investor pressure to cut plastic waste. Last year, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2022/04/55-million-total-ftc-settlements-kohls-and-walmart-challenge-bamboo-and-eco-claims-shed-light">both Kohl&#39;s and Walmart</a> reached settlements of $2.5 million and $3 million, respectively, for falsely claiming that dozens of rayon textile products were actually made from environmentally friendly bamboo.</p><p> When such large, visible companies issue false claims or fail to act, it results in missed opportunities, a growing performance-expectation gap, and, eventually, reputational damage among consumers. So, what makes a business a force for good when it comes to the future of our environment? To find out, Bentley University and Gallup recently conducted a survey of 5,757 Americans to assess how they feel about business and its potential to have a positive impact on society and the environment. The <a href="https://www.bentley.edu/news-Announcing-the-Bentley-Gallup-Force-for-Good-survey-results">results of the Force for Good survey</a> highlight areas in which businesses, small and large, are failing to meet people&#39;s expectations — and how they can do better.</p><p></p><p> The public&#39;s expectations of large companies like Kohl&#39;s, McDonald&#39;s, or Walmart were made clear in our research. A slight majority of our respondents (53%) said that businesses overall have a negative environmental impact. Almost two-thirds (65%) said they feel this way about <em>large</em> businesses, whereas 16% said that <em>small</em> businesses have a negative impact on the planet/environment. Younger respondents in our study had higher expectations of businesses overall, with a whopping 81% of those age 18 to 29 saying that large businesses have a negative impact on the planet, compared with 54% of respondents age 70 or older.</p><p> Drilling down into the data, we found that more than 9 in 10 respondents rated four social and environmental concerns that businesses could act on as extremely or somewhat important: practicing sustainable manufacturing (92%); promoting increased access to education and training (92%); investing time and money into local communities (92%); and operating in a way that is sustainable for the environment (91%). Just 1 in 3 people surveyed said that businesses are currently doing an excellent or good job in any of these areas, and about 1 in 4 (26%) said that businesses are doing an excellent or good job of operating in an environmentally sustainable way.</p><h3> The T-Shirt Experiment</h3><p> One perspective on sustainability is that companies should practice environmental responsibility for the greater good — the “doing good to do good” perspective. Another approach focuses on the importance of “doing good to do well” so that both business and society benefit from leaders&#39; actions. But are these approaches in tension? Need they be?</p><p> One section of the Force for Good survey — what we called our T-shirt experiment — was aimed at getting a better read on how people think about this tension. Amid rising prices for almost everything, we asked whether respondents would be willing to pay extra for a T-shirt depending on a variety of company characteristics. Sixty-three percent of respondents said they would be willing to pay extra — 82% more — for a T-shirt if the company that made it was known for having a positive impact on the environment. The numbers are even higher for respondents age 18 to 29 and for women: Young people were most likely to say they would pay more — about 8 in 10 — and almost 7 in 10 women. (See “Results of the T-Shirt Experiment.”) Both of these consumer groups are key markets for many companies.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Results of the T-Shirt Experiment</h4><p class="caption"> To differing degrees, depending on age and gender, respondents indicated their willingness to pay more for the same product based on a business&#39;s sustainability practices. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-07-26_Clark_fig1-1.png" alt="Results of the T-Shirt Experiment" /><br /></article></aside></div><p> When people were asked how much they would pay for the T-shirt without being given any additional information, the median response was $10. This held true for those with personal incomes between $24,000 and $179,000. In other words, personal income had little effect on the value they assigned to the product.</p><p></p><p> Respondents were then asked how much more they would pay if the company were known for various attributes: having a positive environmental impact, making a positive impact on the local community, treating employees well, and contributing to charities. Among the four attributes, the premium was highest for companies known to have a positive environmental impact, with a median response of $7.</p><p> Our data indicates that Americans are, in fact, willing to reward companies for doing good. A company known for positive environmental performance can charge more for its products — evidence that “doing good to do well” works.</p><p></p><h3> A False Dichotomy?</h3><p> Most of the respondents didn&#39;t see a trade-off between good environmental performance and good financial performance. In other words, they believe that both can happen concurrently, despite business leaders&#39; arguments that sustainable practices harm financial performance. About 7 in 10 respondents (69%) said businesses that prioritize making a positive impact on society are just as profitable (47%) or more profitable (22%) than their competitors. People who said they have expertise in owning, leading, or managing a business were no less likely than those without such expertise to say that businesses that prioritize making a positive impact are at least as profitable as their competitors.</p><p> Members of different political parties had notable differences of opinion regarding the importance of sustainability. For example, 84% of Democrats said it is extremely important for businesses to operate in an environmentally sustainable manner, compared with 31% of Republicans and 59% of independents. However, a large majority of Republicans (80%) said that sustainability is at least <em>somewhat</em> important. These perspectives might affect a host of company actions, such as choosing content and spending amounts for advertising in red versus blue states and the very design of their products.</p><p></p><p> Likewise, we found significant differences across ethnic identities. Seventy percent of Black respondents, 82% of Asian respondents, 65% of Hispanic respondents, and 59% of White respondents said they believe it is extremely important for businesses to operate in an environmentally sustainable manner. When asked how they feel about focusing on long-term benefits like those for the environment versus short-term benefits like profits, 77% of Asian respondents said they are likely to support that focus — compared with 56% of respondents overall. The figures for both Black and Hispanic respondents hovered around 60%.</p><p> Even when we asked the question in a slightly different way, respondents did not see it as a trade-off but as more of a “both and” situation. For example, when asked about meeting the financial goals of investors, 79% said they believe it is somewhat or extremely important. Eighty-eight percent of respondents also said that making the world a better place is somewhat or extremely important.</p><h3> How Can Your Company Become a Force for Good?</h3><p> Results from this deep dive into what a broad and varied set of Americans believe suggest several actions companies can take or plan for.</p><p> <strong>Pay attention to your local footprint.</strong> Small companies are perceived as better at most stakeholder-related activities. Respondents were twice as likely to say small businesses positively impact people&#39;s lives than large businesses (82% and 41%, respectively). What&#39;s more, respondents are more likely to think large businesses have a negative impact on Americans&#39; lives in general (38%) than they are to say the same about small businesses (4%). This data, combined with the results across age and gender in the figure below (see “Sustainability Is Important to Consumers — but Are Businesses Practicing It?”) on positive community impact, suggests that companies — particularly large ones — should improve their relationships with their surrounding communities.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Recognize that younger Americans expect more.</strong> Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) and Gen Zers (born between 1997 and 2012) expect more from businesses in terms of both social and environmental responsibility than older respondents do. In our T-shirt experiment, 82% of respondents age 18 to 29 were willing to pay more for a T-shirt from a company known for having a positive impact on their local community. Again, young respondents (73%) agreed more than any other age group that businesses&#39; efforts to reduce their carbon footprints and/or emissions are important. Companies will need to account for their environmental stewardship among their customers and future employees.</p><p> <strong>Mind the performance-expectation gap.</strong> Environmental stakeholders and regulators are on the lookout for any discrepancy between expectations of a company&#39;s responsible environmental management and what it is actually doing — the performance-expectation gap. The vast majority of respondents (89%) said businesses have “a great deal” or “some” power to make a positive impact on people&#39;s lives, but just 57% said that businesses are very or somewhat effective at doing so. In terms of the environment, the findings revealed performance-expectation gaps of at least 30 percentage points between “the importance of” and “the performance of” several environmental goals. On questions about reducing businesses&#39; carbon footprints, engaging in sustainable manufacturing, and making the world a better place, we found considerable gaps: On those three points, 52% to 57% of respondents indicated that it is extremely important for businesses to do so, but only 24% to 28% thought they are excellent or good at it.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Sustainability Is Important to Consumers — but Are Businesses Practicing It?</h4><p class="caption"> There is a considerable gap between respondents&#39; opinions on the importance of sustainability practices and their perceptions of businesses&#39; actual practices. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-07-26_Clark_fig2.png" alt="Sustainability Is Important to Consumers — but Are Businesses Practicing It?" /><br /></article></aside></div><p> While having a dedicated sustainability leader, support from senior management, and education for employees and executives is necessary, it&#39;s important to stay vigilant in addressing the widening performance-expectation gap. In what has become a hypercritical business environment, leaders must pay greater attention to how perceptions of what their company is doing compare with what they are actually doing.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Set sustainability goals.</strong> Think carefully about how to measure what you&#39;re doing. This is a logical next step after gaining the support of senior management, and it can help your company determine the progress it has made and where it has soft or blind spots. In fact, regulators have proposed requiring companies to disclose how they set climate-related targets and measure their progress toward meeting them. Consider signing on to broadly recognized and accepted goals like the United Nations Global Compact&#39;s (UNGC&#39;s) <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/">Sustainable Development Goals</a> , which can help your company publicly commit to a plan of action, step by step. The UNGC also requires annual statements on progress to help ward off greenwashing.</p><p></p><p> With increasing attention on environmental sustainability, gaining an understanding of how various stakeholders perceive your statements and actions is vital. By identifying and understanding current perceptions and their implications, as the Bentley-Gallup study does, companies can amend their environmental commitments and processes to ensure that they invigorate their efforts to be a force for good, which will benefit the company, its stakeholders, and, most importantly, the environment.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/do-consumers-see-your-business-as-a-force-for-good/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Myth of the Mainstream</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-myth-of-the-mainstream/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-myth-of-the-mainstream/#comments</comments><pubDate> Mon, 24 Jul 2023 11:00:22 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Marcus Collins. <p>Marcus Collins is a clinical marketing professor at the University of Michigan&#39;s Ross School of Business and former head of strategy at Wieden+Kennedy New York.

The brand had become a symbol of food choices that were driving escalating rates of obesity and hypertension.</p><p> The company spent more than a decade trying to fight this perception among American consumers by targeting them with messaging about its updated menu, which offered healthier alternatives more in line with contemporary diet trends — but to no avail. Year over year, McDonald&#39;s sales declined, and its brand perception continued to spiral downward.</p><p></p><p> Finally, the company decided to go on the offensive. Instead of combating the opposition&#39;s hate and attempting to win over those in the middle, McDonald&#39;s decided to focus on its fans — the people who self-identify as McDonald&#39;s devotees despite the vitriol directed at the brand. The company&#39;s tactics included launching its Famous Orders campaign, which celebrated the favored menu items of superstar fans (like hip-hop mogul Travis Scott and K-pop megastars BTS); creating adult-targeted Happy Meals; and promoting fans&#39; own menu hacks. In doing so, it tapped into what these devotees love about McDonald&#39;s and not only activated their collective consumption but also inspired them to spread the word on behalf of the brand. The result of this strategy was a 10.4% increase in global revenue for McDonald&#39;s from 2018 to 2021 and the return of dormant customers: more than a quarter of those who came in to buy the Travis Scott meal, for example, hadn&#39;t visited the chain in over a year. Seemingly overnight, McDonald&#39;s went from being a cautionary tale to the darling of brand marketing and a case study for advertising effectiveness.</p><p></p><p>这里发生了什么？ Conventional wisdom would tell us that in a world of increasingly polarized opinions, our best bet is to appease the middle, if only because that&#39;s where the majority of the market is. That also seems like a safe bet to many companies, as a middle-of-the-road position is less likely to alienate potential customers. But McDonald&#39;s demonstrated what can happen when you dismiss this conventional approach. Instead of trying to speak to the mass market, it chose a side. It chose to embrace the love instead, fighting the hate, and it abandoned the notion of enticing the large but indifferent middle of the market. By doing so, McDonald&#39;s marketing efforts activated a legion of fans who not only consumed but also won over others as well. What McDonald&#39;s realized is an important lesson for contemporary marketers: If you want to get people to move, you must choose a side. The notion that you can win by playing to the middle is a misleading myth.</p><p></p><h3> Choose a Side</h3><p> The core function of marketing is to influence people to adopt a desired behavior. That is to say, we go to market to get people to move — to buy, to vote, to recycle, to subscribe, to download, to watch, to evangelize, to wear a mask — and to drive a host of other desirable behavioral outcomes that will benefit our organization or interests. And what influences people the most? Well, according to everything we know about human behavior, we are most influenced by other people — not ads, not value propositions, but other people. More specifically, we are most influenced by <em>our</em> people: the individuals who abide by the same culturally established conventions and expectations that dictate what is considered acceptable behavior for people like us. These individuals typically share a similar worldview and, therefore, adhere to a shared way of life in an effort to promote social solidarity among themselves — their subculture. They consume the way the subculture consumes, vote the way it votes, and behave the way it behaves, because that is what is expected of people like them.</p><p> If these people are against you because of the shared conventions and expectations of people like them (their culture), then the likelihood of getting them to take action on your behalf will be slim. That&#39;s why right-wing Republicans won&#39;t bother trying to convert left-leaning Democrats. Instead, Republicans speak to their base — the collective of people who see the world similarly, express a similar set of cultural characteristics as the brand, and are more inclined to move in step with the brand as an act of social solidarity. They identify as members of this group and follow its behavioral norms.</p><p> Those in the unaffiliated middle of the population, on the other hand, are by nature indifferent and risk averse. While they may have opinions, they lack strong convictions in either direction and are therefore less likely to take action. In politics, they don&#39;t vote in primaries or campaign for candidates; instead, they sit on the sidelines and wait to see how things shake out. Their behavior is the same when it comes to brands.</p><p> The middle doesn&#39;t adopt new products with any urgency. They are not the first to respond to marketing communications, nor are they likely to weigh in on a debate between advocates and detractors. They mitigate their own risk of moving out of step with what might be considered generally acceptable by stepping back and observing other people&#39;s responses first.</p><p> The red herring is that we perceive this indifference as an opportunity to persuade them to one side or the other. But the truth is, they are not typically convinced by any marketing communications. Instead, they, too, take cues from other people — sometimes those who are for you, and at other times those who are against you.</p><p></p><p> With this in mind, it becomes abundantly clear that in a polarized scenario, the chances of marketers getting people to move are far greater when we activate the collective of the willing as opposed to trying to convince detractors or even persuade the indifferent. And yet, historically, marketers have focused their efforts on the middle because it represents the biggest market opportunity. However, our chances of successfully influencing behavior increases when we choose to address the people who are most likely to take action. When we do so effectively, we catalyze a propagation effect that causes the product, behavior, or idea to cascade throughout the population, thanks to the process of social contagion — the spread of affects, behaviors, cognitions, and desires due to direct or indirect peer influence of people “like us.”</p><h3> The Power of Propagation</h3><p> The idea of propagation demands that marketers leave behind the conventional approach of targeting the middle, where the majority of the population resides. Besides being of questionable effectiveness, as discussed above, reaching the middle requires costly media spending (think prime-time TV and Super Bowl ads) and places marketing messages in an arena that is noisy and saturated with competing messages. Marketers pay little attention to the fringe, a population that conventional wisdom tells us is too small and too niche. But everything that is now mainstream once started on the fringe: It started within a subculture and propagated out to become popular culture.</p><p> For instance, if you were into comic books 20 years ago, you would have been considered a nerd. Today, however, many of the most-viewed movies across the globe, such as Marvel&#39;s <cite>Avengers</cite> series, originated from comics. Twenty years ago, if you were into video games, you would have been perceived as an immature adult. Today, gaming is not only considered cool but is also a multibillion-dollar industry. Indeed, what is now normal was once fringe. Thanks to social contagion, the cultural characteristics of a community propagate from the fringe to the middle — from the subculture to popular culture. It happens from the outside in, not the inside out.</p><p></p><p> Unlike traditional marketing communications, the reach and subsequent adoption that is achieved through this kind of propagation does not rely on people hearing a message from a company or brand. (It helps, but it&#39;s not necessary.) Instead, people hear about it from someone they trust — someone like them — which increases their likelihood of adoption. As the network scientists Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler contended, “When a small group of people begin acting in concert — displaying similar visible symptoms — the epidemic can spread along social network ties via emotion contagion and large groups can become quickly emotionally synchronized.” This is the network effect that is catalyzed when you activate the collective of the willing. Don&#39;t focus on the middle: Focus on the people who see the world the way you do. Choose a side, and they will convince the bystanders, the passive, the indifferent.</p><p></p><p> Although broadcast messaging might get our attention, it&#39;s the influence of people like us, people with whom we identify, that changes our outlook and, subsequently, our behaviors. This provides a new perspective, and corresponding strategies, for marketers who aim to communicate with consumers in a culture where ideological binaries seem to divide the market. Like McDonald&#39;s did, marketers benefit from choosing a side that is most likely to move and then activating its members so that they might convert people on the brand&#39;s behalf. Status quo practices position the middle as a safe bet. However, the dynamics of cultural diffusion subvert these long-standing best practices for connecting with consumers and influencing behavioral adoption, and demand that today&#39;s practitioners develop new strategies and accompanying tactics.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-myth-of-the-mainstream/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 1</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
