面临着来自公司治理的直接障碍：他被告知，他的实验室必须遵循用于保护巴斯夫整个云基础设施的相同公司数据政策，这将使其无法快速灵活地与其他公司合作新的初创公司。 Lacerda 推迟了发布，直到他能够凭借重要的政治资本安排一个例外：为他的团队提供一个包含单独数据的“沙箱”，并获得通过 API 与新合作伙伴共享这些数据的特别许可。</p><p> Lacerda 以及许多创新冠军的经验指出了数字化转型的一个基本问题：在大公司中，创新团队在面对与他们自己的变革使命相矛盾的业务规则时只能争取豁免。但只要依赖于高层领导批准的临时例外，创新就永远不会大规模发生。相反，我们必须重新思考我们的治理方法，并设计新的管理实践，以数字化的速度进行创新。</p><p></p><p>设计可重复的创新流程对于数字时代的增长至关重要，但它却非常困难。在太多的组织中，新企业都是在单一执行发起人的基础上获得批准的。一旦启动，企业就会进展缓慢，由传统孤岛中的团队管理。资源分配也很缓慢，因为有前途的项目要等待数周或数月才能获得下一轮批准。因为每个项目都得到了一位有影响力的高管的支持，所以没有人愿意关闭它，即使它没有什么希望。</p><p>与此同时，风险规避导致企业只为他们容易实现的目标提供资金——对核心进行渐进式改进，从而带来有保证的、快速的投资回报率。这条路永远不会导致转变。相反，您需要接受不确定性并支持核心内部和外部增长的治理。

<a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a>小团队是敏捷方法的基础，敏捷方法使用快速的短冲刺节奏，每个团队都必须交付新的工作代码、测试和学习，并调整优先级。在亚马逊，创新团队被称为“双披萨团队”，因为每个团队都应该足够小，可以容纳两个披萨（最多八个人）。</p><p><strong>多功能的。</strong>优秀的创新团队拥有多元化的成员，他们跨越职能部门（例如营销、工程和设计）。每个团队的目标是拥有能够提供完成工作所需的所有基本技能的成员。多功能团队能够完全自行推进，而不是在项目中采取下一步之前不断等待另一个部门的输入。</p><p><strong>单线程。</strong>最好的创新团队的所有成员都全职致力于团队的工作。至少，创新团队的领导者必须是单线程的，这意味着他们不能将每周的工作时间分配给团队的新项目和其他项目。领导团队是他们的全部责任。</p><p><strong>自主性。</strong>成功的创新团队拥有明确的决策权，使他们有权在自己的指导下工作。他们的工作不需要获得团队之外任何人的批准——无论是产品设计、接下来要运行哪些测试，还是要追求哪些客户。自治还意味着不禁止从公司外部承包资源。</p><p><strong>负责。</strong>只有当团队也明确对其工作结果负责时，自治才有可能实现。在这里，良好的治理需要对成功有一个明确的定义，这是根据结果而不是可交付成果来定义的。该定义可能包括定量指标和定性原则，并且在团队工作开始之前必须与领导层达成一致。有效的问责制还需要透明度：在任何时候，团队的结果必须对团队内部或外部的任何人可见。每次测试运行、构建的每个 MVP 以及跟踪的每个指标都应该对公司中的任何人可见。</p><h3>与增长委员会建立监督</h3><p>创新团队最重要的合作伙伴是负责分配资金并监督和支持其工作的管理者。根据我的经验，支持企业创新最成功的模式是董事会。在董事会模式中，一个小组定期召开会议并审议，以决定是否赞助各种可能的创新企业——就像一群风险投资人听取初创公司的推介一样。一个创新委员会将赞助和支持多个并行工作的团队。</p><p>这种方法与我发现的非常常见的方法形成鲜明对比：新企业由单一发起人批准的组织。在这些公司中，一名或多名高管可能会利用他们在组织内的影响力来赞助他们认为具有战略重要性和前景的新数字企业。这种模型本质上是临时的，决策基于不同个人的直觉和判断。一旦赞助商将自己的名字和声誉投入到一个项目中，他们就很难让它消亡，无论市场验证其前景如何。相比之下，董事会模式——具有更大的多样性和决策的公正性——本质上更适合大规模管理创新。</p><p>有效的企业创新委员会（也称为增长委员会、风险投资委员会或增长委员会）的人数不应超过八人。他们应该包括具有主题专业知识和市场知识的成员。董事会应该能够挑战公司的正统观念，倡导长远观点，并引入行业外的想法。最好的董事会由来自不同部门的内部利益相关者和至少一名具有外部视角的成员组成。成员的级别应该足够高，以便在组织中拥有真正的影响力，但级别又不能高到无法将董事会工作作为优先事项。</p><p>董事会的职责是定期开会批准新企业，为团队提供战略指导，决定每个阶段的额外资金，并就何时关闭企业做出严格的决定。在这里，决策权再次至关重要。创新委员会必须对其投资组合中的每个团队拥有完整的资助权。其决策应通过与团队的公开而活跃的辩论来制定，但决策权仍由董事会决定。其他高级管理人员，包括首席执行官，可以为企业提供建议和意见，但他们不能对董事会的投资决策进行投票或否决。</p><p></p><h3>为新项目开绿灯</h3><p>董事会和团队必须合作的第一个流程是开绿灯，即批准新企业开始工作。当董事会批准一家新企业时，它应该为团队分配足够的资源（以时间、金钱和人员的形式）进行第一轮测试，以验证有关商业模式的最初问题。有效批准的关键是<em>最大限度地减少</em>每个团队的初始投资，并<em>最大限度地增加</em>批准测试的想法数量。</p><p>这种方法可能看起来有悖常理——它肯定与许多创新治理不善的组织中试图“选择赢家并下大赌注”的倾向形成鲜明对比。事实上，对于董事会来说，重要的是要克制住试图从提交的想法中挑选最佳想法的冲动。首先，董事会确实无法知道哪些想法可行。这些知识只能通过测试和验证来获得。其次，成功的企业往往源于最初有缺陷但随着测试、反馈和迭代设计而不断发展的想法。我建议董事会不要试图评估成功的可能性，而是根据问题定义、战略契合度和团队思维来判断新企业的推介。</p><p></p><p>为了批准许多创新想法，必须建立快速、廉价且有效的验证流程。这意味着引入客户的声音来快速测试该企业是否专注于解决真正的问题。在花旗银行，新企业通常以为期两天或三天的研讨会开始，员工在其中探索问题/机会陈述，并有机会与实际客户一起快速、迭代地开发自己的创新理念。随着您提高第一阶段验证的速度并降低成本，您的企业就有能力批准更多的风险团队来测试和追求更多可能的增长想法。</p><h3>通过迭代资金管理资源</h3><p>管理创新的下一个关键流程是迭代融资，这是董事会在企业获得批准后向团队分配资源的方式。基于风险投资初创企业融资方法，迭代融资被设计得极其敏捷。在每次董事会审查（通常每 30、60 或 90 天）中，董事会将审查每个团队的进度，包括市场测试的新数据，并决定是否向该团队释放下一批资源。</p><p>迭代融资与大型企业的传统预算流程截然不同。这就是为什么它是管理新创新投资的更好方法：</p><p><strong>更快地开始。</strong>在传统的预算流程中，新项目将获得一大笔初始资金，以反映对该项目的承诺。但这只有在经过长时间的分析之后才会发生，分析努力通过基准和第三方数据（误导性地）评估不确定的新企业的机会。相比之下，迭代融资为企业提供了较小的初始预算，但如果团队正在寻求的机会明确且具有战略相关性，则可以让团队快速启动。</p><p><strong>融资周期更短，更加敏捷。</strong>公司预算通常每年制定一次，项目和部门的资金通过一个需要数月的复杂过程来提供。一家有前途的新企业可能需要等待一年多的时间才能获得进行为期四个星期的测试的资源。相比之下，当董事会频繁开会并且融资轮次只为团队提供一到三个月的资源时，决策就会更加灵活。</p><p><strong>根据真实世界的数据进行投资。</strong>许多领导者会向未经测试的新企业过度投入资金，因为他们个人相信该策略是正确的，或者因为他们被团队的说服力所左右。通过迭代融资流程，董事会完全根据真实数据来决定每轮资源。每次开会时，董事会和团队都必须就团队需要在下一次审查会议上提供哪些数据达成一致。这些指标（通常是三到六个关键变量）将随着时间的推移而发生变化，具体取决于新企业仍然面临的最大不确定性来源。它们记录了风险投资团队迄今为止所学到的知识以及下一步需要学习的知识。</p><p><strong>快速扩展以推动指数级增长。</strong>在传统预算中，当资金更新时，任何增加都只是之前预算的增量。通过迭代融资，如果验证成功且风险投资取得进展，则每轮投资的规模应呈指数级增长。人力资源配置也应增加。这意味着发现有意义的增长机会的创新团队可以快速扩展，从而对公司的利润产生可衡量的影响。</p><p>显然，迭代融资要求董事会准备好快速增加对在市场上证明自己的企业的投资。这意味着企业必须提前为一组资源提供资金，以便董事会在一年内跨项目组合进行分配。</p><p>在每个投资组合中，类似的创新（例如，单个业务部门内的高风险创新组合）应该争夺资金。不要让苹果与橙子竞争。首先为特定类别的创新投资组合提供资金，然后让董事会迭代地为各种企业提供资金。</p><h3>养成智能关机的习惯</h3><p>当然，并非每个团队审查都会以继续资助的决定结束。困扰企业创新的经典问题之一是，企业学会如何启动新项目，而不是如何阻止它们。为了让创新取得成果，公司必须准备好退出那些被证明不成功或与战略不够一致的项目。</p><p>系统地、定期地关闭企业是成长委员会的一项关键工作。每次董事会开会进行迭代融资审查时，问题必须是：“我们是进一步资助该企业还是将其关闭？”</p><p></p><p>在传统公司，关闭创新项目的最大障碍往往是不愿承认失败，以及一种非理性的感觉，即任何类型的失败都会带来太大的风险。但如果通过迭代融资提前关闭，失败的成本是最小的。相比之下，如果你的团队不快速、明智地关闭企业，公司就会付出非常实际的成本。如果没有这种纪律，您的创新将缺乏重点，您的资源将分散得太薄，并且您将耗尽新实验的带宽。你将被<em>僵尸项目</em>困住——不成功的企业永远不会关闭并继续吸走资源。在强生公司，通过评估现有投资组合并关闭不再符合公司更新战略的项目来资助一系列全新的创新。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a></p><p>只有当你将其作为例行决定时，停止项目才会变得更容易，而定期进行资金审查的创新委员会将产生巨大的影响。在通用电气的石油和天然气部门，在董事会成立之前很少有项目被关闭。董事会一开始，就在第一个 90 天的周期内轻松关闭了 20% 的现有项目。随着董事会和团队开始专注于战略调整，50% 的新企业在 60 天内关闭。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a>媒体巨头 Schibsted 的目标是，每当在开发渠道中添加新内容时，就会取消一项风险投资。当一个项目需要审查时，为自己设定一个高标准，问：“我们为什么不应该关闭这个项目？”</p><p>以下五种做法对于在任何组织中实现智能关闭至关重要：</p><p><strong>规划一条具有存活率的管道。</strong>大规模创新需要规划关闭大多数新企业。在与真正的客户接触后，只有三分之一到一半的明亮、闪亮的新想法能够通过第一次融资审查。存活率通常会在随后的回合中增加。了解您在不同验证阶段的存活率将使您能够规划未来的管道。例如，如果董事会预计在一年内帮助将三到四家新企业推向市场，那么它需要在一开始就播下足够的种子，以获得成功的良好机会。</p><p><strong>使用风险积压来快速重新分配。</strong>创新委员会应该保留一份已批准但尚未开始的企业创意的排名列表。在审核过程中使用此待办事项将使关闭变得更加容易。重点不再是简单地扼杀一个失败的想法，而是释放团队及其资源，从积压的工作中开发更有前途的想法。因此，当您关闭一个项目时，请快速将成员重新分配给下一个最佳想法。在许多情况下，这可能只是意味着让团队重新关注同一问题的不同解决方案。</p><p><strong>从停工中提取价值。</strong>当您决定关闭一个项目时，请寻求尽可能多的价值。在某些情况下，公司可以将合资企业出售给另一家企业。当沃尔玛的 Vudu 流媒体视频服务不再具有强大的战略优势时，沃尔玛将其剥离给媒体巨头康卡斯特。有时，一项事业很有前途，但尚未可行；通过缩减投资，您可以维持未来的选择。在谷歌眼镜作为消费产品失败后，该公司将项目缩减为专注于工厂车间应用程序的企业专用设备。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a>有时，只有完全关闭才有意义，而要提取的关键价值是从实验中获得的经验教训。当亚马逊关闭其亚马逊拍卖和 zShops 服务时，它吸取了教训，为随后推出的亚马逊商城取得了巨大成功。</p><p><strong>广泛分享学习成果。</strong>分享你从失败的企业中学到的东西是最难遵循的原则之一。大多数公司更愿意放弃那些没有成功的项目。在 2014 年关于其早期数字化转型工作的内部报告中，《纽约时报》承认：“当我们关闭项目时，决策都是悄悄做出的，很少进行讨论，以保护项目运行人员的声誉。结果，教训被遗忘，相关员工变得更加厌恶风险。” <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a>克服这种不情愿对于纽约时报公司及其商业模式的最终转变至关重要。国际汽车联合会 (FIA) 的德国分支机构运营着一个创新实验室，一年内 10 个项目中有 8 个被取消。它最大的胜利是什么？与世界各地在自己的市场上面临同样挑战的其他国际汽联附属机构分享这些结果。</p><p><strong>将人与项目区分开来。</strong>这是建立接受创新失败并从中学习的文化的最后一个关键部分。强有力的董事会审查流程将使团队对其结果负责。但你应该小心，不要将失败的项目与参与该项目的个人的优点联系起来。这些团队成员可以在下一个项目中为您取得巨大的成功。一定要鼓励您的创新者继续研究他们的下一个想法。</p><p>如果你的停工流程确实有效，你就会开始看到志愿服务。当团队真正专注于通过实验验证增长机会时，他们通常会向董事会建议自己关闭，并报告说：“这就是我们所了解到的情况以及我们建议现在关闭的原因。”当这些员工很快带着另一个创业想法回到董事会时，请不要感到惊讶。这可能是你的下一个重大突破。</p><p></p><p></p><p>为了让数字化转型为任何组织带来真正的增长和价值，它必须不仅仅涉及在不合适的管理下挣扎的团队的孤立创新。如果没有新的治理模式来管理新企业，数字创新的潜力将永远达不到。</p><p>创新治理需要三个关键组成部分：（1）必须授权团队快速行动并进行实验，以发现市场上有效的方法； (2) 董事会必须有权监督团队组合并为其提供建议，在最需要的地方分配资源； (3) 两者都必须遵循为新企业开绿灯的常规流程，迭代地为其提供资金，并关闭它们，为下一个新兴机会腾出资源。</p><p>有了正确的治理，各种类型的老牌公司都可以释放员工的潜力，推动业务各个层面的转型和增长。</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss>

所以，在这种情况下，我们使用最近邻图，我们在上面写了很多文档，也就是说，“嘿，在这种情况下，我有一个图像，并且我有另一个与这个图片。”这让我能够构建这种图像网络。图表在 Pinterest 上工作的原因是因为每个引脚本质上都被添加到板上，这本质上使其成为图表中的一个节点，因此它会继续增加图表。</p><p>因此，它允许您……与 SQL 数据库或关系数据库不同，您必须对标签索引和索引进行排序，而图表可以被索引。本质上任何图像都可以索引到任何其他图像。它允许您非常有效地搜索相关的事物。这就是 Pinterest 的力量。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong> Jeremy，你提到人工智能一直是 Pinterest 旅程的重要组成部分，并且从 Pinterest 成立之初就已经在 Pinterest 的技术堆栈中根深蒂固，所以对于你们来说，生成式人工智能一定也无处不在，我相信现在每个人都在想这个问题。所以也许可以告诉我们一些你在那里做什么的情况。</p><p> <strong>Jeremy King：</strong>我们拥有最先进的机器学习环境，可以将所有表面上的这些数据集互连起来。我们将其称为“主页”、搜索系统、推动 Pinterest 个性化、推荐和参与的相关事物。 [并且]我们的月度活跃用户增长速度非常快。 …… Z 世代的增长速度甚至是最快的。我们每月增加了 1300 万活跃用户，因此我们真正关注的是如何提高参与度。</p><p>毫不奇怪，机器学习的许多改进，即使是在过去两年，也一直在推动这种参与。当然，我们已经构建了新功能，使 Pinterest 变得更容易购物。但是，当我们看到机器学习模型的能力有效地增强了 10 倍或 100 倍（这在今天相对常见）时，我们发现随着结果变得更加具体，我们的结果也会大幅增加。</p><p>坦率地说，Pinterest 还关注[大量]不同的事物。所以并不是每一个项目都是关于“你今晚晚餐想做什么？”这也是“我知道你上周在看生日蛋糕”或“新年即将到来”，我们将其中一些相互影响。因此，我们一直在利用一些近几年才出现的先进人工智能功能。这包括 GPU [图形处理单元] 工作以及所有使这些事情变得经济高效的事情。</p><p>因此，回到你关于生成式人工智能的问题，毫不奇怪，考虑到我们是一个图像平台，生成式人工智能对我们来说非常有趣，我通常将其分为三个部分。当我们考虑大型语言模型（法学硕士）时，我们会讨论，第一，如何提高我的团队的工作效率？我们有几个飞行员正在运行。我们还没有确切决定走哪条路，但它看起来确实很有前途，并且像许多其他 CTO 一样，我们对此感到非常兴奋。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>这很有趣。告诉我们生成式人工智能如何提高效率。</p><p> <strong>Jeremy King：</strong>我与一些 CTO 交谈过，我认为非常有趣的一件事是，这位特定的 CTO 说，一般来说，它提高了 10% 到 15% 的生产力，但有一小部分用户的工作效率提高了 50%。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>太棒了。我只是想说，感觉就像，如果你回到十年前，有很多图像和非结构化文本以及诸如此类的东西，让人工智能训练这些数据并理解它，人类干预需要这样做，既可以标记内容，也可以确保输出有意义。现在感觉，随着人工智能时代的到来，许多类似人类的判断将越来越多地通过人工智能时代做出，特别是对于大量非结构化文本、图像、视频和此类内容。是这样吗，还是我太过分了？</p><p><strong>杰里米·金：</strong>我认为这是对的。我的意思是，Pinterest 的系统是建立在嵌入的基础上的，所以你拍摄一张图像或一段文本，然后基本上给它贴上标签——本质上，就你的观点而言，这就是 Pinterest 真正擅长的。您可以利用我们的计算机视觉技术并有效地构建这些嵌入来检测人、内容、沙发或生日蛋糕。</p><p>我们在这方面非常擅长，并且在这方面长期处于行业领先地位。你没有错，所发生的事情只是变得更好；它变得更加准确、更加具体。在过去，我可以说，“嘿，我知道这是一盏灯，我知道它有吊坠，它是由水晶制成的，它是金的，”诸如此类的事情。但现在我可以说：“我确切地知道它上面有多少个尖齿；我知道它们是什么类型的灯泡；我大概知道是谁制造的”之类的东西。我可以说得更具体。</p><p>在 Pinterest，我们确实将它们视为两件不同的事情。人们来到 Pinterest 是因为他们不知道自己到底想要什么。这就是 Pinterest 蓬勃发展的地方，也是我们在市场上保持长期差异化的原因。因为如果你知道你想要什么，你总是可以去亚马逊、家得宝或 Wayfair 去购买，但如果你不知道你想要什么，你可以从 Pinterest 开始或进行一百万种不同的搜索，因为[你]不知道你想要什么。我不知道如何描述，你知道，“经典的谷仓厨房”——[你]不知道这些词。</p><p>因此，即使将其放入 ChatGPT 之类的东西中，我也不知道该怎么说 - 你知道我的意思吗？我相信随着时间的推移，这会变得更好，但其中很多也将是基于图像的。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>您是否发现可用的基础模型可以为您做到这一点，或者您正在构建自己的特定领域模型？</p><p><strong>杰里米·金：</strong>我想，两者都是答案。我们发现——现在还相对较早——在生成图像方面，我们发现较小的模型实际上更加具体，所以我认为这就是将会发生的事情。我的 CTO 朋友们也说了同样的事情，也就是说，每个模型都将针对具体用例，这不仅有助于它更加准确，而且还使其实施成本大大降低。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>我认为您多次提到蛋糕很有趣，因为我认为装饰蛋糕实际上是我唯一使用 Pinterest 的用途。这与谢尔文关于生成的评论有关，因为我深深怀疑我在那里看到的那些蛋糕，没有人可以创造。我当然无法创造它们。那么……人们在多大程度上发布了实际上不存在的图像或不存在的产品？ Pinterest 对此有何看法？</p><p><strong>杰里米·金：</strong>说得很好。我想，是的，我们在我们称之为“艺术”的最大类别之一中经常看到这种情况。艺术包括很多东西，包括传统上挂在墙上的东西、绘画等等。但它也包括人体艺术之类的东西，我们有纹身之类的东西。再说一次，很多都是很好的案例，人们需要一点灵感，而且它可以产生创造力，对吗？它可能不存在于世界上，但你想看看它在人类身上是什么样子。</p><p>你可以看到这一点的到来，你将能够打印出一些生成的东西。这已经发生了，对吧？</p><p><strong>萨姆·兰斯博瑟姆：</strong>是的。这确实与灵感的理念相符。</p><p><strong>杰里米·金：</strong>是的，绝对如此。像蛋糕之类的东西很有趣。更困难的部分之一是，我见过很多关于家居和家居装修的工作，但它正在产生一大堆无法实现的想法，我可以说，“嘿，人们还没有真正拿出相机来拍一张他们房间的照片。”人们这样做，但我们称之为 1% 功能。比如，如何让人们真正使用手机或手机摄像头？</p><p>但如果你可以上传一张图片——我已经看到了一些漂亮的效果图，比如，“这就是我的房间。重新布置我房间里的家具，我已有的家具，”这样的事情变得非常有趣。或者你说，“我想用 Wayfair 的这张沙发替换这张沙发。我想用其他灯替换这盏灯，”这里有 20 种不同的组合，您可以点击查看。</p><p>这就像您正在进行虚拟体验，几乎像 AR [类似增强现实]，但您将真实的产品放入其中，而不是生成产品。但它可以让您构建更加增强的用户体验。</p><p>去年，我们开发了<a href="https://help.pinterest.com/en/article/try-on">AR Try On</a> ，它可以让你试妆，我们再次看到，虽然它没有得到大量使用，但使用它的人购买的可能性增加了 60%某物。当人们真正到达那里时，它会非常有吸引力。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong> Pinterest 的困难是什么？您提到了很多很好的用例，您正在使用这些技术做很多事情。当然，不可能一切都那么美好。有什么难的？</p><p> <strong>Jeremy King：</strong>我们在包容性搜索和结果上花费了大量时间。 2021年，我们推出了发型搜索。这就是第一个技术：当您寻找发型时，如何识别与您相似的头发？这对于完善您正在寻找的内容非常重要。</p><p>我们在肤色方面也遇到了同样的问题，最初我们尝试使用早期模型进行肤色检测。我们发现，更多的是关于人脸检测。因此，我们的团队在皮肤检测方面做了一些出色的工作——它可以是侧面拍摄、背面拍摄、耳朵拍摄或手部拍摄。你不知道什么样的皮肤。那么如何检测是什么皮肤呢？然后您就可以检测到您正在寻找哪种语气。</p><p>同样的东西也必须应用到头发上。我们有各种各样的头发：我们有剃光/秃头、我们有直发、我们有波浪形、我们有卷发、我们有卷发、我们有保护性头发，这些类型的头发使结果显着更好。</p><p>您可以保存您的头发图案和肤色，然后我们将据此定制您的结果。正如您可以想象的那样，这是一个复杂的问题。这不仅仅是美国的事；也是美国的事。每个不同的国家都有不同类型的头发图案和肤色以及不同类型的时尚，所以这些事情确实很难，但它们是伟大的项目。</p><p>我们拥有一支出色的团队。特别是这里的先进技术团队——我们一直致力于包容性技术和所有这些先进模型，它们确实很难，但当你把它们做好时，它们会很棒。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我们这里有一个部分：五个快速问题。我只会问你一堆连珠炮般的问题。请告诉我你想到的第一件事。你最自豪的人工智能时刻是什么？</p><p> <strong>Jeremy King：</strong>包容性的产品功能，实际上，头发图案是我最自豪的功能，因为我不仅从一开始就参与了该产品，而且它也是行业中的第一个。我们从钉钉者那里得到的回应之多令人难以置信。所以，是的，这确实是一件好事。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>除了偏见和一些道德问题之外，您对人工智能还有哪些担忧？</p><p><strong>杰里米·金：</strong>这很有趣。每个论坛上都有。它说：“嘿，你担心偏见吗？”让我们来看看。人工智能让我担心什么？唔。是的，我不担心。我不担心太多事情，但那是CTO……</p><p><strong>谢尔文·霍达班德：</strong>很好。但这是一件好事，对吧？</p><p> <strong>Jeremy King：</strong>这是一位长期担任首席技术官的事情。如果你担心太多，你就无法在这份工作中生存。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>您最喜欢的不涉及技术的活动是什么？</p><p><strong>杰里米·金：</strong>山地自行车。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>非常酷。</p><p><strong>杰里米·金：</strong>我尝试每周至少去两次。周五早上我和一群硅谷科技[同事]一起去，然后通常在周末和我的兄弟和其他一些人一起去。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>你想要的第一个职业：你长大后想做什么？</p><p> <strong>Jeremy King：</strong>我认为我 5 岁的婴儿书上写的是消防员，但我的祖父和父亲都是工程师，所以我实际上认为我会建造房屋，因为我喜欢在外面用手工作。所以这就是我想我要去的地方——建筑或房屋建造。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>您希望人工智能能做哪些目前做不到的事情？</p><p><strong>杰里米·金：</strong>传送：让我更快地通过安检线！也许那即将到来。我一直对翻译感到非常兴奋。我很久以前就接管了 eBay 的翻译团队，有一些很棒的人正在从事这方面的工作。我一直认为万能翻译器会是一件非常神奇的事情。它已经如此接近，但在该设备的消费者版本出现之前似乎仍然很遥远。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>但你认为这是为什么呢？因为我们现在有了法学硕士，而且很长一段时间以来我们已经有了音频到文本的技术。这里的限制因素是什么？</p><p> <strong>Jeremy King：</strong>我认为这是外形因素；比如，我如何拿出手机，点击“从西班牙语翻译成英语”——你知道，诸如此类的事情。我不知道;如果我走到旧金山街上的一个小贩面前，我说的语言不同，但我想要一些东西。 ……它必须很接近，但这是一个外形因素。但我认为它很快就会到来。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>似乎可以解决。</p><p><strong>杰里米·金：</strong>是的，可以解决。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>杰里米，我们非常感谢您抽出时间与我们交谈。在幕后了解我们看到的所有图像之间发生的事情是非常有趣的，但我们可能没有意识到制作看起来像 Pinterest 一样简单的东西所需要的一切。看到这背后有多少人工智能和机器学习是非常令人着迷的。感谢您加入我们。</p><p><strong>杰里米·金：</strong>当然。太棒了。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>感谢您今天的收听。在我们的下一集中，萨姆和我会见了国际特赦组织的达米尼·萨蒂亚和马特·马哈茂迪。请加入我们。</p><p><strong>艾莉森·莱德：</strong>感谢您聆听<cite>我、我自己和人工智能的演讲</cite>。和您一样，我们相信关于人工智能实施的对话不会从这个播客开始和结束。这就是为什么我们在 LinkedIn 上专门为像您这样的听众创建了一个群组。它被称为 AI for Leaders，如果您加入我们，您可以与节目创作者和主持人聊天，提出您自己的问题，分享您的见解，并获得来自<cite>MIT SMR</cite>和 BCG 的有关 AI 实施的宝贵资源。您可以通过访问<a href="https://mitsmr.com/AIforLeaders">mitsmr.com/AIforLeaders</a>来访问它。我们会将该链接放在演出笔记中，希望在那里见到您。</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/images-and-inspiration-with-ai-pinterests-jeremy-king/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>确定关键角色以提高绩效</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/identify-ritic-roles-to-improve-performance/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/identify-ritic-roles-to-improve-performance/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 11:00:54 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Boris Groysberg, Eric Lin, Abhijit Naik, and Sascha L.

class="attribution">布莱恩·斯托弗/theispot.com</p></figcaption></figure><p>领导者喜欢表现出他们重视员工。他们宣称团队中的每个人对于组织的成功都至关重要。尽管这种情绪令人振奋，但事实并非如此。只有优秀的人担任最关键的角色，人才才能成为竞争优势的源泉。让明星从事不重要的工作只是浪费人才。</p><p>战略执行中公认的智慧是，集中力量的集中应用——识别、开发和利用关键能力——是成功的必要条件。然而，除非这些能力转化为具体的角色，并建立适当的制度来确保高素质的员工担任这些职位，否则战略只是一个意图。不幸的是，太多的组织围绕他们当时拥有的人员和当前的技能来制定战略——而他们应该制定最有前途的战略，更好地了解执行战略时最关键的角色，然后配备人员这些角色拥有最优秀的人才。正如我们将演示的，将数据和分析应用于该问题可以帮助您准确确定需要将顶尖人才安置在哪里。</p><p></p><p>有两种方法可以确定哪些角色对关键结果影响最大：使用数据自下而上推断和自上而下推断。在上下文合适且数据可用的情况下，采用自下而上的方法可能会产生令人惊讶的答案。在这种情况下，领导者必须准备好让见解指导他们的决策。</p><h3>数据揭示差异制造者</h3><p>数据可以用来帮助弄清楚谁是你当前的明星，以及哪些职位对组织成果影响最大。在绩效是团队努力的情况下，它可以帮助识别隐藏的人才，并指出对成功可能比领导层意识到的更重要的角色。</p><p>以足球为例：关于场上哪些位置最有价值存在很多争论。前锋，包括前锋，是主要得分手——他们通过进球而成为众人瞩目的焦点，并获得最高的薪水。根据 2023 年<cite>《福布斯》</cite>报告，全球收入最高的 50 名运动员中包括 6 名足球运动员，而且他们都是前锋。</p><p>由于足球是一项低得分运动，因此每个进球都很重要，因此阻止对手进球同样重要。因此，有些人认为防守者是最有价值的球员。中后卫在配合反击中起着至关重要的作用，关键时刻停球失败会给对手创造很大的得分机会。中后卫比其他位置球员更频繁地担任球队队长也就不足为奇了。</p><p></p><p>当然，守门员是最后的防守者：他们在面对极端压力时的判断力和技巧可能决定胜败。还有一些人认为中场球员推动了比赛的节奏。正如控制棋盘的中心对于赢得国际象棋比赛至关重要一样，中场球员可以通过关闭对手的传球路线或通过从防守球员到进攻前锋的适时分配来发起进攻，从而放大每个人贡献的影响。最后，特级大师可能是教练，他对阵容、位置和总体策略做出决定。</p><p>为了确定每个角色的相对贡献，我们收集并分析了德国顶级足球联赛德甲联赛五年的数据，并评估了 2014 年至 2019 年间足球场上各个位置的重要性。</p><p>通过分析玩家在不同角色和团队之间转换时结果的变化，我们按位置隔离贡献，同时观察财富随着这种转换而上升和下降。建立了每个位置如何对结果做出贡献的模型，我们通过测量当我们依次从模型中省略每个角色时模型的获胜预测恶化的程度来加权位置的重要性。</p><p>我们的分析表明，后卫和守门员对于赢得比赛最为关键；它们在我们开发的两种不同型号中占据了前三名。前五名中始终存在四个位置：左后卫、右后卫、守门员和进攻型左中场。尽管防守球员可能不会得到那么多球迷的喜爱，但数据表明他们是获胜的最大因素。</p><p>无论行业如何，这种分析都有效。每个组织或职能部门都可能有自己未被充分重视的角色。虽然销售团队可能会获得该帐户，但服务部门可能会每年更新该帐户。</p><p>人才稀缺也很重要。比较后卫、中场和中后卫的左右位置，左侧的角色贡献不成比例地更多。为什么？虽然左脚足球运动员在这些角色上自然具有优势，但世界级左脚球员的数量比右脚球员要少得多。在杰出人才稀缺的关键职位上，让优秀的人才担任这些职位就显得尤为重要。</p><p>组织领导和结构也很重要。当纳入模型时，教练是第三重要的因素，仅次于后卫位置。团队组织、游戏系统和人员配置决定了关键角色的部署方式。在德甲联赛中，4-5-1阵型——四名后卫、五名中场和一名前锋——是最成功的阵型。它支持优先考虑防御阵地的战略，并且是战略与组织如何围绕关键角色配置自身之间一致性的一个很好的例子。</p><p></p><h3>使用数据来填补关键角色</h3><p>通过结合绩效和人力资源数据，可以将类似的分析方法应用于企业。对于拥有多单位结构（例如多个商店、配送中心或服务团队）的公司来说，好消息是您不需要足球联赛的数据 — 您可以自己完成此操作。具有共同角色的多单位组织提供了跨单位捕获数据并隔离差异角色的机会。</p><p>首先，收集按位置、角色和时间来识别员工的数据。其次，一定要了解影响结果但与人员配置无关的背景因素（例如，商店的表现可能因位置、年龄、业态或季节而异）。这使您可以将个人对结果的影响与环境因素分开。第三，收集本单位的绩效成果数据；最好获得多种类型的指标，因为结果是多维的。</p><p>在我们与一家全国性零售商的合作中，我们在五年内从数百家商店收集了此类数据。我们通过收入、利润、增长、员工流动率和破损率来衡量每月商店绩效。我们发现商店经理非常重要：21% 的收入业绩可归因于商店经理——比商店属性重要三倍多——而且他们对利润率有着巨大的影响。区域经理也产生了可衡量的效果，但他们的影响力不如商店经理。正如预期的那样，地区和区域经理的影响因指标而异。虽然商店经理对收入的影响最大，但利润率表现更受地区和区域经理的影响，他们对采购决策有重要影响。</p><p>就像足球一样，结构和系统很重要。我们的研究发现，距离总部较近的门店表现较好，这促使我们进一步探索如何支持较远的门店。从员工流动性中还可以获得宝贵的见解。当人们停留在自己的角色和位置时，不可能使用数据来区分人们与周围环境的影响。让人们经历不同的环境不仅让他们有机会发展和成长，还增强了数据，可以更精确地衡量角色和执行角色的人员的影响。</p><p></p><p>对于我们合作的零售商来说，这些见解改变了人才战略。最初，领导者们打算为地区和区域经理创建一个培训学院计划，因为他们认为职责范围更广的高层管理人员对绩效更重要。在考虑了我们的分析结果之后，他们转而探讨哪些行为和实践对于商店经理的关键角色至关重要。他们在全公司范围内发起了一项努力，以谷歌名为“氧气计划”的内部研究为模型，提取出对公司业绩产生积极影响的管理者的特质。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a>一旦他们确定了这一关键角色的细节，他们就能够集中投资来大规模开发和复制该工作的能力。</p><h3>人才洞察和可持续竞争优势</h3><p>奥克兰运动家队的比利·比恩利用数据以惊人的低成本组建了一支高绩效球队。作为总经理，他的策略是使用不同的表现指标来寻找被低估的球员，这些球员对赢得比赛的贡献比在传统衡量标准上表现良好的球员更多。这种方法的成功很快被整个联盟效仿，削弱了A队的战略优势。数据驱动的关键岗位人才决策带来的优势也会如此短暂吗？</p><p>有一个关键的区别需要注意。田径运动研究了识别优秀球员的措施——但这些球员在任何球队都可能表现出色。良好战略的标志是竞争优势的来源与其他战略承诺相互关联，因此难以复制。寻找关键角色并围绕这些角色建立一个组织可能比寻找隐藏的明星更具有防御性，因为战略优势与组织如何支持这些角色并开发填补这些角色的渠道息息相关。</p><p>德甲联赛不仅以其防守而闻名，还以其人才来源而闻名。它缺乏英超联赛等拥有亿万富翁老板的联赛的财务实力。然而，德国足球体系致力于培养年轻人才，而不是依赖高价转会成熟球星，这对于需要在球场上证明自己的年轻球员（包括来自德国以外的年轻球员）来说是一个有吸引力的选择。由于其他为高价转会付出高昂代价的联盟有义务让这些天才球员上场时间更长，因此他们削弱了对年轻新兴人才的价值主张。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink"

href="#ref3">3</a>围绕这些明星建立一个系统会使组织变得脆弱：他们变得过度依赖这些明星，并偏离了战略与人才部署相一致的目标。</p><p><strong>尽可能使用数据，并投资使其信息丰富。</strong>当您的组织中有多单位结构时，您可以利用它来系统地研究角色。许多公司都投资了衡量业务部门、产品、地区或商店绩效的系统。由于大多数组织没有明确地将组织绩效和人力资源信息联系起来，因此需要额外的投资才能将这些信息与人员数据联系起来。此外，通常选择将人员留在固定位置，而不是在不同的环境中轮换。但是，在人们的工作方式和地点上引入一些差异的做法可以让我们深入了解哪些角色可以推动绩效。这些见解可以突显无名英雄的贡献，并突显培训和招聘方面的投资可以在哪些方面带来最大的绩效收益。</p><p><strong>根据关键技能进行招聘和发展。</strong>如今，资历和血统在人才市场上的影响力太大；此外，它们还具有巩固关于角色中重要事项的常识的作用。正如领导者可能会被误导，不知道什么角色最重要一样，他们也可能会误入歧途，不知道这些角色中的哪些技能和行为会产生影响。通过识别关键角色中的关键能力，组织既可以奖励重要的事情，又可以制定招聘、留住和培养具有这些技能的员工的蓝图。</p><p><strong>调整系统和结构。</strong>担任关键角色的才华横溢的员工需要得到能够发挥其优势的系统和结构的支持。与德甲球队发现在场上定位中优先考虑防守角色可以增加成功几率类似，组织需要创造性地思考什么样的结构可以让那些从事关键工作的人释放出最好的工作。这些投资既可以让您的关键角色做出更多贡献，又可以让您的战略不易被复制。</p><p></p><p><strong>认识到领导力的关键作用。</strong>在足球队中，教练是赢得比赛的第三重要因素。领导者制定战略，然后建立并激励支持战略的团队。由于整个组织的协调非常重要，任何识别、投资和培养关键角色的有意义的步骤都需要来自高层的支持。当战略的改变需要培养历史上薄弱的关键角色的人才时，这一点尤其重要。 Leaders need to reinforce their commitment to supporting new key roles with their teams and with potential hires.</p><p></p><p> In soccer, winning can hinge on very small differences. While good teamwork is critical, the highly integrated nature of the sport obscures what the critical roles are. The thoughtful use of data can shed light on the critical roles within your team and uncover surprising results that challenge conventional wisdom.

But Gabriella Rosen Kellerman and Martin Seligman, coauthors of the book <cite>Tomorrowmind</cite> , have identified five skills that can help individuals flourish in dynamic work environments — even those that are especially pressure-filled.</p><p> During <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/series/work-23-the-big-shift/">Work/23</a> , an <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> symposium held in May 2023, Kellerman and Seligman explained that they use the acronym <em>PRISM</em> to refer to those five skills. It starts with <em>prospection</em> — the ability to imagine our options, plan for the future, and restore our agency — which Kellerman described as “the meta skill of our era.” The others are <em>resilience</em> , <em>innovation</em> , <em>social connection</em> , and <em>mattering</em> . All of them can be learned, the coauthors said, and leaders can help their employees do so.</p><p></p><p></p><p> Kellerman and Seligman&#39;s work builds on seminal research Seligman conducted with the US Army to understand which soldiers are most at risk of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder. He found that people with extreme pessimism — catastrophizers who believe that when bad events occur, everything will fall apart — are most vulnerable. His research also found that soldiers who demonstrate high positive emotion, low negative emotion, and high optimism on Day One are better positioned to withstand their environments and even go on to be awarded medals for heroism.</p><p> “I&#39;ve worked on resilience my entire 60 years in psychology,” Seligman said. “The people who were invulnerable, who are resilient, are the optimists.”</p><p> Resilience draws on self-awareness and self-compassion, they explained. “Emotional regulation is, in some ways, the foundational skill of maturing as an adult,” noted Kellerman. “It&#39;s our ability to recognize our emotions, to pause in response to them, to reappraise them, and then to choose a response.” That response, she added, ideally comes from a thoughtful, centered place rather than an emotionally reactive one.</p><p> Kellerman and Seligman weren&#39;t able to get to all of the questions from attendees during the Work/23 event, so Kellerman answers some of them below. (Questions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity.)</p><p></p><h6> Why is it that, in some cases, self-efficacy and confidence are seen as negative traits, irrespective of knowledge or skills?</h6><p> <em>Self-efficacy</em> is our belief in our own ability to act in the ways we need to in order to achieve our goals. We build self-efficacy by witnessing our own successes as we build mastery in specific domains. Many decades of studies have shown the positive relationship between self-efficacy and well-being and accomplishment.</p><p> In contrast, <em>self-esteem</em> — often defined as confidence in our own abilities — is a less robust construct and can be falsely inflated. It may or may not be related to actual accomplishments. As our colleague Roy Baumeister has demonstrated, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1529-1006.01431">self-esteem does not predict performance or well-being</a> .</p><p> People with high degrees of self-efficacy may not come across as confident to others, and people who do come across as confident may or may not have high degrees of self-efficacy. Confidence becomes a negative trait when it is false or narcissistic, but neither characteristic applies to self-efficacy.</p><h6> Are there studies correlating pessimism, PTSD, and suicide?</h6><p>是的。 Pessimism is a common feature of depression, and a significant risk factor for suicide. See, for example, “ <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257552463_An_Examination_of_OptimismPessimism_and_Suicide_Risk_in_Primary_Care_Patients_Does_Belief_in_a_Changeable_Future_Make_a_Difference">An Examination of Optimism/Pessimism and Suicide Risk in Primary Care Patients: Does Belief in a Changeable Future Make a Difference?</a> ”</p><p> <em>Catastrophization</em> , an extreme form of pessimism, is predictive of PTSD risk. Catastrophization has also been shown to have a causal relationship with PTSD severity; see “ <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32479704/">The Sequential Relation Between Changes in Catastrophizing and Changes in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Severity</a> .”</p><h6> What skill do you recommend that people choose first for growth?</h6><p> This will vary for every person. For those who are low on resilience, start there. Specifically, focus on the five following skills that drive resilience: emotional regulation, self-efficacy, cognitive agility, self-compassion, and optimism. Which of the five do you feel least comfortable with? Learn about it and look for ways to apply it in your day-to-day life.</p><p></p><p> Our book, <cite><a href="https://www.gabriellarosenkellerman.com/book">Tomorrowmind</a></cite> , includes exercises to build each of these in Chapter 4. For those who are already feeling resilient, pick another of the PRISM powers (prospection, resilience, innovation, social support, and mattering) to start with. [ <em>Editor&#39;s note: Kellerman and Seligman also explore the elements of PRISM in their recent</em> MIT SMR <em>article “<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/reimagining-hr-for-better-well-being-and-performance/">Reimagining HR for Better Well-Being and Performance</a></em> .”]</p><h6> How can companies train their employees on these skills?</h6><p> All of these skills can be taught and developed. The best forms of training are personalized and longitudinal and include a mix of learning and practice. Human experts, like mentors or coaches, are an ideal resource, where available.</p><p> You can start with large-group experiences, like presentations or workshops, but don&#39;t stop there. Teach these skills to managers, and teach the managers how to teach those skills to the people who report to them. Look for ways to integrate practices that build these skills into your culture. All of them require practice over time in order to be sustained.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/thriving-in-the-new-world-of-work/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Countering the Corporate Diversity Backlash</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/countering-the-corporate-diversity-backlash/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/countering-the-corporate-diversity-backlash/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 09 Aug 2023 11:00:33 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Victor Ray and Tsedale M.

Target, a company that has carried merchandise celebrating LGBTQ+ pride for over a decade, ordered some stores to remove such products after conservative activists accused the company of sexualizing children and organized a boycott. Anheuser-Busch lost sales in response to a promotion with trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney, costing Bud Light its spot as America&#39;s bestselling beer. Even Chick-fil-A, perhaps the prototype of corporate conservatism with its opposition to same-sex marriage and policy of closing on Sundays, recently came under attack from conservatives for employing an executive to lead its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts.</p><p> Universities are also facing a diversity backlash. The US Supreme Court recently struck down race-conscious admissions programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Ending race-conscious admissions will likely have ripple effects, as an unclear regulatory environment might discourage organizations from implementing current diversity efforts while spurring some to explicitly exclude Black, Latine, and Indigenous groups.</p><p></p><p> These recent events show that resistance to civil rights progress for members of marginalized or underrepresented groups remains entrenched, and opponents of efforts to improve equity have been emboldened.</p><p> Diversity backlash puts companies in a difficult position. Bowing to pressure from anti-diversity groups may cost them the goodwill they have tried to cultivate among other consumers; Target&#39;s capitulation to conservative pressure earned it blowback from progressive activists. Backing down can also encourage conservative activists to push their demands further. While it might temporarily reduce the pressure on companies, giving in to anti-diversity forces could hurt them over the long term. Demographics are changing, with nonWhites making up an increasing portion of the coveted youth market, and legal protections for LGBTQ+ Americans have broad <a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/599240-support-for-lgbtq-rights-on-the-rise-poll/">support</a> . Rooting out discrimination and increasing access to opportunity is essential to ensuring a rich talent pipeline. And for many individual managers and employees, anti-discrimination is simply a moral imperative.</p><p> Diversity initiatives are vulnerable to attack because many have been tentative. One-off hours-long training sessions, unsupported new hires, or programs that wither as anti-racist protests recede fall far short of the transformative structural changes needed to make organizational outcomes truly equitable. Leaders who are sincerely committed to diversity must prepare for the cost of defending inclusive organizations and adopt policies that make it difficult to roll back diversity gains.</p><p></p><h3> A Tepid Embrace of Diversity</h3><p> When President Lyndon Johnson signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act, with Martin Luther King Jr. present, he was responding to decades of agitation for full economic inclusion. Under the act&#39;s Title VII, the commonplace racial discrimination foundational to American workplaces became illegal. Most organizations that adopted diversity policies did so because social movements forced their hand, not out of a high-minded commitment to equal opportunity.</p><p> Many organizations retroactively recognized that greater diversity helped <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/business-case-for-diversity-in-the-workplace/">them</a> exploit niche markets or foster innovation. But arguments that diversity can be good for the bottom line haven&#39;t led to a fundamental transformation of segregated and racially stratified American workplaces. And relying on a business case for diversity lets leaders withdraw support for these initiatives if economic gains don&#39;t materialize.</p><p> While civil rights laws drove real workplace changes, they were largely marginal. Despite early gains in Black and Latine employment, workplace desegregation essentially stopped in the <a href="https://www.russellsage.org/publications/documenting-desegregation">1980s</a> , and hiring discrimination against Black <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1706255114">men</a> has been relatively constant since. When hired, people of color were often designated to diversity positions cordoned off from the organization&#39;s core functions, limiting opportunities for their career growth and mobility. Enforcement of anti-discrimination laws varied greatly depending on the political winds, typically (but not exclusively) increasing under Democratic presidents and waning under Republicans. As sociologists Frank Dobbin and Alexandra <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-soc-090820-023615">Kalev</a> have found in their research, attempts to comply with an uncertain regulatory environment led companies to adopt diversity policies with dubious effectiveness. Human resources experts often introduced policies that courts countenanced as good-faith anti-discrimination efforts, despite the policies being ineffective and sometimes counterproductive.</p><p> Diversifying organizations rarely undermined the White norms and the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122418822335">power</a> that shaped them. Homogeneity remained the standard, diversity a deviation. Acknowledging the changes brought to workplaces by the Civil Rights Movement, Kimberlé Crenshaw and <a href="https://thenewpress.com/books/critical-race-theory">colleagues</a> nonetheless highlighted in their 1996 book <cite>Critical Race Theory</cite> the unequal ground on which diversity policies were seeded: “The very same Whites who administered explicit policies of segregation and racial domination kept their jobs as decision makers in employment offices of companies, admissions offices of schools, lending offices of banks, and so on.”</p><p> This history of organizations&#39; tepid embrace of diversity has left them unprepared to deal with the current backlash. Three short years after their collective response to massive protests over the police murder of George Floyd, companies are reneging on their diversity <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/host-of-companies-sued-alleging-unmet-diversity-equity-pledges">pledges</a> . Promises included increasing the representation of marginalized groups and women in senior-level positions and boards; addressing retention, promotion, and pay gaps; and working with senior leaders and managers on upskilling inclusive leadership behaviors. Companies added positions focused on DEI to demonstrate their intentions to tackle injustice, without transforming in ways that would support long-term organizational changes.</p><p></p><p> A slowing economy and, we suspect, a diversity backlash led companies to cut those new DEI positions at a faster <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/diversity-roles-disappear-three-years-george-floyd-protests-inspired-rcna72026">rate</a> than other jobs. Attacks on DEI have led some organizations to backtrack from their commitments to create initiatives centered on addressing organizational policies, practices, and cultures that target groups facing persistent inequities. Attempts to integrate substantive DEI programs also succumbed to the backlash, as evidenced by <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/coca-cola-scraps-diversity-requirements-for-outside-law-firms">Coca-Cola</a> abandoning its proposed DEI policy for outside law firms. Some activist shareholders have attacked companies&#39; DEI <a href="https://www.mvalaw.com/media/news/15112_WLT_McDowell.pdf">interventions</a> and also targeted the practice of DEI audits, which help mitigate workplace discrimination.</p><h3> Confront the Resistance</h3><p> Although we&#39;ve outlined a pessimistic story, diversity programs can succeed. Research <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/000312240607100404">shows</a> that diversity programs are effective when organizations dedicate specialized positions to manage and monitor equity goals and programs.</p><p> Accountability is <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/02/dei-initiatives-are-futile-without-accountability">key</a> to sustaining effective DEI policies and programs. While equity work should involve all employees, DEI professionals must be empowered to hold the leadership accountable. Organization leaders must take responsibility for designing, modeling, and implementing equity programs that reshape organizational policy. Research shows that strategic DEI initiatives, including establishing mentoring programs that incentivize employees to sponsor marginalized group members, demonstrating transparency in hiring and promotion processes, and holding employees accountable for diversity goals, can work.</p><p> The latest backlash against diversity should prepare organizational leaders for possible resistance to diversity initiatives from internal stakeholders and external anti-diversity activists. Making public statements in support of DEI can help establish accountability goals, but unfortunately, it seems that a growing number of leaders are choosing silence or capitulation in response to anti-diversity activists.</p><p> We see a similar phenomenon in how the right-wing rejection of climate science has led some leaders to downplay sustainability goals, a practice known as <em>greenhushing</em> . A recent <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0047287520930087">study</a> examining this dynamic in the hospitality industry found that consumers preferred when hotels communicated their corporate social responsibility efforts rather than engaging in greenhushing. Interestingly, the study found that such communications also prompted consumers to consider the ethics of their own choices. Similarly, we believe that openly discussing an organization&#39;s commitment to address systemic issues through accountability reduces resistance to initiatives that can change behaviors and attitudes and lead to progress.</p><p></p><p> Organizations should confront the diversity backlash, along with the empty nature of superficial diversity policies, head-on. With diversity training increasingly criticized and White fatigue derailing serious discussions of racism, racial inclusion in organizations faces an existential threat. Resisting this diversity retreat requires organizational accountability to the broad array of commitments made in response to acknowledged racial injustices.</p><p> For organizations committed to embedding equity within their mission, values, culture, and practices, we recommend taking a strategic planning approach. Expectations for overnight results must be regulated by realistic goals that are results-oriented and measurable, with targeted dates for completion. This process must include a feedback loop design that allows for corrections in planning, implementing, and executing, thus providing managers with openings to check for impact and progress. Recent events give organizations an opportunity to reaffirm and strengthen their commitments to working toward creating an equitable organization by stamping out inequality.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/countering-the-corporate-diversity-backlash/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> How Outlawing Collegiate Affirmative Action Will Impact Corporate America</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-outlawing-collegiate-affirmative-action-will-impact-corporate-america/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-outlawing-collegiate-affirmative-action-will-impact-corporate-america/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 11:00:59 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Derek R.

This was a momentous decision that stands to have widespread societal and organizational implications. Although the scope of the ruling was limited to college admissions, we can draw upon existing data to forecast the impact on corporate America. The evidence clearly points to two key outcomes: First, collegiate patterns of racioethnic diversity will change fairly dramatically; and second, these changes will have considerable downstream consequences for workplace composition as well as patterns of racioethnic inequity across a host of other measures.</p><p> As tempting as it might be to view those conclusions as hyperbolic, research on three decades of state-level affirmative action bans strongly suggests otherwise. In fact, eradicating affirmative action has led to reductions in the proportions of underrepresented (Black and Hispanic) students in undergraduate and graduate programs, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and math; it has also led to fewer underrepresented students enrolled in and graduating from medical and law schools. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> These effects tend to be lasting — and, importantly, implementing alternative policies that don&#39;t explicitly consider race and ethnicity has done little to counter them. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a></p><p></p><p> Extending these state-level findings to the national level suggests that employers will have less racioethnically diverse college-educated talent to draw upon when filling their vacancies, particularly from premier institutions. Alternatively, the Black and Hispanic candidates within their applicant pools are less likely to be selected because they will be less credentialed as a result of having fewer degrees or having graduated from lower-ranked colleges, where they are more likely to apply and be accepted post-affirmative action. A somewhat less-intuitive consequence is that the White (and Asian) graduates of more prestigious colleges and universities will have had less exposure to people of other racioethnic backgrounds. This has implications for their multicultural competence — the ability to relate to those dissimilar from oneself — and may help account for why employers tend to pay higher starting salaries to graduates of more racioethnically diverse business schools and universities. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p> The fallout within Black and Hispanic communities stands to be devastating. Most notably, there will be fewer minority professionals to help meet the needs of racioethnically similar minority clientele. Though this might seem to be more a matter of convenience, it is especially troubling in fields like medicine or law (which employs attorneys and members of law enforcement), where minority underrepresentation is often noted as a contributing factor to well-documented racioethnic health care and criminal justice disparities. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p> Lower odds of graduating from a more prestigious school or graduating at all also have implications for racioethnic inequality within organizations. This begins with underrepresented minorities being less apt to obtain a job or more likely to land a lower-quality one. It goes on to influence outcomes spanning the entire human resources management landscape, from entry to exit, because initial placements have lasting consequences for things like compensation, promotions, training/development, retention/separation, and deployment. For instance, even Black and Hispanic professionals who gain access to employment opportunities may be more likely to find themselves facing the “last hired, first fired” phenomenon. Moreover, a low starting salary can affect the size of raises or competitive offers from other companies and has deleterious compounding effects on one&#39;s retirement savings.</p><p></p><p> Those seeking even more concrete evidence that outlawing collegiate affirmative action can influence diversity in corporate America need look no further than recent research by Harvard Business School professor Letian Zhang. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> He examined affirmative action bans&#39; effect on whether people from different racial backgrounds became managers, using data from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on more than 11,000 private-sector US businesses from 1985 to 2015. He anticipated that executives might interpret bans as a sort of license to discriminate and, therefore, be less likely to hire Black managers or promote Black candidates. The results showed that “after a state adopts the affirmative action ban, growth in the proportion of Black managers in establishments with corporate headquarters in that state slows down by more than 50% and this slowdown is mostly concentrated in firms with politically conservative CEOs.”</p><p> By widening the collegiate achievement gap, the ban on affirmative action in colleges actually kicks the proverbial can of equal opportunity further down the road by adding larger higher education differentials to existing racial differences in wealth and access to quality preschool and K-12 education that also disfavor underrepresented minorities. Ironically, this further enhances the need for workplace affirmative action strategies just to maintain the racial status quo. That said, any such efforts will almost certainly be challenged along legal grounds, and the Supreme Court (at least as currently constituted) has shown itself highly unlikely to view such efforts favorably.</p><p></p><p> In fact, in a form of preemptive strike, 13 state attorneys general recently informed companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Uber that they should expect greater scrutiny of any policies perceived as promoting race-based preferences in employee selection. They went on to promise legal action against “violators,” signaling their intention to extend the parameters of the Supreme Court ruling to US workplaces. This raises the question, what can organizations that remain committed to racial equal employment opportunity do to limit any losses they might suffer in this new, evolving employment landscape? Below, I provide four suggestions to help practitioners, managers, and organizations navigate this challenge.</p><p></p><h3> Don&#39;t Wait on the Sidelines</h3><p> President Theodore Roosevelt is often credited with saying, “In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing.” In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling, it is probably tempting to maintain business as usual, wait and see how things proceed, and adopt a reactionary approach as the dust settles. Doing so, however, promises to have considerable consequences. Namely, continuing to source applicants from the same schools while making no adjustments based on the predictable changes to student-body compositions leaves an organization entirely dependent on college admissions staffs to retool their strategies to solve a problem that few have been able to address in the past 30 years.</p><p> Accordingly, continuing to use degrees and degree-granting institutions as proxies for human capital, as many organizations historically have, will likely result in race differentials widening across virtually all employment outcomes, with cascading effects for nonemployment outcomes. For instance, a recent study showed that underrepresented minority youth tend to increase their engagement in risky behaviors (smoking cigarettes, alcohol use, and binge drinking) immediately following an affirmative action ban. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a> In short, expect to have fewer underrepresented minority employees and greater racial inequity, including larger differentials in earnings and advancement.</p><h3> Question Everything</h3><p> Well, you might not have to question everything, but if an organization wants to get better at something, it will need to do some things differently and examine how they&#39;ve been done in the past. For instance, an HR executive once told me that it was company policy to recruit only from the country&#39;s top 10 engineering programs. An unintended consequence of this practice was that new recruits came from geographic regions that were quite dissimilar to the company&#39;s locale, and new-hire turnover was unusually high for its industry. There was no qualitative difference between the No. 10 program and the No. 12 program, which was located within 100 miles. Why not recruit from the No. 12 program to reduce the chance of a new employee experiencing extreme culture shock and leaving within the first year?</p><p> Applying this logic in the current context, companies might need to broaden their search parameters to attract applicant pools that are demographically consistent with those of their recent past. Recruiting at historically Black colleges and universities and Hispanic-serving institutions is a good way of engaging in targeted recruitment — a strategy that is presently legally permissible. Placing online advertisements in places frequented by underrepresented minorities conveys that your organization is interested in receiving applications from members of these groups. Moreover, when it comes to selection and compensation, companies will need to reevaluate the implicit and explicit weights assigned to degree-granting institutions. The spoils of graduating from a premier institution are already distributed inconsistently, with larger benefits for White graduates than for Black degree holders. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> Why not make that benefit smaller for everyone and simultaneously open more employment opportunities to a larger group?</p><h3> Lean Into the Data</h3><p> To address the issues raised by questioning everything, organizations can turn to what their data reveals. For instance, though inertia and benchmarking against competitors may suggest that a job requires a college degree, does the data support that contention? Job requirements that are linked to racial differences, like degree attainment and earning degrees from highly prestigious schools, tend to have an adverse impact on underrepresented groups — a form of statistical discrimination. In the context of selection, adverse impact occurs when a particular decision-making tool advantages members of one racial group (or any other legally protected category) relative to members of another racial group. While such differences are not illegal if the difference is job relevant, data is needed to establish such relevance.</p><p> Requiring degrees, favoring graduates of elite schools, and using minimum GPA cutoffs can adversely impact underrepresented minorities when such requirements are not directly related to job performance. In the past several years, there&#39;s been more discussion of eliminating these types of requirements, not only to enhance racial justice but also to simply tap a larger pool of high-potential candidates in a tight job market. Although some may interpret this as a form of “lowering standards” to enhance diversity, it should be noted that standards unrelated to performance are unnecessary and potentially illegal and may result in employee overqualification, which can have negative implications for hires&#39; attitudes, well-being, and performance. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> Use your data (and that of relevant others) to determine job relevance and get rid of barriers that aren&#39;t boosting your bottom line.</p><h3> Select for Potential, and Train for Performance</h3><p> Though colleges invest considerable resources in preparing students for careers, there are inevitable shortfalls in the competency levels that graduates possess and employers desire. For instance, the National Association of Colleges and Employers indicates that employers are nearly unanimous in naming communication as the most important competency, and almost all students know this. Nevertheless, though 80% of students rate themselves extremely proficient at communication, only 47% of employers see students in this same light. The point is that more than half of employers see graduates as lacking the most important competency. Clearly, the 53% of employers that consider college graduates less than extremely proficient communicators are not leaving their vacancies unfilled. If they were, the unemployment rate for 2022 college graduates would not be 4%. Rather, many, if not most, employers recognize that they will need to invest in training to get new hires up to speed.</p><p></p><p> Identifying potential in a race-neutral yet valid way is certainly easier said than done. Generally speaking, the more closely the indicators used to select employees relate to what employees actually do, the better. This suggests that tools like high-fidelity simulations, work samples, and behaviorally anchored structured interviews may be particularly useful. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a> Selection approaches should also focus on identifying trainability to ensure that organizations are able to maximize returns on their training investments. This could entail giving top candidates an opportunity to demonstrate their trainability by actively learning a new job-relevant competency and subsequently demonstrating their proficiency.</p><p></p><p> Over the past half century, affirmative action and its progeny have helped transform the racioethnic landscape of American colleges, universities, and organizations. These programs have done so by providing opportunities to those who history suggests would otherwise have been unlikely (or at least considerably less likely) to receive them. The choice of word — <em>opportunity</em> — is both intentional and important, as many people often lose sight of the fact that these programs grant beneficiaries only the chance to show that they belong. Although the Supreme Court decision eliminated one means of helping to level the playing field, as Alexander Graham Bell once said, “When one door closes, another opens.” Though the path may seem somewhat less clear, innovative companies will create and maintain competitive advantages by finding, attracting, and selecting the most talented people from <em>all</em> racial and ethnic backgrounds.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-outlawing-collegiate-affirmative-action-will-impact-corporate-america/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Make Your Case for Communication Upskilling</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/make-your-case-for-communication-upskilling/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/make-your-case-for-communication-upskilling/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 11:00:21 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Nancy Duarte. <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nancyduarte/">Nancy Duarte</a> is CEO of <a href="https://www.duarte.com/">Duarte Inc.</a> , a communication company in the Silicon Valley.

It&#39;s hard to find a job posting that <em>doesn&#39;t</em> mention the communication skill set as a key requirement. And yet, when faced with the skills that candidates actually have and those that they&#39;re weak in, hiring managers find themselves making trade-offs, particularly to meet pressing technical needs: <em>This guy can code like there&#39;s no tomorrow, but his communication is a challenge. Let&#39;s get him in here fast. We&#39;ll coach him up. It can wait.</em></p><p> The thing is, communication skills <em>can&#39;t</em> wait. Executives in “people functions” like human resources and learning and development (L&amp;D) understand that communication and persuasion skills are critical in all areas of business — even software development and accounting. Those who design, manage, implement, and track employee development programs already know the business benefits of being adept at influencing colleagues and others in an organization.</p><p></p><p> So how do you also show the deep skeptics in your organization — for instance, data scientists who view the word <em>persuasion</em> with disdain, as a euphemism for <em>manipulation</em> — that a serious investment in communication skills is worth making?</p><p> You do it by making a solid case for the return on that investment. And you can take your cues from those folks in L&amp;D. They&#39;ve thought long and hard about ways to measure the ROI of their training programs and the best ways to communicate the benefits of those talents.</p><h3> A Measurement-Based Case for Better Soft Skills</h3><p> At a recent event for my company&#39;s customers, our executive vice president of customers led a panel discussion on the ways that large technical brands are building soft skills and what the ROI has been for them. Two L&amp;D executives shared what they&#39;ve discovered about conveying that value in their organizations: Catherine (Cat) Lang, who heads up product training and certification for customers and partners at ServiceNow, a digital workflow company based in Santa Clara, Calif.; and Noelle Anderson, the director of enablement at Snap, the parent company for visual messaging app Snapchat. Here are five key insights from their conversation.</p><h4> Collect examples of the ROI you&#39;ve seen from previous training.</h4><p> One way to start is to think back to previous learning efforts in your organization and see what dots you can connect for stakeholders. For instance, did an in-house workshop on presenting data precede a big win for your organization — like landing a lucrative project or winning a major client? Make that correlation explicit and point to others like it. You might already have more of an ROI track record for some of your soft skills training than you realize.</p><p></p><h4> Help identify the value of future training.</h4><p> When you&#39;re considering or developing future training, look for more direct ways to measure upskilling outcomes. At Snap, for instance, the enablement team has developed a pitch-coaching program in which salespeople, account managers, and creative strategists work together to develop pitches for existing clients. Participants receive lots of coaching and developmental feedback from seasoned communicators while formulating, framing, and practicing their pitches — a big incentive to sign up for the program. They also create real, measurable value by workshopping real pitch content.</p><p> The payoff — whether it&#39;s a renewed contract or the sale of a new product or service — is quantifiable. “What we&#39;ve done on the back end,” Anderson said, “is work with our CRM teams to create a check box in Salesforce to denote whether or not each presentation was part of our pitch program.” From there, the team can filter to see which pitches brought in revenue.</p><p> Although Anderson&#39;s group at Snap reports to the sales team rather than to corporate L&amp;D, they collaborate with L&amp;D as a “sister team” to identify and build soft skills needed on the sales side. That&#39;s an approach that can pay dividends in both directions: Teams throughout organizations can report back to L&amp;D with evidence of ROI in their areas, which supports further investment in companywide learning programs. For its part, the learning organization can share broader insights on what types of development drive employee satisfaction and retention. And L&amp;D can hone its skill-building programs in light of where teams are seeing the greatest impact on day-to-day performance and sales.</p><h4> Recognize qualitative impact — including better employee retention.</h4><p> Even with something like a pitch program in place, it&#39;s tough to tally up the costs of soft skills training in cold, hard dollars — especially when the training is conducted internally by HR staff members or informally by managers and colleagues. The benefits can be tricky to gauge, too, since much of the value in upskilling is indirect.</p><p> For instance, consider one of the pitch program&#39;s key benefits for employees: greater visibility with senior leadership. That pays off for both individuals and the organization, but not in a way that shows up immediately on the balance sheet. Anderson said that batches of pitches are developed and presented in rounds, and by the third round, the two groups with the best pitches get to present their ideas to the executive team for more feedback before sharing anything with clients.</p><p> Sure, these interactions with executives make the pitches themselves better. But think about the other benefits: They kick-start mentoring relationships, and they open up more development and growth opportunities and more doors to advancement — all of which can enhance the employee experience, motivation, and loyalty.</p><p> Can you quantify these results? Sometimes you can&#39;t, so you gauge value qualitatively. That can mean soliciting input from managers and team leaders on a training program&#39;s impact on employees&#39; behavior, effectiveness on the job, and approach to teamwork. Considering the qualitative impact from the employee&#39;s perspective is essential, too, because talent retention has major implications for ROI. For proof of why these intangibles matter, consider a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/03/09/majority-of-workers-who-quit-a-job-in-2021-cite-low-pay-no-opportunities-for-advancement-feeling-disrespected/">Pew Research Center 2022 survey</a> that found a tie between “no opportunities for advancement” and “pay was too low” as the top reasons US workers cited for leaving their jobs. Or consider the findings of LinkedIn&#39;s March 2022 “ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220506202443/https://business.linkedin.com/glint/resources/employee-well-being-report-march-2022">Employee Well-Being Report</a> ,” which found the No. 1 driver of work culture to be “opportunities to learn and grow.”</p><p> Lang said that at ServiceNow, her team is “looking at employee retention and satisfaction with development” and tying those “very, very closely to our employee voice surveys as well” to get a holistic view of the effects of upskilling on retention. She said she saw “quick uptake as we started piloting new soft skills programs.” People have demonstrated keen interest in this type of upskilling at Snap, too: Anderson said employees view it as evidence that the company values them because it&#39;s “demonstrating [its] belief in an individual by investing in them and their development.” She also noted, “These are the types of skills that can help people internally get their own momentum, their own movement, and get their own thoughts put forth in a way in which folks will actually respond.”</p><h4> Strategize about which kinds of jobs to focus on first.</h4><p> Like any organizational change effort, upskilling a workforce requires strategic planning. To help such an initiative gain traction, it&#39;s useful to identify where you&#39;ll see the greatest immediate payoff and plan to concentrate there before you roll things out more broadly.</p><p></p><p> Lang&#39;s group at ServiceNow focuses first on people at the director and senior director levels because they have such a big say in how work gets done day to day and are responsible for keeping employees&#39; efforts aligned with organizational goals. The sooner they&#39;re communicating those goals clearly and framing performance objectives compellingly, the sooner the company will reap the rewards of hitting those targets. Attending to people at the director and senior director levels first also creates a cascade effect, equipping them to share what they&#39;re learning with their teams through one-on-one coaching, mentoring conversations, and even recommendations for courses or other learning content.</p><p> Snap, on the other hand, prefers to upskill front-line managers first, Anderson said. Because she oversees learning in a sales organization, where employees&#39; communication skills have an immediate impact on client relationships, the front line is where she sees the quickest return on investment.</p><h4> Address the time crunch head-on.</h4><p></p><p> Even if an organization&#39;s stakeholders agree that, in an ideal world, they should prioritize helping employees with soft skills, time constraints can make it tough. In the perennial battle between the important and the urgent, the urgent tends to win leaders&#39; attention and resources. Anderson described how what she calls “the here and now” sometimes gets in the way of broader learning goals at Snap: “There have been many classes where folks are like, &#39;I&#39;m so excited. I can&#39;t wait to go.&#39; And they show up, but then they have to drop out.” Work commitments and deadlines often tear people away.</p><p></p><p> One way to address that challenge culturally is by openly acknowledging it and showing how you can accommodate it in your learning schedule and course design. Create the expectation that it&#39;s more than OK for people to engage only as they&#39;re able. Think about dicing up the content into shorter modules or mini-workshops that busy employees can more easily digest. Set aside time in the workday for skill development. Learners need this type of support in the workplace, and the organization benefits too. If executives balk, remind them that making learning doable increases the ROI <em>and</em> shores up employee commitment to the organization in a tight labor market.</p><p> You might need to adjust project deadlines a bit or give people fewer tasks while they&#39;re doing development work so they don&#39;t feel pressure to do their “real” work after hours. Development <em>is</em> real work. Treat it that way as a manager — and discuss it that way with your stakeholders. It&#39;ll be an easier sell if you&#39;ve taken steps to help them see all of the benefits of the investment.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/make-your-case-for-communication-upskilling/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> CEOs Can Make (or Break) an Organization Redesign</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ceos-can-make-or-break-an-organization-redesign/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ceos-can-make-or-break-an-organization-redesign/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 02 Aug 2023 11:00:41 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Herman Vantrappen and Frederic Wirtz. <p><a href="https://akordeon.com/who-we-are/">Herman Vantrappen</a> is the managing director of Akordeon, a strategic advisory firm based in Brussels.

Some redesigns are major companywide overhauls, such as Procter &amp; Gamble&#39;s creation of six industry-based sector business units in 2019, which its CEO described as “the most significant organization change we&#39;ve made in the last 20 years.” <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> Other redesign efforts have a narrower scope, focusing on a particular division, function, or issue.</p><p> For a CEO, organization redesign is different from other large-scale change initiatives. In a corporate strategic reorientation, for instance, the CEO is bound by the decisions of the board of directors and follows a strongly analytical approach. In a functional initiative, such as setting the company&#39;s digital strategy, the CEO can delegate the lead to someone on the management team and assume a supervisory role. But in a corporate organization redesign initiative, the CEO must actively take the lead, both because of the profound impact that the resulting changes will have on the culture and employees and because only the CEO has the all-encompassing view required to reduce the risk of serious unintended and undesirable consequences from any particular redesign choice.</p><p></p><p> We have witnessed many redesign initiatives in our work with organizations over the years and have confirmed that the CEO&#39;s leadership of these efforts is key to their success. But we continue to be surprised by how many CEOs still struggle to get to effective outcomes. We&#39;ve found that plans frequently go astray or run into dead ends despite the abundant and often sensible advice in the management literature. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li> The new CEO of a business services provider wants to reconsider the role of the corporate center and the organization more broadly. Each member of the management team has their own pet idea for restructuring: One is under the spell of self-organizing teams, another is adamant about a framework used at their previous employer, and a third thinks the company should simply be a holding of small regional enterprises. It takes a long time to build even minimal alignment.</li><li> The CEO of a multilateral agency launches an exercise to make the organization less siloed. Heated debate and a couple of offsites with the management team lead to a number of major decisions, including plans for sharing resources and broadening the CEO&#39;s span of control. But after some backroom maneuvering, decisions are undone.</li><li> The founder-CEO of a family-owned engineering and construction company retires, handing over the reins to one of his children. The new leader has plans to professionalize the company&#39;s business processes and governance, but the retired founder keeps finding ways to short-circuit the CEO, undermining any effort to improve the company&#39;s functioning.</li></ul><p> When we looked back on the major organization redesigns we&#39;ve accompanied in the past 30 years (see “The Research”) and reflected on why some initiatives were less effective than others, we recognized that CEOs can fall into one of two traps: failing to use an appropriate framework, and, quite simply, failing to maintain sufficient leadership throughout the process. In this article, we&#39;ll present a systematic approach to organization redesign that CEOs can follow, and address specific behaviors that executives must guard against if they are to retain full ownership throughout the organization redesign and implementation processes.</p><h3> A Framework for Tackling Organization Redesign</h3><p> Many scholars and consultants have developed frameworks that support systematic thinking about organization design. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> The framework we are presenting here emphasizes two aspects that are often underexposed.</p><p> First, the framework recognizes that managers never start with a blank slate when redesigning their organization. There is always an existing organization in place that heavily informs any redesign. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> Even if the existing design has become dysfunctional, there are usually good reasons why it was adopted in the first place, and those reasons shouldn&#39;t be ignored. As a consequence, a good framework needs to incorporate a dynamic link between the past and the future.</p><p> Second, much of the current advice in the management literature focuses on either upstream aspects of an initiative (for instance, identifying the company&#39;s purpose, values, and vision) or downstream aspects (such as execution and change management). Less is said about the midstream core of the discipline — that is, the hard stuff, such as structure, processes, and systems. A good framework should rehabilitate this essential midstream part while integrating it seamlessly with the upstream part (by considering the drivers of change) and the downstream part (by ensuring readiness for the go-live on Day One).</p><p> The framework that we have gradually developed through our work aims to overcome those two shortcomings by respecting the dynamic nature of change and focusing on the hard organization design variables. Starting from the first principle, it brings together the building blocks of organization design thinking into a logical flow, from understanding an organization&#39;s <em>drivers of change</em> to the options for <em>concept design</em> , the operationalization in <em>detail design</em> , the implementation at the <em>transition</em> stage, and the course corrections necessary during the reorganization&#39;s actual <em>performance</em> . (See “The Organization Redesign Guide.”) </p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand-column callout-highlight--transparent"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> The Organization Redesign Guide</h4><p class="caption"> This framework integrates familiar building blocks into a logical process flow to steer reorganization initiatives. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MAG_Vantrappen_Fig1.jpg" alt="The Organization Redesign Guide"></p><p class="attribution"> Source: Herman Vantrappen and Frederic Wirtz</p></article></aside></div><p> CEOs at the front end of an organization redesign need to be aware of five overarching principles that stand out in this framework:</p><p> <strong>1. Organization is a means to an end.</strong> Managers change an organization design with the expectation that the new design will better enable the company to achieve its business goals. That expectation is based on the assumption that those goals will be made explicit, embraced by the management team, endorsed by stakeholders, and remain reasonably stable. A company whose goals are vague or fluctuating is likely to cycle through disruptive organizational rearrangements without much improvement in its performance. That&#39;s why our design framework starts with identifying both the external and internal drivers of change.</p><p> <strong>2. The best possible design is unknowable.</strong> Making organization design choices is arguably more difficult than making business strategy choices. A strategy choice comes down to selecting the one of various alternatives that maximizes the defined objective — say, EBITDA growth. With strategy, leaders weigh the available information, the assumptions and uncertainties, resource constraints, and their own appetite for risk. Not so for organizational choices. They do not flow from a mathematical optimization but from a judgment about the weight of the arguments in favor of and against each of a number of design alternatives. That is why the design framework encourages CEOs to consider alternative organizational concepts.</p><p> <strong>3. Concept design precedes detail design — and only the latter is participative.</strong> At the concept stage, the principles for the new design are defined. Those involve fundamental organizational variables, in particular the architecture (for example, what to centralize and what to decentralize). <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a> After considering alternative design concepts, one is selected and taken forward for detail design (for example, the roles of various functions in an end-to-end business process). The detail design can and should be done with the broad involvement of the managers and people directly concerned: They know best what works, will have to operate within the design outcome, and can act as change ambassadors. However, such a participative approach is rarely advised for concept design, which tends to require familiarity with the company&#39;s (often still confidential) vision and strategic options, freedom from conflicts of interest concerning the fate of various company functions, and speed.</p><p> <strong>4. An organization design evolves through a pattern of deliberate leaps and emergent hops.</strong> The notions of deliberate and emergent strategy are well entrenched in the discipline of strategy formulation: Guided by the company&#39;s deliberate strategy, managers at all levels in the organization make myriad decisions every day that gradually alter the exact form of that strategy. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> A similar pattern is observed in organization design: Senior management deliberately decides on a major rearrangement (leap) of the organization, after which a series of adjustments (hops) are made to compensate for the inevitable imperfections of the original design. This leap-and-hops pattern is totally normal and even desirable, since the perfect design is elusive and a company&#39;s environment changes all the time. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a> That is why the design framework shows loops that feed imperfections back into the design so that they can be addressed.</p><p> <strong>5. The proof of the design is revealed only after Day One.</strong> Day One refers to the moment at which the approved detail design goes live and the redesign starts to have a direct impact on the daily functioning of a large number of people: what they do, how they do it, and with whom. As little as possible should go wrong, for the sake of managerial credibility, respect for people, and impact on the business. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> That is why it is crucial to start a careful change management process well ahead of Day One. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a> No employee should be left in the dark about their place in the redesigned organization.</p><p></p><h3> Why the CEO&#39;s Continuous Engagement Matters</h3><p> In strategy formulation exercises, it may be perfectly adequate for the CEO to stay involved through ad hoc interventions spaced over time, such as participating in an executive offsite, leading the steering committee, or presenting to the board of directors. In organization design exercises, on the other hand, we find that the most effective CEOs keep their finger on the pulse of the process on an almost daily basis, from start to finish.</p><p> One reason they do this is that it provides them the opportunity to form their own ideas about a fit-for-purpose design and to possibly shift their mental model quite radically. They take their time to allow their thinking to mature, as there is no single best design and the eventual choice is a largely qualitative judgment about a number of valid alternatives.</p><p> They also consistently engage because they realize that the organization design process is quite unforgiving. Each phase builds on the choices made in the previous phase, gradually involving more and more people. The number of explicit or implicit micro-commitments made along the way — about roles, borders, lines, people, head count, and other factors — keeps growing. Having to backtrack is painful, in part because it is widely visible. If strategy formulation is like planting trees, organization design is like sowing grass: Its effect is immediate, all over the place, and in need of attention.</p><p></p><p> A third reason for daily engagement is to help build buy-in for the new design within the organization. Effective CEOs insist on participating fully in communications about the outcomes of the design exercise, not so much through the proverbial “memo to all staff” as by talking with people in the field. They can only do so credibly and convincingly if they have immersed themselves in the actual design work.</p><p> Most importantly, CEOs involve themselves in the process daily because they recognize that people and interactions will eventually make (or break) the organization. Fully participating in the design process gives CEOs a unique opportunity to observe and influence the people side of the business beyond their direct reports.</p><h3> How Leadership Weakness Can Derail Redesign</h3><p> In situations where we&#39;ve observed a leader&#39;s inability to remain fully in control of the redesign process as laid out above, their weaknesses have tended to reflect one of four characteristics: half-heartedness, appeasement, indecisiveness, or incapacitation. We&#39;ve distilled the following four archetypes from our observations of organization redesign efforts that have faltered:</p><p> <strong>The half-hearted CEO.</strong> Whereas the trigger of a strategy formulation exercise tends to be clear, an organization design exercise may be prompted by lobbying by certain stakeholders rather than a clear business need. In some cases, a member of the management team or the board of directors may raise a concern. The CEO might not initially find that concern important or be inclined to initiate change, but they might want to satisfy that stakeholder to end the debate and thus agree to consider organization redesign — with the private thought that the plans will go nowhere. Or the CEO may be confused, unclear, or cagey about the motivation for a redesign, leaving it to the project team to fill in the blanks. In still other cases, the CEO might be on their way out, voluntarily or involuntarily. In all of those situations, the CEO lacks a full-throated commitment at the inception of the project, getting it off to a bad start.</p><p> <strong>The appeasing CEO.</strong> Every transformation requires careful change management, with deliberate activities to move the company from its present state to the desired future state and help people adopt the changes. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a> However, CEOs can go overboard when it comes to inviting people&#39;s involvement, which can result in an excessively complex process with too many steps, participants, and approval points. For example, inviting more comments instead of deciding and freezing the process can drag out the design phase. Appeasing behavior aimed at demonstrating a willingness to listen is often well intentioned and meant to function as stakeholder management — but it can also reflect the CEO&#39;s own uncertainty about the design concept.</p><p> <strong>The indecisive CEO.</strong> The decision-inept CEO who fails to make decisions or stick to firm decisions is rare but not extinct. A typical symptom is the CEO giving in to a late-stage “over my dead body” threat by a manager who disagrees with a well-thought-out executive team decision. CEOs will sometimes compromise in the final stretch out of a fear of negative fallout. In such organizations, things happen in spite of the CEO.</p><p> <strong>The incapacitated CEO.</strong> Defective governance can make it hard for the CEO to keep a grip on the redesign throughout the entire process. In companies where the CEO is not also the chair of the board of directors, the board might interfere with the CEO&#39;s handling of the organization redesign. In privately owned companies, powerful board members such as retired founders can meddle in the design and short-circuit the CEO, protecting old favorites or otherwise disrupting an orderly process. Such impairing of the CEO — whether during the concept design, detail design, or transition phase — is often visible at lower levels and highly damaging.</p><p> CEOs planning an organization redesign would be well advised to consider these patterns of weak leadership. They should assess their own vulnerability in terms of both their own traits and the contextual factors that hamstring their leadership, and then consider how to overcome them.</p><p> They can begin by asking themselves four questions:</p><ol><li> Do I fully believe in this initiative?</li><li> Will I listen to the right people without letting the process go off track?</li><li> Am I prepared to make tough decisions where needed and stick to them?</li><li> Am I in control of all the levers I will need to pull?</li></ol><p> Such soul-searching is important because once CEOs understand where their leadership of this critical change effort may be weak, they can work to mitigate those weaknesses. (See “How CEOs Can Diminish Their Vulnerability.”) Imagine a CEO who knows they tend to be appeasing. They might recognize that during the concept phase, they should consult with a restricted group of senior managers, and during the transition phase, they should adopt a kind of comply-or-explain process (when any deviation from the concept design must be explained and can only be accepted after approval by the governance body that had approved the concept) and freeze the design, reassuring employees that the company will make course corrections after launch as needed. </p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand-column callout-highlight--transparent"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> How CEOs Can Diminish Their Vulnerability</h4><p class="caption"> CEOs who tend toward any of the four behavioral archetypes that can undermine organization redesign can take action at each stage of the process to strengthen their leadership. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MAG_Vantrappen_Fig2.png" alt="How CEOs Can Diminish Their Vulnerability"></p><p class="attribution"> Source: Herman Vantrappen and Frederic Wirtz</p></article></aside></div><p> We worked with the CEO of an industrial company who acknowledged that he had some elements of the incapacitated and indecisive archetypes. He was able to compensate for the tendencies that might have otherwise derailed the process, in a few smart, specific ways:</p><ul><li> Because the CEO traveled almost constantly, he appointed a chief change officer with complementary skills who worked closely with him and took care of day-to-day project matters at the head office. However, the CEO remained in charge of the effort.</li><li> The CEO proposed having the company&#39;s nomination and compensation committee act as a steering committee during the concept design phase. This provided a managed channel to the board chair, whose frequent intervention in operational matters sometimes undermined the CEO.</li><li> After the results of the concept design phase were formally endorsed by the nomination and compensation committee and approved by the board, the CEO was able to more easily implement the comply-or-explain rule during the detail design phase. To avoid concept creep, any deviation from the concept would have to pass through the committee again.</li><li> The CEO encouraged the company&#39;s divisions and functions to each appoint an ambassador for the transition phase. These representatives were on the management team of their respective divisions and functions and had participated in the detail design phase. They met with the chief change officer monthly to share progress information in both directions.</li><li> A simple tracker was used to monitor progress toward a range of specific transition targets in advance of the go-live. The percentage-of-completion statistics were regularly reviewed by the CEO and openly published based on division and function. This generated some healthy peer pressure and helped the process maintain traction.</li></ul><p></p><p> The example demonstrates that it pays for CEOs to do some upfront, explicit, and honest introspection about their visible behavioral tendencies and the actions that can prevent the redesign exercise from derailing.</p><p></p><p> Continual organization redesign is a fact of corporate life. In most cases, there are good business reasons to consider a redesign, despite the significant extra time, resources, and emotional energy it tends to consume. But the CEO&#39;s full-on engagement is needed to make the redesign succeed. Even then, however, redesign exercises often go astray. CEOs may lack an appropriate design framework or simply fail to maintain sufficient leadership throughout the process. They should start with an assessment of their vulnerabilities — both their own behavioral tendencies and governance-related constraints. And they should find ways to demonstrate that they are full-hearted, conclusive, decisive, and, ultimately, in control.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ceos-can-make-or-break-an-organization-redesign/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Learning From and With AI: Duolingo&#39;s Zan Gilani</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/learning-from-and-with-ai-duolingos-zan-gilani/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/learning-from-and-with-ai-duolingos-zan-gilani/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 01 Aug 2023 11:00:27 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Sam Ransbotham and Shervin Khodabandeh. <p>Sam Ransbotham ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ransbotham">@ransbotham</a> ) 是波士顿学院卡罗尔管理学院信息系统系教授，也是<cite>《麻省理工学院斯隆管理评论</cite>》人工智能和商业战略大创意计划的客座编辑。 Shervin Khodabandeh 是 BCG 的高级合伙人兼董事总经理，也是北美 BCG GAMMA（BCG 人工智能业务）的联合领导者。您可以通过<a href="mailto:shervin@bcg.com">shervin@bcg.com</a>联系他。</p><p class="mt20"> <cite>《我、我自己和人工智能》</cite>是<cite>麻省理工学院斯隆管理评论</cite>和波士顿咨询集团合作推出的播客，由 Sam Ransbotham 和 Shervin Khodabandeh 主持。我们的工程师是 David Lishansky，协调制作人是 Allison Ryder 和 Sophie Rüdinger。</p> ]]>; </dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Cognitive Technologies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Gamification]]></category><category><![CDATA[Generative AI]]></category><category><![CDATA[Product Strategy]]></category><category><![CDATA[AI & Machine Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Customers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Data, AI, & Machine Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[New Product Development]]></category><category><![CDATA[Skills & Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy]]></category><description><![CDATA[When Zan Gilani came to the U.S. from Pakistan to complete his undergraduate studies, he chose to study Chinese because it was rumored to be a difficult language.

I&#39;m personally pretty excited about today&#39;s episode because Duolingo is in a really interesting position. In a lot of our show, we end up talking about how organizations are using AI to augment or to improve human decision-making, and that&#39;s great. But Duolingo goes further and focuses on how humans are learning with AI — personalized education at scale, which is something that appeals to me. Anyway, that&#39;s enough from me. Let&#39;s hear it from Zan. Zan, thanks for joining us.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Thank you. It&#39;s a pleasure to be here.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Zan, first, can you give us an overview of Duolingo and the company, and what your role is?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Absolutely. Duolingo is basically an app that teaches languages. We teach 40-plus languages right now. Most of those people, by the way, are learning English, and most of our learners are also learning on mobile phones, so Android and iOS devices. And we are the most-downloaded and the most-used educational app there is, languages and otherwise. We have around 16 million DAU, or daily active users, and 40-plus million monthly active users as well. And I&#39;ve been at the company just coming around to eight years, where I am a principal product manager for the Experimental AI team.</p><p> My primary role is leading this team that is working to teach more effectively using generative AI, and also, more broadly, I help set the company up for success when it comes to generative AI.</p><p> One of the main use cases we have now specifically for generative AI is a new subscription tier. Duolingo is a freemium product. The mission is to provide the highest-quality education possible [and] make it accessible to as many people [as possible]; all you need is an internet connection. So we have this free version of the app, which is what most people are on. That&#39;s really good; most people at the company spend time on that. And then we have subscription tiers.</p><p> And we recently just launched a new AI-powered subscription tier called Duolingo Max, and I&#39;m happy to go into the features [of that] as well.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> So Experimental AI … it&#39;s sort of like your R&amp;D lab, if you will?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Well, I&#39;d say actually more than half of the company is working on R&amp;D broadly — kind of all of the people who work on product, and [among] the folks who work on learning or teaching effectively, you could think of it as a lab, yes.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Great. Maybe, for our audience, you could list the variety of use cases or places that AI is being used. I mean, of course, [aside] from the obvious one — personalization and gamification — that a lot of the apps have. But just tell us how AI is being used.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Duolingo has been using AI for as long as the app has been around, which is coming up to a decade. In fact, it was founded by a computer science professor, Luis von Ahn at Carnegie Mellon University, and his graduate student at the time, Severin Hacker. Right now, it&#39;s used in a number of different ways. On the growth side, for example, a lot of work goes into optimizing notifications.</p><p> The thing about Duolingo that makes it different from other apps is that it really tries to help you stay motivated. For us, pedagogically, we think that the hardest thing about learning a language is actually staying motivated, because remember: This is something tough to do. It&#39;s especially tough to do by yourself, on a phone — that&#39;s really a tough thing. So notifications and the timing of when you get them, the messaging that it has, really does affect someone&#39;s ability to stick with it in the long term. So we put a lot of effort into machine learning for notifications.</p><p> We also use it on the content-generation side, so we are trying to create useful, appropriate content; we use it there as well. And then, in a separate arm of the company, which is the Duolingo English Test, which is basically an English proficiency test that students have to take when going to university — kind of a competitor to the TOEFL or TOEIC or IELTS; most Americans haven&#39;t had to experience this — we use it for detecting cheating. We use it for generating content in a bunch of different places as well.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That&#39;s fascinating. And on the actual core of the app, which is teaching you language, how dynamic is that? How personalized is it when it adjusts to a person&#39;s way of learning?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Personalization plays a role, but a lot of the experience is curated by learning scientists, by educational content developers. For most people, the order in which you want to learn things is going to be roughly similar. For example, everyone learns the present tense before you then go on into other complicated tenses. But where we do use AI for personalization specifically is for something called Birdbrain, and this is basically a system we have that is optimizing for the difficulty of questions that you are going to see in practice sessions.</p><p> And one thing to note over here about Duolingo is that it&#39;s completely interactive. It&#39;s meant to feel like a game. So every time you&#39;re learning, you&#39;re kind of answering a mini exercise, and then you get it right or wrong. You always get feedback. So the point of Birdbrain is to try to come up with a Goldilocks level of difficulty, because basically, if something is too hard, it&#39;s frustrating and you lose motivation. If something&#39;s too easy, it&#39;s boring and you lose motivation. Birdbrain is one of those things that we use for personalizing practice in particular.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Shervin, one thing I think that&#39;s funny about that is that, in describing his product, we just took for granted the speech synthesis, speech recognition. These were avant-garde things 10 years ago, and now, Zan, you didn&#39;t even bother to mention those as applications of AI. I think that&#39;s sort of stepping back [and] seeing what now is normal.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That&#39;s right. And I think one thing you have that&#39;s quite interesting and maybe unique is just the number of feedback loops you must have. I mean, usually, in a lot of other applications, when you think about corporations and retail and banks and telecom, etc., it takes some time to get feedback. And you&#39;re almost getting instantaneous feedback on so many experiments or mini experiments from so many people. Maybe tell us a little bit more about just the speed of learning and the speed of adaptation of your algorithms.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> There&#39;s a nice bit of mirroring over here, which is that there are principles for learning effectively that we try to impart into the product itself. And then, as a company and as an organization, we are trying to operate on those principles as well. Getting fast feedback really matters when you&#39;re learning a language. But it also matters when you are working on the product itself, and, from a very early time, we basically built out our own A/B testing infrastructure, and it&#39;s pretty core to the product process; that&#39;s the central component of how we do product at Duolingo.</p><p> At any given moment in time, you have hundreds of experiments being run on things that are very granular — the positioning of buttons [indicating] the pricing on the page for the price of our subscriptions, your classic bread-and-butter experiments — to also huge new features, new tabs. Basically, if it&#39;s not a bug, it&#39;s probably the case that we&#39;re running this in the form of an experiment. We&#39;ve gotten very, very good and very, very sophisticated at doing this.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Shervin&#39;s going to roll his eyes because I&#39;m going to go academic for a minute, but you&#39;re a classic case of experiential learning. And actually, I&#39;m going to give you a little bit of segue to talk about your <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/">Max product</a> here, because I think there are two pretty exciting parts of that. There&#39;s Roleplay, which is getting to the academic, concrete experience part of experiential learning, and then this Explain My Answer, which is a reflective observation and critique. So tell us a little bit about both of those and how those are tied to learning outcomes.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Definitely. I think it&#39;s useful to talk about where we were before adding those two features. Pedagogically, Duolingo has always been about implicit learning, so learning without telling you explicitly, “This is what you&#39;re going to learn, and this is how it works.” And that is the DNA of the experience, because we think it&#39;s just more automatic when you do it that way. People also get really demotivated and put off by complicated grammar tables, etc. And then, the second is that you&#39;re learning on an app, and you&#39;re doing this interactive thing — these almost gamelike exercises.</p><p> The two things that have been missing or limited is that, one, some people do actually want explanations, and that can be really efficient and effective when done in the right amount and in the right way. So Explain My Answer is a solution to that problem, and the nice thing about Explain My Answer that really only works thanks to modern large language models is that the large language models are really good at providing jargon-free, concise explanations of the mistakes you make. It&#39;s really tough, even for teachers, to try to do that without using jargon and also without being right on the money. And so we are able to do that with Explain My Answer pretty well. It can give you follow-up illustrations, it can give you examples — all of these things that make large language models, by the way, just good for anyone trying to learn anything by themselves. For me, it&#39;s life-changing.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Or anyone trying to give a speech.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Or anyone trying to give a speech, yes. And then the second one, Roleplay, is that, ultimately, for most people, language learning is not an academic exercise. They&#39;re trying to use it as a skill in the real world, and that&#39;s a skill in and of itself. So how do you give people the ability to practice that? How do you get them to simulate this? Chatbots are exactly one way to do so, because now, what you have is something that can speak to you at the level of difficulty that you&#39;re at, has infinite patience, and can then actually give you feedback afterward as well.</p><p> Even if people had access to native speakers, which they don&#39;t generally, you&#39;d still need a native speaker who has infinite patience and who really, really can understand what you&#39;re looking for. So Roleplay is basically trying to provide that experience in the app, rather than just having a text interface like ChatGPT and just having you speak back and forth. Basically, what we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve broken down conversations or scenarios into these bite-size experiences, where you&#39;re talking to a chatbot who&#39;s going to be a barista or a friend that you&#39;re borrowing something from, and then you try to go through a very specific, short experience.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Sam, I have a question for you because, Sam, as you know, is a distinguished professor, and he&#39;s been teaching people — including people that are not in his class, like me — a lot of things. So my question, Sam, is … in all seriousness, though, what makes a good teacher, in your opinion?</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Actually, Zan hit on a couple things right there, and that&#39;s part of why I was feeling somewhat convicted in his conversation. This infinite patience that he talks about — that&#39;s really important, and it&#39;s also really hard.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Impractical.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Yeah. And meeting people where they are is a fundamental problem that we have in education. I mean, I sit in front of a room with 35, 40 people, and they are not homogeneous. And meeting people where they are is exactly what Zan was talking about. So, yeah, you have to know the material well, you have to keep people engaged, but you also have to keep track of where people are and what they know — present stuff that&#39;s not too easy and not too hard — and I&#39;m very attracted to this model.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> So, what&#39;s next?</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Well, yeah, that&#39;s exactly where I was going. What&#39;s next? I mean, if we can do this with language, what else can we do this with? Where does it work?</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> I meant just for language. So meeting people where they are, having very good knowledge of the student and their progress, and then being able to do role-playing and lots of experiential learning, and being able to explain and guide in a more jargon-free way and in a way that you could repeat it and I don&#39;t have to rush to take notes. I mean, all of these things, right? What is missing? I&#39;m hearing this and this is better than a regular teacher, it sounds like. But in your view, what is missing for this to be a perfect teacher — in Zan&#39;s view?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> I think we are still a very, very, very long way away from being the perfect teacher, for a number of reasons. I&#39;d also say, we don&#39;t believe, and I certainly don&#39;t believe, that at the end of the day, all you need is a chat interface and most people will be able to get really far with whatever they&#39;re trying to learn. So, to answer the first part about why we&#39;re far away from a teacher, well, some of this, I think, is unknown, but there is a real impact to developing a relationship with another human being when you&#39;re learning.</p><p> There is an emotional part of learning something new, and there is a human connection that can be as simple as the fact that you show up for your tutoring appointments because you don&#39;t want to let your teacher down, to also the fact that that tutor can be really engaging with their facial expressions, with the cadence of their voice, with the illustrations that they can tell, the way they can relate to maybe their own lives.</p><p> So that, we&#39;re still very far away from. And then, when it comes to just “Hey, why can&#39;t a chatbot teach you everything?” for most people, you still have to be organized, and being organized is quite exhausting. For example, just deciding what to eat next is often what you spend all your time doing, or deciding what movie to watch. And, similarly, deciding what to learn next is tough. So someone on the product side has to figure out the right sequencing of things for you to learn.</p><p> Similarly, being creative is exhausting as well. For a real-life tutor, it would be really difficult for them to put on a lot of different personas and do a lot of role-playing. Then you&#39;d need a tutor who is also an amazing actor. And AI gives you the ability to do that with a virtual teacher, but even then, we don&#39;t want a learner to have to come up with these scenarios all the time themselves.</p><p> The last two things I&#39;ll mention is that learning is also multisensory. It&#39;s also contextual. What you&#39;d want, ideally, is some kind of learning and context happening as well instead of just with a chatbot.</p><p> And the last thing to mention is, people really do need a sense of progression in order to stay bought into learning a language, because actual progress is so slow and so incremental, it&#39;s really hard to see. And so what you have to do is, you have to show people progress bars that are filling up, and you have to check in. I think there are probably ways that you could simulate that in a tutor experience, but those are some of the reasons why I think we care about building the experience outside of that as well and building a path that you go along, and all of these other things that go into making Duolingo what it is.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Zan, I want to come back to one thing you were talking about that I&#39;m pretty attracted to, [which] is this idea of figuring out what&#39;s the next thing that you need to learn. I mean, historically, every class that I had in languages, we had a book and we moved from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2. And somebody, somewhere, really thought through the sequence of that.</p><p> But at the same time, I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s necessarily optimal for all students. And we think about recommendation systems and Netflix, or in music; you know, we&#39;ve talked to Spotify, Shervin. This seems like a great opportunity here. What&#39;s the one thing that I could learn right now that would make the most difference? Or what&#39;s the one thing that I don&#39;t know that&#39;s keeping me from opening up this next section? That seems like a huge opportunity.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Yeah. And I would break that into two pieces as well. One of them is just, generally, what&#39;s an effective order to learn in, and what&#39;s an effective order to teach in? And it&#39;s especially useful for people who have some prior proficiency, which is most people who are trying to learn a language in Duolingo — particularly English learners, because they&#39;ve done it in school in some kind of way, and their knowledge is patchy, as we like to say.</p><p> And in those cases, the order is going to be quite different person to person because of different experiences. And then the second aspect of it is the things that you specifically are having trouble with in the moment that you need to focus on more. Maybe you&#39;re just making way more mistakes for a particular concept. Maybe it&#39;s verb conjugations that are the problem, or maybe you just don&#39;t know how to introduce yourself well. And so there&#39;s an opportunity to, say, actually spend more time in that part of the experience.</p><p> It&#39;s not that every curriculum is custom made for a unique student, but it is that where you put your attention and your focus, and the amount you put in, and the order in which you do it in is directed by some kind of tutor. I will say that&#39;s a tough thing to do. It really is a tough thing to do. We&#39;re not there, but that&#39;s part of the dream, certainly.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> So the show is <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> , and we didn&#39;t learn a lot about you and yourself. So maybe tell us a bit about your background — how you ended up in this role, and what the journey was like.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Yes. How far back should I go? Do I start with grandparents? Parents? Myself?</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Up to you.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> OK. I&#39;ll skip the extended biography. I grew up in Karachi, Pakistan. That&#39;s where I was raised, and I came to the US for undergraduate studies. And I actually studied political science and East Asian studies in college because, one, I was interested in languages, so I took Chinese, and when I was learning languages in college, one of the most exciting things was always trying out tools to see what was effective or not.</p><p> So it&#39;s the interest in languages, it&#39;s the interest in technology that got me to Duolingo. And actually, I started in marketing because I&#39;d done some marketing and advertising internships before that. At that time, we were around 50 people at Duolingo, and we went from having just one team that worked on the app to having teams that worked on monetization, learning, and growth. And so I started working on growth as a marketing person, and then, about a year and a half in, I switched to being a product manager. And for most of my time at Duolingo, I have worked on growth, which is to say user retention, whether that&#39;s new users or existing users, growing our presence in Asia; that was super interesting. Things like that. And motivation and what gets people motivated and what keeps them motivated has always just been an interest of mine.</p><p> And then, the switch to working on AI as the focus and leading this Experimental AI team came at the end of last year because, basically, we ended up partnering with OpenAI for their GPT-4 launch. And the reason why we ended up doing this partnership was actually because I knew the product manager for the GPT-4 launch at OpenAI, and when we got together, we quickly realized Duolingo is the perfect use case for the launch, because for the launch, what they really wanted was to show that companies are actually using this to transform their businesses and these are also companies that are trying to do good for the world, etc. And so we, as a company, based on that partnership and getting access to GPT-4 early, shifted a bunch of priorities [and] started really leaning into AI, and one of those things was to start this team that&#39;s trying to work on experimental features.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Very exciting. And actually, from a motivation standpoint, you&#39;ll be thrilled to know that my son is very proud of his Spanish language streak, so …</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Amazing.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> We&#39;ve got a segment where we ask you a series of questions, and these are just rapid-fire; say the first thing that comes to your mind. What&#39;s your proudest moment in AI?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> We, as a company, launching Duolingo Max has been super exciting and just paving the way for a new era of teaching. It&#39;s been created, actually, by the Max team at Duolingo, which is led by Edwin Bodge and Bill Peterson, and it&#39;s super exciting.</p><p> I&#39;d say personally, actually, the first product that my team has been working on is actually — the experiment is going live. You could kind of think of it like TikTok for reading, but it&#39;s something where all the content is generated by GPT-4. It&#39;s giving you a huge breadth of content because people need reading practice in lots of different varieties, and it&#39;s also listening as well. So I&#39;m very excited to see how that goes.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Very cool. What worries you about AI?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> I&#39;m generally very optimistic, but I think the thing that worries me is just that the pace of change is so quick that it will be destabilizing. And the goal for us as a society is to make sure we can stay stable in the face of very, very rapid change, because rapid change is what we want, actually. We want progress to come quickly but without all of the destabilizing effects. So that&#39;s the fear. I think it&#39;s a solvable problem, but that&#39;s the fear.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your favorite activity that does not involve technology?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> I play a lot of soccer. Funnily, there is technology involved with that, as it turns out, but, yes, I play a lot of soccer. That&#39;s one of my favorite activities to do.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> So, what first career did you want? Poli-sci, I think you mentioned. What did you want to be when you grew up when you were a kid?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Lots of different things. There was never one answer. I wanted to be a writer, a journalist, a cricket player — a cricketer — and work in international development; I even wanted to be an architect.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> You ran the table there.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Yeah, a lot of different things.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your greatest wish for AI? What are you hoping we can get from this?</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> I think AI is the way that we can create the fastest progress, where [by] “progress” here I just mean as many human beings [as possible] are living the lives that they choose to live — that they&#39;re flourishing. I think that is the highest-level goal, and that is the meaning of life for most people. I&#39;m very excited to be part of that effort.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Well, it sounds like you are. Zan, thanks for taking the time to talk to us. I genuinely feel like this is a hugely different and exciting opportunity for how we as humans can get better. And it sounds like Duolingo is doing a lot of that. Thanks for joining us.</p><p> <strong>Zan Gilani:</strong> Thank you so much.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Thanks for joining us. Next time, Sam and I speak with Jeremy King, senior vice president and head of engineering at Pinterest.

Anyone perusing handbags at a street market knows how common it is to find fake products that look identical to the real thing but might not function the same way. In some cases, this can put consumers at risk: A pharmaceutical company, for instance, discovered counterfeit versions of its product on the black market that contained no active pharmaceutical ingredients. As well, a company&#39;s legitimate product may be diverted for unauthorized sales, as when a global electronics company discovered that distributors in its network, who had ordered components supposedly for customer repairs, were selling them on the gray market.</p><p> High-demand products in every industry are lucrative targets for fraudulent criminal activity. Unfortunately, counterfeit products are a problem that many companies do not want to acknowledge or raise to their boards or shareholders. Senior executives often try to explain away the problem, rationalizing that counterfeiters will always find a way to copy products or that piracy represents only a small percentage of sales and is not worth going after. That plays right into the hands of what counterfeiters want businesses to do: ignore them.</p><p></p><p> When companies do begin to quantify the level to which counterfeiters are affecting their bottom lines, they may attack the problem with piecemeal approaches to try to prevent it from growing. But that&#39;s not enough.</p><p> Our research suggests that successfully combating counterfeits requires the attention of a broad collection of organizational functions. It works best with a multilayered strategy encompassing diverse methods and engaging the entire organization and its partners.</p><p></p><p> We recommend that organizations tackle counterfeiting with a cohesive plan for identifying, containing, and preventing it. This comprehensive process means routinely keeping tabs on contract manufacturers and charting how products move through the supply chain. It includes scoping out what is for sale in consumer markets, deploying covert markings, reviewing warranty claims, educating customers, and partnering with key agencies and competitors.</p><h3> Conventional Tactics Aren&#39;t Working</h3><p> Companies that pay any attention to counterfeiting have traditionally relied on a brand security function to track down criminal activity. These teams often detect counterfeiting using tactics such as applying covert and overt markings on legitimate products, attaching RFID tags that track product locations, and using serialization combined with blockchain to create transaction records that are resistant to tampering. For example, barcodes compliant with the GS1 Global Traceability Standard are used to track COVID-19 vaccines. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> For many organizations, though, these tactics are not enough.</p><p> Counterfeiting and illegal diversion of product remains pervasive: Our 2018 survey of 21 supply chain executives revealed that nearly half had an issue that was ongoing or had experienced an incident in the previous year. More than 70% said they&#39;d had an incident in the previous five years. (See “The Research.”) One executive told us that his company discovered that the equivalent of an entire factory&#39;s monthly production of its products was being sent into black markets, largely due to diversion from one of its own suppliers.</p><p> Counterfeiting has grown into a problem that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says was worth $464 billion in 2019, or 2.5% of world trade. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> It was once thought that counterfeiters went after only high-value or luxury items such as pharmaceuticals, designer handbags, or perfume. But now the marketplace is full of fake footwear, pesticides, cosmetics, toys, automotive parts, and medical equipment. Counterfeiters are targeting any industry and any product line where there is an easy profit to be made.</p><p> While companies may never completely eliminate bad actors from copying products or diverting goods from authorized channels, they can significantly reduce counterfeiters&#39; market penetration and restore lost revenue. Successful approaches may involve cutting off counterfeiters&#39; access to markets, eliminating their supply of unauthorized goods, or making a product more difficult to copy. Here, we&#39;ll go into detail on the three activities that a robust action plan comprises: identification, containment, and prevention.</p><h3> Identification: Gain Insight Into the Extent and Nature of the Problem</h3><p> Getting a baseline on the severity of the counterfeiting problem is a critical first step. As the size of the issue becomes clear, the potential return on investment in shutting it down also comes into view. This can help establish performance metrics for the anti-counterfeiting team that can be aligned with business objectives and outcomes. Examples of metrics include the dollar amount or percentage of revenue lost annually due to illegal product trade, total top-line revenues recovered (dollars that were previously unknowingly lost to counterfeit sales), and the number of confirmed incidents of illicit trade, counterfeiting, diversion, and tampering.</p><p> <strong>Create a cross-functional brand security team.</strong> Developing realistic measures of the current problem often requires an intensive investigation that involves applying market channel analyses that explore multiple sources of sales data and other information from both inside and outside the organization. To be effective, a brand security team should include participants from sales, marketing, operations, purchasing, logistics, finance, and accounting, as well as core brand security functions. Such teams are typically led by a global brand protection officer who in many cases has a law enforcement background and usually reports to the chief operating officer.</p><p> <strong>Examine internal and market data to flush out suspicious activity.</strong> Companies can struggle to find, much less measure, counterfeiting activity, given that clues are usually buried in data about sales, warranties, returns, and other product metrics. Unless someone is looking for it, unusual activity can easily go unnoticed.</p><p> A good first step is to start by looking at what&#39;s being sold online. E-commerce has emerged as a perfect channel to fuel the counterfeit goods industry. Consumers may unwittingly buy products from online retailers that don&#39;t verify the source of the products on their platform and whether they are legitimate. Despite counterfeit sites being shut down regularly by Amazon (and, in China, Alibaba), operators trading in fake goods regularly open up again under a different name the next day. Amazon reported that it blocked 10 billion fake listings and destroyed 2 million counterfeit products in 2020 alone. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a></p><p> Since e-commerce sites are frequently a counterfeiter&#39;s primary source of sales, companies can begin by investigating where their products — either genuine or fake — are being sold online. Looking for common attributes of counterfeiter websites can narrow down the pool of suspicious activity. For instance, a company might find four different sellers on Amazon offering an exact copy of its handbag, listing the same details and even photos. An indicator of potential counterfeiters might include spelling or grammatical errors, blurry photos, or other details that don&#39;t look quite right.</p><p> Another important data source is warranty returns. When a consumer sends a product back because it is defective (and counterfeits often are), detective work can track down where it was purchased and how. This can lead to the origin of market entry for counterfeit goods and a starting point to find their downstream source. A global medical products company we looked at hired a global brand protection officer who examined warranty and returns data, field service requests, and sales data. In his first 100 days, he found 1,000 confirmed incidents of illicit trade, counterfeiting, diversion, and tampering. This amounted to $1.4 billion — 2% of revenue — lost annually to illegal product trade.</p><p> Estimating counterfeit sales is a difficult but essential task: Companies must establish a baseline against which to gauge the effects of anti-counterfeit measures. Having an accurate understanding of the scope of the problem is a prerequisite for deciding how much to invest and what ROI to expect from anti-counterfeiting measures. In many cases, business decision makers are unaware of the extent to which their revenue and reputation are in jeopardy.</p><p> <strong>Map the supply and distribution chain.</strong> Many companies are surprised to learn that bad actors are active within their own supply chains. Overproduction, black-market sales, and unauthorized distribution are common sources of leakage that may result in a product, or copies of it, being sold through channels that a company knows nothing about. That&#39;s why an important early step is to identify the manufacturing and distribution channels through which the company&#39;s products travel.</p><p></p><p> The brand owner at a large global apparel company told us that he had heard through his distributor network that the brand was being sold in Mexico even though the company had no authorized retail presence there. To track where these products were coming from, the director hunted down bills of lading and shipping records for the ocean freight shipments that were going to Mexico. The paper trail showed that the goods were shipped from a port in Israel — by the same authorized manufacturer that was producing the company&#39;s branded product in the United States. The apparel company eventually tracked down the clothes, which were genuine products, made under the same specifications and from the same materials, but were being illicitly distributed outside of the contractual agreement between the parties. When the apparel company set up a global brand security function and mapped its entire supply network, it found that similar cases of product diversion were occurring all over the world.</p><p> Analyzing how much is being spent on raw materials in the upstream supply chains is a good place to start mapping a supply base. Procurement can reach out to the accounting team to track all third-party purchases being made on the company&#39;s behalf (a document generally known as a <em>spend analysis</em> ). If a supplier is buying more raw materials and is operating at a higher production level than what the company is ordering, this is a telltale sign that the additional product may be moving into the black market. This requires full visibility into the supply chain, beyond just Tier 1 suppliers (which is increasingly important for other reasons, in particular to manage risk related to labor or environmental violations). Some suppliers may be reluctant to disclose their upstream suppliers for competitive reasons but can be reassured that the query is for security purposes and not an attempt to cut them out of the chain.</p><p></p><h3> Containment: Limit the Problem&#39;s Spread</h3><p> With a dedicated team in place, an initial sense of the problem&#39;s scope, and an understanding of the particular counterfeiting and diversion risks that it&#39;s most vulnerable to, a company can begin to manage the problem systematically in order to contain it.</p><p> <strong>Analyze product segments.</strong> One of the key tasks for the investigation team is segmenting products by channel, margin, volume, and risk of counterfeit activity. This ensures that the team&#39;s attention is being directed toward the most vulnerable market channels first.</p><p> In many cases, a current-state analysis of a company&#39;s supply and distribution processes helps reveal a common set of product segments that counterfeiters go after. In particular, our research found that product lines with high complexity based on the variety of finished products, level of finished-product customization, geographical span of suppliers, number of tiers in the supply chain, predictability of demand, and variation in manufacturing volumes. Examples of items in this category include aircraft and automotive replacement parts, toys, high-end apparel, branded pharmaceutical products, and consumer electronics. Counterfeiters are more likely to opportunistically target product segments characterized by a greater level of complexity and exploit this complexity to their advantage.</p><p> We interviewed executives at a biotech manufacturer who knew that counterfeit products were showing up in the market but did not know the source. The brand protection team started by segmenting products into those that were big targets for counterfeiters (in this case, high-margin items) and analyzing data to estimate the number of incidents per brand. The team — formed through a close collaboration among franchises, brand owners, and regional sales managers — then rolled out a plan to franchise partners and country business units. This established brand protection priorities by product line and provided a system to track customer-reported incidents by brand and conduct data reviews every six months.</p><p> At the same time, analysts began collecting market intelligence on supply chain vulnerabilities, including potential logistics disruptions and the threat of regulatory intervention, that posed significant risks for business plans and growth targets by region. Cumulatively, these efforts helped the manufacturer prioritize those businesses and regions where brand protection could best safeguard market revenue from sudden disruptions. In the process, the team identified a significant counterfeit and diversion activity affecting a blockbuster infusion drug that was putting many patients at risk. The company said it was able to eventually reduce the number of incidents from 100 per year to zero. This required persistent efforts to deduce the source of each incident through detailed analysis and the introduction of countermeasures — including sending a message to counterfeiters warning that they would be pursued, in hopes of convincing them to go look for an easier target.</p><p> This kind of analysis begins with identifying an initial clue and following the thread of activity. The initial problem may manifest itself as a minor issue such as a customer warranty problem, a dealer who seems to be ordering too many replacement parts, or a spate of customer returns on a particular brand of product. Any of these issues may be a hint that leads to a channel of counterfeiting activity.</p><p> <strong>Start with e-commerce sites, and reach out to customs and other authorities.</strong> A team of analysts should be hunting down in-the-open counterfeit operations on e-commerce sites on an ongoing basis and reporting them to the platform operator, such as Amazon, and to law enforcement. At the very least, this introduces more friction into some bad actors&#39; businesses to slow them down.</p><p> Counterfeit products almost always have to cross borders and pass through transshipment points and customs inspections overseen by law enforcement entities. These are critical players in the supply chain, and organizations must think of them as partners in the battle against revenue loss and intellectual property theft. These relationships are particularly important in highly regulated environments, such as pharmaceuticals, food, aerospace, and automotive manufacturing, where counterfeit products can endanger their users.</p><p> An official with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) told us that it can be challenging to get brand owners to understand the CBP&#39;s process and play their part in helping the agency fight the problem. “We are in the field, inspecting containers,” he said. “If a CBP officer opens a container and sees something that looks suspicious, they will first look in our internal database of registered brands. If the officer doesn&#39;t see anything, there is nothing they can do.” Registering brands with the CBP and US Patent and Trademark Office is a critical step in containing counterfeiting.</p><p> <strong>Educate (and warn) customers.</strong> It is imperative that consumers are educated about the possibility and risks of buying fake goods. Companies should make customers aware, through brand marketing, that if they buy from an unverified online third-party seller, they bear the risk of not having the product covered by warranty — or, worse yet, having it fail with dire consequences. One company we know of began adding a statement on its Amazon website warning that products returned to it that were not licensed would not be under warranty. Companies should also emphasize to customers the importance of registering the product serial number for warranty purposes, which protects them if a legitimate product they&#39;ve purchased turns out to be flawed or faulty. If a customer tries to register the serial number for a counterfeit product, it will show up as an error and alert the brand security team to a problem.</p><h3> Prevention: Stop Future Counterfeit Ops Before They Start</h3><p> Once an organization discovers how the spread of counterfeit products in its market channels works and has taken initial steps to contain the problem, it must continue to monitor criminal activity and establish strong preventive measures. There are important roles for numerous functions in the company to play at this stage.</p><p> <strong>Product packaging experts should explore digital tracing technology.</strong> Features in current tracing technologies offer positive product authentication, can indicate tampering, can increase the difficulty of replication, and permit product tracking and tracing. Secure markings — which use a variety of packaging, blockchain, and serial marking technologies — are one method for tracking products. Many industries are working with standards organizations like ASTM International or GS1 to develop common methods for verifying products. This can help avoid the problem where counterfeiters try to copy not just the product but the digital marking, too.</p><p> In the biotech example mentioned previously, the brand protection team worked with the business to identify covert and overt authentication capabilities, which created automatic alerts when counterfeit products were being sold through market channels. The team also created a comprehensive customer communication plan using web advertisements, targeted email and Twitter campaigns, and retailer alerts about the dangers of buying from unauthorized sources. The campaign created awareness in the company&#39;s sales partner network and set the stage to identify where new counterfeit sales were occurring.</p><p> <strong>Quality assurance should review data to track down instances of product problems and returns.</strong> QA can create triggers in its data collection processes that flag potential illegitimate activities. We know of a company that noticed an uptick in its product returns, discovered that the products were not legitimate, and tracked them down to the point of sale — which revealed the source of the counterfeiting.</p><p> <strong>Supply management should step up efforts to audit suppliers.</strong> It can be particularly fruitful to track overproduction by suppliers, as well as how they dispose of products that don&#39;t conform to quality standards — products that can end up moving through black market channels and thus avoiding trade compliance policies. One large apparel company began monitoring the inventory levels within its supplier&#39;s facilities and noticed that the supplier&#39;s inbound raw-material inventories were much greater than the volume of finished goods it was shipping to the company. This was an indication that product was being produced and sold elsewhere through other channels.</p><p> <strong>Logistics should map supply routes to document compliance on the part of transportation providers.</strong> This can help ensure chain of custody along global supply chains, particularly at handoff points such as ports, warehouses, and distribution centers. Companies with multitier distributor channels should document every logistics handoff and conduct random audits to determine whether there are proper security personnel and locked gates at all distribution centers.</p><p> <strong>Human resources might want to consider monitoring employees who are dealing directly with targeted products.</strong> This may include conducting background checks, as well as increasing training to enhance staff awareness. If there is a high level of missing inventory or a sudden increase or drop in product sales, investigations may be required.</p><p> <strong>Aftermarket sales should track warranty claims and parts sales to identify product-quality problems.</strong> As with the quality assurance team, those at the front line of aftermarket sales are in a position to learn that products aren&#39;t performing as expected, which, again, may indicate that counterfeits are entering market channels. For example, a large retailer made the decision to limit its distribution channels and authorized resellers, recognizing the high potential for counterfeit products in these particular sales channels, especially e-commerce.</p><p></p><p></p><p> Counterfeiting and product diversion are not crimes that a single organization can combat. They require the diligence of brands, retailers, packaging companies, and logistics businesses. This is a rare instance where joining with competitors can yield important insights. Companies should consider joining a consortium and partnering with industry counterparts. Industry-specific groups include the Automotive Anti-Counterfeiting Council for vehicle manufacturers and Rx-360 for pharmaceutical companies. Members of React, a large anti-counterfeiting network, include Marvel Entertainment, Mattel, Pfizer, Philips, Prada, and Timberland.</p><p> Counterfeiting is also not just a private-sector supply chain problem. Labor and human rights advocates, consumer education agencies, customs agents, federal and state law enforcement agencies, local police, and consumers of counterfeit products all have an interest and role in ferreting out unauthorized activity. While counterfeiting and product diversion cannot be eliminated, dedicated efforts can curtail both significantly.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/taming-the-counterfeiting-epidemic/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Dismantle Career Roadblocks for More Equitable Outcomes</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/dismantle-career-roadblocks-for-more-equitable-outcomes/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/dismantle-career-roadblocks-for-more-equitable-outcomes/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 11:00:51 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Haig R.

Women and people of color continue to face obstacles advancing to more senior roles and are frequently not positioned to succeed in the same ways as their White male counterparts.</p><p> That was the message from Haig R. Nalbantian, cofounder and coleader of the Workforce Sciences Institute, during <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/series/work-23-the-big-shift/">Work/23</a> , an <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> symposium held in May 2023. Nalbantian helps organizations apply evidence-based, empirical methods to strengthen their DEI efforts and retention strategies and asserts that “the surging use of analytics in the HR domain to inform work and workforce management” is a big part of the future of work.</p><p></p><p> While talent and drive are important in shaping careers, situational factors profoundly affect what happens to employees at work. They include employees&#39; access to “accelerator” roles, such as customer-facing jobs; how employees navigate flexible work arrangements, such as part-time status; and employees&#39; reporting relationships, such as whether they report to higher-level or high-performing supervisors. Nalbantian noted that these easy-to-identify circumstances, which he called <em>explained differences</em> , are prevalent.</p><p></p><p> Many organizations also have pervasive and sizable <em>unexplained disparities</em> regarding who gets chosen for promotions. Nalbantian said that in both his own studies and others, “women are actually more likely to be highly rated” by their managers at elite, large employers — all things being equal — “but in the majority of companies, they&#39;re less likely to be promoted.”</p><p> He said it is critical that companies address the explained differences and explore the unexplained disparities.</p><p> Nalbantian wasn&#39;t able to get to all of the questions from attendees during the event, so he answers some of them below. (Questions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity.)</p><h6> Does your research address intersectionality in its analysis? You talked about women and people of color, but what about women of color and other people with multiple intersecting minority identities?</h6><p> In many of the client cases covered in my study, we did indeed examine intersectionality directly. We&#39;ve done this quite a bit in larger US-based organizations that have adequate populations of these demographic groups for modeling purposes.</p><p> One of the areas of particular interest to client organizations is intersectionality with respect to reporting relationships. That is, do the specific demographics of one&#39;s supervisor affect whether the employee is promoted, is highly rated, or gets higher pay increases? For example, do White male supervisors treat Black female reports worse than White male or White female reports? Do White female supervisors help the prospects of their female reports, regardless of color?</p><p> I can say that there are few regularities in these results — certainly far less than the results I&#39;ve reported with respect to performance ratings, roles, supervisor performance and level, and flexible working.</p><p></p><h6> Has this research mapped across socioeconomic status as an intersectional influence?</h6><p> Unfortunately, we&#39;ve had much more limited data on socioeconomic factors, in part because most of our clients focus these studies on their salaried populations, ignoring their hourly workers. This concerns me, as it reveals a tendency to discount front-line workers. I try to remind organizations that what happens in their front-line ranks can have a major impact on business results. I&#39;ve seen and documented this in client assignments. Still, the tendency of organizations is to prioritize their salaried employees — professionals, managers, and executives.</p><h6> You mentioned that being younger than comparable peers is an attribute favorable to success. Can you elaborate more on what your studies have found regarding age inequalities?</h6><p> The negative impact of age is close to universal among our analytical findings with client organizations. The simple fact is that once an employee gets beyond the median age of their cohort, all things turn negative: They&#39;re less likely to be promoted, they&#39;re less likely to receive a high performance rating, and their pay growth levels off or declines.</p><p> The one positive is that there is less turnover with older employees, often substantially less. Indeed, it may be that it is precisely because older employees tend to stay that employers don&#39;t feel the need to promote, pay, or recognize them in the same way as they do their younger employees. The latter have more outside opportunities, so they may need to be constantly wooed.</p><p></p><p> These negative signals about older workers can be very misleading. We often find that groups with more older workers actually outperform those with more younger workers. There&#39;s a discordance between what&#39;s found at the individual level compared with the group or organizational level.</p><p> This suggests that the productivity of older workers shows up not in their own measures of individual performance but in the performance of those with whom they work. We call this a <em>spillover effect</em> . So, for example, if older workers are less likely to turn over, they can cause their younger colleagues to follow suit, thereby bringing more stability to their work groups and making them more productive. For more evidence about the productivity of older workers, see the recent study I conducted with Richard A. Guzzo and Nicholas L. Anderson, which we discuss in the article “ <a href="https://academic.oup.com/workar/article/8/2/208/6574297">Age, Experience, and Business Performance: A Meta-Analysis of Work Unit-Level Effects</a> ” in the journal <cite>Work, Aging and Retirement</cite> .</p><h6> How can organizations ensure that age diversity and inclusion are integrated into their equity and diversity initiatives?</h6><p> Again, it is a common view among business leaders that older workers are less productive. And because they tend to cost more, they are viewed more as a liability than an asset, despite significant evidence to the contrary. For some reason that I find hard to explain, combating ageism is not high on the DEI agenda, certainly not as compared with efforts to address gender and racial inequity. I fault the DEI community for not being more aggressive on this front.</p><p> The aging workforce is a fact of life almost everywhere. Organizations that don&#39;t deal effectively with the repercussions of this secular trend and ensure that they are managing their older workers effectively run the risk of undermining organizational performance. In effect, they may make their unfounded stereotypes a self-fulfilling outcome.</p><p></p><p> I always urge my clients to undertake the kind of disciplined diagnostic work to evaluate the realities of their own workforce — to determine whether spillover effects are indeed at work in their organization, and to respond accordingly. Through this process, many of them will find that they have an asset to protect rather than a liability to discard.</p><h6> Is there any analysis done on the correlation between company performance or share price and the situations demonstrated by the survey?</h6><p> I&#39;ve undertaken client studies in which we link workforce characteristics and management practices to various business outcomes, including profitability, financial and operational productivity, revenue growth, and customer retention, among others. Our results have been mixed. In some, we&#39;ve seen that greater diversity in work group or unit composition improves business performance; in others, we&#39;ve found no effect or statistically negligible results. The most robust review and synthesis of the results of these studies is the meta-analysis of the effects of age and tenure noted above. That study did not focus on the effects of race and gender.</p><h6> What concrete steps can organizations take to battle these biases?</h6><p></p><p> My article in the summer 2023 issue of <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> , “ <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/opening-access-to-the-fast-track-for-career-equity/">Opening Access to the Fast Track for Career Equity</a> ,” speaks directly to this question. I explain how organizations can use the results of this kind of modeling to help eliminate or reduce the influence of demographics on how well employees are positioned to succeed at work. The reality is that all too often, situational factors inordinately affect the ability of employees to succeed and that women and people of color are situationally disadvantaged.</p><p> Employers who recognize that they are not positioning this talent to succeed can deploy an approach I call <em>proactive career management</em> to change this reality on the ground. This may involve getting more women and people of color into supervisory or other accelerator roles, changing reporting relationships, and neutralizing the negative effects of flexible working, among other things. I share a case study in my article to illustrate this approach in action.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/dismantle-career-roadblocks-for-more-equitable-outcomes/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
