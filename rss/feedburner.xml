Khodabandeh：</strong>机器学习可以检测欺诈活动，但也可能会错过良好行为。在今天的节目中了解一家平台公司如何管理这些风险和权衡。</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong>我是来自 Airbnb 的 Naba Banerjee，你们正在听<cite>我、我自己和 AI 的</cite>声音。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>欢迎来到<cite>《我、我自己和人工智能》</cite> ，这是一个关于商业人工智能的播客。每集我们都会向您介绍人工智能创新人士。我是 Sam Ransbotham，波士顿学院分析学教授。我还是<cite>《麻省理工学院斯隆管理评论》</cite>的人工智能和商业战略客座编辑。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我是 Shervin Khodabandeh，BCG 的高级合伙人，也是我们人工智能业务的领导者之一。自 2017 年以来， <cite>MIT SMR</cite>和 BCG 一直在人工智能方面进行研究和出版，采访了数百名从业者，并对数千家公司进行了调查，了解如何构建、部署和扩展人工智能能力，并真正改变组织的运营方式。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>今天，Shervin 和我正在与 Airbnb 信托产品和运营总监 Naba Banerjee 进行交谈。纳巴，感谢您加入我们。</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>谢谢；很高兴来到这里。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>我认为大多数人都知道 Airbnb，但也许可以告诉我们该公司的简要概述以及您的业务。</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong> Airbnb 代表着一个促进联系和归属感的地方。数以百万计的主人向完全陌生的人开放他们的家，你我和我们的家人可以去一个充满异国情调的目的地旅行，而不是住在酒店，你实际上可以真正沉浸在当地文化中。有时，如果您真的很幸运，您可以住在房东的家里，真正体验到房东的本来面目，从而建立和促进联系和归属感。</p><p>在这个日益变得孤立、联系变得越来越稀有的世界里，我很高兴能成为一家致力于创造更多联系的公司的一员。我的团队（爱彼迎的信任与安全团队）的工作贯穿于整个客户旅程，从您在爱彼迎创建帐户的整个旅程开始。有时，可能会出现问题：可能会创建虚假帐户，或者您的帐户可能会被接管。您想要入住的房源可能是假房源；您正在查看的评论可能并不完全真实。但我们的工作是确保您可以专注于您的神奇住宿，房东可以专注于成为完美的房东，我们会尽力预测其中一些风险，并将发生此类问题的风险降至最低。我的团队所做的就是利用技术和数据来实现神奇的用户旅程。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>我想我们都听到过出现问题的头条新闻。在您进行的无数交易过程中出了多少问题？</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>这是一个很好的问题。 2021 年，爱彼迎上发生了大约 7000 万次旅行，其中不到 0.1% 的旅行导致房东或房客报告该次住宿期间可能发生的问题。当我们的团队深入调查并实际查看真正的伤害发生在哪里或必须将某人从平台上删除时，这个数字甚至更小。</p><p>我知道即使是一件糟糕的事件也可能太糟糕了，不应该发生，但在更大范围的事情中，你回过头来意识到大多数人实际上都是好人。百分之九十九点九的人只想处理日常事务、享受愉快的住宿或成为出色的主人。但有时，在极少数情况下，当坏事发生时，我们希望确保降低这种风险。</p><p>如果你仔细观察一个人在哪里对另一个人造成了伤害，你会发现这些事件只是一小部分。但当我们谈论安全时，我们关注的是[诸如]一氧化碳气体泄漏。可能会滑倒；这可能是财产损失，玻璃破裂，地毯上可能有污渍。我们也在研究此类问题。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我从你的话中听到的是，你的角色是，第一，一个好角色。你是善良的保护者和邪恶的“守护者”，对吗？</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>我喜欢这个。您应该成为我们品牌团队的一员。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>这是一件好事，对吧？这是一个非常有目的的角色。第二部分是，你谈论的是微观上的小事件。</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>是的，大海捞针。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·霍达班德：</strong>对吗？这些都是有趣的问题。告诉我们更多关于幕后的信息——会发生什么？</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong>我想说它分为三个部分。一是，我们从“为什么”开始，也就是说——你说得很好——我们是善的保护者，并试图抵御坏的。我们永远不能说我们阻止了一切不好的事情。就像山姆所说的那样，你不能那样做。但我们如何学习并变得更好呢？这就是人工智能和机器学习[机器学习]的用武之地，[我们问]“我们如何利用数据和技术的力量来学习并变得更好？”每年，风险都不会保持不变；数据不断增长。</p><p>第二件事是，“我们如何负责任地使用技术？”也就是说，您可能会过于直率并尝试尽可能多地阻止以专门查看欺诈和安全事件并将其控制下来，但是，如果您用于做出这些决策的数据存在偏见，则可能会创造不公平，那么你就可能对很多真正只想过得愉快的好人关上大门。所以[它是关于]负责任地使用技术。 ......它有自治机制，也就是说，我们有我们的隐私团队，我们的数据隐私团队，我们的信息安全团队，我们的反歧视团队，它们......几乎就像信任团队的镜子。 [还有] Airbnb 的其他团队，每次我们真正专注于这个特定的欺诈媒介、机器人检测、帐户接管检测或当事人检测时，他们都会不断确保我们是否使用了以下数据：一种安全的方式和透明的方式，给用户控制权，然后不引入偏见。</p><p>最后，我们有办法为人们提供一条回头路，也就是说，我们将根据我们可用的数据、我们可用的技术以及该技术的成熟度，尽我们所能决定。但如果我们错了，我们是否可以创建透明度和一个流程，让用户在我们阻止或删除他们时提出申诉并重新回到平台，以便我们能够再次学习并变得更好？因此，在最高层面上，这就是我的团队在幕后工作的方式。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>有哪些用例？</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong>我们已经讨论过很多次的用例之一是，你知道......我将给你讲一个小故事，那就是，当我在 2020 年加入信托团队时，世界刚刚关闭；疫情肆虐。与世界等待疫苗的方式非常相似，在等待疫苗的过程中，我们进入了封锁模式。</p><p>这是一个生硬的工具……防止人们将自己暴露在不安全的情况下。同样，Airbnb 不幸成为适合未经授权的家庭聚会的产品市场。不幸的是，当酒店和酒吧关闭时，只有不到 1% 或 0.1% 的用户在寻找可以举办派对的地方，开始出租 Airbnb。结果，我们意识到这给使用这个基于信任基础的平台的房东和房客社区带来了很多痛苦。所以最初，我们不得不使用一些非常生硬的工具。</p><p>我们首先制定了全球派对禁令，称爱彼迎不允许举办任何类型的派对。其次，我们开始研究一些模式，发现 25 岁以下的人会在离家不到 50 英里左右的地方预订整个房屋一晚或两晚 - 这些似乎都是导致聚会的信号。当聚会发生时，我们通常会发现……该帐户是昨天创建的。然后我们实施了一项名为“25 岁以下”的生硬规则，并将其落实到位。现在，我们必须小心，因为这些规则并不完全适用于全球。但这在北美奏效了，我们立即发现未经授权的团体数量有所减少。</p><p>但随着时间的推移，就像规则一样，我们看到人们开始玩弄这些规则。他们会找一位年长的朋友为他们预订房间。他们不会预订一晚，而是预订三晚，依此类推。 [并且]对优秀用户的影响是如此之大，以至于我们说：“我们需要转向机器学习。我们需要变得更聪明。”因此，我们在澳大利亚进行了第一次试点，在那里我们对地方进行了细分，并比较了拥有我们建立的新派对模式的地方与其他地方。我们看到减少了吗？再说一次，这就像大海捞针一样，但我们仍然发现该地区采用派对模式的派对比不使用派对模式的派对少了 35%。当我们开始在北美进行实验时，我们确实发现它与启发式方法一样有效，但对优秀用户的影响较小。</p><p>这给了我们继续前进的信心，因为什么都不做不是一种选择。我们必须做点什么，而且必须聪明地去做。这是我们可以出去讨论的用例之一——并不是说我们正在阻止所有各方，但至少 Airbnb 对此采取了强硬立场。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>在您描述问题和解决方案时，我听到的一个共同点是需要不断适应和持续学习，并使用正确的工具来完成正确的工作。有时这是一个规则，然后可能是无监督学习，然后是人工干预。这听起来确实是一个跨学科的问题，包括规则改变的部分，或者欺诈者操作方式改变的部分，你还会有“是不是太生硬了？”的问题。它是否限制了一些无意识但良好或良性的行为？”在这些情况下，人机协作或交互如何进行？</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong> Shervin，你总结得非常好，也就是说，这不是一件一劳永逸的事情。你构建它，然后你必须不断地学习和优化，甚至是你正在做出的决策，以及你周围的世界如何演变。这是人类真正擅长的领域，也就是说，你必须遵守使用最新数据、正确数据来训练你的模型的纪律，并就最佳阈值做出权衡决策。你会说，“好吧，这是有风险的，我们已经准备好冒这个风险了。”</p><p>在 Airbnb，我们一直致力于如何在循环中利用人类。除了产品和规划团队之外，我还有一个信托运营团队。该运营团队由全职员工以及全球代理组成。每当我们构建一个新模型时，一开始我们经常让模型做出基于风险阈值的决策：“这是前 1%。这是下一部分。这是下一部分。”有时，我们会将其发送给人类，然后在此基础上创建标签，表示“我同意模型的决定”或“我不同意模型的决定”，然后将其作为训练数据返回到模型。</p><p>然后，当我们对模型的决策能力更有信心时，我们就会转向自动决策。这个派对模式，就你的观点而言，现在完全是自动决定的。但最终发生的情况是，当我们收到用户的申诉，说“我被错误地阻止了”，那么该申诉就会作为客户告诉我们的数据。然后一名特工查看了该上诉并说：“实际上，这个决定是错误的。”如果代理做出了正确的决定，该客户提出了正确的上诉，并且没有发生任何事件，我们就知道这是误报。</p><p>但假设代理商批准了，然后该客户继续举办派对；那是假阴性。我们不断从中学习，但我们是迭代地进行的。首先，我们尝试将模型直接应用于人类。再说一遍，不能保证人类比模型更擅长决策，但我们会不断衡量其表现。然后我们会转向[更少]人类决策的高阶决策。有时我们也会……假设政党模式做出决定。人们继续他们的快乐方式，有保留。有时，在预订完成后，我们仍然会让人查看风险最高的 1% 预订，以尝试并纠正任何可能的情况。</p><p>因此，它要么试图平衡这一点，即人类什么时候是做出决定的合适人选？机器什么时候应该做出决定？我们经历了一段并不轻松、非线性的旅程。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>您一开始提到您可能会审查更多案例，然后从这些案例中学习。但与此同时，人们……这 7000 万笔交易正在不断发生。例如，当您举例说明酒店在大流行开始时关闭时，这就是个别房东和顾客发生这种情况的时候。您如何平衡需要快速到位和需要完成流程之间的权衡？</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>这可能是最困难的事情，也是我整个职业生涯中处理过的最困难的事情。在此之前，我负责管理 Samsclub.com（沃尔玛的一部分）的所有产品，当时我认为我的工作很辛苦。当我们为客户提供服务、帮助他们结账时，我们仍然感觉自己处于增长的道路上，我们可以选择增长的速度或增长的速度。我总是有团队关注那些试图检查但无法检查的人，并在我们构建长期架构时为他们提供服务，但人们的生命并没有受到威胁; [这是]人们的钱——诈骗者利用偷来的信用卡骗取了公司数百万美元。</p><p>爱彼迎有一个团队正在努力保护好人，避免坏事。我们所做的是，你必须真正擅长确定优先级，这在信任和安全的世界中也很难做到。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·科达班德：</strong>我的意思是，从很多方面来说，选择就是萨姆，你一开始就说过：这些经济体并非没有风险。它们不可能没有风险。总体而言，好处多于坏处，因此一切都取决于优先顺序。但我不得不说，我们已经与许多在其他组织中扮演类似角色的人进行了交谈——你提到了山姆会员店等——他们正在使用技术、数字人工智能/机器学习来驱动各种用例。我认为你的突出之处在于它是一个持续的平衡行为，而且风险很高。然后你就会有这样的目标和谦虚地说：“好吧，我们相信我们会犯错误，而且这个系统不可能没有错误。”</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>是的。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>但随着时间的推移，情况正在变得更好。这引出了我的下一个问题：你如何衡量你的有效性？是指事件的数量、不良事件发生的严重程度和频率吗？</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong>我很高兴你问这个问题，因为我很自然地会朝着这个方向发展，也就是说，在最高层面上，我们衡量自己的指标是每百万次旅行中的欺诈事件数、安全事件数每百万次出行，以及良好的用户影响。这是衡量“我们屏蔽了多少优质列表？”的平衡指标。我们阻止了多少好主人和好客人继续前进，无法真正理解我们的误报和漏报？”但归根结底，我们全面考虑的是美好的旅行。</p><p>我们还从可能发生的欺诈损失的角度来考虑美元。我们正在查看收到的客户支持票证、因遇到我们团队提出的摩擦而产生的用户 NPS [净推荐值]。因此，在基本层面上，我们正在研究这些指标。但在我的职业生涯中，我第一次遇到的挑战之一是——在欺诈领域，我们可以进行 A/B 测试——我们不断迭代我们的模型。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>当你这样做时，你也可能会阻止相当良性的行为和意图。但正如你所说，在某种程度上，人类的判断需要压倒一切，并说这对一个人来说风险可能太高了。是的，我的意思是，当谈到机器学习时，我们总是谈论探索和利用，以及持续的反馈循环，但是学习总是有成本的，对吗？但是当我向你发送营销信息时你可能不喜欢，学习成本非常小，所以我会给你发送很多这样的信息，并且我会做各种A/B/X测试。但是，当我对风险较高的群体或人群进行这种 A/B 测试时，您可能会做出不这样做并依赖回顾性数据的人类判断。</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>是的。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>我认为您为我们很好地阐明了这一点。</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>是的。我们问自己的一个问题是，是什么让一个人信任另一个人？是什么让人们信任 Airbnb？我们意识到，我们可以在后台[训练]各种模型，而你甚至不知道自己是否处于 1% 还是 2% 的风险阈值内，或者是否被标记为良好用户。</p><p>但爱彼迎与您（作为房客）或您（作为房东）或房东与房客之间也需要进行对话，以真正建立信任。就像当我们问某人“如果你 17 岁的女孩想在上大学之前背包旅行时，你愿意把她送到希腊的一个陌生人家里吗？”您可能会说这是个人经历。我有一个17岁的孩子，即将上大学。我意识到，第一个想法是“不——不会发生”，我在 Airbnb 负责信任和安全。但后来我想，“好吧，如果我能和主持人谈谈就好了；”如果她要和别人住在一起；如果那个人是像我这样的妈妈……”</p><p><strong>谢尔文·霍达班德：</strong>是的。</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong>作为 Airbnb，我们可以说，“我们在后台运行所有这些模型；别担心，你的女儿很安全”——我认为这不会成功。我认为作为父母，您会希望获得需要查看的信息，即使您的判断可能并不比机器更好。所以我们也在努力，我们需要说什么，我们需要做什么？有时，当我们说“Airbnb 不会允许在同一社区内最后一刻预订的一晚住宿”时，我认为这也会让很多家长感觉更好，那好吧，至少这一点选项消失了。他们可能会想出其他办法。这个信息不能令人费解。该消息必须很简单。必须清楚地理解该信息。除了询问人们不应该做什么之外，我们还需要鼓励人们应该做哪些良好行为，例如与主人交谈、与客人交谈、提出问题。</p><p>我们推出了一项针对单身女性旅行者的计划，因为我们开始发现单身女性旅行者在私人房间内发生的人身安全事故的发生率可能略高。我们开始鼓励[女性]弄清楚，你的房间里会有锁吗？那把锁还能用吗？您可以独自使用浴室吗？哪些空间是共享的？哪些不是？所以这不是一个阻止任何事情的模型。这只是我们以多种语言发布的一个教育模块，这对我们的独行旅行者来说非常有帮助。我团队的部分工作不仅是建立隐形防御，而且还通过教育和信息传递预先建立信任和信任感。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>说得很好。我不得不说，你提到你是五个孩子的母亲。我不得不说，我认为当你告诉你的孩子他们能做什么和不能做什么时，你的立场非常坚实，因为你有这么多的数据和丰富的经验，而当我说一些话时，他们就像，“嗯，你怎么知道？”你可以说：“好吧，相信我；我每年进行 7000 万笔交易，我知道发生了什么。”</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>并且不断成长。是的。顺便说一句，我很高兴与您的孩子交谈。任何时候。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>是的，那就太好了。我会带你去解决这个问题。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong>关于你的测量，我认为很有趣的一件事，也许回过头来谈一下。您也提到了一些积极的指标。所以我认为这有点诱人，我认为即使在这次谈话中我们也已经这样做了，我们是在向负面方向滴定。这就是新闻的普遍问题——坏消息可以提高报纸销量。嗯，我认为在这次谈话的过程中，我们已经转向了这一点。但我认为你提到的一些指标对他们来说有更积极的影响，不是吗？</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>是的，绝对如此。这是我们过去几年的顿悟，因为任何类型的机器学习模型在有大量数据可供学习时通常都会表现良好。在此类案例中，在 7000 万多次出行中，当其中的 0.1% 甚至导致了报告，而其中的一小部分导致了有人被驱逐的实际事件时，几乎没有什么可以解决的。因此，这些模型需要时间才能成熟。当然，随着技术的发展，情况会变得更好，但我们意识到我们拥有更多关于良好用户行为的数据。</p><p>我们有更多的用户实际进来，提前几个月预订住宿；他们可能会准时入住，让房源比他们发现时更好，与房东和房客沟通，留下诚实的评价。因此，如果我们真的能够翻转开关，虽然我们需要继续寻找异常现象、趋势和不良行为者，但如果我们能够真正善于了解什么是良好行为，同时确保我们也在衡量在我们如何收集和使用这些数据方面存在潜在的偏见或歧视以及隐私合规性，那么当某些事情看起来确实有风险时，这可以非常有效地通知我们。例如，如果一个帐户通常是从美国访问的，[并且]突然我们看到该 IP 现在正在从菲律宾访问，感觉就像“哦，这是一个帐户接管”。但如果这是一个经常环游世界的好用户，也许这不是一个帐户接管，并且良好的用户行为中有历史记录，可以让我们更聪明地了解“正常情况是什么样子，异常是什么样子的？”不是广泛的，而是非常具体的，基于用户细分。</p><p>所以这不是什么新鲜事，但我认为我们有时倾向于真正了解不良行为是什么样子并善于检测它，而不是补充异常行为与正常行为的样子。</p><p><strong>谢尔文·霍达班德：</strong>是的。您在一个真正不断发展的领域拥有如此丰富的见解和信息。我的意思是，这不像典型的协同过滤情况，“像你这样的用户也买了这个”。我的意思是，在匹配方面还有很多事情要做。这一定是一个非常有趣且值得您关注的问题。</p><p><strong>纳巴·班纳吉：</strong>是的。它要求我们摆脱信任和安全的束缚，与我们的搜索、相关性和个性化团队密切合作，因为我们的工作——与我以前在电子商务工作时的工作不同——不仅仅是进行协作过滤并说，“像你这样的人买了这个，所以你应该买这个，”或者，“你去了巴黎，所以也许接下来你想去罗马。”</p><p>这是关于……这次你和家人一起旅行。你有小孩；您可能需要日托服务，我们知道该房东提供日托服务，并且这个位置可能非常适合您。或者同一个客户可能独自旅行，也许我们需要提供不同的建议。将这些信任和安全信号嵌入到我们的搜索相关性算法中，可以非常有效地将正确的人与正确的列表相匹配。</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham：</strong> Naba，你并不是从 Airbnb 开始的。告诉我们一些你是如何到达那里的。您提到了沃尔玛和那里的一些背景，但您是如何最终担任目前的职位的？</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong>我是家里第一位女工程师。我父亲抓住了我的机会，对我说：“你很好奇。你是一个永远的学习者。你想做工程吗？”当时我不知道什么是工程学，但我还是报名了，并成为我家里第一位女工程师。</p><p>我曾在塔塔咨询服务公司工作，然后加入 Cognizant，通过 Cognizant 来到美国，并在 AAA 工作了一段时间。我会继续从事不同的项目和不同的工作，这将帮助我学习全新的东西。</p><p>沃尔玛发生在2006年左右。我被要求在沃尔玛从事供应链方面的工作，如果你想在一家公司学习供应链，那可能就是你应该去的公司。当我做供应链的时候，我每年都承担越来越大的责任和项目，直到我发现自己从沃尔玛领导几乎所有的供应链团队去山姆会员店，这是沃尔玛的一部分——领导所有的供应链团队。产品、前端、购物车、结帐、营销和定价，这是我以前从未做过的。但这让我有机会获得全面的经验，了解大型零售商的后端如何运作，以及前端客户体验如何运作。</p><p>山姆会员店结束后，我被要求领导搜索工作。就在那时，我开始对机器学习和人工智能运行的世界真正感兴趣，而搜索对我来说是一个很好的着陆点。有趣的是，我在麻省理工学院修了一门课程，学习人工智能和机器学习的应用，这给了我承担搜索工作的勇气。</p><p>从那时起，差不多 13 年后，Airbnb 在沃尔玛诞生了。我对旅游业和这个市场非常好奇，它与我在沃尔玛所做的任何事情都非常不同。所以这里的主题是，我总是倾向于一些能够帮助我利用我所拥有的技能的东西，然后利用我的好奇心和学习去做一些全新的事情，并在我前进的过程中增强自己。这就是我的背景。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong> Naba，我们现在有一个部分，我们会问您一系列快速问题，然后告诉我们您想到的第一件事。您最自豪的 AI/ML 时刻是什么？</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong>你要求我在不同的球队之间进行选择，这对我的职业生涯来说是限制。但我要说的是，我们在政党检测和政党风险降低方面所做的工作是开创性的，业内没有其他人像我们一样做到这一点，所以这对我来说是一个非常自豪的时刻。但我为我所有的团队感到自豪，郑重声明。</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh：</strong>这是一个很好的答案。您对人工智能有何担忧？</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee：</strong>令我担心的是它的威力有多大。当 [OpenAI 首席执行官] Sam Altman 来到 Airbnb 时，我们有机会近距离亲眼见到他。 And just how fast this technology is improving and how much capability it has … I worry about it falling into the wrong hands. I worry that while my team has this technology, the fraudsters have this technology too, and so I worry about, if today we are worried about fake IDs and fake spam messages being sent to our hosts and guests, how much more advanced this technology is going to get and how much more difficult it is going to get for us to detect the good from the bad. And I think it&#39;ll be AI to the rescue as well in detecting fake AI.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Your favorite activity that involves no technology?</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> Painting with watercolors. I love painting nature. And so paper, watercolors, and just peace and tranquility, no technology, is my favorite thing to do. And of course hugging my kids and spending time with them just listening to their day, trying to make them not be on their cellphones while they talk to me. Those two.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Very well said. The first career you wanted: What did you want to be when you grew up?</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> I wanted to be a teacher. I come from a family of teachers, and I feel so much joy when I&#39;m seeing someone&#39;s eyes light up with the gift of knowledge. I am a forever learner. Every job that I take has been completely different from my previous job; it&#39;s because I love to learn. And so, yeah, that&#39;s what I wanted to be.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And you probably do a fair amount of teaching in your current role anyway.</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> I do a lot of mentoring.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> You&#39;ve taught us quite a lot.</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> Thank you, thank you. I do do a lot of mentoring, because I feel like if someone else can see me do what I do, that will make them feel that they can do it too. So if I can just do that, that&#39;s my life&#39;s mission accomplished.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What&#39;s your greatest wish for AI in the future?</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> My greatest wish for the world, actually, is to not be so afraid; to give it a chance. Because I think sometimes our fear of the bad holds us from embracing the good. There is so much wasted effort that goes into activities that should be automated through AI — so many patients who are not getting treatment; so many companies that probably need help and need so much funding to stand up basic things that can be done by AI; so many countries, probably, who are underdeveloped [but could] get so much advantage. I know that when it falls into the wrong hands, it can be used for bad, but the world has more good people than bad people, and I believe in the power of us using AI for good — using our collective goodness.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I think everyone will probably resonate with your idea that the world is better than it is bad. We do tend to hear most of the negative stories, but it&#39;s refreshing to hear how, one, how much attention you&#39;re paying to try and to prevent those, but also to hear something about the good stories too that your platform enables. Thank you for taking the time to talk with us today. We&#39;ve enjoyed it.</p><p> <strong>Naba Banerjee:</strong> Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Shervin.

The ubiquitous corporate practice of repurchasing shares has been the focus of much political and media scrutiny. The federal Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 included a 1% excise tax on repurchases (which President Biden has proposed increasing to 4% in his 2024 budget). In addition, senior Democrats have shown interest in barring executives from selling shares for three years after a repurchase, the federal government has suggested that companies that give up buybacks will receive preferential treatment, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed a significant increase in the extent and frequency of repurchase reporting.</p><p> The debate on the economic consequences of stock buybacks has so far tended to focus on small samples or cherry-picked examples. Given that thousands of companies repurchase their shares each year, and aggregate repurchases have exceeded $500 billion annually for the past five years, we decided that a large-sample study of repurchasing behavior was warranted. Our study, published in the journal <cite>Financial Management</cite> , outlines the benefits of the practice, as stated by its proponents, and provides evidence that casts doubt on the alleged costs cited by its critics.</p><p></p><p> Critics of buybacks typically make three arguments against the practice. First, they claim that share repurchases enable companies to manipulate the market either by increasing the demand for — and therefore the price of — shares or by tricking naive investors by inflating earnings per share (EPS). Second, they allege that share repurchases enable insiders to benefit through compensation contracts or the sale of shares at inflated prices. And lastly, critics charge that share repurchases crowd out investment and thus sacrifice innovation and long-term economic growth.</p><p> Meanwhile, those who support or engage in stock buybacks offer several justifications for the practice. First, payouts to shareholders align manager and shareholder incentives by reducing the potential misuse of free cash flow. Second, using repurchases instead of or in addition to dividends gives corporations flexibility in the amount of cash returned to shareholders, the ability to award repurchased shares to employees as equity compensation, a modest tax advantage to shareholders (less pronounced since the 2003 dividend tax cut), and the ability to signal the company&#39;s good prospects to the market. Finally, share repurchases represent well-disclosed and regulated arm&#39;s length transactions at current market prices between willing participants.</p><p> Given the drive to regulate share repurchases, we would expect evidence of their drawbacks to be observable in public data. To test this, we documented trends in repurchases and compared trading volume, share price performance, CEO pay, and corporate financial activities (evidenced by investment and profitability) of companies that do and do not repurchase shares. We segmented the businesses that repurchased shares in two ways: (1) small positive versus large positive repurchase amounts (defined as below versus above median values), and (2) frequent versus infrequent repurchasers (defined as companies that repurchase in one or two quarters as opposed to three or four quarters of the year).</p><p> Our large-sample evidence on thousands of US exchange-listed companies over the past three decades shows that repurchases in the US are a mainstream corporate financial activity that returns several hundred billion dollars of capital to shareholders annually. At an aggregate level, we found that this activity neither creates nor destroys much wealth (that is, it does not produce significant changes in share price). In addition, while repurchases are associated with higher past profitability, they are not associated with excessive CEO pay or underinvestment.</p><p> Trends in aggregate repurchasing activity over time indicate that while repurchases have quickly grown in value, much of the growth can be attributed to inflation and increases in market capitalization. In addition, repurchases are now similar in size to dividends and have not grown faster than dividends for quite some time. However, unlike dividends, repurchases drop precipitously (and temporarily) in times of corporate stress, indicating that they do in fact provide companies with the aforementioned benefit of payout flexibility.</p><p></p><h3> A Closer Look at the Data</h3><p> Through our analysis, we were able to systematically address each of the stated criticisms of stock buybacks.</p><p> First, do companies use share repurchases to manipulate the market by creating excess demand to drive up stock prices? If they do, companies that repurchase shares should have higher trading volumes than those that do not. But average trading volumes have largely remained quite similar for all listed companies, regardless of whether or how often they repurchase shares. In fact, in recent years, the trading volumes for companies that do not repurchase shares have greatly exceeded those of repurchasing companies, suggesting that any excess volume arising from repurchases is dwarfed by other forces.</p><p> If naive investors are tricked into buying shares of companies that engage in repurchasing behavior because of the resulting EPS inflation, we should observe short-term price bumps followed by poor long-term performance. However, regardless of whether or how intensely and frequently companies repurchased shares, we found no evidence that companies significantly outperformed in the quarters with repurchases. While we did find some marginal evidence that companies that intensely repurchase do outperform slightly in the quarter after repurchases, we found no evidence of future reversals in the short or long terms. This pattern of outperformance is more consistent with companies using repurchases to signal undervaluation — a benefit to investors — rather than to manipulate the market.</p><p></p><p> The second critique is that repurchases allow insiders to unfairly profit. If share repurchases as rent-seeking behavior by insiders were a common, systematic abuse, CEOs whose companies buy back shares would receive abnormally high pay, including salary, bonuses, and the value of equity awards. Using a model-generated measure of excess pay that has been vetted in earlier academic literature, we estimate that CEOs of companies that make large positive repurchases earn only $51,000 more than CEOs of companies that do not repurchase shares — a statistically and economically insignificant amount of excess pay. The difference is even smaller — $4,000 — when we compare CEOs of companies that repurchase frequently with those that do not repurchase. These differences are economically tiny in relation to the average CEO&#39;s pay of several million dollars. Surprisingly, CEOs of companies that repurchase infrequently or repurchase small positive amounts earn the least excess pay, less than even the CEOs of non-repurchasing companies. None of this evidence suggests that companies use repurchases to boost CEO pay.</p><p> The third and final critique is that repurchases reduce companies&#39; ability to take advantage of investment opportunities, thereby sacrificing innovation and economic growth. We found that companies that do not repurchase shares invest more but are significantly less profitable than those that do repurchase shares. The companies that repurchase frequently and in large amounts are highly profitable and have steadily made investments in the past, and they continue to make large investments and, at the same time, return capital to shareholders. This suggests that profitable companies repurchase shares while maintaining a steady level of investment, whereas less profitable or loss-making companies do not (or maybe cannot) repurchase shares but are more investment-intensive in the hope of becoming profitable. While there might be isolated examples of poorly governed companies that choose to avoid profitable investments and instead return capital to willing shareholders, it is hard to see how directives encouraging or incentivizing such poorly run companies to retain cash would lead them to make good investments.</p><p> Potential stakeholders who may be affected by repurchase regulations include managers, other employees, shareholders, governments, and society at large. If a company is profitable, a CEO can pay excess cash out to shareholders in the form of buybacks or dividends, keep the money on their balance sheets, or invest in new projects. A small tax on share repurchases may not change corporate behavior significantly and might raise a small amount of revenue for the government. But if the tax rate grows high enough, companies will choose to not buy back shares and instead pay out exclusively via dividends or retain cash. In that case, the government raises no revenue but implements a de facto ban on share repurchases.</p><h3> How a Buyback Ban Could Backfire</h3><p> If a company were to switch to only paying out dividends, shareholders would lose the ability to choose whether to receive a cash payout and could face negative tax ramifications, given that dividends are taxed as income while capital gains are often taxed at a lower rate, and only when gains are realized. In addition, the company would lose important flexibility in difficult times, because cutting dividends is punished more by the market than cutting repurchases.</p><p></p><p> However, the move to restrict stock buybacks seems intended not to motivate companies to shift to paying back shareholders through dividends but to invest more in the business. There is evidence that retained cash is correlated with CEOs making value-destroying decisions, such as pursuing empire-building mergers, accruing personal expenses, or funding pet projects. It seems implausible that restrictions on share repurchases would induce CEOs of poorly governed companies to invest in value-enhancing projects that they otherwise would not have been funding.</p><p></p><p> From an employee standpoint, there is some evidence that labor unions are able to negotiate more successfully if their employers have excess cash, but there is plenty of evidence that constraints on a company&#39;s flexibility to raise and distribute capital is bad for employees, especially during downturns. Empire-building mergers can also be bad for employees, given that M&amp;As often result in the employees of the acquisition target being laid off and employees of the acquiring company being misallocated. In addition, some repurchased shares are reissued to employees, making any actions that are bad for shareholders also bad for stockholding employees.</p><p> Overall, our results show an absence of correlation between share repurchases and price manipulation, return reversals, excess CEO compensation, and underinvestment, which makes it highly implausible that economically significant causal effects of share repurchases still underlie the data. Corporations lose flexibility if they have to rely only on dividends, and evidence shows that poorly governed CEOs who retain cash often spend it on value-destroying mergers, expenses, or pet projects. It is implausible that policies designed to reduce repurchases will also reduce alleged but unobserved malpractices without imposing costs on US public companies and other stakeholders.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-case-against-restricting-stock-buybacks/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Are You Ready for the Next Supply Disruption?</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/are-you-ready-for-the-next-supply-disruption/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/video/are-you-ready-for-the-next-supply-disruption/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 13 Jul 2023 13:46:34 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[M.

But it&#39;s possible to have a high-performing, healthy workplace culture in a hybrid workplace, with flexibility in when and where people work. It just needs to be managed differently.</p><p> That was the message of Future Forum&#39;s Brian Elliott, who presented on a panel with N. Sharon Hill of the George Washington University School of Business and Julie Dervin of Atlassian during <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/series/work-23-the-big-shift/">Work/23</a> , an <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> symposium held in May 2023.</p><p> Elliott said that 93% of the 10,243 knowledge workers his company polled said they want flexibility in when they work. Those who were given some choice, he said, had <a href="https://futureforum.com/research/future-forum-pulse-winter-2022-2023-snapshot/">productivity scores 39% higher</a> than those who were not. Those with some flexibility about <em>where</em> they work also scored higher (8%).</p><p></p><p> Finding an equilibrium between employees&#39; desire for flexibility and an organization&#39;s strategic goals requires a reexamination of the kinds of work that need to be done in person. It also may require different work configurations for different groups within the same organization, and it certainly requires different ways of benchmarking the work employees accomplish.</p><p> Attendees had more questions for the presenters than there was time for, and Elliott agreed to answer some after the event. (Questions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity.)</p><h6> How do you measure productivity? Most workers say they are more productive working from home and on their own schedule, but are they really?</h6><p> Here&#39;s a heretical take: We need to stop trying to measure productivity in knowledge work and focus all that time and energy on measuring outcomes.</p><p> Productivity metrics take outputs (emails sent, cases closed) and divide them by inputs (hours active), and the better ones adjust for quality (cases reopened). That can work, somewhat, for rote, routine tasks, which are what get automated over time. But also, those metrics can be gamed, and people will game them — up to and including buying <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHBQQVG">mouse jigglers</a> . As Dominic Price of Atlassian has <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/the-problem-with-productivity-metrics">written</a> , “Productivity has always been a good way to measure the impact of machines and capital. It&#39;s just never been a good way to measure the impact of <em>humans</em> .”</p><p> At Future Forum, we&#39;ve ventured into this; we compared populations with and without flexibility to see that those with location flexibility report higher productivity scores, and those with schedule flexibility have an even bigger advantage. There are also academic studies by Stanford&#39;s <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30292">Nick Bloom</a> , HBS&#39;s <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30292">Raj Choudhury</a> , and others that show the same thing.</p><p> But it&#39;s an odd question in that we didn&#39;t ask it when people were in the office. We simply assumed that because people were present, they were doing something productive. We all know that&#39;s not accurate.</p><p> Instead, let&#39;s skip the whole mess and take the time to get clear on our organization&#39;s objectives and key results (OKRs), and do it in a way that those can cascade down by business unit and function, and to the team level. From the team level, much can be taken to the individual level to find the individual&#39;s impact both in terms of what they did and how they were as a teammate.</p><p> Assessing people on the impact they have on a team&#39;s goals is harder but will take us a lot further than installing more productivity metrics that measure their inputs and outputs.</p><h6> Random collisions seem to be key in driving innovation. How do you promote serendipity in terms of making connections across teams?</h6><p> Connections are an essential part of employee engagement and retention, but the connection to innovation is at best spurious. <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=991">Study</a> after <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4093796">study</a> has shown that what really enables innovation is psychological safety.</p><p> In research we conducted in 2021, Future Forum found that location (whether fully onsite, hybrid, or fully remote) had little to no correlation to team innovation. Instead, what <em>did</em> matter were factors like whether people felt they could ask questions and whether teams were willing to take risks — that is, whether they felt psychological safety.</p><p> Building connections is important, but we should do it intentionally in organizations instead of relying on random chance. Here are three ways you can do this:</p><p> <strong>1. Intentional cross-team connections.</strong> Programs like open brown-bag lunches where a rotating cast of internal experts present or host an “ask me anything session,” bringing leaders from other functions into your quarterly planning cycles, and creating public channels in Slack or Teams for sharing insights based on topics (like AI) can go a long way.</p><p> <strong>2. Leverage tools to build connections.</strong> Products like Donut, an app for Slack or Teams that pairs up individuals across teams programmatically, help ensure that everyone gets connected, not just those who work on the same floor or in the same building.</p><p> <strong>3. Help new employees build a network.</strong> One of the big challenges of the past few years is that too many companies hired people without rethinking how they build connections and get to understand the culture. One of my favorite tips comes from Genpact in Europe, where new employees are given six people to meet outside their team, either in person or at a virtual coffee, and each of those is supposed to provide two to three more contacts.</p><p> Investing in new tools and processes can also be a big boost. Think about processes like <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/12/using-brainwriting-for-rapid-idea-generation/">brainwriting</a> before a brainstorming session: Allowing people the heads-down space to think about some research results or a problem, write out their thoughts ahead of time, and then share with the group at the same time brings out more new ideas. It also lowers the odds of groupthink.</p><p></p><h6> How can you communicate an expectation that people should come into the office one or two days a week in a way that is inspiring and inclusive, and not forceful and dictatory?</h6><p> The last two years are littered with companies that declared that three days a week in person is the answer and saw 1.5 days a week as an average. This hides the fact that there&#39;s typically a more junior group of employees coming in two or three days a week, while more senior employees are coming in less often.</p><p> Repeating the policy doesn&#39;t work, and threatening to fire people who don&#39;t come in more often is unrealistic and breeds resentment. Leadership knows that it&#39;s some of the more experienced, critical talent that&#39;s coming in less often. The junior staff knows this too.</p><p> Instead, what we&#39;ve seen work is focusing on helping teams figure out their own rhythms through team-level agreements. The needs of a sales team and an engineering team, for instance, are different. The sales team might end up mandating two days a week that are default days in the office, and stacking those days with specific activities that are more “heads-up” than heads-down, such as training sessions, mentoring hours, and one-on-ones. The engineering team, on the other hand, might end up with one week of the month in person for planning, lunches together, and demo days.</p><p> Encouraging senior staff to come in at least one day a week for mentoring sessions, to be available for training, and for coffee with junior staff goes a lot further than simply telling them to show up.</p><p> The other critical element is that coming to the office can&#39;t be consistently worse than working at home. People don&#39;t want free lunch all the time, they want a place for team meetings, the ability to find a quiet spot for customer calls, and Wi-Fi that works. For a large number of companies, that requires redesigning the workspace.</p><h6> What should managers do to avoid having flexible work perpetuate or even exaggerate existing biases in the workplace? Being “out of sight, out of mind” is a real concern.</h6><p> Proximity bias and the chances of presenteeism leading to better opportunities as well as rewards is a real risk. We need to create a level playing field, and that starts with training managers and leaders to assess team and individual performance on the outcomes they generate, not the inputs (hours in the office, speed of response, being always-on). Leaders and their people partners need to look not only at the promotion and rewards cycle but also at their talent development pipeline and who&#39;s getting the new, shiny projects.</p><p> Working with the Slack executive team, we set a rule that all of the senior executives&#39; regular reviews — such as the CMO&#39;s weekly review of new project proposals — be done entirely virtually. That helped not only the usual challenges of people not hearing those at the other end of the room but also the pressure to be “in the room where it happens” for those meetings, which more junior staff might attend only once or twice a year.</p><h6> Many companies and industries outside of tech have a split between knowledge workers and those who need to be present in person to do their job (such as retail and manufacturing). How would you recommend positioning flexibility so as not to create an unfair dual standard?</h6><p> The differences between desk (office) workers and deskless (or front-line) workers extend far beyond the ability to work remotely: They include pay, benefits, facilities, training, and more.</p><p> The talent shortage in deskless workers is a massive challenge for many companies. But I don&#39;t think the answer is to force desk workers back into offices full-time. That doesn&#39;t really solve any issues for deskless workers.</p><p> The answer here is investing in the specific needs of deskless workers. According to <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/why-deskless-workers-are-leaving-and-how-to-win-them-back">research by Boston Consulting Group</a> , schedule flexibility and choice are top factors in talent retention. Leaders are investing in programs like the ability to swap shifts and having multiple types of schedules for call center workers. Neiman Marcus Group reduced turnover by 20% by offering sales associates flexibility in choice of stores and departments, as well as hours.</p><h6> I&#39;m at a startup. In a budding company, management focuses a lot on work culture as they grow. How does a startup, or any enterprise for that matter, build culture while allowing a remote or hybrid model?</h6><p> I&#39;m a strong believer that culture is built regardless of where you are located, the slogans on the wall, or the quality of the happy hours. Culture gets built based on the everyday experiences your employees have and the decisions you make: what you prioritize as a company, how you treat your customers and employees, what projects you resource, and whom you reward.</p><p></p><p> That said, there are a set of practices that I&#39;ve seen used that really help build a solid foundation. Here are three of them:</p><p></p><p> First, digital-first doesn&#39;t mean “never in person.” Getting people together, even if widely distributed, is an important part of building culture. For teams, I&#39;d recommend — at least quarterly — a few days focused primarily on team building, socialization, and connection. As a startup grows, this often goes from everyone quarterly to teams quarterly and everyone once a year.</p><p> Second, get clarity on how you work together, and share more about yourself. Your <a href="https://futureforum.com/2022/06/23/team-level-agreements/">team-level agreement</a> shouldn&#39;t just focus on how often people are together, it should also get into how you communicate, how you make decisions, and more. Sharing tools like <a href="https://futureforum.com/2022/07/15/personal-user-manual/">personal user manuals</a> can also go a long way toward establishing a culture of trust.</p><p> And third, create transparency at work. One of the key factors that drive culture is leadership communication, and as a company scales, it&#39;s important to remain transparent while putting in place guardrails. What topics matter to your company and mission most? How do we interact with one another?

I want to give everyone some kind of assurance, but I don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going to happen in six months either. What can I do?”</p><p> If you&#39;ve found yourself in a similar situation recently, you&#39;re not alone. Almost every people leader I&#39;ve met with over the past year has asked me some version of this question. And in a recent study, 89% of HR leaders shared that their teams have voiced concerns about <a href="https://www.humu.com/blog/the-toll-of-workplace-anxiety-and-what-to-do-about-it">job security, leadership changes, or reorgs</a> .</p><p> When uncertainty is high, managers should aim to make work a place of stability rather than another source of stress. “The most effective managers clearly communicate that they care about the people on their team,” explained Molly Sands, head of practices for Atlassian&#39;s Team Anywhere. “Research shows that what managers of top-performing teams consistently do differently is to make their reports <a href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/601872ae12d42e2264ff9ac4/62d6d89b1037a1bb82393638_Infographic _ Actions that drive great management.pdf">feel valued and comfortable</a> .”</p><p></p><p> How can you offer assurance when a lot of big decisions — and broader economic conditions — are outside of your control? It may seem almost impossible, but it&#39;s not. Here are seven ways managers can support their teams during turbulent times without making promises they can&#39;t keep.</p><p> <strong>Help each employee work toward their dream job.</strong> You can&#39;t always guarantee someone a promotion (or, unfortunately, even job stability), but you can commit to giving your employees the kinds of valuable learning opportunities that will help them no matter what comes next.</p><p> To surface the experiences or projects your team members would be excited to take on, ask them to show you a job posting for a role they&#39;d be thrilled to have in three to five years. Walk through the listed responsibilities together, and pinpoint any for which they think they lack the skills or compelling experience. Then commit to helping them grow in these areas by offering them relevant tasks or projects.</p><p> It can also be useful to make career chats a habit. Every six weeks, schedule 30 minutes with each of your reports to ask questions like these:</p><ul><li> What kinds of projects or tasks do you enjoy most?</li><li> What parts of your current responsibilities do you find energizing?</li><li> Do you feel like you&#39;re learning and growing in your role?</li><li> Are there skills you&#39;re looking to grow in the future?</li></ul><p> Make it a point to create or offer them relevant opportunities based on these conversations.</p><p> <strong>Cocreate a medium-term mission with your team.</strong> When faced with uncertainty or frequently shifting priorities, we often feel stuck or like we have little to show for all the effort we&#39;re putting in. This sense of helplessness can lead to apathy and disengagement. In fact, research my team at Humu conducted in February on the impact of continued uncertainty showed that roughly 40% of <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/web-assets-humu/eBooks/FY24 Q1 eBook - Uncertainty/eBook_Uncertainty_01.pdf">employees felt less ambitious</a> than they did a year earlier.</p><p> To reenergize your team members, bring them together to define and work toward a shared three-month goal. Looking three months out can create a longer-term sense of stability for your people, but it&#39;s a short enough time period that, even if things shift around you, you likely won&#39;t have to change your mission. For example, a marketing team might aim to increase website traffic by 25% over the next quarter, or run experiments on how to more quickly share information and make decisions. As Jamie Woolf and Heidi Rosenfelder, founders of Creativity Partners, advise, “To better enlist your team in the cocreation of the future, try asking questions like &#39;What new sources of profit can replace dwindling ones?&#39; or &#39;What can we do to break down silos within our team?&#39;”</p><p></p><p> <strong>Help your team achieve wins within two weeks.</strong> Quickly boost your team members&#39; sense of progress by focusing them on what they <em>can</em> control and giving each of them a specific task they can cross off within a week or two. Start by dividing your medium-term mission or longer-term goals into mini-milestones, and track and celebrate each one as it&#39;s achieved.</p><p> Sarah, an engineering manager, recently split an ambitious product launch into a series of specific features and updates and then assigned her reports individual tasks from the list. She also set up a 15-minute team check-in at the end of each week to celebrate what they had achieved and track the group&#39;s collective progress toward their shared goal.</p><p> <strong>Create clarity when you can.</strong> Thoughtful explanations in tough situations are critical to earning trust and reducing anxiety. The next time you have an update to share, prepare to walk through the story of how the decision was made, and think through any concerns or questions that might come up. Plan how you&#39;ll address each one. If you&#39;re unsure of what to say, ask other leaders or HR for recommendations. When you do share the decision with your team members, encourage them to ask clarifying questions.</p><p> It&#39;s also important for managers to speak to their own emotions — while avoiding emotionally processing news in front of their team. “You should say, &#39;I am disappointed about the results this quarter,&#39; but not, &#39;I am so disappointed by the results. I am so terrified we are all going to lose our jobs. I don&#39;t know what to do,&#39;” Sands suggested. “Transparency doesn&#39;t mean you have to share everything you feel or are concerned about.”</p><p></p><p> You can also run a clarity audit by talking with your team about a recent decision that affected them (such as a new product road map or a change in the expense policy). In your next series of one-on-one meetings, ask the following questions:</p><ul><li> How and when did you learn about this decision?</li><li> Is anything unclear?</li><li> What can I do differently the next time I&#39;m communicating a change with the team?</li></ul><p> These conversations can help you identify how to improve transparency — and make it clear to employees that you&#39;re doing your best to keep them up to date.</p><p> <strong>Provide context when you can&#39;t create clarity.</strong> Managers tend to stay quiet until they can share a concrete decision. But a lack of communication is still a form of communication — and it usually breeds mistrust and gossip.</p><p></p><p> To avoid misunderstandings, explain why you can&#39;t offer more details, and aim to provide a timeline for when you expect to have more information. For example, you might say something along the lines of “I haven&#39;t heard back on what changes will be made to the sales pitch. I&#39;m hoping to have more to share with you in a week or so, but I wanted to be as transparent as possible with where we are right now.”</p><p> <strong>Encourage your team to benefit from benefits.</strong> Studies show that up to 80% of employees are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2019/07/02/only-half-of-employees-understand-their-benefits-heres-what-hr-leaders-can-do-about-it/?sh=a4a1a578133c">confused about the benefits</a> their company provides. When budgets shrink, it can be an uphill battle to design and fund new ways to support your team. You might be surprised at how much you can boost morale simply by making employees aware of what already exists. For example, though my former employer offered women returning from maternity leave the option to work part time for their first month back, many expectant mothers were unaware of this policy. After Sands, then a product leader at Humu, flagged this option on a companywide Slack channel, several women (including me) took advantage of it and expressed gratitude for the policy.</p><p> Review your company handbook, or schedule a quick meeting with HR for a refresher. In an upcoming team meeting, give a brief overview of your organization&#39;s benefits, and encourage your team members to take full advantage of them. You might want to specifically highlight mental health benefits, vacation policies, or flexible work options. Start by saying something like “I know it&#39;s been a stressful time and uncertainty is high, so I want to highlight a few programs and benefits our company offers that might help you feel better.”</p><p> <strong>Help your team say no.</strong> Preserve your team&#39;s mental health by stepping in to protect their time. Set clear and reasonable expectations, and back your reports when they turn down nonurgent requests.</p><p></p><p> You can also look for ways to get more visibility into everything they&#39;re being asked to do — and aim to set up friendly barriers. For example, when I learned that my team was being overwhelmed with requests from sales, I created a short form and advised my reports to direct all of the requesters to complete it in order to start the process. This served three functions: (1) It allowed me to better understand what my team was being pulled into, (2) I could help my reports prioritize or say no as necessary, and (3) it reduced the number of requests, because few people actually filled out the form.</p><p></p><p> Uncertainty breeds anxiety, and although managers can&#39;t snap their fingers and magically make everything fall perfectly into place, they can take steps to help their teams feel more empowered, supported, and able to succeed. Offering team members personally meaningful growth opportunities and helping them achieve quick wins can restore their sense of control and motivation. Creating transparency around changes and updates — or explaining why a decision has not yet been announced — can restore employee trust. And helping people invest in their well-being and set healthy boundaries can make it easier for them to weather workplace storms.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-support-your-team-when-uncertainty-is-high/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Improve Key Performance Indicators With AI</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/improve-key-performance-indicators-with-ai/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/improve-key-performance-indicators-with-ai/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 11 Jul 2023 11:00:38 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Michael Schrage, David Kiron, François Candelon, Shervin Khodabandeh, and Michael Chu. <p class="mt20"><strong>Michael Schrage</strong> is a research fellow with the MIT Sloan School of Management&#39;s Initiative on the Digital Economy.

In the spring of 2023, we fielded a global survey and subsequently analyzed records from 3,043 respondents representing more than 25 industries and 100 countries. We also interviewed 17 executives leading AI initiatives in a broad range of companies and industries, including financial services, media and entertainment, retail, travel and transportation, and life sciences.</p><p> Our research examines how managers and leaders use AI to enhance strategic measurement to advance strategic outcomes. It explores how organizations have adapted — and even generated new — KPIs with AI to define and deliver measurably better performance.</p></aside><p> Improving key performance indicators is a clear mandate for most organizations. According to our seventh annual <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/big-ideas/artificial-intelligence-business-strategy/">global executive AI survey</a> , 7 out of 10 respondents agree that enhancing KPIs — not just improving performance — is critical to their business success. As one executive notes, “We need to evolve our KPIs all the time so we don&#39;t run our business on legacy metrics.”</p><p> A growing number of companies now use AI — in a variety of ways — to accelerate that evolution. “I&#39;m very excited about what machine learning can do in terms of having our senior leaders move away from metrics that look backward to metrics that can look forward,” says Avinash Kaushik, chief strategy officer at digital marketing agency Croud and a former senior director of global strategic analytics at Google.</p><p></p><p> Early on at Lyft, engineers designed an algorithm to maximize revenue by matching driver supply and customer demand. “It looked at all the possible combinations of riders and drivers and picked the combination that — based on the ride being requested, where the driver was located, all of the system dynamics — would maximize revenue,” says Elizabeth Stone, former vice president of science at Lyft. Then, as data scientists began testing other objectives, something interesting emerged. One AI solution discovered that optimizing conversion rates — how often a user ordered a ride after opening the app — would, in turn, deliver more ride requests in the future. More ride requests ultimately mean more revenue. As a result of using AI, Lyft transformed its revenue KPI from one focused on ride and driver combinations to one that also focuses on optimizing conversion rates. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p> At Tokopedia (part of GoTo Group), one of Indonesia&#39;s largest marketplaces, AI sifts through petabytes of data to detect signals that are correlated with credibility and reliability. These are key considerations, given that 86.5% of its 14 million merchants — selling 1.8 billion products — are new entrepreneurs. Having more-credible merchants makes the marketplace more appealing, effective, and efficient. “They might have good products to sell, but they don&#39;t know how to manage their stock,” says Herman Widjaja, Tokopedia&#39;s CTO. “With AI, we connect our customers to the right product that is served <em>by the right merchants</em> that they want.” The company synthesized millions of possible signals into a scoring system that represents a new KPI around merchant quality.</p><p> While most respondents understand the need for enhanced KPIs, a clear majority currently rely on inadequate tools and technologies to manage their metrics. Even as machine learning algorithms and generative AI transform enterprise capabilities, human judgment remains the overwhelmingly dominant approach to KPI enhancement. Two-thirds of survey respondents affirm that managers make judgment calls when adjusting their organization&#39;s KPIs. While common, this approach often fails to yield the desired results: Barely a third of survey respondents relying only on human judgment see their KPIs improve.</p><p></p><p> In contrast, companies that use AI to inform their KPIs are far more likely to see improved metrics. Ninety percent of respondents who use AI to create new KPIs say they see their KPIs improve. These AI-informed KPIs offer business benefits and demonstrate new capabilities: They often lead to more efficiency and greater financial benefit and are more detailed, time sensitive, and aligned with organizational objectives. (See “Creating New KPIs With AI.”) We observe a growing awareness among executives that KPIs need to become smarter and more predictive. </p><div class="callout-highlight callout-highlight--transparent"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Creating New KPIs With AI</h4><p class="caption"> Of the 34% of organizations surveyed that use AI to create new KPIs, 90% see improvements. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/AI-BusinessStrategy_Article02_fig1-final.png" alt="Creating New KPIs With AI" /><br /></article></aside></div><p> All of the leaders we interviewed for our research voiced similar rationales for enhancing KPIs. As legacy metrics become static and outdated, their value as tools for defining and achieving organizational goals diminish. In fact, they become measurably less useful. Both individually and collectively, KPIs need to be updated and enhanced to ensure that they advance desired organizational outcomes. Improving performance without enhancing KPIs creates competitive risk. Companies that focus on — or align around — suboptimal measures are at a competitive disadvantage. Focusing on performance without a commensurate focus on its measure creates an inherent imbalance that can sabotage a company&#39;s efforts to compete effectively.</p><p> Based on our research — which includes results from a global survey of more than 3,000 managers and qualitative analysis of more than a dozen executive interviews — we have identified three ways to enhance strategic metrics with AI:</p><ul><li> <strong style="font-size:1.25em;">I</strong> mprove existing KPIs.</li><li> <strong style="font-size:1.25em;">C</strong> reate new KPIs.</li><li> <strong style="font-size:1.25em;">E</strong> stablish new relationships among KPIs.</li></ul><p> This article explains how this Improve-Create-Establish, or ICE, framework can help leaders and managers repurpose KPIs to make their people, processes, and technologies more effective. Our research shows that AI-enhanced KPIs are associated with strategically valuable business benefits, including increased efficiency, better alignment, and greater financial benefit. Integrating AI into the strategic measurement process has enormous implications for the future of capital allocation, customer engagement, employee experience, EBITDA, and every other executive metric.

We offer several practical steps on how to use AI to enhance their KPIs.</p><p></p><h3> Improve Existing KPIs With AI</h3><p> Companies that initially use AI to boost performance numbers tend to find that the technology creates opportunities to revisit and review key performance parameters.</p><h4> The Substitution Effect at Wayfair</h4><p> Wayfair&#39;s AI approach makes that case. While losing a sale may appear to be a straightforward measure, the online furniture retailer used AI to reexamine the fundamentals behind its lost-sales KPI. As CTO Fiona Tan recalls, “We used to think that if you lost the sale on a particular product, like a sofa, it was a loss to the company. But we started looking at the data and realized that 50% to 60% of the time, when we lose a sale it is because the customer bought something else in the same product category.”</p><p> This AI-enabled analysis allowed Wayfair to experiment with substitute offers based on customer concerns such as price points, shipment times, and other factors. Demand for these substitute products provided a new lens on what had been previously measured and interpreted as lost sales. Recognizing this “substitution effect” led Wayfair to adjust pricing across its entire sofa domain, revamp product configurations in its fulfillment centers, and reprioritize legacy KPIs.</p><p></p><p> At one level, Wayfair used AI to transform its legacy lost-sales KPI into a more valuable metric that differentiated truly lost sales from actual sales. But at another level, the AI behind this upgraded KPI also enabled more sweeping changes. Tan&#39;s team used the substitution effect to develop a “profit-awareness framework,” which changed the way the company interacted with customers. Wayfair&#39;s furniture recommendations began to factor in delivery times and shipment costs, as well as product incidents and product profitability, when making next-best offers. Explicitly measuring and incorporating the substitution effect reframed lost sales as sales opportunities and led to pricing shifts. This reframing consequently aligned product placement decisions with the needs and capacities of distribution centers and warehouses, which improved both employee and customer experiences.</p><p> Companies across the industry landscape are finding ways to use AI to improve existing KPIs. Some use AI to deepen their understanding of factors that drive KPI outcomes, whereas others use AI to identify and prioritize which KPIs deliver the most value to the organization. While our survey results suggest that most companies will satisfice around improving KPIs (that is, rely on human judgment), we also see companies recognizing that AI makes possible altogether new KPIs that can achieve, and drive, next-level performance.</p><h3> Create New KPIs</h3><p> In addition to improving existing performance metrics, AI offers the potential for managers to algorithmically discover and generate entirely new KPIs. While our survey shows that only 16% of respondents&#39; organizations use AI to generate new KPIs, 90% agree that their use of AI has measurably improved their KPIs.</p><p> For example, hunting for indicators that can help physicians preempt sudden cardiac death, which afflicts 300,000 people in the US every year, is an ongoing effort for physicians and researchers. These types of deaths come out of nowhere; doctors can&#39;t predict them, since patients don&#39;t present as high risk. It&#39;s an especially frustrating condition because there is a known effective treatment — installing a cardiac defibrillator — if doctors can identify at-risk patients in time. One of the researchers in this hunt, Ziad Obermeyer, a physician and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, is working with Region Halland Health System in Sweden whose electronic health record data can be linked to a variety of government data. He and his collaborators trained an algorithm to predict sudden cardiac death in the year after an electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed, using death certificates, and a variety of other data points taken from government records and electronic health records.</p><p> “The algorithm became quite good at predicting who&#39;s going to succumb to sudden cardiac death in the year after an ECG is taken. Every time someone gets an ECG, it generates a risk score that measures the probability the individual will die from sudden cardiac arrest,” says Obermeyer. That ECG score can also function just like a key performance indicator: With the score in hand, a doctor might observe how it changes if the patient is prescribed a medication such as a beta blocker or an ACE inhibitor. While the research is at a very early stage, it might one day empower doctors and patients to work together to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death — and identify new interventions that might decrease the risk. “Having the ability to turn these very complicated biological signals into indicators is very powerful,” Obermeyer says, “and I think that&#39;s going to be something that we&#39;ll see a lot more of, not just for sudden cardiac death but for diabetic complications and all sorts of other preventable, high-stakes conditions.”</p><p> Obermeyer&#39;s use of AI to create a new KPI for sudden cardiac death promises to improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance physicians&#39; sense of their own efficacy. Developing and discerning new key performance indicators with AI is an emergent phenomenon across the business landscape and among large companies we interviewed, such as DBS Bank, General Electric, General Motors, Sanofi, Schneider Electric, and Walmart. These companies are using AI to identify indicators of future performance at earlier and earlier stages of corporate activity. This capability facilitates better situational awareness and a more effective response to changing market conditions, among other benefits.</p><h3> Establish New Relationships Among KPIs</h3><p> No KPI is an island. Many executives we spoke with emphasized that better managing their business requires that they bring local KPIs together into a more integrated set of metrics. Executives across industries explicitly remarked on the inherent organizational and computational tensions between maximizing local KPIs and optimizing higher-level, more macro KPIs. As KPI features and parameters evolve, the importance of anticipating, modeling, and coordinating multiple KPI interactions with AI becomes more critical.</p><h4> DBS Bank Integrates Its KPIs With AI</h4><p> Singapore-based DBS Bank once relied on independent KPIs for each function touching different points along a customer journey. That is, for a given product, marketing would, for instance, have its own customer engagement metrics, product would have its own attrition metrics, finance would have its own revenue metrics, etc. Over the past three years, however, the multinational banking and financial services company has replaced that vertical model with a horizontal one. DBS created a value map that ties the use cases together into a single customer journey with outcomes in four categories: customer experience, employee experience, profitability, and risk. “We call it &#39;managing through journeys,&#39;” says Sameer Gupta, DBS&#39;s chief analytics officer. “Each customer journey would have multiple drivers, and each driver would in turn have multiple metrics to measure. You can imagine how quickly these scale, and it would be humanly impossible to optimize such a large number of drivers and metrics. AI is a force multiplier that gives us the ability to analyze large numbers of drivers and metrics and also identify those that need to be acted on now.”</p><p> In the new model, the outcome data is visible to cross-functional squads, whose members all have a stake in optimizing results in all four categories. “Everyone is looking at the same data, and everyone is accountable for the same outcome,” Gupta notes. The squads use experimentation, data analytics, customer immersion, and AI to continually review the factors driving different outcomes. In addition, they retain a sharp focus on choosing the correct metrics.</p><p> Establishing these interrelationships among their KPIs has been, in Gupta&#39;s words, “a fundamental shift.” He anticipates that AI will have an increasingly prominent role as the organization continues to coordinate its metrics in a drive toward continuous improvement. “We are starting to unpack to ask, &#39;Do we currently make that decision through data and AI enablement? Is there an opportunity to make it through data and AI enablement? If there is, how can we do it?&#39;” Gupta says. Discerning new relationships among KPIs with AI and other analytical techniques can yield new business opportunities, new insights, and a valuable set of data around which to manage organizational behaviors.</p><h3> Leadership Takeaways</h3><p> The future of strategic measurement belongs to smarter KPIs. Our research suggests, however, that few legacy organizations are strategically using AI to improve their KPIs. This makes both AI and KPIs undervalued assets. Leadership needs to invest accordingly. Using AI to improve KPIs, create new KPIs, and establish new relationships among KPIs creates an opportunity to capture measurably greater value. The ICE framework invites executive and boardroom discussions that should lead to management investment in improving strategic measurement.</p><p> Our research also emphasizes the need for leaders to align not only on which KPIs to pursue but, even more fundamentally, on the purpose of those KPIs. Will KPIs be primarily retrospective, or will they predictively lean into the future?</p><p> If the latter, organizations need road maps for improving existing KPIs; a commitment to exploration and experimentation around creating new KPIs; and a recognition that relationships among KPIs may matter as much as, if not more than, the individual KPIs themselves. Intelligent KPIs should not be primarily managed as independent performance silos; rather, their interdependencies and interrelationships must be understood and addressed. As our examples have shown, these shifts represent operational, organizational, and cultural challenges to leadership.</p><p> As has been the case with almost every successful AI initiative, KPIs, like the algorithms that comprise them, must be transparent and explainable. KPIs — organizationally, culturally, and operationally — cannot be seen as black boxes. They should be designed and deployed to be trusted. This cultural component should not be minimized or taken for granted. Otherwise, people at all levels of the organization will seek to game the metrics that guide them, ensuring organizational misalignment.</p><p></p><p> Underlying this new emphasis on AI and KPIs, and on strategic measurement more broadly, is an acknowledgment that quality KPIs depend on quality data. KPIs trained or supervised on biased, incomplete, and flawed data sets are likely to be biased, incomplete, and flawed. Data quality matters more wherever KPIs matter more. We see organizations committed to AI-driven KPIs becoming even more committed to cultivating data as an asset. They see investments in data reflected in KPI improvements.</p><p> Finally, as AI-influenced KPIs become more influential in the enterprise, their own performance will require new levels of monitoring and oversight. Leadership will need to be able to evaluate how well their KPIs are doing, individually and collectively. Are they the right KPIs for sustainable success? Are they appropriately anticipating the future? Are they making the right decisions — and helping humans make the right decisions — for achieving desired and desirable outcomes? Simply put, KPIs will require their own KPIs to help answer those important questions.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/improve-key-performance-indicators-with-ai/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The 10 Most Popular Articles in 2023 (So Far)</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-10-most-popular-articles-in-2023-so-far/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-10-most-popular-articles-in-2023-so-far/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 06 Jul 2023 11:00:48 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[MIT SMR Editors. ]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence]]></category><category><![CDATA[Corporate Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hybrid Workplace]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership Development]]></category><category><![CDATA[Remote Work]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership]]></category><category><![CDATA[Organizational Behavior]]></category><category><![CDATA[Talent Management]]></category><category><![CDATA[Workplace, Teams, & Culture]]></category><description><![CDATA[Three-plus years after COVID-19 interrupted office-based operations with a sudden transition to remote work, managing hybrid teams remains a pressing issue for leaders.

Each episode, we introduce you to someone innovating with AI. I&#39;m Sam Ransbotham, professor of analytics at Boston College. I&#39;m also the AI and business strategy guest editor at <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> .</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> And I&#39;m Shervin Khodabandeh, senior partner with BCG and one of the leaders of our AI business. Together, <cite>MIT SMR</cite> and BCG have been researching and publishing on AI since 2017, interviewing hundreds of practitioners and surveying thousands of companies on what it takes to build and to deploy and scale AI capabilities and really transform the way organizations operate.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Welcome. Today, Shervin and I are excited to be joined by David Hardoon, who holds several senior positions at the Aboitiz Group. David, thanks for joining us.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Thank you very much, Sam, Shervin.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Can you first tell us a bit about the Aboitiz Group? Where do you work?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> The Aboitiz Group is a 100-plus-year-old conglomerate that originated starting in Spain — Catalonia — and relocated to the Philippines. It started in the hemp business but is now quite diversified, from the main business — power generation and distribution across the Philippines — [to] financial services, cement, construction, utilities, [real] estate, airports, food, agriculture. We&#39;re now going through a transformation and becoming — I love this term, by the way — a techglomerate.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What is Aboitiz Data Innovation?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> About seven years ago, give or take, the bank started with all digitalization of the banking services. And what that had resulted in, as you would imagine, [was] a tremendous amount of data. The more you engage your consumers digitally, the more you have digital services — well, surprise, surprise — the more data you have.</p><p> And the question came as well, how are we really using it? Are we using it? What&#39;s the best way to put it to good use? And that question kind of also went beyond just the bank into the rest of the businesses, as you can imagine. Power has a lot of data; agriculture, airports, etc., have a lot of data.</p><p> We were born with a very on-point mandate: operationalizing data, operationalizing AI. Really, how do we put it to good use?</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What are some of these uses?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> I mean, there&#39;s the usual financial side, where we all learn from hyperpersonalization, financial crime. And don&#39;t get me wrong — that stuff … always gets me all excited. I spent a few good years in the financial regulator [space] here in Singapore.</p><p> But let me give you an oddity: cement, an industry that you wouldn&#39;t really associate with data or AI. We sat down with the CEO at the time, and we said, “Look, even in the world of cement, you have a lot of data.”</p><p> How can this work? So let me give you a little tidbit of how the world of cement works. And this is something that was new to me. So basically, it&#39;s like baking. I don&#39;t know if you bake, but it&#39;s like baking. It&#39;s basically, you have mixtures. You have these kind of formulas, and you end up with cement, which will have different types of properties. And these properties [are] what&#39;s absolutely critical depending on what you&#39;re planning to build, whether it&#39;s a mall, a high rise, a low rise, residential, etc., and so forth.</p><p> Having said that, as with baking, you kind of need to do a bit of trial and error. You need to try out these different mixtures to make sure it produces the right one. That results in operational overhead. It results in wastage. I mean, as with baking, you stick this stuff into kilns — literally, it&#39;s a furnace — to bake it. Using data, using the information that&#39;s coming from all the devices, the IoT, using AI, being able to actually tell the bakers or, in this case, the chemical engineers what is going to be the output of this mixture before they even start, while at the same time maintaining that quality control, which is absolutely crucial. Now this is, by the way, not just hypothetical. This is already operational for the past year in all the plants — about six plants in the Philippines — and results in operational efficiency, results in reduction in [the amount] of wastage, resulted in what I like to call quantifiable ESG [environmental, social, and governance]: a 35 kiloton reduction of CO <sub>2</sub> emissions. So that&#39;s a nice unusual example I like to give in terms of how data is used.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Well, I could tell you, Sam and I are going to love that. We&#39;re both chemical engineers.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Oh, well, there you go.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Actually, when you said baking, I did my Ph.D. in catalyst synthesis, so I spent a lot of my time baking various aluminosilicates to create catalysts. And you&#39;re completely right: You try all these things. Some work; some don&#39;t work. And had there been the ability for me to know ahead of time, I probably would have gotten my Ph.D. in a tenth of the time.</p><p> But seriously, this is quite interesting. Now, if you go from personalization and cyber and fraud, and you also have this example in baking cements, then we must believe that there is such a wide portfolio of things that you are considering. So tell us more about what makes it into that portfolio, because there is no end to what you could do. What are the kinds of things you get excited about?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> You&#39;re absolutely right. Being fortunate working in a conglomerate, you kind of wake up every day and discover something new. So there are kind of two dimensions to it. On the one hand — and I&#39;m going to go back to this term <em>operationalization</em> , operationalizing data and AI — it&#39;s stuff that has to make sense to the business. So revenue, operational efficiency, risk management. And then we have to look at the things around the corner. We have to experiment. But those may not be things that get immediately deployed. Like, effectively in agricultural builders, we have the animals; we have pigs, swine, and poultry. And as part of that process, we want to make sure that the animals have the best possible care provided to them. On an experimental side, we say, “OK, how can we use technology that&#39;s already available but may not have been put in exactly in this particular context, not in Southeast Asia?” So we&#39;re using voice recognition and image recognition for pigs to help identify stress and detect illnesses, so that could be automatic alerts to the caregivers.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What&#39;s the ground truth on that? That would be interesting to know.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> That&#39;s a great question.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> What&#39;s the training data?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> So this is the amazing stuff. It&#39;s a very expressive animal. So when you actually go there with the people who take care of them, they can literally point at them and say, “This animal is distressed,” and you&#39;re constantly recording.</p><p> We&#39;re kind of, “OK, is this really something that&#39;s relevant? Does it make sense?” Like, can we have that conversation with the baker, you know, the chemical engineer? Can we have a conversation with the animal keeper, the veterinarian and so forth, or the pole engineer when we&#39;re dealing with electricity cables? It&#39;s extremely important.</p><p> And that&#39;s one of the things that I realized throughout my career of doing data, is where things failed, where you suddenly had this divergence of exploring scientific research — and I came from the world of science, you know, like ex-academic — without really seeing that connectivity. And if we go all the way back, even when radar was invented, the reason things fall apart is whereby the very, very small gaps of “Well, it&#39;s not quite there; oh, it&#39;s not quite usable.” So that&#39;s the first part.</p><p> Then, the second level is seeing, well, is this something that, as much as possible, is truly going to make a difference to either our internal users — because that&#39;s extremely important — and for many of the businesses which are within the group, which are actually B2B, like in power, where, essentially, we provide power and wholesale [electricity]? So it&#39;s our internal users in terms of, let&#39;s say, predictive asset maintenance — critically important.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> That is really fantastic. I mean, what you&#39;ve said is inspiring on so many levels. One is, let your imagination be the limit, right, because [of] the question of “Can something be done better, more effectively? Can you see around the corner there?” And there&#39;s data, then, yes. That&#39;s one thing that&#39;s inherent in all these examples that you gave.</p><p> You started with what most would consider quite advanced and interesting things, and we have guests who talk about those all the time: personalization, fraud, cyber. All of those are very important. And then you went to cement. And then you went to pigs. And then you talked about human and AI …</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Yeah.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Which is quite critical too. I just find that very, very energizing.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Well, it&#39;s the nexus between human and AI. There are two critical things that I believe have to go hand in hand — have to. While this may change in the future to some degree or extent — I mean, who knows what&#39;s going to happen around the corner? Things change so rapidly. But I&#39;ll be the first one to admit this: I truly came to this appreciation when I worked [for] the regulator — surprise, surprise — [of the] criticality of combining governance and innovation. And I used to get asked this question repeatedly, of “Oh, but don&#39;t you think governance inhibits innovation? It stifles us.” And I came to the view of, I&#39;m vehemently against that perspective.</p><p> I would argue that not only it does not stifle it — it would result in more and even better innovation. It&#39;s essentially about just simply having, you know, common sense. I was privileged in being in the process and coming up with the FEAT principle. So this was <em>fairness</em> , <em>ethics</em> , <em>accountability</em> , and <em>transparency</em> , back at the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p><p> I remember that when it came out — and we deliberately kept it very simple — and I showed it to our governor, our managing director, and he was just like, “David, isn&#39;t this just common sense?” And I just smiled, and I was like, “Well, no; even common sense has to ... it&#39;s not always that common. It has to be written down.” But it&#39;s critical. That&#39;s No. 1.</p><p> And No. 2, what you were mentioning is that, yes, while AI and data can do what is seemingly miraculous stuff, it&#39;s critical that this combination with us humans and <em>how</em> we use it is baked in at the very beginning. And even now, obviously, everyone&#39;s talking about ChatGPT, but remember: All the data that it&#39;s trained on is from <em>us</em> to a certain extent.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah. You can&#39;t take humans out of the loop, because after a while, they will lose what makes them human.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> But we have examples of that. I mean, that&#39;s OK in some places. I mean, neither of you know how to navigate by the stars, I&#39;m guessing, unless, Shervin, you&#39;ve got some tricks up your sleeve that I haven&#39;t learned yet. I mean, most people don&#39;t drive a manual transmission; that seems to be a skill that&#39;s … well, OK, maybe one or two of us do here. But the point is, we don&#39;t have to retain all possible skills. We just have to be savvy about which ones we hang on to.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> That&#39;s exactly [right], what you said: It&#39;s some, not all. But sometimes you find that you see this trend of like, “Oh, look what it can do. <em>Everything</em> gets automated.” And I remember, if I go to my early days as a consultant — you know, I used to be a consultant doing AI — you would find a lot of times, potential clients and people you spoke to, even if they didn&#39;t say it explicitly, what they were trying to achieve was like, “Oh, just do everything automatically with AI.”</p><p> And you need to have almost this natural inclination by saying, “OK, if it&#39;s contextual, if it makes sense.” Like you said, maybe I want to pick up star navigation because I&#39;m interested in it. I want to learn about astrology or astrophysics or whatnot. Great. But you see it now becomes a niche topic that some people pick up. The general public doesn&#39;t need to know how to do it. But we need to be able to identify that decision point rather than just go [into a] “No, everything now, AI galore” kind of situation.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Well, I mean, what you&#39;re saying is, there&#39;s value in the ongoing dialogue. There&#39;s value in ongoing challenge. And every time there is a dialogue, I mean, even back in Socrates&#39;s time, the dialogue is where it elevates the conversation. And you&#39;re rightly pointing out that the moment you say AI is the be-all and end-all is the moment that you are under-delivering on AI, and then you&#39;re for sure under-delivering on the human potential.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Well you&#39;re losing a potential answer. Let me give you two examples. In the financial section, we have Union Bank of the Philippines, amongst others. While AI governance regulation is not yet — <em>yet</em> — a requirement, let&#39;s say, in the Philippines, we&#39;ve situated a working group, which is an interesting combination of people, from your risk officer, legal, compliance, and then you have marketing, customer engagement, experience. What happens is, while you still have the traditional process of model validation, etc., from a statistical, mathematical, data point of view, the models are presented in this working group for us to have a debate. Because a model may pass all the statistical tests, but if this model goes wrong — even that 10% or 5% — there is a significant reputational risk at play or there&#39;s a potential impact to the consumers. That debate is important because if you just looked at it from that statistical, even a potentially automated process, you would miss it.</p><p> Now, the resolution, interestingly enough — and I honestly tell you, like, maybe eight out of 10 times so far — isn&#39;t data, isn&#39;t AI. The resolution a lot of times is process, which is people. And that makes us actually wiser and understanding, “OK, how do we use it, and how do we engage with it? And when do we allow” — Sam, to your point — “that automation?” And when we go “no,” I retain the veto to overrule, to a certain extent. So that&#39;s one example.</p><p> The other one is if I go back to my cement [example], and in fact, we did this very deliberately at the very beginning because we didn&#39;t want our colleagues and chemical engineers to think, “Oh, great. Why do you need me? You&#39;re just going to automate the whole thing.”</p><p> No. The whole point was, we absolutely need them because there may be new types of mixtures that we haven&#39;t considered. You will still need to have that experimentation. The whole goal is providing information.</p><p> What it has resulted in is efficiency. If I give a swing again to another one — when ChatGPT came out, I got asked straightaway from a few boards, “What does this mean?” And my instinctive reaction, rather than going into this whole lengthy explanation of liberation, I just responded by saying, “It means that every one of us can have the productivity of 10 people.”</p><p> So this is what this stuff means, and that&#39;s what that nexus, the dialogue, the integration, the augmentation means — is that we now have the ability to be far more productive, whatever “productive” means in that context. For some people, they may say, “I just want to work two hours but [appear] as if I work the whole day.” Some may say, “I want to work the whole day.” … It may differ. But that&#39;s what it means because now we&#39;re able to take all this data.</p><p> I&#39;m sure some of you remember, back in 2000, you had these memes online of “getting information off the internet is like drinking from a fire hose.” It&#39;s still true. We&#39;re inundated with information, with data, but it&#39;s like distilling it down to something that&#39;s relevant to me, usable, that I can do something with it and get that gain, essentially.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I think one thing that&#39;s coming out of this conversation — Shervin used the word <em>Socratic</em> , and, David, you used the word <em>dialogue</em> . What&#39;s nice about this is it&#39;s dropped this hubris that I feel like I see in a lot of machine learning. Machine learning seems to be about humans teaching machines. So it&#39;s this sort of “We know all. We make the machines emulate us, and if they do, they pass the Turing test, and, yes, everything&#39;s golden.” But then you get pushback, and you say, “Oh, no. The machine can teach <em>us</em> things we&#39;ve never known before.” Well, that just has switched the direction. It still has that same directional hubris, but the things that you&#39;re both talking about are much more [oriented around the] Socratic and dialogue.</p><p> When you think about what that group can form together — and Shervin and I have got some results from last year&#39;s research that said about 60% of the people are thinking about AI as a coworker. And that strikes me as that sort of a relationship, because between the two, yes, you find some new compound that maybe someone wouldn&#39;t have tried. I don&#39;t know what the chemical engineering equivalent of the Fosbury flop is. Do you remember the Fosbury flop, where he learned a different way of jumping over the high bar, and then suddenly everyone else adopted that technique? That sort of idea seems like it could come out of this approach.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> It&#39;s actually really interesting you bring that up. I mean, I&#39;d love to say, “Oh, yeah, we had this all intended in the very beginning,” but I&#39;ll be very honest and say, I think it&#39;s more of a nice consequence that wasn&#39;t fully intended at a point in time.</p><p> But I want to go back to that FEAT principle. One of the principles resulted in a lot of discourse — and I mean a <em>lot</em> — where we had a statement amongst all of them that said that we should hold AI to at least the same standard as human decisions. So AI-based decisions should be held to at least the same standard as human-based decisions. And the debate was phenomenal and [people] said, “Oh, no, we should hold it to a higher one,” etc., and so forth.</p><p> But what the intention of that principle was saying is, if you&#39;re using now … so let me go back again to, let&#39;s say, a financial [example]: loan provisioning. And if [you&#39;re] using an AI algorithm and you&#39;re finding that “oh, we&#39;re discriminating,” OK, yeah, absolutely, that&#39;s something that needs to be addressed, reviewed, and corrected. But hold your horses there. Take a step back. Take the AI out of the equation. Had you been discriminating before the AI? And that&#39;s really the question because ... I remember I had long debates with many regulators. Maybe debate is the wrong word: <em>discussions</em> with many regulators. And I was actually a bit opposed to regulating AI, and I&#39;ll explain what I mean by that.</p><p> I&#39;m not opposing regulation. But when they said “regulating AI,” I got a bit defensive. I said, “What I&#39;m worried about is that we&#39;re like, &#39;OK, well, since AI now is showing me all this stuff that I don&#39;t want to know about, then I&#39;m just not going to use AI.&#39; And we&#39;re going to go back to the same procedures previously, which, guess what — it&#39;s the same problem. You just weren&#39;t paying attention to it because that information, that knowledge, wasn&#39;t bubbled up to the surface.”</p><p> So, what I kept on arguing is that, yes, the regulation has to be in play. And yes, there may be certain scenarios whereby AI requires higher scrutiny. But the regulation is still on the outcome. The regulation is still in the fact that, for example, it&#39;s a case of discrimination. You should not be discriminating; whether you&#39;re using a human-based process or an AI-based process is kind of beside the point. But I just want to emphasize that point, Sam, because it really goes back to what you were saying of, it&#39;s now teaching <em>us</em> things that we may have been, let&#39;s say, sometimes consciously ignorant of, sometimes inadvertently unaware of.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> David, tell us about your background. How did you end up where you are?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> If I roll back all the way to the beginning, and I&#39;m going to say this again with a big smile myself, how did I end up where I am? Detention. That&#39;s how I ended up here.</p><p> I must have been, what, 14, 15, 16 years old, and I got sent to the library because of detention. And, you know, if you&#39;re in a library, you have nothing better to do. I picked up a book on Prolog. Don&#39;t ask me why, from all the books I could have picked up, I picked up one about Prolog. And this is really before knowing anything about the whole world of, well, I guess in that case, it would be expert-based systems. And I started reading, and I just couldn&#39;t put it down. And that kind of triggered this exploration of, how can we better capture knowledge? How can we better learn?</p><p> And that obviously resulted in kind of learning a bit more about neural networks, AI. In fact, I was one of the first two students who took the degree of computer science with artificial intelligence. It was literally brand-new, from that perspective.</p><p> My Ph.D. thesis was about semantic models, so literally the representation and encapsulation of knowledge, effectively, and information; [it] was on learning musical patterns/music, or generating music from brain patterns. And the whole idea about that is essentially providing expert-based systems knowledge, if you think about it in that way, for people who, say, can&#39;t sit in front of a piano and play but are fully capable cognitively.</p><p> So that&#39;s kind of what brought me here. I know it&#39;s a very weird kind of journey. But yeah, I need to thank my literacy teacher: Thank you for sending me to detention.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> OK, so we&#39;ve got a segment where we&#39;re going to ask you some quick questions. What are you proudest of in terms of artificial intelligence? What have you done that you&#39;re proudest of?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Where to begin? What I&#39;m most proud of is the way we&#39;ve been able to graduate — and I literally mean that — from the academic world to the industrial world.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What worries you about AI? You&#39;ve mentioned some worries today. But what worries you?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> What worries me is I don&#39;t think we&#39;re fully appreciating what we&#39;re creating. I think we need to focus head on with the realization of what we&#39;re creating and what we&#39;re seeding for possibilities, for good and for bad.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your favorite activity that does not involve technology?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> SUP: stand-up paddling. Being on the water and just paddling away. It&#39;s extremely soothing. It&#39;s actually phenomenal exercise, for those who haven&#39;t tried.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> I&#39;ve tried and I&#39;ve missed the stand-up part. I&#39;m OK with the paddling, but the stand-up seems to lead to trouble. What&#39;s the first career you wanted while you were sitting in detention? What did you want to be when you grew up?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> I wanted to be an astrophysicist.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> What&#39;s your greatest wish for AI in the future? What are you hoping we can gain from this?</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> I don&#39;t know. Self-actualization? I hope we learn more about ourselves. It&#39;s already giving us capabilities. I mean, for example, I&#39;m dyslexic. Thank heavens for auto spell-checkers!</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Well, thank you for taking the time. I think that there&#39;s a lot that you&#39;ve mentioned. I think we can go back to even examples of food 100 years ago. We had a terrible food cleanliness [problem], and now we have a supply chain we can trust. Perhaps we can build that same sort of supply chain with data. Thank you for taking the time to talk with us today. It&#39;s been a pleasure.</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> Thank you, Sam, Shervin.</p><p> <strong>Shervin Khodabandeh:</strong> Yeah.谢谢。</p><p> <strong>David Hardoon:</strong> And maybe, if I may just add another note, I think that&#39;s really the critical thing: It&#39;s AI <em>trust</em> . It&#39;s about trust. Thank you very much.</p><p> <strong>Sam Ransbotham:</strong> Thanks for listening. Next time, Shervin and I talk with Naba Banerjee, head of trust product and operations at Airbnb, about how the travel platform uses AI and machine learning to make travel experiences safer.</p><p> <strong>Allison Ryder:</strong> Thanks for listening to <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> .

These technologies are taking over more and more aspects of business as they seep into the collective consciousness. As Vox put it, generative AI is “ <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2023/1/5/23539055/generative-ai-chatgpt-stable-diffusion-lensa-dall-e">suddenly everywhere</a> ,” and it&#39;s poised to profoundly change daily life within organizations in many ways, particularly in the sphere of communication.</p><p> More than ever, when people receive texts, emails, or other digital messages, they have reason to wonder whether an actual human being wrote them. ChatGPT is even being used to write <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/chatgpt-is-being-used-to-write-emails-big-companies-are-embracing-it.html">custom messages</a> to individual executives on LinkedIn. In response, tools are being created to help people determine whether a message was really <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90830518/tools-to-detect-ai-generated-text-chatgpt">written by a human</a> . Some of these tools are made by the same companies whose technologies generate such text. But few people are likely to use these detectors in the short term, and even if they do, there will be a continuous cycle of AI-based text generators constantly working to outsmart the detectors.</p><p></p><p> The net result is clear: When it comes to digital communication, we&#39;re unlikely to trust most “personal” digital messages for a while to come. This is why, in working to build authentic relationships, sidestepping technology altogether has newfound power.</p><h3> Handwritten Messages Take on New Value</h3><p> Few people answer calls from unrecognized phone numbers these days. And executives are increasingly aware that AI is also being used to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/11/why-chatgpt-ai-are-taking-over-the-cold-call-salesforce-leader.html">schedule such calls</a> , which can make them feel like just another name on a list.</p><p> In an effort to connect with decision makers, I recently tried going a different route: I wrote notes by hand to several executives and dropped them in the mail. Some of these have led to very positive personal responses and meetings, and even contract discussions. These relationships are being built on <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-on-books/author-talks-susan-mcpherson-on-building-meaningful-relationships-in-business-and-in-life">meaningful foundations</a> that could lead to long-term business growth.</p><p> There have always been people who prefer to write business notes by hand, but it&#39;s never before carried such a significant connotation — that a real person has taken the time to write out a personalized message rather than choosing an easier option. And a recent study shows how powerful that can be: Researchers from business schools at the University of Maryland and Yonsei University in South Korea found that “presenting a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10949968221102306?journalCode=jnma">handwritten note</a> has a positive and significant effect on customer spending” and that “warmth underlies the key findings.”</p><h3> Humanizing Communication</h3><p></p><p> A similar principle applies to internal communication as well. Some managers now use technology for things like employee recognition and turn to generative AI to create and send complimentary messages to team members. While this may be helpful for overwhelmed and exhausted managers, it can also reduce the sense of meaning and personalization that employees may be looking for. This is why handwritten notes can be a powerful way for managers to show employees — especially <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-create-belonging-for-remote-workers/">remote workers</a> , who aren&#39;t in the office to receive such recognition face to face — their genuine appreciation.</p><p> Writing notes by hand may not be the right move for everyone — such as if someone&#39;s penmanship is particularly difficult to read. But there are other ways to personalize communication, including creating videos or voice memos tailored to a specific individual, or even leaving a voicemail if a phone call goes unanswered. Some people block off a time in their schedule and say, “I&#39;m going to keep this two-hour block open in hopes that you might want to chat. Reach out anytime within that time frame, and I&#39;ll drop whatever I&#39;m doing.”</p><p> The key is to always be on the lookout for ways to emphasize our humanity in our communications. The more we do that, the less of an interloper AI will be in our relationships — and the more authentic and rewarding they&#39;ll become.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/amid-growing-ai-humanize-communication-to-strengthen-relationships/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> The Four-Day Workweek: How to Make It Work in Your Organization</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-four-day-workweek-how-to-make-it-work-in-your-organization/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-four-day-workweek-how-to-make-it-work-in-your-organization/#comments</comments><pubDate> Thu, 29 Jun 2023 11:00:45 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Andrew Barnes. <p>Andrew Barnes is the founder of Perpetual Guardian, New Zealand&#39;s largest corporate trustee company.

It would be crucial, he knew, to still deliver the same output, customer service, and profitability. He landed on what he calls the 100-80-100 rule: “We pay 100% income for 80% time, as long as we get 100% output.”</p><p> The trial made global headlines — “We stopped counting when we got over about 14,000” — and Barnes was inundated with requests for advice. He started a not-for-profit organization and began helping companies on their own pilots, providing virtual workshops, mentoring others, and networking opportunities. The results, which now include data from 91 companies and 3,500 workers, have been analyzed by a team of academics.</p><p></p><p> And those results have been universally positive. “Not only are 90%-plus of employees saying they like the four-day week — and, in fact, they really don&#39;t want to go back — but companies are seeing material benefits in productivity,” Barnes said.</p><p></p><p> Barnes talked about the experiments and their findings during <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/series/work-23-the-big-shift/">Work/23</a> , an <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> symposium held in May 2023. He wasn&#39;t able to get to all of the questions from attendees during the event, so he answers some of them below. (Questions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity.)</p><h6> Is there any research comparing a four-day workweek versus five reduced days (at six hours a day, for example)? Do the results suggest that four days is the better way?</h6><p> Both are viewed by us as four-day weeks! The clickbait is “a four-day week,” but in reality, we talk about <em>reduced hours working</em> — the 100-80-100 rule. The key is that employees get the time off that&#39;s important to <em>them</em> . In my company, we have some people who take a full day off, others who take two half days, and others, often working parents, who work compressed hours five days a week. That schedule helps with child care issues, which a single day off would not address.</p><p></p><h6> How do you measure the success of the four-day workweek from the perspective of employees and teams when it comes to productivity versus company results like revenue?</h6><p> Obviously, it&#39;s easier to see whether there&#39;s improvement in company results such as profitability and revenue. We often find that people ask how we measure employee productivity. This, of course, raises the question of how productivity is <em>currently</em> being measured. All too often, it quickly becomes clear that many organizations use time as a surrogate for productivity.</p><p> Part of our program is helping organizations develop other productivity measures so that improvements can be more clearly assessed. A key part of this is helping employees identify the unproductive parts of their day. Simply eliminating unproductive activity will, by definition, increase productive activity.</p><h6> I find that much of what fills the time outside of tactical work are personal conversations and relationship-building. Do those things diminish when you move to a four-day week?</h6><p> No. In fact, the evidence suggests that these improve. By combining policies such as quiet hours (deep work), fewer and shorter meetings, and better social facilities (in our case, a better staff breakout area), we find that staff cohesion and team-building actually increase. By reinforcing that staff members need to work together to allow everyone to achieve the objective of reduced hours of working, there is often more time for these interactions, not less.</p><h6> Gallup&#39;s US panel data from 2020 shows that employees who work four days per week have higher well-being than those who work five or six days. However, Gallup&#39;s data also shows that the <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/358346/gallup-workplace-insights-learned-2021.aspx">percentage who are actively disengaged rises</a> among those who work fewer days. Gallup says that employees who already feel disconnected from their employer are likely to drift even further away. What do you advise companies to do to address this?</h6><p> In the context of a society where many employees work from home and are therefore separated from the usual workplace culture, the impact of reduced hours working is actually minimal. It is also necessary to differentiate between the old style of four-day-week working (where only a few worked four days and most worked five, often with the former receiving lower pay) and the new model, where everyone works a reduced schedule with no reduction in pay. Companies in our trials report significant increases in engagement scores. In the case of our own company, scores increased by 40% — to levels the researchers said were the highest they had ever seen in New Zealand.</p><h6> What differences do you see in the effects of the four-day workweek on people doing different kinds of work — say, between software developers and creative workers versus salespeople?</h6><p> Obviously, there are practical differences in how the work is actually done, but the impact on employees across the companies in our various trials appears to be consistent. Employees report being more productive, more rested, less stressed, and happier. It is a thesis of mine that healthier, happier, more rested employees are more productive. Who would have thought!</p><h6> What kind of training and prep do companies do to introduce a four-day week?</h6><p> We encourage organizations to take a couple of months to plan and prepare before initiating the six-month trial. Both the preparation and trial allow organizations to flex the process to find out what works for them. The bulk of the efficiencies and improvements come from empowering staff members and creating a culture where individuals recognize that they have to work together to reduce wasted time. In my own organization and in many others, training was therefore limited and largely unnecessary.</p><h6> How do you build employee trust to successfully achieve the stated goals when implementing a reduced workweek?</h6><p> Put simply, if trust does not exist prior to the implementation of the four-day week, it is unlikely the implementation will be successful.</p><h6> We run a 24-hour operation. Have you seen this done in organizations such as this, and what is the impact on the staffing numbers? Don&#39;t you have to increase the number of employees?</h6><p> In many ways, it is easier to introduce a four-day week into a seven-day, 24-hour operation, as the organization is already running shift patterns. A reduced-hour week simply requires shifts to be reconfigured. Remember that our thesis is that productivity actually increases, so in some operations, each shift can be staffed with fewer employees.</p><p> Alternatively, in people-heavy organizations such as medical facilities, it is likely that more staff will have to be recruited. The savings here, though, come from reduced recruitment time and turnover, fewer sick days (67% fewer, according to the trial data) with reduced impact on productivity, and lower costs for expensive temporary staff. Evidence also suggests that outcomes improve.</p><h6> Have you done this work with clients in consulting industries? What kind of success have you had there? How was billable time affected?</h6><p>是的。 PR firms, legal firms, and consultancies have all moved to the four-day week. Billable hours is often quoted as an impediment, but it is simply a mechanism to allocate costs. The clients pay on value and outcomes. If you can now do the work quicker under the four-day model, just adjust the cost allocation units. The client doesn&#39;t care. A simple example: Two consultants produce an identical piece of work. One takes an hour, one half an hour. Why would the client pay twice as much for the former? In reality, billable hours get adjusted in order to align the bill with the amount the client will pay.</p><p></p><h6> What obstacles did you encounter when making the switch to a four-day workweek?</h6><p> The principal obstacle was that members of my leadership team were highly skeptical, if not hostile, and my board universally hated it. Bringing leadership on the journey and helping them to walk the talk is critical for the project&#39;s success. I have set out the usual obstacles in various papers that are on the <a href="https://www.4dayweek.com/">4dayweek.com</a> website and in my book, <cite>The 4 Day Week</cite> .</p><h6> Can you provide sample policies used by companies?</h6><p> The 4dayweek.com website has lots of helpful material, including the research and a white paper. That white paper includes the policies we introduced at Perpetual Guardian to implement the reduced schedule.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-four-day-workweek-how-to-make-it-work-in-your-organization/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 1</slash:comments></item><item><title> Communication Is at the Heart of Positive Employee Relationships</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/communication-is-at-the-heart-of-positive-employee-relationships/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/communication-is-at-the-heart-of-positive-employee-relationships/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 27 Jun 2023 11:00:12 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Ben Laker. <p>Ben Laker ( <a href="https://twitter.com/drbenlaker">@drbenlaker</a> ) is a professor of leadership at the University of Reading&#39;s Henley Business School and coauthor of <cite>Too Proud to Lead: How Hubris Can Destroy Effective Leadership and What to Do About It</cite> (Bloomsbury, 2021).</p> ]]>; </dc:creator><category><![CDATA[Communication]]></category><category><![CDATA[Employee Recruitment and Retention]]></category><category><![CDATA[Leadership]]></category><category><![CDATA[Skills & Learning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Talent Management]]></category><category><![CDATA[Workplace, Teams, & Culture]]></category><description><![CDATA[In today’s competitive job market, companies must focus not only on finding the best candidates but also on fostering positive relationships with them, starting with the first step of the recruitment process through every stage of employment.

How leaders communicate with prospective and current staff members can significantly affect their organization&#39;s reputation as a place where people want to work. After all, having a culture that incorporates transparent and open communication is essential to building trust and loyalty.</p><p></p><h3> The Importance of Communication Skills in Hiring</h3><p> According to research, oral and written <a href="https://newmanu.edu/top-5-skills-employers-look-for">communication skills</a> are among the top five most sought-after attributes in potential new hires: Employers want workers who can effectively convey their ideas, perspectives, and knowledge.</p><p> Employees with strong communication skills are able to express their thoughts and emotions clearly, making them more efficient in the workplace. Additionally, they are better equipped to manage challenging conversations or negotiations with clients or coworkers through their ability to listen attentively, provide accurate feedback, and resolve conflicts.</p><p> Good communication skills also foster a better company culture: Employees create a stronger bond when they are able to effectively communicate with one another. This not only creates a cohesive and productive work environment but also increases their loyalty to the organization.</p><p></p><p> Hiring managers should screen resumes for clear and concise writing abilities and pay attention to how candidates speak during interviews to assess their communication skills. If appropriate, they should request written work samples before an interview to assess candidates&#39; writing capabilities. Candidates who can effectively communicate their qualifications and skills in writing will likely be able to better articulate them orally during the interview.</p><p></p><h3> The Hiring Process: Clear Expectations and Open Dialogue</h3><p> All parties involved in the hiring process need to be clear and concise when conveying information. Hiring managers must clearly define expectations, roles, and responsibilities when talking to potential candidates: One study found that 48% of employees who left a job early did so because their employer&#39;s <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/study-48-of-workers-have-left-a-job-because-it-didnt-meet-expectations/551179/">expectations were unclear</a> .</p><p> Establishing an open dialogue with candidates during the hiring process is essential for building trust and gaining insight into their communication styles. By using a combination of open-ended questions, role-playing scenarios, and exercises that focus on communication, employers can better understand each candidate&#39;s approach to their work and create a foundation for a strong working relationship.</p><p> Once a new hire is brought on board, providing feedback on their communication skills can help them understand what they are already doing well and where they can improve.</p><h3> Navigating Layoffs: Transparency, Empathy, and Compliance</h3><p> In an era marked by recession fears and downsizing, how companies handle layoffs can have a profound impact on their reputation and employee morale. To maintain a positive relationship with employees during layoffs, employers should prioritize clear, honest, and timely communication. This means providing as much advance notice as possible to all employees, explaining the rationale behind the decision, and offering support to those affected, such as career counseling, resume preparation, and job search assistance. By treating employees with respect and empathy, companies can minimize negative impacts and maintain a favorable reputation.</p><p> Furthermore, organizations must comply with laws governing layoffs to ensure the fair treatment of employees and avoid legal repercussions. Employers should be aware of their state and local laws to ensure that they meet minimum notice requirements and other regulations. Consider the case of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, where the initial decision to <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/bed-bath-beyond-to-pay-out-severance-to-1300-workers-after-initially-bypassing-law/ar-AA1aKgBG">bypass severance laws</a> led to lawsuits — and thus more negative publicity for a company that had recently declared bankruptcy — followed by a reversal of the decision.</p><h3> Creating a Culture of Open Communication</h3><p></p><p> The key to fostering positive relationships with candidates and employees alike lies in creating a culture of open communication. This means valuing transparency, honesty, and empathy, no matter the stage of employment. Companies should also encourage open dialogue among all levels of the organization, providing opportunities for employees to voice their concerns and ideas. This can help to establish a sense of trust, promote a collaborative work environment, and, ultimately, contribute to the company&#39;s overall success.</p><p> In addition to fostering open communication, employers should invest in training and development programs that help employees enhance their communication skills. This benefits the individuals, contributes to a more effective and cohesive work environment, and can, ultimately, lead to greater success for the organization and a more productive work environment overall. By prioritizing communication at every stage of the employee life cycle, managers can foster a positive work culture in which individuals feel valued, supported, and empowered to succeed.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/communication-is-at-the-heart-of-positive-employee-relationships/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
