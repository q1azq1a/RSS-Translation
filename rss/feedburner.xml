<a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a>他们与不同的人建立桥梁关系，并接触新的观点，这可能有助于创造力。 <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a>另一方面，选择私下合作的创意团队受益于一个以信任感为特征的安全空间，这种信任感可以促进真实性和创意偏差、冒险精神和创意孵化，这也可能有助于创造创新空间。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a>以这种方式工作可以促进联系，巩固共同的身份，从而产生更强烈的贡献和参与动力。 <a

等平台允许团队根据特定项目协作的需要创建公共或私人渠道。</p><p>通过公共渠道使新群组透明或保持私密的选择对于成员的联系和沟通对象具有重要影响。每种选择都会形成不同类型的沟通结构，对创意成果产生不同的影响。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a></p><h3>数字创意的两条路径</h3><p>我们对一家大型制造商使用协作平台的 215 个群体进行的研究表明，数字通信功能（透明与隐私）和数字通信结构（桥接与结合）产生两种不同的路径，从而产生不同类型的创造力，我们将其定义为<em>发展性创造力</em>和<em>破坏性</em>创造力<em>创造力</em>。 （参见“数字协作中的两种创造力”。）发展创造力涉及结合或扩展现有概念以产生新的结果，我们发现这是在公共渠道中合作最有可能的结果。破坏性创造力涉及对物体或问题的创造性破坏，从而出现对该物体或问题的新观点。在数字环境中，当团体将其通信设置为私密时，最有可能发生这种情况。</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside

/></p></article></aside></div><p>管理者可以通过仔细设计两条不同的路径来培养这两种不同类型的创造力。通过将正确的沟通功能与正确的沟通结构相结合，管理者可以促进对特定项目或项目阶段最有用的创造力类型。重要的是，随着创新项目的进展，一些群体可能会从一种模式转向另一种模式中受益。</p><p>为了说明不同的数字配置如何影响发展性创造力还是颠覆性创造力的出现，我们借鉴了从研究协作平台收集的真实讨论。正如下面的两个例子所示，具有桥接关系的透明团体会产生发展性创造力，而具有联系关系的私人团体会产生破坏性创造力。我们的研究表明，当这些路径失调时，创造力往往会停滞不前。</p><p></p><h4>发展创造力之路</h4><p><em>选择透明度：</em>约翰正在努力为他的一位客户解决回收刨花板的问题。他转向该组织的主要渠道，这是一个公共团体，该团体将自己描述为提供提问和分享想法的论坛。</p><p><em>参与桥梁：</em>约翰联系了之前在论坛中提到过回收刨花板在欧盟很常见的人。他解释说，美国的客户正在努力解决这个问题，迄今为止只找到了对材料进行降级回收的方法。他问道：“你能详细解释一下这个过程吗？”</p><p><em>结果：</em>全球团队成员 Seb 提供了他从国外客户那里了解到的信息，并建议将回收与能源回收相结合，正如欧洲所采用的那样。对话最终转向开发创造性的解决方案并扩大知识的使用来帮助客户。从这一简短的对话中，我们看到像这样的开放组织论坛提供了跨群体沟通的机会，通常通过偶然性或意想不到的来源找到棘手问题的创造性解决方案。这种交互能够将知识从一种环境扩展到另一种环境。</p><h4>创造性颠覆之路</h4><p><em>保护隐私：</em> Elena 领导着一个由 15 名成员组成的私人团体。其成员正在尝试重新构想其组织的运作方式，以使其更加敏捷和富有创造力，这样做正在挑战公认的工作方式。该小组保护其隐私，成员对该小组最终成为公共论坛表示保留，并指出他们更愿意将在论坛中发表的评论远离更多受众。</p><p><em>鼓励联系：</em>小组成员敏锐地意识到他们之间的联系，并赞扬他们能够建立的“共同语言”和“社区意识”。埃琳娜指出，在这个共享空间中作为一个团队工作，使他们能够用特定的词汇和概念讨论工作理念，并分享专业身份。他们的对话表明他们担心最终向组织中的其他人开放该小组可能会降低沟通中的诚实和直接程度。</p><p><em>结果：</em>重构发生在这个紧密相连的群体中：例如，该群体对组织结构辩论的想法感到兴奋，称此类讨论“高度富有成效”；这再次表明，私人团体的安全性促进了更多的争论性讨论，从而产生新的想法。从团队的交流中，我们可以看到，私人团体提供了联系的机会，不仅可以建立安全感和共同使命，还可以承担更大的风险，专注于重构问题和创造性的破坏。</p><h3>设计数字组以发挥创造力</h3><p>我们研究的数字协作工具用户之间的交互表明，它们特别适合促进协作创造力。随着工作场所数字化的不断发展，知识工作者对远程或混合工作安排的偏好进一步加剧，组织面临的挑战是了解不同项目的需求并相应地选择正确的创造力途径。这需要战略性地将所使用的协作工具的不同功能与适当的通信结构结合起来。管理者在这样做时需要考虑以下三点：</p><p> <strong>1. 选择支持公共和私人空间的协作工具。</strong>问题所需的创造性输出类型可以指导有关所需团队类型的决策。如果一个新项目可能涉及逐步改进现有产品或流程（即发展创造力），那么建立一个具有桥梁纽带的透明团队，鼓励偶然和不同的观点建立联系是理想的路径。另一方面，充满不确定性的新挑战——颠覆性创造力——最好通过一个具有安全和共享身份的纽带的私人团体来实现。</p><p></p><p> <strong>2. 管理者应该考虑如何支持他们无法看到或监控的私人团体，以及如何使这些团体中嵌入的知识可供更广泛的组织使用。</strong>组织应该努力创造机会，让整个组织从私人空间中发生的创造性偏差中学习，但又不能破坏安全感和共同使命感，而这些是破坏性创造力出现的条件。管理者必须愿意信任流程并让它有机地发展，即使它是无形的，因此超出了他们的控制范围。领导透明团队的管理者同样可以在需要时通过不时促进秘密对话来支持创造性的冒险。为了确保组织中的其他人最终能够获得学习成果，应鼓励这些私人团体的创建者找到转移他们所学知识的方法，例如，通过建立一个开放团体来分享有关团体活动的新闻和更新。</p><p></p><p> <strong>3. 组织可以将不同的群体结合起来，创造多种途径来发挥不同类型的创造力。</strong>数字工具为现实世界的团体提供了独特的机会来创建多个不同的数字空间，这些空间可以同时或顺序管理以支持不同类型的创造力。例如，埃琳娜的团队讨论在创建最小可行流程后创建第二个公共小组，以便“走出战略室”并“与组织中的主要利益相关者建立联系”以“测试他们的假设并转变它们”进入知识。”因此，拥有一个私人团体有助于破坏性创造力的初始阶段，随后可以通过公共团体实现第二阶段的发展创造力。同样，对于需要一些实验和创意孵化的公共项目，管理者可以鼓励团体暂时“撤回”私人飞地，以鼓励更大的风险承担。</p><p></p><p>当管理者想知道如何在数字工作场所培养创造力和创新时，了解数字工具为创造力提供的独特机会至关重要。这些工具的不同通信功能——尤其是那些支持透明与隐私的工具——产生了不同的创造力路径，最终形成了创造性的发展或破坏性形式。领导者需要注意，没有一种放之四海而皆准的创新方法。什么是最有效的取决于雄心的范围和创新过程的阶段。他们必须使用户能够融合和拥抱多种创造力途径，并利用这些途径最大限度地发挥数字劳动力的创造力潜力。</p><p></p>

We found that at this stage, participants rely on signals such as the idea proposer&#39;s status in the community, and how an idea is framed and formulated, to filter out what they perceive as low-quality ideas and choose the ones they will support. Specifically, ideas from members whose previous proposals had gained high levels of community support were more likely to move forward. So were ideas that were accompanied by upbeat, detailed descriptions and an average of seven images.</p><p> However, predicting which ideas would receive 10,000 votes at the final stage was almost impossible. We found a large degree of randomness regarding which ideas made it to the last round after passing the initial threshold. In the end, social influence played a significant role in selecting the finalists for Lego to evaluate.</p><p> These findings suggest that although companies could apply artificial intelligence technology to select the most promising ideas from customers, such an approach would be less useful in finding the hits. An engaged customer community can contribute insights about which ideas have a certain something — call it market fitness or viability — that can&#39;t be easily replicated. Community involvement across multiple selection stages complements the expertise within the Lego Group by detecting high-quality ideas with strong market demand.</p><h3> Insight 2: <span class="normal">Give Unhappiness an Outlet</span></h3><p> Involving customers in selecting product ideas poses a diplomatic challenge. From 2008 to 2019, there were 148 ideas that garnered 10,000 votes, and of those, only 23 were selected for development and production by the Lego Group. Rejecting so many popular proposals could stir a backlash if not managed carefully.</p><p> We looked into how community members who supported the ideas that the Lego Group rejected reacted, by analyzing their activity before and after they learned about the company&#39;s decisions. We found that they not only stayed on the Lego Ideas platform but also became more engaged in commenting on others&#39; ideas. However, when doing so, they expressed their disappointment by providing more negative feedback for about two weeks after their cherished idea was rejected.</p><p> These results illustrate that rejecting a participant&#39;s idea can affect the wider community. That the consequences were short-lived can be attributed to participants&#39; high identification with the Lego Group and Lego Ideas, as revealed in interviews with participants. Customer loyalty has enabled the company to say no without destroying its community.</p><p> Members we interviewed described different ways Lego has been able to create such loyalty. One tactic has been to design the platform to encourage participants to connect individually. One member from Greece said that she has continued to participate because she values the relationships she has with fans from different countries, including France, Italy, and Spain.</p><p></p><p> Further, the company has organized fairs, in-person competitions, and test labs where Lego Ideas participants are invited to contribute. A member who frequently attends Lego shows described his luck at being invited, along with his son, to the Lego 1-90 Builders event, which was held in 2022 at the newly expanded Lego London store to celebrate the company&#39;s 90th anniversary. Guests shared their stories of what Lego meant to them, and they had the chance to be featured alongside Lego designers in a series of 90 photographs by renowned fashion and portrait photographer Rankin.</p><p></p><h3> Insight 3: <span class="normal">Share the Wealth</span></h3><p> Although children are Lego&#39;s primary customers, the company has embraced opportunities to expand its reach by partnering with adults. When we interviewed Lego Ideas and BrickLink managers and observed the BrickLink Designer Program (BDP) — where members compete to have their ideas crowdfunded — we found that the company encourages not only creativity but entrepreneurship as well.</p><p> Many creators are able to earn money from their proposals outside of Lego Ideas competitions. Many fans have side careers as Lego builders, showcasing their creativity on YouTube and other social media platforms. And they have fueled demand for aftermarket sales.</p><p> A Lego enthusiast, Dan Jezek, started BrickLink in 2000, after he discovered a demand for aftermarket bricks on eBay. At first the site hosted just 15 resellers&#39; stores. <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a> Today, it hosts more than 10,000 sellers in 70 countries. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a> Consumers can buy and sell bricks, sets, and original designs from each other. The Lego Group purchased BrickLink to complement Lego Ideas, providing a way to extend its relationship with adult fans and especially with a smaller niche of skilled designers. Owning BrickLink also offered Lego the possibility of better control over the quality of ideas submitted and exchanged on the platform.</p><p> The company is using BrickLink to create new revenue streams with members. It launched BDP in 2021 with a competition for members of its 10K Club — those whose ideas had garnered 10,000 votes on Lego Ideas but had not been chosen by Lego employees for commercialization. Fans could pledge money to help their favorite projects get a second chance at being realized.</p><p> If a design had at least 3,000 preorders on BrickLink, Lego assembled exclusive kits, including both bricks and a building manual, for those customers. If an idea did not get enough preorders, all rights to the idea reverted to the creator, who could do anything with it, including selling the digital building instructions on the platform.</p><p> Lego invested in the program by assigning designers to help creators test, build, and refine their projects before submitting them for crowdfunding. The company also performed quality checks on sets that were headed into production to ensure adherence to safety and legal standards as well as a first-rate building experience.</p><p> The program was well received by adult fans, according to a BrickLink manager we interviewed. Many designs reached the crowdfunding threshold of 3,000 preorders within days — or even minutes. The Lego Group has since expanded BDP to allow for submissions by anyone who lives in a country where it operates. To encourage Lego fans&#39; digital creativity, the company provides them with software called BrickLink Studio that they can use to design and submit their proposals.</p><p> Although the company markets the Lego Ideas competition winners through its regular retail channels, BrickLink creators market their crowdfunded ideas themselves. The kits produced are not official Lego sets, but they include a small Lego logo on the side of the box in addition to the BDP logo on the front to remind consumers of the connection with the company.</p><p> Late last year, the company announced that rather than one-off or occasional events, BDP competitions would become a permanent feature of the program, and launched two in early 2023, with winning designs expected to ship in mid- to late-2024. After BrickLink members have voted for their favorite submissions, the company will weigh crowd support alongside its own selection criteria (including creators&#39; design skills and digital acumen) and compatibility with its existing product portfolio to select five designs.</p><p> Finally, BrickLink members will be invited to preorder any of the five designs. Those that receive over 3,000 preorders will be manufactured in limited quantities — up to a maximum of 20,000 sets. Creators, who again will market their own designs, will receive 5% of the net sales.</p><h3> End &#39;Not Invented Here&#39;</h3><p> Each of the above insights highlights a way that the Lego Group has rethought how it operates to capture more benefits from customer-generated innovation. Companies often find this hard to do. Skeptical employees may resist ideas from outside — the classic not-invented-here syndrome — but they might change their attitudes after exploring the perspectives of external contributors. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> Further, working with consumers can challenge internal product developers&#39; professional identities. They might have to redefine what they think of as their roles. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a></p><p> Lego has found productive ways to overcome these challenges by integrating its open innovation pipeline with its internal design organization in a way that capitalizes on its designers&#39; and marketers&#39; unique knowledge and expertise. Consumers&#39; ideas will vary in quality, and some will not appeal to a mainstream market. Lego&#39;s internal experts have a key role in ensuring that customer-generated designs reflect the Lego brand by upholding company standards for design complexity, quality, safety, and buildability.</p><p> Because Lego Ideas and BrickLink are pillars of the company&#39;s business strategy, the Lego Group needs to nurture the community and keep it aligned with the organization&#39;s internal priorities. For Lego Ideas, this requires a two-pronged approach, with one team responsible for community engagement and another charged with ensuring that customers&#39; ideas are compatible with the larger product portfolio. The two teams cooperate to determine the best development direction for the platform.</p><p> Another team focuses on community engagement, integration, and alignment for BrickLink. It also coordinates with the Lego Ideas team to ensure that the company takes full advantage of the complementarity between the two platforms.</p><p> Lego designers still create the majority of products for the company. But by embracing Lego Ideas and BrickLink, the company ensures that a broader spectrum of ideas reaches consumers than would be developed internally and that it captures a large share of the value from these ideas.</p><p></p><p></p><p> Our four-year study of how Lego manages its customer innovation platform uncovered three important lessons for managers who seek the benefits of open innovation.</p><p> First, customers contribute to the open innovation process in two ways: by generating ideas, and by identifying the most promising ones with the highest market demand. Second, companies can mitigate negativity within customer communities when they reject customers&#39; ideas if they make building and sustaining customer loyalty a priority. Last, companies can deepen their relationships with customers by allowing them to earn money from their creative efforts.</p><p> The gains from open innovation are more likely to stick when companies make internal changes that help them integrate and manage collaboration with customers. Lego&#39;s focus on keeping the customer community engaged and its contributions aligned with product strategy has enabled it to reap the benefits of increased innovation, revenues, and loyalty among its customers.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/lego-takes-customers-innovations-further/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Unleash the Unexpected for Radical Innovation</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/unleash-the-unexpected-for-radical-innovation/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/unleash-the-unexpected-for-radical-innovation/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 12 Sep 2023 11:00:49 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Wenjing Lyu, Gina Colarelli O’Connor, and Neil C.

These speed and orientation sensors tell our phones whether they&#39;re being held in portrait or landscape mode, deploy airbags in our cars, and track our forehands when we play virtual tennis. They also help sense when the earth starts to shift before earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. But while it is easy to recognize the significance of this innovation retrospectively, its true impact didn&#39;t become apparent until many of today&#39;s most valued applications were developed. This gradual unveiling of an innovation&#39;s potential over time is a surprisingly common pattern — so common, in fact, that companies need to craft their innovation management systems with this phenomenon in mind.</p><p> Here&#39;s how the accelerometer made its mark. In the early 1980s, an R&amp;D scientist at Analog Devices learned of a new invention in the world of integrated circuits that incorporated mechanical devices within their designs. Today, we know that innovation as microelectromechanical system, or MEMS, devices. The scientist was intrigued enough to invite the inventor, a professor at a nearby university, to give a talk to Analog&#39;s R&amp;D group. He then began to experiment with design and generated ideas with colleagues on packaging such a device on a circuit board, the benefits the technology could provide, and how such systems could be manufactured at scale. He expected that there would be uses in the automotive industry, a sector attractive to Analog because automobiles were becoming increasingly dependent on smart electronic systems. Eventually, the team demonstrated the potential of these new devices to sense changes in speed and showed how they could be produced economically, and thus the accelerometer chip was born.</p><p></p><p> Over the next 10 years, the company searched for applications in the automotive market. Airbag detonators were its first target, but along the way, many more applications surfaced, mostly outside of the automotive industry. Eventually, Analog found that the device could be modified to enable advances in video game technology, training simulators, medical instrumentation, sporting goods, optical telecommunications, and satellite technology, including gyroscopes. The company also began receiving inquiries for more and more use cases such that, by the time the technology&#39;s foreseen applications in the automotive industry were being adopted, its unforeseen applications were already transforming many other markets.</p><p> This case is just one example of how ideas that at first appear to simply be an interesting leap, a next step in product development, or a combination of known technologies can turn out to have more radical impacts. As such technologies are incubated, both the company and the broader market learn more about them. Unanticipated use cases emerge and, in many instances, are far afield from those that were originally imagined, perhaps leveraging different characteristics of the technology or different business models.</p><h3> The Difficulty of Predicting Radicalness</h3><p> While the story of the accelerometer is one of amazing success, it also speaks to Analog&#39;s ability to fully explore the idea&#39;s potential. Those opportunities can be missed if much of that radicalness appears only as a technology incubates. How much radical innovation is lost because organizations abandon projects before this radicalness appears?</p><p> One of the starkest illustrations of the unpredictability of achieving “breakthrough” status for a particular project is a seminal analysis published by DuPont. In 1968, R&amp;D managers were asked to consider projects that were early in their development and identify which ones should be abandoned as well as those they considered to be <em>discontinuous innovations</em> , defined as having the potential for a “sudden appearance of a breakthrough in technology that can yield entirely new products, processes, or services” that result in high reward for a company. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> Thirty years later, in 1997, their answers were compared with the actual outcomes. (See “DuPont&#39;s Predictions of Radicalness.”) </p><div class="callout-highlight callout--expand-column callout-highlight--transparent"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> DuPont&#39;s Predictions of Radicalness</h4><p class="caption"> In 1968, Dupont R&amp;D scientists predicted outcomes for certain early-stage projects. The table below shows the projects&#39; actual outcomes as of 1997. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MAG_Lyu_Fig1.png" alt="DuPont’s Predictions of Radicalness"></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p> The results showed that the managers were wrong more often than they were right and that they had both overestimated and underestimated projects&#39; prospects. Some projects that managers had considered promising ended up being abandoned, irrelevant, sold, or killed. Only 1 in 6 of these expected high-reward projects was still active. In contrast, of the seven projects expected to fail because of low returns, three — Tyvek, Surlyn, and Clysar — had become clear winners, two others remained in development, and two had been killed. So not only were breakthroughs unpredictable even for a company taking this question as seriously as DuPont, but all but three of its successful breakthroughs would have been lost had it acted on the opinions of managers who couldn&#39;t yet see their promise.</p><p> Our own research confirms how difficult radicalness is for R&amp;D leaders to predict. We asked respondents at 300 large corporations across seven industries in seven countries about the most successful project they had developed in the past few years — specifically, whether the innovation was judged to be incremental, substantial, or radical initially, and whether that prediction was borne out. In fact, while 93% of the projects wound up being substantially or radically innovative (as might be expected of respondents&#39; most successful projects), initial expectations for most — a full 92% — had been that they would be merely incremental. (See “Expectations Were Low for Successful Innovation Projects.”) </p><div class="callout-highlight callout-highlight--transparent"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> Expectations Were Low for Successful Innovation Projects</h4><p class="caption"> Survey results show the radicalness that innovation leaders at 300 companies expected when they started what turned out to be their most successful innovation projects — and how dramatically those expectations differed from their after-the-fact appraisals. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MAG_Lyu_Fig-2.png" alt="Expectations Were Low for Successful Innovation Projects"></p><p class="attribution"></article></aside></div><p></p><h3> Practices to Search for More-Radical Opportunities</h3><p> When executives rely on their initial assessments of an innovation&#39;s radicalness, they tend to skip the work needed to purposefully consider a broad array of contexts and industries the idea might affect. That leaves the organization less aware of emergent opportunities and more likely to treat them as out-of-scope surprises, or even annoyances, when they crop up. R&amp;D teams or technology scouts might discover breakthrough technologies but be unable to prove that the market is big enough.</p><p> “We have big ideas that are incrementally executed,” the CTO at one company told us. He went on to describe an example in which the first, most obvious application of a novel technological platform that fit with one business unit&#39;s expectations was easily transitioned to a commercialization team, but many other potential opportunities were left on the table, completely unexplored. At another company, the central R&amp;D organization was tasked with identifying, selecting, and developing advanced technology programs that would produce breakthroughs aligned with the company&#39;s current business units, according to the CTO. Two years later, he realized that the most exciting opportunities emerging from these programs were in fact not aligned with the business units, but since R&amp;D hadn&#39;t planned for this outcome, no alternative mechanism was in place for pursuing them.</p><p> In both of these cases, two organizational competencies might have helped the innovation teams uncover hidden breakthrough potential: <em>proactive discovery</em> and <em>wide-eyed incubation</em> .</p><p> Proactive discovery is the work a team undertakes to identify the myriad possibilities an invention might offer. Team members invest effort upfront to identify the multitude of applications, use cases, and markets that might be newly created as a result of these advances. Through outreach to thought leaders, engagement with experts from other industries, and a host of other methods that provoke associative thinking, discovery teams can uncover the opportunity landscape that a novel technology, idea, or business model could offer.</p><p> Proactive discovery can play a big role in convincing internal decision makers that a specific opportunity is worth pursuing. It can also affect how big an impact a technological breakthrough can have, by broadening the number of industries and markets it can potentially influence. And, of course, when radical innovations do surface, it can profoundly affect the company&#39;s growth.</p><p> Nutrition and bioscience company DSM engaged in proactive discovery in the early 2010s, after having made advances in protein development that led to the development of its clean cow feed additive. The additive reduces a cow&#39;s methane emissions by more than 30% without any adverse effects on the animal&#39;s welfare, feed consumption, or performance.</p><p></p><p> The members of DSM&#39;s strategic innovation team also looked for other applications for the additive: They read scientific and market research, attended conferences and trade shows, interacted with thought leaders, and imagined potential applications. The team also identified and catalogued many potential opportunities for proteins while maintaining the highest sustainability standards. As a result, DSM was well prepared as these markets began to emerge. It has since commercialized products such as a canola-based protein isolate that can be used to increase the quantity and quality of protein in plant-based alternatives without introducing soy or gluten; textured vegetable proteins to be used as food additives; and solutions for manufacturing cheese, ice cream, and other dairy products.</p><p> At DuPont, several years after the project analysis described earlier, a director of new business development engaged in proactive discovery by placing advertisements in scientific journals and trade magazines soliciting input on potential use cases for new materials arising from ongoing internal R&amp;D programs. Each advertisement described the properties of the material being developed and invited readers — presumably R&amp;D colleagues in other companies — to contact his new business development team with potential applications. An ad for a biodegradable polyester (later named DuPont Biomax) received more than 100 inquiries and resulted in over 20 different applications that DuPont explored. The bio-based materials business ultimately grew from one formulation to an entire family of offerings, none of which had been anticipated.</p><h3> Learning Through Incubation</h3><p> Discovery is a necessary first step, but it is not sufficient for assessing how promising an opportunity might become. Doing this requires a next step — incubation — to more fully examine each of those opportunities that proactive discovery surfaced.</p><p> Wide-eyed incubation is the process of vetting the myriad opportunities and testing the many uncertainties that have been uncovered during proactive discovery. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> This process can involve diverse activities, such as clarifying the performance thresholds needed for a technology to be valuable for a specific use case, working out viable business models that the company is willing to use, or collaborating with partners to fill gaps in the company&#39;s expertise. <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a> New applications can emerge as the market is engaged and technical development proceeds.</p><p></p><p> The interactions with market agents and technical experts during incubation surface additional unanticipated uses and benefits. With wide-eyed incubation, team members are motivated to explore those opportunities rather than narrow their focus and deem the applications out of scope. As the team comes to understand the market, the market comes to understand the potential benefits the technology can deliver, and thus an increased understanding of the radicalness of the innovation takes shape. <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p> Over time, ICL Group, a multinational chemical company, developed and improved a capability to produce high-purity phosphates. They were initially used only in fertilizers, but as the purity levels have improved, they have been incorporated into food and a number of other applications. When a Chinese battery company approached ICL to buy phosphate materials, the ICL team realized that lithium iron phosphate could address problems in the lithium battery market. Ultimately, it won a large grant from the US Department of Energy to explore this and other opportunities adjacent to battery technology.</p><p> These examples show how difficult it is to predict how radical an innovation project will be, even for companies already in the process of incubating the project — just as they show how critical incubation is during the commercialization process for avoiding the loss of important opportunities.</p><h3> Internal R&amp;D Helps Capture an Innovation&#39;s Radicalness Potential</h3><p> With so much unexpected potential emerging during incubation, one might wonder whether the source of the innovation matters. For example, external innovators, such as universities or startups, may look more broadly than an established company that has difficulty seeing beyond its sector, and thus be able to identify and execute on more promising opportunities.</p><p> Surprisingly, our survey data shows that more unanticipated radicalness is found when projects are developed by internal R&amp;D teams: On average, these projects become 1.5 points higher in radicalness (p&lt;.001) on a scale from 1 to 7 than do innovations that are sourced externally. This greater ability to foster radicalness internally makes sense for several reasons. First, organizations that develop, own, and nurture the technology themselves may be better able to communicate within their internal networks about the innovation, and other organizational members may spot a use that hadn&#39;t previously been considered. In a survey of 47 members of the Innovation Research Interchange, a professional association of mid- and senior-level R&amp;D leaders, a number of management practices were positively correlated with commercial success from radical innovation. Of the 15 management practices that were measured, the strength of informal internal networks — the relationships that employees form across functions and divisions to share knowledge and accomplish tasks — was the most strongly and significantly correlated with radical innovation commercial success, with the correlation coefficient r=.56 (p&lt;.0001). <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a></p><p> Many companies seem to recognize the importance of these informal networks. 3M is famous for its Tech Forum poster sessions, in which internal R&amp;D members present their current projects and colleagues from other parts of R&amp;D and the business units come to learn about the R&amp;D portfolio. Many creative collisions have occurred as a result of the forum, which has been run for over 65 years.</p><p></p><p> GE&#39;s fluoroscopic imaging technology was originally developed for use in its avionics unit. The R&amp;D scientist who led that program recognized that GE Medical Systems&#39; Imaging business might benefit from the technology, which could image movement in ways that had the potential to offer whole new levels of diagnostic data over conventional CT scanning technologies. The scientist mentioned the possibility to a colleague in R&amp;D who was dedicated to the GE Medical Systems division, and ultimately this led to the MRI imaging technology that GE commercialized — a completely unexpected breakthrough in the industry.</p><p> A second reason why internal innovation sourcing can be beneficial is that internal leaders have greater control over the strategic choice points that inevitably arise on a technology&#39;s development path than they do with corporate venture investments or university lab research that their company may be funding. Which applications to pursue, which technological platforms to use, how to integrate a radical innovation with other known technologies, and other critical decisions are completely under the control of the company&#39;s decision makers. For externally developed innovations, the large company could take on the role of customer, investor, or board member but would not have absolute decision authority. This type of relationship limits the organization&#39;s ability to deeply understand the nuances of the technology&#39;s potential, or to shape its development path or strategic choices.</p><p> Interestingly, the DuPont experience also provides a case study supportive of the benefits of internal innovation sourcing. Across all 13 projects in its portfolio, DuPont had three winners, a 23% success rate. This is notably higher than what is found when venture capital performance is measured, where win rates are estimated to range from 0.05% to 5%. <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a></p><p> These findings do not negate the importance of open innovation, technology scouting, and external sourcing as critical components of a company&#39;s innovation activities; these relationships and activities often make up for important capability shortfalls. <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a> Rather, our results indicate that relying on open innovation to the exclusion of meaningful investments in purposeful exploratory R&amp;D may decrease the likelihood that a company will realize the innovative potential of a new technology.</p><h3> The Rewards of Unanticipated Radicalness</h3><p> One might imagine that unanticipated radicalness would be a mixed blessing, since radical projects are typically more difficult to implement than incremental innovations. Greater unexpected radicalness could increase the innovation&#39;s impact but could also make its implementation more challenging. Interestingly, this does not seem to be true. While our data affirms that more radical projects are generally harder to implement, if the radicalness emerges as project development progresses (for example, during incubation), it seems to be less difficult to implement than expected.</p><p> These findings suggest an additional benefit of uncovering these hidden radical innovations: They will be disproportionately easy to implement. This is exemplified by a project that a smartphone app company undertook for geolocating customers. The initial purpose of the project was to make weather predictions and inform customers about canceled events. As the project progressed, the team came to recognize more (and more important) ways to use the geolocation information, such as customizing location-specific advertisements, facilitating real-time location exchanges among cohorts for meetups, and providing personalized recommendations based on customers&#39; location histories. With a deeper understanding of the potential breadth of the market and the scope of the technology&#39;s impact that emerged through incubation, the company&#39;s leaders became more willing to invest in its commercialization.</p><p> The pattern of projects becoming easier to implement as they become more radical can be explained through dynamics that emerge when a market is introduced to new technology ( <em>technology push</em> ). While technology push is often criticized as a worse approach to innovation management than listening to the market and meeting its requirements ( <em>market pull</em> ), we find that as the market learns about the technology, technology push can turn into market pull.</p><p> For example, one of our interviewees, a research fellow at IBM, described giving a talk at a scientific conference in which he mentioned a phenomenon associated with a gallium arsenide-based chip. At the end of the presentation, an R&amp;D scientist from another company approached him with a problem he&#39;d been unable to solve; that audience member ultimately became the first customer for a use case that had not been considered by the inventor or his team. This example and others like it demonstrate that as technology push occurs, the market begins to pull, which can smooth the path for implementation.</p><p> The recent rapid development of drone technology is another example of technology push leading to market pull. In our interviews, a leader at an industrial drone startup mentioned starting the business with one “relatively simple goal”: increasing the precision of mapping. As the company developed the technology, it realized that precision mapping could be integrated with other technologies (such as a flight control system) to develop new industrial drone products. The company incubated many of these new use cases, such as drone-based inspection of photovoltaic power plants, which led to many new offerings.</p><p> In sum, the further a technology is taken through the discovery and incubation process, the more it can find promising applications where internal or external users will demand it and smooth the implementation process.</p><h3> Embracing the Surprise of Radicalness</h3><p> We encourage organizations looking to increase their radical innovation capabilities to follow four guiding principles.</p><p> <strong>1. Avoid overdependence on external technological sources.</strong> Depleting internal R&amp;D in an effort to fully embrace open innovation is a path many companies have chosen of late. Our research results suggest that leveraging the full breakthrough impact of innovations without the internal networks, decision control, and deep expertise that come with continued investments in internal R&amp;D will be challenging. Companies might also need to broaden their technology expertise beyond the areas that are directly applicable to the business units, to better explore opportunities that would be more radical.</p><p> <strong>2. Build internal capabilities for proactive discovery.</strong> The objective of discovery is to generate and elaborate the richness of an opportunity landscape. Rather than presuming that a technology offers one solution for a big, widely held problem, use tools to stimulate divergent thinking, imagination, and the early exploration of use cases and their implications in terms of product offerings and market segments. One option is to map technology, applications, market segments, and product formulations, in any order, within a problem/opportunity domain. This process helps teams recognize the many different ways their company could participate in addressing a complex problem area that requires radical innovation.</p><p> <strong>3. Have the patience to cultivate innovation projects through incubation.</strong> During the incubation process, it is possible that a killer application that has never before been imagined will surface as a result of interactions with other niche markets. Tools such as the Learning Plan project management approach and discovery-driven planning can be used to vet opportunities. <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a></p><p></p><p> <strong>4. Staff the discovery and incubation teams with new business creation expertise.</strong> This is not the same thing as R&amp;D skills. Corning&#39;s exploratory marketing and technology teams have engaged in proactive discovery for each major R&amp;D program where there were no immediately obvious use cases but plenty that could be imagined. DuPont eventually instituted inbound marketing teams within R&amp;D to find applications for many of the ideas emanating from its central R&amp;D facility and then begin testing them with interested parties. Each of these examples points to the importance of hiring, developing, and promoting people with strategic innovation opportunity generation and new business creation skills. <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a></p><p></p><p> Ultimately, organizations must be prepared to take advantage of surprises. When companies are laser-focused on finding a technological solution for a known problem, they tend to ignore the unanticipated signals of enthusiasm that come from internal and external markets. Companies that have discovery and incubation capabilities in place must also be willing to devote attention and financing when these types of surprises arise. Part of the art of radical innovation is embracing surprises with an open mind and agile exploration of their potential beyond the confines of the anticipated.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/unleash-the-unexpected-for-radical-innovation/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title>利用基层自动化</title><link/>https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/harnessing-grassroots-automation/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/harnessing-grassroots-automation/#respond</comments><pubDate> Mon, 11 Sep 2023 11:00:28 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Ian Barkin and Thomas H.

class="attribution">贝内代托·克里斯托法尼/theispot.com</p></figcaption></figure><p>公司越来越多地接受这样的想法：帮助非技术员工（那些拥有深厚业务领域专业知识的人）学习直接自动化那些让他们头疼并浪费时间的流程。例如，人力资源员工具有独特的资格来识别其工作中平凡和重复的部分，例如候选人跟踪任务，然后通过一些培训，构建自动化，以减轻他们的重复数据输入和数据清理等杂务。</p><p>虽然组织内所谓的公民开发此类应用程序需要仔细的规划和治理才能有效，<a href="https://hbr.org/2021/06/when-low-code-no-code-development-works-and-when-it-doesnt">但低代码和无代码技术</a>已变得司空见惯，并使此类冒险成为可能。 <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a>具体来说，机器人流程自动化 (RPA) 和更广泛的智能自动化 (IA) 套件允许重新设计和自动化工作流程，现在已经足够简单，功能专家可以自行设计、开发和部署 IT 应用程序和分析模型。不再是所有项目都需要 IT 员工进行调解，因为他们可能无法完全理解最终用户的痛点。这些公民主导的自动化工具允许技术含量较低的人员构建复杂的系统，从而改善他们的工作体验，并且它们已经为许多企业创造了可观的价值。</p><p></p><p>在本文中，我们通过对 AT&amp;T、电通、强生 (J&amp;J)、普华永道、Voya Financial 和 Wesco 六家公司的采访来描述他们为加入公民自动化运动所做的努力。我们还详细介绍了其他组织如何最好地开发这些能力以及这样做的好处和挑战。</p><h3>是什么推动了公民自动化</h3><p>从本质上讲，鼓励非 IT 专业人员参与设计自己的工作工具并不是什么新鲜事。长期以来，企业一直在利用其业务团队来寻求流程改进的想法。例如，六西格码皮带佩戴者接受过改进小型流程的培训。新鲜的是，今天的公民实际上可以勾画并运行他们曾经只能向 IT 开发团队描述的未来状态。</p><p>利用公民的力量在一定程度上是必要的，因为根本没有足够的人具备完成公司议程上的大量数字计划所需的专业 IT 技能。即使是保守估计，到 2030 年，<a href="https://codesubmit.io/blog/shortage-of-developers/">技术人员也会严重短缺</a><a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">。2</a>在交易系统之间移动信息、更新电子表格，甚至撰写标准格式电子邮件等任务的自动化时机已经成熟，但这通常不会发生，因为拥有技能的人无法完成这项工作。</p><p>在会计咨询公司普华永道，公民自动化工作源于一项培训<a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/upskilling/our-digital-transformation-journey.html">员工的计划，这些员工被称为“数字加速器”，</a>以帮助业务发展，而无需按比例增加员工数量。 <a id="reflink3" class="reflink" href="#ref3">3</a>数据、自动化和人工智能被确定为该计划的三大支柱。自愿学习新技能和技术并被选入该计划的员工被要求专注于三大支柱之一。参与者可以从常规的客户服务工作中抽出时间来寻求各种技能提升选择。专注于自动化的员工接受了工具（包括 RPA、数据准备和混合以及简单的机器学习模型）和 6 Sigma 流程改进方法的培训，并被要求识别可从自动化中受益的流程。一个以审计为中心的数字加速器创建了一种自动化功能，通过从许多不同的电子表格中自动提取和聚合数据来确定客户审计所需的任务范围。它节省了 40 个小时的审计时间，并被采纳为审计师与其他客户一起使用的标准工具。</p><p>当然，公民主导的自动化兴起的主要驱动力是某些自动化编程的相对简单性的相应大幅提高。</p><h3>必要的工具和培训</h3><p>自动化工具的快速发展和民主化推动了公民自动化运动。与其他形式的人工智能相比，RPA 和 IA 往往更容易实施且成本更低。 RPA 被广泛用于访问来自多个系统的数据并自动执行结构化、信息密集型任务，例如路由传入的客户电子邮件或更新交易系统中的订单状态。当与机器学习和字符识别等 IA 工具结合使用时，它们还可以做出数据驱动的决策，并从手写的客户表格或合同中的关键条款等文档中提取重要信息。</p><p></p><p>有多种技术选择。首先是来自 UiPath、Blue Prism 和 Automation Anywhere 等供应商的标准 RPA 工具。这些学习和使用起来可能很复杂——不是因为它们需要编码，而是因为它们可能需要与交易系统集成。通过适当的培训，许多非技术员工可以用它们构建简单的自动化。其次是专门为公民开发的技术，因此很少或根本不需要编码。一些主流 RPA 软件有更简单的版本，旨在实现公民自动化。例如，微软已将易于使用的 RPA 功能作为其 Office 生产力套件的一部分。</p><p>我们在研究中接触过的大多数组织都提供时长在 40 到 80 小时之间的公民自动化培训计划，许多组织还通过领先的自动化工具供应商提供的指导来补充其计划。培训计划还可以包括黑客马拉松，学员可以在其中运用他们的技能快速构建 RPA 应用程序。</p><p>由于 RPA 系统通常链接到现有交易系统并从中提取数据，因此公民自动化人员通常需要了解企业 IT 架构才能安全访问和使用数据。但是，如果公民开发的 RPA 应用程序经过 IT 专业人员认证并解决了与其他系统集成的任何问题，则可能不需要这些知识。我们研究的一些组织已经建立了自动化卓越中心（COE）来处理所有此类集成和合规性，使公民能够专注于将自动化应用于他们理解的流程，而不需要他们熟悉底层架构的复杂性。 <a id="reflink4" class="reflink" href="#ref4">4</a></p><p>最近，生成式人工智能在企业场景中的出现已经开始让 RPA 的设计和实施变得更加容易。例如，自 OpenAI 的 ChatGPT 于 2022 年底发布以来，多家 RPA 供应商已经宣布其 RPA 系统与 ChatGPT 提供的语言功能之间的接口。不久之后，用户就可以很容易地用几乎任何自然语言指定自动化系统所需的属性，并自动生成系统的工作原型。如果出现提示，生成式人工智能系统还应该能够自动创建易于理解的工作流程和决策规则描述。</p><p>追求智能自动化的公司可能会提供机器学习功能，以便与 RPA 相结合。在大多数情况下，这将涉及自动化机器学习或 AutoML 系统。 <a id="reflink5" class="reflink" href="#ref5">5</a>这些系统自动执行数据科学中涉及的许多任务，包括次要数据清理、特征工程、替代算法建模以及用于部署的代码/API 生成。一些 AutoML 系统在技术上很复杂，但其他系统更适合仅接受过一些定量培训或背景知识的公民数据科学家使用。例如，在 AT&amp;T，公民数据科学家可以使用预定义的客户流失数据和功能来确定哪些手机客户应该成为促销或其他干预措施的目标，以防止客户流失。然后，RPA 机器人可以自动通知这些客户有关促销的信息。</p><p> <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/06/before-automating-your-companys-processes-find-ways-to-improve-them">在自动化之前改进流程</a>几乎总是一个好主意，并且对公民进行渐进式流程改进技术（例如六西格码或精益）的培训可能是有益的。 <a id="reflink6" class="reflink" href="#ref6">6</a>集中的流程改进专家小组还可以在推出自动化之前提供快速流程分析。然而，有一个案例表明，自动化现有的“混乱”流程仍然可以提供价值。这也可能是早期公民所有的努力中最有可能出现的情况，因为他们倾向于专注于数字化他们所做的事情以及他们如何做——尽管在这种情况下使用了新的工具和技术。</p><p>公司可以采取多种方法来选择员工参与自动化活动。有些公司，例如电气和通信技术经销商 Wesco，很高兴地让所有感兴趣的公民自动化人员参加培训。 Wesco 项目的负责人告诉我们，该公司愿意培训任何表示感兴趣的人，并且他相信该组织甚至可以从项目退出者中受益，他们仍然可以充当“自动化大使”。</p><p>其他公司，如普华永道，有一个正式的申请流程来评估和“接纳”志愿者。制药和消费品公司强生 (J&amp;J) 要求使用 RPA 的公民完成正式的培训课程并获得技术认证。那里的领导者表示，总的来说，公司认为具有逻辑思维、技术能力和学习能力的人是成为公民开发人员的良好候选人。强生公司还寻求与员工所从事的工作相适应，其中基于规则的工作尤其可取。</p><p></p><h3>领先组织如何支持公民自动化</h3><p>一些公司从企业最高层支持公民自动化并集中协调活动；另一些人则满足于让一千朵花更加自主地绽放。然而，大多数都采用某种程度的集中协调、技术标准和培训。</p><p>为了扩大公民自动化的影响，一些公司建立了由员工开发的可访问的自动化程序集合，供同事使用。普华永道创建了最广泛的图书馆之一，拥有与客户服务地图一致的数千个自动化和数字资产。在将资产添加到市场之前，会根据其技术能力、潜在业务价值以及是否符合政策准则来审查解决方案及其底层代码。然后将其“签入”图书馆，供其他人提取和使用。</p><p>全球广告公司 Dentsu 是公民自动化项目最早的开发商之一，它建立了一个自动化中心，公民自动化人员可以在这里贡献他们创建的解决方案。该公司目前拥有 1,000 多名积极贡献的参与者，其市场上有 350 个解决方案。该中心受欢迎的公民主导的提交包括用于准备和操作基于电子表格的报告、导出和归档发票、处理时间表报告和电子邮件提醒的自动化，以及提取数据并在系统之间移动数据的各种方法。</p><p> Wesco 的大约 200 名员工在专门的 COE 的支持下工作，该 COE 通过处理更多技术任务、审查和签署自动化设计以及确保遵守公司治理和安全协议来补充他们的自动化工作。在一项计划中，COE 为公民开发人员构建了一个框架，用于配置从供应商门户和网站提取数据，以实现更好的实时发货和订单履行跟踪。由于供应商超过 50,000 家，而且所有供应商都具有独特的界面，这项任务需要数百名 IT 员工才能完成。相反，公民能够慢慢地逐步将供应商的投入数字化——这是一项风险低、复杂性低的任务。然后，COE 能够在此基础上通过与公司的核心系统连接来向客户提供及时的信息。正如项目发起人所说，“美妙之处在于每个人都在做自己擅长的事情。”</p><p>在电信公司 AT&amp;T，广泛鼓励公民自动化和公民数据科学，并且这两个领域都有活跃的社区。 <a id="reflink7" class="reflink" href="#ref7">7</a>想要参与更复杂的基于机器学习的决策的公民自动化开发人员可以使用各种 AutoML 工具。 AT&amp;T 还拥有各种可用于机器学习的可重用数据集，以及包含机器学习模型预定义特征的“特征存储”。例如，用户可以轻松地执行搜索来查找涉及“流失”或“网络性能”的所有功能。他们还可以通过 API 访问已计算出的常见预测结果（例如客户流失）的分数。</p><p>最成功的公民自动化者在一些公司受到表彰并获得经济奖励。强生举办年度展示会，公民开发者因其解决方案对业务成果的影响而获得认可。在普华永道，那些成功创建供整个组织使用的自动化资产的人如果得到广泛使用，就会获得经济奖励。重要的是，雇主要在经济上或其他方面承认公民的工作所带来的好处，否则他们可能会试图将其转移到其他地方。 （例如，在拥有多项远程全职工作的个人的在线讨论板上，我们遇到了一些参与者，他们能够通过自动化自己的任务来产生足够的工作成果。）</p><h3>管理公民自动化项目的策略</h3><p>大规模有效的公民自动化并不是自发出现的。它需要通过支持职能来促进，通过社区发展努力来鼓励，并通过政策和护栏来引导。还应该监控公民的努力并跟踪他们的结果，以了解他们是否有价值和是否在成长。也许最重要的是，公民自动化工作必须得到组织领导者的重视和赞助。</p><p>在 J&amp;J，为了更好地协调自动化计划，公司的 IT 组织、全球服务职能部门和一些公民开发人员从业者之间建立了合作伙伴关系。合作伙伴开发了一个框架，通过精心策划的技术培训课程、一套技术标准和评估用例的标准来加强对公民开发人员的支持。</p><p> AT&amp;T 开发了一个活跃的公民自动化社区，并得到中央数据科学和自动化组织的支持。自动化始于业务运营团队，并迅速发展到约 300 个 RPA 机器人。经过一年自下而上的活动，企业 COE 成立了。现在，A&amp;T 拥有超过 3,000 个机器人，其中 92% 的自动化用例由公民构建。中心小组制定自动化技术标准，并为那些希望加入社区的人定期举办会议和培训课程。</p><p>普华永道数字加速器计划得到了美国主席兼高级合伙人 Tim Ryan 的大力支持。该计划中的公民自动化人员对于他们从事的自动化活动拥有广泛的自由裁量权，但只有最成功的产品才会由公司集中的产品和技术团队推广。该小组的领导者决定哪些公民倡议成为整个组织的企业资产。</p><p> Wesco 公民倡议没有单一的执行发起人；相反，它得到了整个领导团队的支持，并由全球智能自动化领导者 Maxim Ioffe 协调。 Ioffe 还负责自动化 COE，从而为与 IT、高级分析、IA 和业务团队中的公民进行协作提供单点联系。</p><p>我们的研究表明，大多数认真对待公民发展的公司都会投资创建由具有 RPA 和 IA 开发背景的专业人员组成的自动化 COE，以加速公民参与。这些企业的一部分，例如投资公司 Voya Financial，在一个支持组织中结合了自动化和流程改进功能。 <a id="reflink8" class="reflink" href="#ref8">8</a>这些集中资源对于需要深度自动化和流程改进技能的大型或战略业务流程非常重要。他们还可以为公民活动提供培训（面向公民的工具和流程改进）、认证和自动化项目审查。</p><p>电通以自上而下的监督开始其自动化方法。最初的目的是实现大规模企业流程的自动化，但分析发现，它们的数量不足以使其成为主要焦点。相反，该公司的第一位首席自动化官（任何公司中最早的此类官员之一）马克斯·切普拉索夫（Max Cheprasov）得出的结论是，有更多机会实现小型本地工作流程的自动化，并且这项工作很大程度上可以由公民来完成。切普拉索夫的团队开发了培训、举办了黑客马拉松，并为公民自动化项目开发了一个集中中心。他非常相信自下而上方法的有效性，因此将其带到了他现在工作的中型营销服务公司。</p><h3>权衡风险和回报</h3><p>公民发展存在风险。公民可能会自动化不良的流程工作流程，无法记录他们的工作并离开公司，在开发自动化过程中犯错误，或者他们的机器人与企业交易系统的集成不佳。当然，专业的开发人员也可能会犯这样的错误，但通常还有其他专业人士支持他们。</p><p>那么，关键的一步是认证公民开发的自动化，以便整个部门或公司在自动化中心或市场中持续使用。该认证可以帮助确保自动化是使用最先进的工具构建的，并且其功能和风险得到充分理解。例如，普华永道有一个治理流程，可以审查公民自动化提交的内容，以确保它们符合法律和监管要求。 AT&amp;T 还让专业人员在将公民的努力投入生产部署之前对其进行审查。</p><p>但一位领导者告诉我们，他的治理关注点更广泛，涉及业务连续性和变革管理。 “我们是否为 30% 的金融在公民开发的应用程序上运行做好了适当的准备？”他问。 “我们意识到一个临界点即将到来，并想知道我们是否对该事件采取了适当的控制措施。我们不确定我们是否这样做。”</p><p>虽然公司希望公民主导的转型能够创造巨大的价值，但在大多数公司中，迄今为止自动化的范围很小且集中。扩大这些试点工作以解决端到端企业业务流程将是一个未知的领域。公民自动化是否会顺利地推动数字化转型的新努力，还是会造成影子 IT（在没有 IT 功能知识或专业知识的情况下开发的应用程序）和技术债务（依赖过时技术的应用程序）的混乱局面？即使是我们采访过的早期采用者也不确定。目前，公民自动化的发展似乎总体上是积极的，但随着时间的推移和更多的采用，可能会出现问题。</p><p></p><p>这些风险被回报所抵消。根据德勤全球智能自动化调查，自动化计划最常见的目标是降低成本：公司预计自动化任务的成本平均会降低 30% 以上。 <a id="reflink9" class="reflink" href="#ref9">9</a>公司还强调了让人们自由地执行更高价值的任务而不是自动化工作的好处。一些公司衡量员工节省的工作时间。例如，据电通统计，其公民举措节省了超过 400,000 个小时的员工时间。 AT&amp;T 计算得出，其自动化大部分由公民创建，每年可节省约 270,000 个小时，总体投资回报率为 20 倍。除了受益于这些时间节省之外，组织通常会发现员工在改进和数字化工作方面投入更多。</p><p></p><p>公民自动化也有明显的非金钱利益。员工获得新技能，减少苦差事上的时间。任务数字化的发生速度比其他方式更快，并且更多的员工参与到变革的发生中。</p><p>显而易见的是，用户友好的数字工具正在推动新型混合业务/技术开发人员的创建。这些员工现在能够比现代企业历史上的任何时候都更快、更轻松地构思和部署解决方案。</p><p></p>

This advice is based on two assumptions: (1) More information leads to better understanding of the decision at hand and possible consequences, and (2) an emphasis on gathering information rather than relying primarily on one&#39;s own knowledge may reduce harmful biases.</p><p></p><p> However, a growing body of <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-120709-145346">research</a> shows that CEOs may often be better off putting more trust in the simple rules of thumb known as heuristics. These usually spring from a leader&#39;s direct experience, are applied deliberately, and frequently result in superior decision outcomes. Our recent <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/joms.12913">study</a> , published in the <cite>Journal of Management Studies</cite> , suggests that CEOs who use more heuristics in making decisions can accelerate the speed of new product development in their organizations and achieve greater overall business performance. Another <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sej.1">study</a> , by Christopher Bingham et al. in <cite>Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal</cite> , suggests that using heuristics for international expansion decisions can lead to higher sales and revenue growth from those initiatives.</p><h3> When (and Why) Heuristics</h3><p> Research finds that heuristics work best under three conditions.</p><p> <strong>When the decision environment is noisy.</strong> In such an environment, more information is unlikely to lead to a better understanding of a specific decision problem. For example, when executives make choices about which innovation projects to invest in based on estimated market size, feasibility, or timeline, these data points often reflect the subjective evaluations of potential project leaders rather than objective facts. Using heuristics under such conditions filters out noise in the decision-making process.</p><p></p><p> Research shows that simple heuristics, such as “invest in projects with the most advantages” or “invest in the project that the most experienced team member prefers,” can be as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/mar.21397">accurate</a> in selecting successful innovation projects as comprehensive decision-making while also accelerating the speed of decision-making.</p><p> <strong>When decision makers face a highly dynamic environment.</strong> In this case, information becomes outdated quickly, and using outdated information can diminish decision quality. For instance, when selecting target customers for new marketing initiatives, it can be more effective to use simple heuristics rather than relying on past, possibly outdated customer data. The simple rule “target customers who have bought from us in the past six months” can predict future purchasing behavior more <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1509/jmkg.72.3.082">accurately</a> than complex models trained on large amounts of older data.</p><p> <strong>When obtaining large amounts of information is difficult.</strong> In the case of hiring, for example, it&#39;s impractical or costly to obtain extensive information on every potential candidate. Employers instead have to rely on a few pieces of information, such as a candidate&#39;s CV and their impression of a candidate&#39;s performance in an interview.</p><p> Research <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4014970">suggests</a> that using heuristics in such situations can forecast future job performance more precisely than analyzing detailed information obtained in structured interviews. For example, managers might ask themselves three simple <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/20/jeff-bezos-3-question-rule-for-hiring-new-amazon-employees.html">questions</a> when considering a job candidate: Does the candidate have exceptional ability? Do I admire the candidate&#39;s track record? And will the candidate raise the level of performance within the team? They might choose to hire a candidate only if the answer to all three questions is “yes.” However, heuristics used in hiring must focus on performance-related criteria and not have the effect of unfairly discriminating against individuals or reinforcing social biases.</p><p> In short, heuristics work best in environments that are noisy and dynamic, and where information is scarce.</p><p></p><h3> How Heuristics Can Clarify Thinking</h3><p> To understand how using heuristics can help in practice, let&#39;s consider how they help leaders address four fundamental questions in new product development.</p><p> <strong>On which opportunities should we focus in new product development?</strong> Comprehensive decision-making in this regard would involve instructing development teams to analyze a wide variety of market segments and technologies to identify the most promising opportunities. Alternatively, CEOs can use heuristics to focus their efforts on certain customer types (“develop products only for end customers”) or specific product types (“develop only software products”). Such heuristics enable a narrower focus for new product development and a higher likelihood of generating more innovative <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2307/2666981">ideas</a> . CEOs can also use heuristics to limit the number of projects that can be developed in parallel, ensuring that sufficient resources are available for each project.</p><p> <strong>How do we choose among competing projects?</strong> Heuristics can also help CEOs effectively choose among projects within a specified search field. Many factors can influence the attractiveness of a new project, such as future profitability, risk, product advantage, feasibility, market size, competition, and length of payback period. When using comprehensive decision-making, CEOs carefully analyze and weigh each of these factors. However, simple heuristics are often faster and more effective when deciding which projects to move forward with and which to drop. CEOs can assign positive and negative scores (+1 / -1) to each factor for each project, tally these scores, and select the project with the highest total. Or they can eliminate all projects that score poorly on the factors they consider the most important, a heuristic called <em>elimination by aspects</em> . Research <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264437916_Fast_and_frugal_heuristics_for_new_product_screening_-_Is_managerial_judgment_'good_enough'">shows</a> that these two heuristics can identify which projects are likely to fail and which are likely to succeed in the vast majority of cases.</p><p> <strong>What&#39;s the right pace of new product development?</strong> Heuristics can assist CEOs and managers in establishing a sense of rhythm and pace for new product development. For example, Apple uses the simple rule of “release a new version of the iPhone every 24 months” to structure its development activities. This rule promotes efficiency by providing employees with a continuous and predictable sense of urgency, facilitates the integration of external suppliers, and smooths the transition of employees from one project to the next. Similarly, some <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393807">CEOs</a> set the rule that all new-product projects must be finished within 18 months to provide a steady rhythm and pace. Other <a href="https://hbr.org/2001/01/strategy-as-simple-rules">CEOs</a> set the rule that new B2B product releases must be synchronized with customer release cycles, forcing development teams to reduce their project scopes to deliver projects within customer deadlines.</p><p> <strong>How can we balance efficiency and flexibility?</strong> Development groups must be efficient (that is, streamline processes to deliver products under time and resource constraints), and they must also have the flexibility to explore and experiment, but focusing on one often comes at the expense of the other. Heuristics can help CEOs effectively balance this trade-off. For instance, 3M famously uses the rule of thumb that all developers can spend 15% of their <a href="https://www.3m.co.uk/3M/en_GB/careers/culture/15-percent-culture/">time</a> working on projects based on their own ideas. This simple rule balances efficiency and flexibility by determining the time available for independent exploration, in order to foster innovation while effectively managing resources. Similarly, CEOs have the option to stipulate that a specific number of projects must embrace high experimentation (such as “one-fifth of all projects should be radically innovative”) or set limits on the resources allocated each year for entirely novel projects (“10% of the budget is reserved for new-to-the-world ideas”). Research has <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.44.6.743">shown</a> that such simple rules can empower companies to develop highly innovative products despite limited resources.</p><h3> Getting the Most Value From Rules of Thumb</h3><p> In order to gain the advantages of speedier decision-making with heuristics and still maintain decision quality, CEOs who employ them should consider the following actions:</p><p> <strong>Use heuristics in the right context.</strong> Heuristics are effective in environments that are noisy and dynamic and where information is hard to obtain, whereas comprehensive decision-making is more effective in stable environments where large amounts of objective information are readily available. CEOs should thus adapt their decision-making style to the characteristics of the environment.</p><p> For example, when making decisions on which companies to acquire in mature markets, comprehensive decision-making can be effective because objective information on acquisition targets is readily available. In contrast, when CEOs acquire companies in highly dynamic markets experiencing rapid technological development, heuristics may be more effective, since more information often does not necessarily lead to better predictions of a target&#39;s value.</p><p> <strong>Develop and refine your own heuristics.</strong> Effective heuristics are not arbitrary — they are developed through careful reflection and an understanding of difficult business problems. Heuristics are reliable when they capture causal regularities in a simple rule, but they can introduce <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/joms.12891">bias</a> when they do not capture a causal link. Reserving space for careful reflection when generating heuristics may therefore be time well spent for CEOs.</p><p></p><p> Developing one&#39;s own heuristics is crucial because the insights captured in a heuristic developed by someone else may not transfer to a different decision context. Heuristics also become more <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sej.1312">effective</a> when CEOs put them into practice, observe their outcomes, and refine them over time. Research finds that a simple heuristic for international expansion for a supplier to the pharmaceutical industry, such as “enter countries that have a lot of pharma activity,” can, with experience, be refined into the more complex and effective heuristic of “enter countries that have lots of pharma activity and are home to the headquarters of a large pharmaceutical company.”</p><p></p><p> <strong>Share and explain the story behind a heuristic.</strong> The heuristics developed by CEOs will serve as decision guidelines for many members of an organization, who will themselves apply rules such as those defining what kinds of international markets may be of interest or what kinds of development projects to pursue. However, because heuristics are very short and simple by nature, they don&#39;t convey the logic behind them. Sharing the story about why a heuristic was created increases the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joms.12808?af=R">chances</a> that employees will remember and apply it.</p><p></p><p> Recent advances in data analytics — and many organizations&#39; success at gaining useful insights from these tools — suggest that analyzing large amounts of information using complex algorithms may be the most effective way to make decisions. However, many managerial decisions need to be made in noisy and dynamic environments, where quality information can be hard to obtain and evaluate. In such environments, simple rules of thumb can lead to faster and better choices than complex analyses based on large amounts of information. We encourage CEOs and managers to understand the value of heuristics and learn how to develop and use them as a complement to thorough information gathering and analysis in decision-making.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-potency-of-shortcuts-in-decision-making/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Strategic Alignment With AI and Smart KPIs</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/strategic-alignment-with-ai-and-smart-kpis/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/strategic-alignment-with-ai-and-smart-kpis/#respond</comments><pubDate> Tue, 05 Sep 2023 11:00:55 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[David Kiron, Michael Schrage, François Candelon, Shervin Khodabandeh, and Michael Chu. <p class="mt20"><strong>David Kiron</strong> is the editorial director, research, of <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> and program lead for its <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/big-ideas/">Big Ideas research initiatives</a> .</p><p class="mt20"> <strong>Michael Schrage</strong> is a research fellow with the MIT Sloan School of Management&#39;s Initiative on the Digital Economy.

In spring 2023, we fielded a global survey and subsequently analyzed records from 3,043 respondents representing more than 25 industries and 100 countries. We also interviewed 17 executives leading AI initiatives in a broad range of companies and industries, including financial services, media and entertainment, retail, travel and transportation, and life sciences.</p><p> Our research examines how managers and leaders use AI to enhance strategic measurement to advance strategic outcomes. It explores how organizations have adapted — and even generated new — KPIs with AI to define and deliver measurably better performance.</p></aside><p> Aligning operations with strategy is a critical leadership task. Turbulent market conditions, agile competitors, and ongoing demands to digitally upgrade operations and processes make strategic alignment more challenging to manage. Digitally savvy leaders are addressing the alignment challenge by improving how they use and develop KPIs.</p><p> Drawing on a global survey of more than 3,000 managers and 17 executive interviews, we find leaders across the business spectrum using AI to enhance how KPIs are prioritized, organized, and shared. These enhancements have a direct, measurable effect on strengthening strategic alignment. These leaders also deploy AI to improve the accuracy, detail, and predictive capabilities of KPIs themselves. The improvements individually and collectively generate greater situational awareness and improve how corporate functions work together to achieve strategic outcomes.</p><p></p><p> Leaders acknowledge that they need new measurement capabilities and improved metrics to better anticipate and navigate strategic opportunities and threats. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a> They recognize that new AI-based measurement abilities can deliver new performance insights and metrics, strengthen alignment, and improve outcomes. Our findings represent a clear and coherent call to action for leaders to create more integrated systems of forward-looking and interconnected KPIs.</p><p> These AI-enriched KPIs, or <em>smart</em> KPIs, can effectively act as an enterprise GPS, advising people about where they are, where they need to go, and how best to get there. These smart KPIs offer more detailed and accurate descriptions about what is happening in the business, more incisive predictions about what is likely to happen, and, in some cases, more proactive suggestions for what actions managers should take. Smarter, more forward-looking KPIs improve on legacy KPIs left uncoordinated and unchallenged due to time and executive inertia.</p><p> We discuss examples — from several industries — that illustrate how leaders use these new capabilities to achieve their strategic goals and offer specific recommendations for using AI to enrich KPIs and advance strategic alignment.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4></h4><p> Smart KPIs are forward-looking and interconnected KPIs informed by artificial intelligence.</p></article></aside></div><h3> Strengthening Strategic Alignment With AI</h3><p> KPIs were always intended to be mechanisms for aligning organizational behaviors with strategic objectives. Most managers, however, do not believe that their KPIs <em>in practice</em> reflect strategic aspirations; they recognize that their KPIs need to be improved. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a> Our research shows that leaders who enrich their KPIs with AI are more likely to see alignment benefits, such as improved cross-functional coordination. They are more effective at prioritizing KPIs, identifying and building relationships among KPIs, and sharing KPI-related data across teams. They treat KPIs more as assets to improve and less as targets to hit.</p><h4> Prioritizing KPIs With AI</h4><p> Deciding which KPIs to emphasize and prioritize is a well-known challenge of strategic alignment: “We need to do a better job aligning on our KPIs” was a common refrain in our qualitative research. Interviewees widely cited executives&#39; gut feelings as a key source of KPI disagreement. Survey respondents who reported that their company has used AI to prioritize its KPIs were 4.3 times more likely to see better alignment between functions than those who did not. Prioritizing KPIs with AI improves data-driven decisions and lays the groundwork for stronger strategic alignment.</p><p> Maersk, the Danish transportation, shipping, and logistics company, used AI to reassess and define how it measures throughput and the productivity of its network of 65 assets in ports, transportation, and warehouses worldwide. Front-line managers had to decide whether key performance was best defined by loading and unloading ships or trucks as quickly as possible (maximizing throughput) or by managing the loading process so that the transportation could reliably depart as scheduled. Was the right KPI speed or schedule reliability?</p><p></p><p> This decision would have enormous practical ramifications for the business. Using more equipment in <a href="https://www.apmterminals.com/en/about/our-company">APM terminals</a> for loading and unloading would increase throughput but increase short-term costs (extra equipment meant extra expenses). Using just enough equipment to ensure on-time departures, in contrast, would contain costs but limit throughput. Based on experience, onsite front-line managers believed that speed — unloading and loading ships as quickly as possible — was the right performance measure.</p><p> To test this hypothesis, Maersk&#39;s data science team developed digital twins — AI-driven models — to represent each approach and assess their effects across the value chain. They concluded that using less loading equipment would preempt bottlenecks at transshipment points or when making connections with other modes of transport, such as road and rail.</p><p> They also discovered that going faster at one port led to slowdowns elsewhere. Keeping to a reliable schedule also reduced costs and resulted in more on-time arrivals. Going more slowly was “a counterintuitive metric,” says Holly Landry, Maersk&#39;s chief data officer. “Using a digital twin for the supply chain both explained and justified using less equipment. It saved in the millions — at just one terminal.”</p><p> Now, the company is rolling out digital twins across its value chain. With AI, Maersk prioritized the right KPI, which then led to more efficient, aligned performance across the enterprise and increased customer satisfaction with reliable deliveries.</p><h4> Ensembling KPIs With AI</h4><p> Discovering interdependencies among KPIs with AI facilitates the creation of KPI “ensembles” that bundle distinct KPIs for different — but connected — business activities. Examples of KPI ensembles include employee productivity and customer engagement, profit margins and market share, and quality manufacturing output and return on assets. AI plays a critical role in discerning otherwise hidden patterns that link one KPI with another. Since these patterns often span multiple functions and stakeholders, KPI ensembles can break down silos and increase collaboration between different stakeholders, enhancing organizational alignment.</p><p> Pernod Ricard, the $10 billion global spirits company, uses AI to describe and deepen the connection between two of its most important KPIs: profit margins and market share. In the past, these KPIs were siloed and separated, each with its own set of measures. (The finance function focused on profitability, while sales and marketing focused on market share.) The company now deploys AI to deliver insights into how commercial and marketing investments that improve profits — such as media or in-store activation — also influence market share objectives and vice versa. Instead of seeking to maximize each individual KPI, the spirits maker now seeks to optimize both KPIs in concert with each other.</p><p> “If you can imagine moving a cursor between market share optimization objectives and margin optimization objectives,” says Pierre-Yves Calloc&#39;h, Pernod Ricard&#39;s chief digital officer, “you need to know how the required investments vary to reach these objectives. AI is going to give you that information. With AI, we can better align market share KPIs, margin KPIs, and required investments to reach them.” This capability transformed how Pernod Ricard&#39;s leadership allocates capital and balances its aspirations for profitability and market share.</p><p></p><h4> Making KPIs Shared, Visible, and Trusted</h4><p> Broadly, sharing KPIs means sharing accountability, sharing information, or both. Sharing accountability for KPIs is typically a leadership decision. Sharing performance information depends on technology and data access. Our research identifies several ways that AI enhances KPI information sharing and promotes collaboration among different parts of an organization.</p><p> Using AI to share KPIs offers specific benefits that can strengthen strategic alignment. Companies that use AI to share KPIs are five times more likely to see improved alignment between functions and three times more likely to be agile and responsive than organizations that do not use AI to share KPIs. As one executive remarked, “We need to do more to share KPIs. … What are the right KPIs to share that will allow us to ensure that one thing isn&#39;t counterproductively overriding the other?” Improving visibility into companywide KPI outcomes and performance drivers— with the appropriate data and AI applications — bolsters managers&#39; abilities to share, discuss, and navigate tensions among KPIs.</p><p> At Sanofi, AI brought together the data that drives the pharmaceutical company&#39;s integrated business plan (IBP) — an enormous task for a business that has made 300 acquisitions over the past 50 years. In 2019, incoming CEO Paul Hudson championed data democratization, which required new data standards for quality and governance, as well as new technical infrastructures for processing and distribution. Performance data on key IBP metrics were eventually consolidated and shared with 10,000 top executives worldwide via a smart new digital interface called Plai (for its easy-to-access, easy-to-use, AI-powered functionality).</p><p></p><p> This approachable AI tool, also referred to as “snackable AI” by its developers, offers visibility into companywide performance and enables managers to have constructive discussions about performance. These conversations would have been impossible before — not because the data was unavailable but because the algorithm introduced a level of objectivity that made decisions and conversations more organic, trusted, and effective, says Stephanie Androski, Sanofi&#39;s head of global finance operations and transformation.</p><p> “We now have one number that&#39;s going behind our sales forecast, and it&#39;s the central point for multiple other KPIs. If we&#39;re predicting a potential out-of-stock situation for a product, not only does it give us the ability to say, &#39;Oh, wait a minute — the AI is predicting we might be out of stock of that product in four months. Is that real and can we get ahead of it?&#39; It also gives us the ability as finance to ask, &#39;Are the sales too ambitious for this product? Will we lose market share?&#39; or &#39;What does this do to the overall forecast?&#39; Because everything is more out in the open, and because you can see it, it&#39;s really helped increase that dialogue and productivity.”</p><p> The essential leadership takeaway is that organizing and sharing KPI data with AI can deliver a valuable, trusted platform for collaboration and alignment.</p><h3> Three Types of Smart KPIs</h3><p> As KPIs evolve, their contributions to strategic alignment evolve as well. Our research suggests that there are three ways that AI-enriched KPIs improve on metrics that simply track performance. These smart KPIs better describe the world as it is (ongoing and past performance) and better anticipate how it likely will be (future performance). In some cases, smart KPIs also indicate what can or should be done to promote better outcomes. Executive dashboards, for example, typically color-code KPIs: Red indicates that performance is down, and green means performance meets/exceeds expectations. This coding is a simple type of call to action that traditional KPIs and dashboards provide. Smart KPIs go further: They can make more detailed and specific recommendations about next steps and diagnose the implications for other KPIs.</p><p> Thus, smart KPIs improve on traditional KPIs in three overlapping senses: They better describe and <em>predict</em> performance and <em>prescribe</em> more detailed and valuable recommendations. These three types of smart KPIs map to a well-known distinction between descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. This KPI typology is explained in more detail below.</p><p> <strong>1. Smart Descriptive KPIs.</strong> These KPIs synthesize historical and current data to deliver insights on <em>what happened</em> or <em>what is happening</em> . They provide a deeper understanding of performance gaps and their causes, leading to better KPI creation or a better understanding of KPI relationships. An example is Sanofi&#39;s snackable AI tool, which boosts situational awareness by revealing critical interdependencies among different KPIs.</p><p> <strong>2. Smart Predictive KPIs.</strong> These KPIs anticipate future performance by producing reliable leading indicators. They provide visibility into potential outcomes, thus enabling preemptive actions to mitigate risks or leverage opportunities. For instance, General Electric has transformed its KPIs to focus on leading indicators. The company is using AI, for example, to analyze order pipelines by comparing orders against the installed base of products and services. These detailed comparisons help accurately identify opportunities to increase future orders, which, in turn, drives stronger revenue and margins. As Carolina Dybeck Happe, GE&#39;s senior vice president of finance and former CFO, notes, “Utilizing leading indicators creates a much faster and much tighter connection between the strategy and delivering on that strategy.”</p><p> <strong>3. Smart Prescriptive KPIs.</strong> Beyond description and prediction, prescriptive KPIs are enriched with AI recommend actions. They not only indicate performance gaps but also suggest corrective measures. Sanofi&#39;s smart KPIs, for instance, align operations and sales by recommending adjustments to sales KPIs based on supply chain performance.</p><p> Enriching KPIs with AI empowers key metrics to drive the right performance and strengthen strategic alignment. By transforming KPIs into smart descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive tools, digitally savvy organizations use them for enhanced situational awareness, more effective decision-making, and improved performance management.</p><h3> Leadership Takeaways</h3><p> Based on our research, the following actions will help leaders use AI to improve how they use and develop KPIs and how they align operations with strategy.</p><p> <strong>Treat KPIs as assets.</strong> When KPIs are viewed as assets as well as metrics, they invite more thoughtful and intentional investment. Which KPIs should be enriched or improved with AI? Which KPIs are candidates to become more predictive and forward-looking? What investments in AI, data, and people are necessary to strengthen relationships among KPIs and enhance strategic alignment? Much as organizations identify, cultivate, train, and develop their people for greater responsibility and decision-making authority, leaders should identify, cultivate, train, and develop their KPIs to deliver actionable insights and recommendations.</p><p> <strong>Encourage greater visibility and transparency around performance measures.</strong> Making KPIs more visible clarifies accountability and responsibility, encourages discussion, and cultivates a shared sense of purpose. The Sanofi case illustrates that creating a single source of truth about performance that is shareable and visible to top leaders benefits alignment. Increasing cross-functional access to KPIs encourages greater situational awareness and self-awareness. Democratizing access to credible and transparent performance data helps people see where they are and where they need to go. The C-suite should commit to AI-related resources that improve the visibility and transparency of KPIs.</p><p> <strong>Map KPI relationships and connections.</strong> People across the enterprise should be able to see how key performers, key performance, and key performance indicators relate to one another. Visibility and visualization animate how organizational alignment works. Data-driven leaders can use AI to map, model, and manage their performance drivers and KPI priorities, says Hervé Coureil, Schneider Electric&#39;s chief governance officer and secretary general. Describing and representing a company&#39;s “ecosystem of KPIs,” notes Coureil, can be a labor- and resource-intensive first step. These maps and models can both identify and clarify which KPIs should be shared or ensembled. Customer-centric organizations, for example, would likely prioritize shared and ensembled KPIs around customer experience and customer lifetime value metrics. Better mapping and modeling make KPIs better assets.</p><p></p><h3>结论</h3><p>Our research finds that improving strategic alignment depends not only on properly defining the metrics that matter most but also on continually developing these metrics with AI and better data. But on a more fundamental level, our research highlights that AI is taking on tasks that were once the exclusive domain of executives, such as prioritizing, ensembling, and sharing KPIs. The convergence of AI and KPIs is redefining how KPIs are used and how KPIs contribute to strategic alignment. The ongoing translation of strategy into smarter, better organized, and more valuable metrics is an increasingly critical activity for data-driven leaders.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/strategic-alignment-with-ai-and-smart-kpis/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Procurement in the Age of Automation</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/procurement-in-the-age-of-automation/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/procurement-in-the-age-of-automation/#respond</comments><pubDate> Thu, 31 Aug 2023 11:00:01 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Remko Van Hoek and Mary Lacity. <p>Remko Van Hoek is a professor of supply chain management at the University of Arkansas&#39;s Sam M.

Remko Van Hoek and Lacity have been studying early adopters of procurement technologies for three years, including companies using e-auctions, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies, such as blockchains. For this article, they interviewed senior executives, business unit leaders, managers of centers of excellence for procurement, buyers at dozens of companies, suppliers, and automated negotiation software vendors.</p></aside><p> Executives are often skeptical about automating procurement processes, particularly when they involve negotiations, but automated negotiation tools offer considerable value for all stakeholders and can be used effectively throughout many businesses.</p><p> Over the past three years, we have studied modern automated procurement practices at dozens of organizations. We studied technologies that have been around for a while but not widely adopted, such as e-auction technology, as well as newer technologies, such as AI chatbots. Companies in our study that had automated procurement negotiations consistently saved money compared with those engaged in traditional person-to-person negotiations and improved supply chain resiliency by identifying more qualified suppliers. Automated negotiations also increased buyer productivity, allowing buyers to spend less time and energy on tasks that are now handled by software. Suppliers benefited from clarity on how they would be assessed, shorter sales cycles, real-time feedback on their current standing, and confidence that they would be treated fairly, even in situations that involved entrenched incumbent suppliers.</p><p></p><p> However, implementing a new procurement model and a different approach to relationships isn&#39;t easy. Stakeholders often have legitimate concerns. Business unit heads paying for goods and services worry that automated negotiations will land them the cheapest suppliers (chosen based on costs only), leaving them to deal with shoddy quality, inferior services, and broken supplier relationships. Buyers often reject automation tools because they view negotiations as their specialty and worry about being marginalized or even replaced. Suppliers want opportunities to differentiate themselves on more than just price; nonincumbent suppliers often suspect that buyers use automated negotiations merely to pressure incumbents to lower their prices and thus fear that they do not have a legitimate chance of winning the business.</p><p> In this article, we detail the substantial benefits organizations have derived from automated negotiations, what it takes to persuade stakeholders to use the technology, and how to incorporate automation into your procurement processes.</p><h3> Reaping the Benefits of Automated Negotiations</h3><p> Both large and midsize companies in our study achieved notable savings with automated negotiations. Danish global shipping company Maersk uses various automated negotiations for $1 billion in annual spending and has saved 7% to 8% during the past few years compared with manual negotiations. Walmart International automated negotiations for over $7 billion worth of spending, gaining 5% or more in additional value compared with traditional negotiations. Google has seen good results from its large-scale e-auction program and has embedded the technology into its procurement toolkit and processes.</p><p> Smaller companies have also generated savings. Walker&#39;s Shortbread, a family-owned baked-goods manufacturer in Scotland, buys 80 million British pounds&#39; ($105 million) worth of ingredients and packaging materials each year. It used automated negotiations for 90% of its spending on raw ingredients in the first half of 2023, saving between 1.5% and 7%, depending on the category. Mexico-based Grupo Herdez, another family-owned food-product manufacturer, has been using e-auctions for a fraction of its annual purchase of raw materials, saving around 8% on items like spices and seeds. The company is planning to expand e-auctions to other procurement categories this year.</p><p> Walmart, Maersk, and Google have scaled automated negotiations across procurement categories as varied as marketing media, food for vessel crews, transportation services, general contractor services, e-commerce small-parcel delivery, supply chain equipment, and even marketing agency services. Through June 2023, Maersk had conducted over 10,000 e-auctions. In 2022, Walmart applied e-auctions to 65% of its total indirect spending. While the number of auctions Walker&#39;s Shortbread conducts is minuscule compared with Maersk&#39;s or Walmart&#39;s, its default procurement option is now e-auctions.</p><p> Automating negotiations dramatically increases the number of suppliers and negotiation rounds that a company can include while significantly decreasing the amount of time the process takes. In a wide range of e-auctions, Walmart had up to 150 suppliers participating simultaneously, conducting multiple rounds of negotiations in about two hours. “It would take a buyer months to complete a negotiation like that in person,” said Michael DeWitt, vice president for strategic sourcing at Walmart.</p><p> Such efficiency benefits companies of all sizes. “It&#39;s the speed of e-auction execution that drives value,” said Kees Bressers, head of procurement at Walker&#39;s Shortbread.</p><p></p><p> Companies that have scaled their automated negotiations have matched the procurement strategy for a particular spending category and market conditions with the best automation processes and tools. (See “How Automated Negotiations Work.”) They work to win over members of the three stakeholder groups — business unit heads, buyers, and suppliers — by promoting the benefits each will gain.</p><div class="callout-highlight"><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article><h4> How Automated Negotiations Work</h4><p> There are many nuanced automated negotiation processes and tools, but at a high level, they can be divided into two categories: one buyer and many suppliers, or one buyer and one supplier. In both scenarios, the human buyer prepares the software for negotiation events. Once the event is deployed, the human buyer remains on the sidelines while the software interacts with humans representing the suppliers.</p><h4 style="color:black;"> One Buyer, Many Suppliers</h4><p> E-auctions — or interactive bidding, as Walmart calls them — are real-time online negotiations that use competition to achieve true market value by delivering time and process efficiencies. <a id="reflinkii" class="reflink" href="#refii">ii</a> Compared with traditional negotiations, where the buyer is in the middle, an e-auction allows the buyer to step out of the process so that suppliers compete with one another directly, as illustrated below. </p><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article style="border-bottom-width:3px;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-color:#00e0ff;margin-bottom:20px"><h4> Tradition Versus Automation With Multiple Suppliers</h4><p class="caption"> In automated negotiations, the buyer is still responsible for the process and for defining the rules. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MAG_VanHoek_Fig1.png" alt="Tradition Versus Automation With Multiple Suppliers" /><br /></article></aside><p> The process lets the market do its work, without potential buyer bias, such as favoring the incumbent supplier. Procurement teams can consider conducting an e-auction when at least two qualified suppliers are willing to participate.</p><div class="callout-toggle"><p> There are three main types of automated e-auctions:</p><p> <strong>English reverse auctions.</strong> Suppliers compete in real time to be the lowest bidder. Suppliers can see everyone&#39;s bids and can repeatedly enter lower prices. The supplier that submits the lowest price before the event is closed is awarded the buyer&#39;s business.</p><p> English reverse auctions are suitable for procuring goods and services in markets where there are plenty of competitors. The format stimulates competitive bidding and tends to drive pricing across bidders toward a narrow range in the final stages of the auction. The format can be used for multiple lots within a tender, and many rounds and bidders can be accommodated.</p><p> English reverse auctions are the most-used format, but buyers should be mindful not to always use them by default and should consider other options.</p><p> <strong>Dutch reverse auctions.</strong> Here, the buyer seeds the competition with a low price. If no suppliers bid on the initial price, the buyer&#39;s software increases the price incrementally. The process repeats until a supplier bids or the buyer reaches its upper bound on what it is willing to pay. The first supplier to accept the current price is awarded the buyer&#39;s business.</p><p> Dutch reverse auctions, with their winner-takes-all award strategy, are suitable for procuring goods and services in supplier markets where there is great supplier interest in securing an agreement. A large number of suppliers is not necessary. However, the format does not enable price discovery as much as English reverse auctions do.</p><p> <strong>Japanese reverse auctions.</strong> In this approach, the buyer seeds the competition with a high price. All suppliers willing to accept this price stay in the negotiation. Next, the software decreases the price and all suppliers willing to accept this price remain in the competition. The process repeats until a supplier accepts the current price and is then awarded the buyer&#39;s business.</p><p> Japanese reverse auctions are a good alternative to English reverse auctions in markets where there is a limited number of bidders. The format ensures that the supplier explicitly opts in, which can support buyer confidence in the offers.</p><p> This format is less commonly used, and buyers and suppliers may be less familiar with it. There is a risk that the auction will end early, at a higher price than the buyer desired, because it takes only one incremental bid to secure the win.</p><h4 style="color:black;"> One Buyer, One Supplier</h4><p> Buyers may apply automated negotiations even when there is only a single supplier. Again, there are various processes and tools to consider.</p><p> AI-powered chatbots automatically negotiate on terms and conditions, such as payment schedules, termination clauses, and opportunities for growth. The chatbots are programmed to produce deterministic outcomes and do not negotiate any terms that the buyer has not preapproved.</p><p> Dynamic request-for-quote tools mask the buyer&#39;s target prices for itemized goods or services, wait for the human supplier to enter a proposed price, and then provide instant feedback regarding the level of agreement. </p><aside class="l-content-wrap"><article style="border-bottom-width:3px;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-color:#00e0ff;margin-bottom:20px"><h4> Tradition Versus Automation With One Supplier</h4><p class="caption"> Automated tools can even be used to negotiate with a single supplier. </p><p><img src="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MAG_VanHoek_Fig2.png" alt="Tradition Versus Automation With One Supplier" /><br /></article></aside></div></article></aside></div><ul><li> <em>Business unit heads</em> get access to an expanded base of qualified suppliers at the best price. They continue to define requirements, desired terms and conditions, and budgets, so their roles do not change. However, they must accept that their favorite incumbent suppliers might be replaced.</li><li> <em>Buyers</em> aren&#39;t eliminated; rather, their responsibilities expand, and they use their expertise more strategically. They will consider more procurement options, formalize business unit heads&#39; needs into templates or scorecards, find more qualified suppliers, and leverage new automation tools. Instead of having face-to-face negotiations with suppliers, buyers organize and qualify suppliers to participate in automated negotiation events.</li><li> <em>Suppliers</em> will need to be trained in the new automated tools and processes. They benefit from rules that increase fairness, real-time feedback on the competitiveness of their bids, and a reduced administrative burden. Compared with the experience of face-to-face negotiations with buyers, suppliers spend more time planning for automation events but much less time negotiating, reducing their overall sales cycles.</li></ul><p> By studying companies that have successfully transitioned to automated negotiations, we&#39;ve identified six key practices to help leaders overcome stakeholder resistance and deliver value.</p><p></p><p> <strong>1. Mandate consideration, not use.</strong> While executives might be tempted to mandate adoption of automated procurement, it&#39;s generally a poor way to get buy-in from business unit heads and buyers. Instead, executives of large procurement organizations might mandate that buyers <em>consider</em> participating in automated negotiations. This practice allows the buyers to use their subject-matter expertise and relationships with business unit heads to identify the best automation opportunities, which helps with stakeholder buy-in and optimizes the effectiveness of automations.</p><p> Times were tough for the shipping industry in 2009, so Maersk saw cost cutting as crucial to ensuring its competitiveness in the market. The chief procurement officer (CPO) at the time mandated that buyers <em>consider</em> adopting e-auctions and set minimum yearly targets for each buyer as part of their annual performance evaluation. The CPO recognized that there could be valid reasons for not using e-auctions, such as an insufficient number of bidders, so the business unit heads and buyers selected which deals were best suited for automated negotiations to meet the targets.</p><p> Like Maersk, Walmart requires that all buyers consider automating all negotiations. Initially, the procurement leaders did road shows with business unit heads and buyers to communicate the potential value and make it clear that buyers could opt out by documenting their rationales.</p><p> “By making auctions the preferred default, it forces a better procurement strategy,” said Walmart&#39;s DeWitt. “It encourages buyers to think outside of the box and to look for more suppliers, which in the end benefits the business whether they do an auction or not.”</p><p> Executives at companies with smaller procurement operations might find a mandate unnecessary. Walker&#39;s Shortbread, for instance, has only five full-time procurement specialists for the entire company, and they all work in the same office, so Bressers was able to discuss the strategy with them directly. That approach helped him gain buy-in on digital procurement at a company that had been managing the process with telephone calls and emails for decades.</p><p></p><p> Similarly, Grupo Herdez has not mandated e-auction consideration or use. The economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic made cost rationalization a requirement for survival. The procurement team communicated the necessity of using automated negotiations to drive down costs to business unit owners, buyers, and suppliers. Business unit owners and suppliers took the most convincing because the company had used some of the same suppliers for 40 years or more. To get incumbent suppliers to agree to participate in e-auctions, Grupo Herdez&#39;s procurement managers went to the suppliers&#39; senior leaders to explain the economic need for competition to cut costs. “Even though many of them have more power in the relationship because they are larger than us, they understand and accept our need,” said Felipe Díaz Mojica, manager of strategic supply.</p><p> <strong>2. Make success visible.</strong> While mandating e-auction consideration helps global businesses get started, making early successes visible across the company can generate excitement among business unit heads and buyers — especially when leaders credit the buyers for their role. Google made success visible in staff newsletters and offered employees incentives based on the number of events they conducted through automated negotiations.</p><p> In the early stages of Maersk&#39;s automation journey, the CPO broadcast live negotiations on big screens and celebrated the business unit heads and buyers who led the e-auctions. Since every e-auction was generating double-digit savings, the successes broke through stakeholder complacency. “The &#39;push&#39; strategies for automated negotiations soon evolved into demand &#39;pulls,&#39; ” said Nikolaj Jessen-Klixbüll, Maersk&#39;s director of procurement.</p><p></p><p> At Walmart, business unit heads from one country were particularly skeptical about the value of automated negotiations, so procurement leaders invited them to watch a live auction on a big screen in an auditorium. DeWitt recalled that the nonbelievers initially sat in the back with their arms crossed.</p><p> “Nobody looked happy,” he said. “Then the auction started, and prices started to drop. It was wildly competitive, and you could see the mood in the room change. People started to smile. By the end, they were literally giving high fives to each other and to us. After that, they became our best champions.”</p><p> Walmart presented monthly awards recognizing the buyers who were using automated negotiations for new spending categories, for large-volume events, or in new geographies. One purpose of the awards was to signal to the entire company that while software enables automated negotiations, it&#39;s the buyers who run them.</p><p> At Walker&#39;s Shortbread, business unit heads needed to see how suppliers would submit bids before they sanctioned the new procurement model. “Business owners were nervous,” said Bressers. “We are a 125-year-old company where deals were done with handshakes and a purchase order.” He won them over by demonstrating an e-auction in a sandbox environment before conducting one live. He then invited key business unit heads and the procurement team to the first couple of live auctions, which were displayed on a large screen. After observing the bidding process, business leaders recognized that the process was fair and were very pleased with the lower prices.</p><p> These early successes happened only because the companies planned automation events carefully, including vetting the suppliers.</p><p> <strong>3. Prequalify suppliers.</strong> Procurement teams should recruit and preapprove suppliers before automated negotiation events. This practice ensures that only capable suppliers can be awarded the business. Procurement teams may also need to collect initial proposals to increase the pool of qualified suppliers.</p><p> Maersk&#39;s buyers work with business unit heads to identify their needs. The requirements are converted into supplier scores that are used to prequalify suppliers against minimum requirements and rank them in terms of their comparative position before negotiations start. A supplier with a lower carbon footprint, for example, would be favored over an equivalent supplier with a higher carbon footprint. <a id="reflink1" class="reflink" href="#ref1">1</a></p><p> “For this to be a success, business owners specify their prerequisites,” said Jessen-Klixbüll. “They know we&#39;re not going to invite any suppliers to participate if the business doesn&#39;t trust that the supplier can deliver the service.”</p><p> Before an e-auction, Maersk uses automated dynamic requests for quotes (RFQs) if there are limited suppliers in the market or when there are large differences between suppliers&#39; prices. The dynamic RFQ process aims to reduce the pricing gap and qualify more suppliers for e-auctions. Maersk also uses this process to negotiate deals with a single supplier when no other viable suppliers exist in the market.</p><p> Business unit heads and buyers agree to a target price based on market assessment, needs, and budgets. During the event, Maersk&#39;s software displays a blank line-item price sheet without revealing the company&#39;s target prices. After a supplier submits its proposed price, the dynamic RFQ system offers automatic feedback on the competitiveness of the supplier&#39;s offer, using a traffic-light metaphor: Green indicates that the bid is competitive, amber indicates that the bid is close to competitive, and red indicates that the bid is not competitive.</p><p> Unlike an e-auction with a short time limit, dynamic RFQ events stay open for a few days so that suppliers have time to work with subsuppliers on further discounts and then enter a new, more competitive bid.</p><p> Walmart uses a scorecard to assess business unit heads&#39; weighted requirements for quality, service, security, sustainability, costs, and other criteria. Suppliers are prequalified and assigned an initial ranking based on their scorecard. The scorecard is embedded in the interactive bidding software, so suppliers can see where they rank. If business unit heads heavily weigh costs, a supplier will climb in the ranking by bidding a lower price. If nonprice factors are heavily weighted, lowering the price will not improve the supplier&#39;s ranking by much.</p><p> “It requires prework to get the business and buyer stakeholders to develop the scorecards,” said Bayan A. Hariri Sr., director of procurement transformation and center of excellence (COE) at Walmart. “But it makes it so much easier to award the supplier when the event is done.”</p><p> Before automated negotiations were adopted, buyers from Walker&#39;s Shortbread contacted incumbent suppliers and one or two other suppliers to determine market prices and then used that information to renegotiate prices with the incumbent. Now, with automated negotiations implemented, buyers first invite suppliers to respond to RFQs to determine the suppliers&#39; capabilities and get a sense of current market prices. Walker&#39;s Shortbread then uses this information to prequalify suppliers for e-auctions. Incumbents now compete for the business. The number of qualified suppliers has doubled for some procurement categories, increasing competition.</p><p> <strong>4. Treat nonincumbent suppliers fairly.</strong> The procurement team must communicate the value, process, and award criteria to suppliers before an automated negotiation begins. “It is important to communicate to suppliers that, with an e-auction, suppliers get much better and more real-time visibility into their position in the tender,” said Lily Han, manager of global procurement at Google. “They also get very direct control of their competitive position; it is much more in their hands.” At the same time, suppliers need to be assured that the other suppliers will not know who is competing in the event, said Grupo Herdez&#39;s Díaz Mojica.</p><p> As most procurement professionals will attest, business unit heads and buyers prefer incumbent suppliers because change creates more work and potential operational risks. Companies should adhere to a strict policy that the supplier that wins the negotiation should be awarded the business. There should be no negotiations after the event; incumbent suppliers should not be able to overturn the results of automated negotiations with offers of big discounts afterward. Maersk, Walmart, and Walker&#39;s Shortbread adhere to this golden rule. Walker&#39;s Shortbread selects the winner based on a weighted average of technical and cost criteria.</p><p> To increase fairness and avoid misunderstandings about process and purpose, Walmart also provides every supplier with personalized training before they participate in automated negotiations. Buyers explain the auction design and award criteria and ensure that suppliers understand how to use the technology.</p><p> Supplier feedback on the training has been positive, but a better indicator of supplier value is repeat participation, according to DeWitt: “Suppliers come back again and again.”</p><p> <strong>5. Unleash the power of AI to improve deals with tail-end suppliers.</strong> Normally, procurement organizations negotiate only with their major suppliers, which typically represent 20% of a company&#39;s suppliers but 80% of its procurement budget. Buyers generally offer tail-end suppliers cookie-cutter deals that are nonnegotiable. Recently, however, companies like Walmart, Maersk, and others have found ways to improve deals with tail-end suppliers using AI-powered chatbots.</p><p> Like e-auction technology, an AI chatbot can run 2,000 negotiations simultaneously, 24-7, while allowing suppliers time for bid preparation if needed. “The ability to take on a massive amount of negotiations simultaneously and to be able to scale that across a number of scenarios is of incredible value,” said Jessen-Klixbüll.</p><p> Scaling the chatbots has increased productivity for both Maersk and Walmart because the software learns from every negotiation, reducing the setup time for new procurement categories.</p><p> When using AI-powered chatbots, business unit heads and buyers start by identifying the suppliers to approach and defining acceptable trade-offs that will become part of the programming. For example, business unit heads might prefer a price discount in exchange for paying the supplier earlier. Or they may favor offering suppliers a 60-day written termination notice rather than a termination-for-convenience clause, or want to offer the supplier opportunities for growth by increasing their product mix and sales volumes.</p><p> Unlike the many AI tools that produce probabilistic outcomes, AI-driven automated procurement tools produce deterministic outcomes, thus eliminating the possibility of surprise results. Once the tools are deployed, the buyer steps out of the process and the chatbot presents alternatives to a human representing the supplier.</p><p> Maersk began using an AI-powered chatbot predominantly for inland transportation, where volume and traffic are too limited to justify a full-blown auction. Maersk pre-awards a supplier for a specific region, and when the supplier is needed, the AI chatbot leads the negotiation.</p><p> Walmart first used its AI chatbot for contract renegotiations with tail-end suppliers in one country and has since expanded to midtier suppliers and multiple countries. Its average savings range from 7% to 10%. In return, suppliers have gained better termination conditions, early payments, and/or growth opportunities.</p><p> Most tail-end suppliers welcomed the opportunity to actively negotiate with Walmart for the first time. In follow-up surveys, 67% of suppliers said that they found the system easy to use and 83% liked the ability to counteroffer. <a id="reflink2" class="reflink" href="#ref2">2</a></p><p> Smaller companies also can gain benefits from AI chatbots. Genuine Cable Group (GCG), a US company with 1,200 employees, is currently training its chatbot on different scenarios, with plans to launch it in the fourth quarter of 2023. GCG has tens of thousands of suppliers, with some deals as small as $10,000 in spending per year. The chatbot will allow GCG to engage with more suppliers than it had been able to in the past, according to CEO Steve Maucieri. The project is low risk because the software provider offers a gain-sharing model in which its fees are paid from the savings generated. Maucieri also anticipates a future in which his many customers will use AI-powered chatbots to negotiate deals with the company.</p><p> <strong>6. Create a formal support structure.</strong> Formal support structures, such as COEs, can help to scale automated negotiations across geographies, business units, and spending categories.</p><p> Maersk came to realize that if it wanted to embed mature procurement processes across the globe, it needed to have procurement teams located closer to its businesses. It created a global COE with regional support representatives. Teams in Panama City, Panama; Charlotte, NC; Cape Town, South Africa; Rotterdam, The Netherlands; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; and Shanghai support Latin America, North America, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, respectively.</p><p> The COE representatives don&#39;t take negotiations away from buyers. Instead, they provide tool expertise and support buyers&#39; efforts to engage business stakeholders, consider negotiation types, and design automated negotiations using templates. The COE also focuses on supplier experience so that the automated negotiations ease suppliers&#39; burdens too.</p><p> “We don&#39;t want to make the negotiation too complex, difficult to use, or bureaucratic, because buyers and suppliers will eventually walk away,” said Jessen-Klixbüll.</p><p> Walmart also has a COE with a dedicated team of super users who support buyers and suppliers. Walmart&#39;s procurement leadership views the maturation of the company&#39;s procurement strategy and capability as one of the biggest benefits of automating negotiations. The COE continually updates its templates to guide buyers to the optimal sourcing approach. “We always position automated negotiations as a strategy that enhances the negotiation as part of the sourcing process, and not as a replacement of the sourcing process itself,” DeWitt said.</p><p> For both Maersk and Walmart, buyer and supplier training is ongoing, given that new employees and suppliers are constantly onboarding and automation options and negotiation types are evolving.</p><p></p><p> Smaller companies can engage the services of an outsourcing provider to create formal structures. Walker&#39;s Shortbread, for example, hired an e-auction software provider to manage the infrastructure and e-auctions.</p><p></p><p> Ultimately, automating negotiations is not about the technologies; it&#39;s about enabling buyers to be more efficient and effective by focusing on procurement strategy. Suppliers benefit by replacing high-pressure person-to-person negotiations with clearly defined automated negotiation events, and sales cycles no longer languish. Business unit heads benefit from measurable savings and from expanded pools of qualified suppliers. To capture these benefits, executives should focus less on technology and more on effective procurement strategy, deployment, and change management. The good news is that the practices we&#39;ve described are highly transferable across companies and industries and have the potential to benefit many.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/procurement-in-the-age-of-automation/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item><item><title> Generative AI at Mastercard: Governance Takes Center Stage</title><link/> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/generative-ai-at-mastercard-governance-takes-center-stage/<comments> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/generative-ai-at-mastercard-governance-takes-center-stage/#respond</comments><pubDate> Wed, 30 Aug 2023 11:00:30 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Thomas H.

Impressive and exciting? No doubt — that&#39;s one reason why it won seven Academy Awards. A portent of the future? Perhaps — as scientists explore the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2023/03/12/is-the-multiverse-real-the-science-behind-everything-everywhere-all-at-once/?sh=4a4837583475">idea of a multiverse</a> , the film provides one vision of what it might look like. Somewhat bizarre and confusing? Well, to us anyway.</p><p> JoAnn Stonier, until recently Mastercard&#39;s chief data officer, made an apt comparison between the movie and generative AI when she appeared on a <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/generative-ai-is-everything-everywhere-all-at-once-in-the-enterprise-says-mastercard-cdo/">recent panel</a> . “Everything everywhere” is a good way to characterize the technology — exciting, confusing, and important all at the same time. We have previously <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomdavenport/2020/04/13/joann-stonier-of-mastercard-a-unique-take-on-the-cdo-role/?sh=4dea1d172ac6">written about</a> Stonier and her unusual position as one of the few CDOs who has been heavily focused on data ethics for many years. We interviewed her on one of her last days as CDO; she&#39;s since become a Mastercard fellow but will still work on data and AI ethics issues.</p><p></p><p> After the interview, we were somewhat relieved, as you might be, to find out that Stonier and Mastercard are still feeling their way with regard to generative AI. That&#39;s true of many companies. More than half of the respondents to a recent VentureBeat survey said their organizations are experimenting with AI, but only <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/more-than-70-of-companies-are-experimenting-with-generative-ai-but-few-are-willing-to-commit-more-spending/">18% of those companies have begun implementing it</a> . The same percentage said they expect to spend more on the technology in the coming year.</p><p> Of course, Mastercard is an old hand at data, analytics, and AI: We wrote about its efforts toward becoming an “ <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/becoming-an-ai-powerhouse-means-going-all-in/">AI powerhouse</a> ” a year ago, and Stonier <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/audio/designing-a-better-future-mastercards-joann-stonier/">discussed the company&#39;s use of AI</a> on the <cite>MIT Sloan Management Review</cite> podcast <cite>Me, Myself, and AI</cite> . Mastercard has been in the AI space for more than a decade, most significantly in the cybersecurity realm. That a leader and company so experienced with AI is still trying to work out the details of a generative AI strategy should be comforting to many other companies and managers.</p><p></p><h3> What&#39;s Already Clear</h3><p> Mastercard&#39;s extensive experience with previous forms of AI led it to build a robust methodology and governance process. At a high level, this process involves understanding the data, understanding the models, and reviewing the output and the related outcomes.</p><p> Each of those steps will come into the process for evaluating generative models, but they are likely to have a different flavor. Mastercard has no shortage of structured numerical data, of course, but the data that generative AI processes are often images and less-structured text. Given the complexity and size of generative models, understanding exactly how a given input produces a specific output is very challenging. That places even more importance on the step of reviewing outcomes, which need to be assessed for factual accuracy, biased or toxic language, and value to the user, as well as unintended consequences to individuals, organizations, and the ecosystems in which the outcomes might operate.</p><p> Despite the uncertainties inherent in the technology, Mastercard has already established some policies with regard to generative AI. Shortly after the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022, the company put guidelines in place to ensure that employees innovate responsibly with the new technology. This encourages internal exploration of the models its vendor provides while safeguarding confidential company information.</p><p> Some companies have gone so far as to ban ChatGPT and the use of other large language models by employees, but Mastercard hasn&#39;t been tempted to do so. “Some of the use cases have been more creative than others, but we haven&#39;t had any problems thus far,” Stonier said. Perhaps that&#39;s because, as she noted, “everybody in the company is more aware and digitally engaged now, and they see governance as part of everyone&#39;s job.”</p><p> We think that virtually every company should be educating its senior executives and board members about generative AI, and Mastercard has been predictably active in that regard. It has held multiple sessions for the senior executive team and board members to address different aspects of the technology, including the opportunities it provides, the regulation it needs, and the process the company should follow in implementing it. Numerous outside experts have participated in these briefings, and Stonier noted that there are several tech-savvy board members who already understood the technology well.</p><p> Mastercard has an established council of AI-informed leaders from all areas of the business that evaluates AI use cases before their deployment, and it has added generative AI use cases to those that are reviewed. Some of the use cases developed so far involve areas like fraud detection, internal knowledge management, and personalization. Even more use cases are in the experimentation phase and are not yet intended for production deployment.</p><p></p><p> Although detailed government policies for generative AI haven&#39;t been issued yet for the US, Stonier said that it&#39;s already clear that there will be different policies for the many different capabilities of generative AI. Because Mastercard depends heavily on reliable information systems, for example, using generative AI to develop programming code will be treated differently than using it to create marketing copy.</p><p> It&#39;s also clear that an interdisciplinary and cross-functional approach will be required to manage generative AI at Mastercard. Already, lawyers, HR professionals, and systems and data engineers and architects are engaged in developing the company&#39;s approach to the technology. As use cases become more customer-oriented (they are primarily internal now), it&#39;s likely that more parts of the organization will become involved. External regulators will want to see how the company built any “black box” models, where the logic and data sources the models are built on aren&#39;t readily visible to users. Stonier said that governance of generative AI is a challenge, given all of the possible use cases and aspects of the organization that are involved. She expects that, consistent with the previous AI development process, governance will have to address not only what the users of the technology are trying to achieve but also what the most likely outcomes will be.</p><h3> What&#39;s Still Evolving</h3><p> Stonier said that many aspects of generative AI are still being discussed, as they should be. This is a period of experimentation for the company and its employees, and Stonier noted that no one wants to dampen it as long as <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/vision/corp-responsibility/data-responsibility.html">the company&#39;s data responsibility principles</a> are being followed. Mastercard wants to use generative AI as an opportunity for learning and to eventually benefit from it as much as it has gained from conventional AI in its fraud-reduction and cybersecurity initiatives.</p><p> At the moment, the primary benefits being realized are internal productivity gains for the company&#39;s own processes. Use cases for Mastercard&#39;s customers, including merchants who accept Mastercard, will come later. There is the potential for highly personalized data analysis and messages for customers in the future.</p><p> Mastercard already has a well-defined process for rolling out data and data products and even a business unit — called Data &amp; Services, which Tom <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomdavenport/2021/01/13/data-exhaust-turbocharges-mastercard/?sh=451638f887df">wrote about</a> a couple of years ago — for making them available to customers. Stonier believes that Data &amp; Services and the company&#39;s Cyber &amp; Intelligence business will be the most likely to implement generative AI-based products in the future, adding to a wide array of existing AI solutions. She is confident that these generative AI uses will employ multiple types of language models and that they will make extensive use of humans in the loop, perhaps through reinforcement learning with human feedback. There will be extensive testing, she said, to ensure that there are no substantial hallucinations or other problematic outputs in the products. We think this is important; if machine learning is like analytics on steroids, generative AI is like machine learning on LSD. That captures the unpredictable aspect of the technology.</p><p> The specific architectures for generative AI models have also yet to be determined. Stonier feels that there will definitely be multiple models, but she&#39;s not sure whether they will be stacked — combined for one use case — or arrayed, with a front-end system determining which is most appropriate for the context.</p><p></p><p> We asked Stonier whether she feels that generative AI is an incremental or hugely transformative technology. “It&#39;s been incremental so far, but eventually it may be transformative,” she said. “But any transformation won&#39;t be a big-bang moment — it will take place over time. Improvements in operating efficiency will come relatively quickly, but changes in products and services will take longer.”</p><p> If your company is wrestling with how to govern and fully take advantage of generative AI, Mastercard&#39;s experience should make you feel somewhat more relaxed. This technology may or may not transform your business, but it certainly raises many new issues and opportunities. They don&#39;t all need to be figured out overnight.</p><p></p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/generative-ai-at-mastercard-governance-takes-center-stage/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 0</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>
