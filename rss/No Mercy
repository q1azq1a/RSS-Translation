href="https://www.valuationresearch.com/pure-perspectives/spac-market-update-who-turned-on-the-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">有 10 个实现了正回报</a>。这是一个假象，因为更深层次的故事被忽略了。传统的IPO结构正处于结构性衰退，这是资本市场发生根本性转变的征兆。 </p><p><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" class="alignnone wp-image-215421"

亿美元的价格<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/29/blue-apron-to-be-acquired-by-wonder-group-for-103-million.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">将自己出售</a>给 Wonder Group。对于一家向千禧一代提供鸡肉和羽衣甘蓝纸板箱的企业来说，这感觉像是一场胜利，直到你意识到这是它旅程的最后一站，其中包括估值 20 亿美元的 IPO。 （顺便说一句，我六年前<a href="https://youtu.be/llRHp5DBqIs?feature=shared&amp;t=86" target="_blank" rel="noopener">就预测到了这一点</a>。）</p><p>同样，Instacart 用绿色塑料袋向千禧一代提供鸡肉和羽衣甘蓝（创新），本月以 100 亿美元的<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/instacart-ipo-may-slash-value-160409601.html?guccounter=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">价格上市</a>……继 2021 年私募轮估值为 390 亿美元之后。从那时起，该公司几乎每天都在贬值，在我撰写本文时市值已跌至 70 亿美元。消费“科技”公司 Rent the Runway 和 Allbirds 的 IPO 股价均下跌 96%。 Warby Parker 表现出色，仅损失了四分之三的价值。</p><p>此前，Cava 于 6 月进行了首次公开募股（它要求千禧一代离开家去吃鸡肉和羽衣甘蓝），该公司筹集了 7 亿美元的私人资金，上市后市值<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/restaurant-chain-cava-valued-47-bln-shares-pop-debut-2023-06-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">飙升</a>至 47 亿美元，然后又缩减至 35 亿美元。我投资的一家公司 Oddity 的估值为 20 亿美元，后来涨到了 27 亿美元，昨天收盘价为 15 亿美元。 Better Mortgage 在其 SPAC 之前在私募市场上的估值达到 60 亿美元，目前估值为 1.23 亿美元。我也不能幸免。我以 6 亿美元的估值投资了 Better，但没有出售任何股份，因为我的 SPAC 是“不同的”。</p><p>相对而言，这些首次公开募股是成功的。但是等等——市场不是在上涨吗？是的，但就像大学排名一样，这些指数是分散大众注意力的武器：70% 的收益来自七只股票。顺便说一句，OpenAI 正在以 900 亿美元的估值筹集资金，比今年早些时候增加了三倍。它有真实的收入和爆炸性的增长。什么时候会公开？答：当现有股东认为没有额外的好处时。</p><h4>发生了什么？</h4><p>很简单，真的。当资本回报率下降时，私人市场投资者希望抓住之前泄露给公共投资者的好处。具有超凡魅力的推动者将 CNBC 和社交媒体武器化，他们更渴望娱乐而不是新闻，FOMO 感染了大众，MBS 从恐怖主义转向资本主义，创造了一股可供部署的资本洪流。</p><p>风险投资公司在本世纪的前二十年取得了可观的回报，它们需要一个有足够大后院的房子来吸收数十亿的新资本。数百亿美元涌入上市前的成长型公司。当消费者手头有现金时，永远不要低估市场创造产品的能力。 </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215417"

/></p><h4>调动，转移</h4><p>这是否意味着资本市场的核心已经腐烂了？是的，但不是看起来的那样。问题不在于首次公开募股已经成为拉高抛售计划（通常是这样）。问题是它们<em>并不重要</em>。重心正在从公共资本转向私人资本。这一变化是渐进式的，因此并没有引起媒体的太多关注。但市场趋势与儿童相似：如果你不是每天都和他们在一起，当你最终看到他们时，这些变化会让人感觉难以置信。然而，在这种情况下，奶奶会说：“我不敢相信你竟然缩小了这么多！”如果这种转变继续下去，预计资本和权力将越来越集中在少数人手中，IPO 中“P”的经济回报将受到抑制。</p><h4> IPO结构性下滑</h4><p>22 世纪 80 年代，当我在摩根士丹利担任分析师时，优秀的公司会在想要筹集资金并向投资者和员工提供流动性的时候上市。 2002 年，我参加了 Red Envelope 公司在纳斯达克的敲钟仪式，这是我五年前创立的公司。到那时为止，这种感觉是奇特的——我做到了。我掌管着资本主义的大雪橇，我的余生将在经济上有保障。男人想成为我的朋友，女人想和我上床。这么棒的钟声。剧透警报：这一切都没有发生。也许有一些新朋友。</p><p>这是渐进的，但那钟声不再响起。它推出的产品让整个房间焕然一新，因为回报集中在少数大赢家身上。公司等待上市的时间更长，发行的股票也更少，但没有真正的投票权。其中许多，也许是大多数，对新主人来说几乎没有什么好处。</p><p> 1980 年，十分之九的科技公司 IPO 实现盈利。 2021 年，这一比例为五分之一。在所有风险投资支持的公司中，1980 年，78% 实现盈利；2021 年，这一比例为五分之一。 2021 年，10%。 2022 年上市的 13 家风险投资公司中， <a href="https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/IPO-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>没有一家</em></a>实现盈​​利。 </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215422" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart.png"

100vw, 900px" /></p><h4>最深的口袋</h4><p>不盈利的首次公开募股的兴起并不是公司在其增长周期的早期上市的问题。相反，其中许多公司规模庞大，在上市前就筹集了大量资金。就在 10 年前，当风险投资家 Aileen Lee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/02/welcome-to-the-unicorn-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">创造了“独角兽”一词</a>来指称估值超过 10 亿美元的私人公司时，她只能识别出其中的 39 家。今天有<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,221</a> 。</p><p>增长、避税、救助、债务驱动的支出狂欢，以及通过法律将收益私有化和损失社会化的政府武器化，形成了艾尔斯岩规模的私人财富。公共资本曾经是飞跃到光速的超级物质，但现在已经不再了。 ADIA和PIF等主权财富基金、软银、红杉和Andreessen Horowitz等大型风险基金、富有的个人和企业现在部署了<em><a href="https://a16z.com/9b-to-build-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">数十亿美元</a></em>，而他们的前辈只能开出数百万美元的支票。他们别无选择，只能进行 1 亿美元以上的投资，因为你不能一次投入 100 亿美元来发挥 1000 万美元的作用。</p><p> 2007年，微软以<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/25/technology/25facebook.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">150亿美元的估值向Facebook投资</a>2.4亿美元，被认为是“天文数字”。谷歌在上市前仅筹集了 2600 万美元； Netflix，1.02 亿美元。特斯拉是一家资本密集型企业，在 IPO 之前筹集了不到 2 亿美元的股本和另外 5 亿美元的债务。快进到今天： <em><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/biggest-us-vc-startup-funding-deals-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">上周</a></em>完成了 6 笔金额超过 1 亿美元的不同风险投资。埃隆的另一家公司 SpaceX，已通过多轮融资筹集了 94 亿美元……并且仍处于私有状态。</p><h4>私人捕获</h4><p>巨大的财富带来巨大的机会。从历史上看，一家公司在首次公开募股后的很长一段时间内都有望实现增长，任何拥有嘉信理财账户并有远见的人都可以获得由此带来的股票收益，并尽早买入。谷歌在 IPO 后的头十年为投资者提供了<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MBB-25772" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30% 的年回报率</a>，Facebook 为<a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/27473/facebook-stock-price-since-its-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19%</a> 。如果你在 1980 年苹果公司 IPO 时投资 1,000 美元，那么今天它的价值将是 175 万美元。</p><p>但如果你不需要公开市场获取资本，为什么要把这些收益拱手让给普通大众呢？你不需要，除非这是拉高和抛售的最后阶段。 Uber 在 2019 年上市之前<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111015/story-uber.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">筹集了 100 亿美元</a>的私人资本，其中大部分来自软银和沙特王国，估值为 824 亿美元。四年后，公众股东获得了 3.5% 的年回报率。 Blue Apron 在 IPO 前私下筹集了 1.35 亿美元，超过 Netflix 和谷歌的总和。</p><p>今天上市的公司不一定是坏企业。 Airbnb 是一家伟大的公司，是我最大的持股之一，但对于其私人支持者来说，这比公开市场上的投资者来说是一项更好的投资——首次公开募股三年后，它的交易价格低于公开市场投资者可以购买的<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/10/airbnb-ipo-abnb-starts-trading-on-the-nasdaq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">第一笔交易。</a>库存。不再需要公开市场来推动增长的私人投资者会更长时间地持有公司，在将外壳扔给大众之前榨干所有的汁液。</p><h4>桌边残渣</h4><p>那么为什么要公开呢？就像酿酒师从压扁的葡萄上最后压榨他们的廉价标签一样，私人资本提供商还有另外一个伎俩，这也是 IPO 衰落故事的一部分。</p><p> “首次公开募股”是一个用词不当，因为最初很少向<em>公众</em>出售股票。相反，银行家将它们出售给由银行青睐的机构客户组成的一群买家。第一天的“流行”是这些买家向公司支付的股票价格（“发行价格”）与他们在交易第一天可以出售股票的价格之间的差额。以发行价获得 IPO 股票是对在其他地方（即不是您）产生费用的投资银行机构客户的奖励。为了奖励客户并为股票树立积极的基调，银行希望股票首日上涨。这并不新鲜，而且这些银行和公司之间长期以来一直存在紧张关系，他们将流行视为留在桌面上的钱。改变的是用于产生流行音乐的阴谋以及它消散的速度。</p><p>其中一个秘密是微小的漂浮物。 1980 年，IPO 的流通量中位数（即公司向公众发行的股份的百分比）占总股本的 29%。 2022 年，这一数字为<a href="https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/IPO-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15%</a> ，为四十年来的最低水平。在一个有效的市场中，浮动不应该影响价格，但如果你能把炒作机开得足够高并挤压供应，你就拥有了营销的失落方舟：人为稀缺。 Instacart 几周前首次公开募股时仅向公众发售了其总股本的 8%。该报道成为当天财经媒体的焦点，该股在首日交易中上涨了 12%。 Airbnb 仅向公众发售了 7.5% 的股票，而该股在开盘时就上涨了一倍多。 </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215420"

sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4>监禁</h4><p>从历史上看，短期上涨的价值较低，因为内部人士在出售股票之前会受到禁售期（通常为 180 天）的限制。然而，这种情况也在发生变化。 2021 年，25% 的 IPO 具有较短的禁售协议，允许内部人士在 180 天到期之前出售股票 - 这一比例是有记录以来的<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/13024bb1-8a46-4a87-979e-6a18a00a11e7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">最高水平</a>。其中，三分之二是科技公司（令人震惊）。直接上市（跳过银行机构管道）被宣传为一种比首次公开募股更民主的替代方案<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/10/02/direct-listing-is-a-more-elegant-approach-bill-gurley.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">，“对所有人开放和平等的机会”</a> ，并且<a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/direct-listings-vs-ipo-paths-to-going-public-51638305261" target="_blank" rel="noopener">越来越</a>受欢迎。需要明确的是，直接上市与准入关系不大，而与倾销关系更大，因为没有锁定要求。</p><p>小流通量的另一个好处是它可以让内部人士保留更多的控制权。这与双层股权结构的增加齐头并进。这些规定授予内部人士特殊股份，拥有10倍的投票权。创始人喜欢这一点，因为它可以让他们将风险与控制脱钩。 2021 年， <a href="https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/IPO-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24%</a>的 IPO 采用双层股权结构，高于 1980 年的 2%。在科技公司中，这一数字为 46%。 Robinhood 的使命是“投资民主化”——除非你投资 Robinhood，其创始人拥有公司 16% 的股份，但控制着 66% 的投票权股份。创始人并没有使投资民主化，而是将其独裁化。 </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215418"

/></p><h4>私人流动性</h4><p>首次公开募股的第二个动机是为早期投资者和员工创造流动性。但公有制不再是创造流动性的唯一途径。投资者越来越有能力在私人市场上抛售部分股票。 OpenAI 正在商谈以健康的估值<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-seeks-valuation-up-90-bln-sale-existing-shares-wsj-2023-09-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">出售现有股票</a>。 eToro 最近售出<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/israels-etoro-agrees-120-mln-secondary-share-sale-source-2023-07-31/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.2 亿美元</a>。去年上半年，在 IPO 市场冻结的情况下，私募股权公司出售了 570 亿美元的二级股，<a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/secondaries-2023-PE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">创下历史新高</a>。</p><h4>在贵宾室</h4><p>由于不需要公开市场融资，并且有更多寻找流动性的选择，私人投资者将继续为公司提供资金，直到公司到达以下两个站点之一：公司强大但成熟，并且完全收获了成长期的回报，或者它的模式是可疑的，现有股东需要向更大的傻瓜发出一系列虚假信号，这样他们就可以向独角兽动物园的游客扔粪便。</p><p>虽然私人资本投资者（又名非常富有的人）获得了收益，但公共投资者（又名其他所有人）却很难进入创造真正财富的市场。随着资本的集中，权力也随之集中。 “股东阶层”一直都是精英阶层。但它一度触及了富裕阶层，然后通过养老金和退休基金触及了大众——扩散了影响力，加强了民主。公有制的透明度要求可以防止勾结、贪污，并稳步迈向王朝社会。</p><p>相反，我们对富人进行了救助，科技公司获得了数万亿美元，在公共投资的基础上建立了厚厚的创新层，同时减少了研发并缴纳了更少的税款，并且对创新者进行了崇拜，尽管他们没有父亲或只是糟糕的投资者，但他们仍然继续俘获我们的感情和资本。</p><h4>该怎么办？</h4><p>否认你或任何其他人知道如何挑选股票的想法。投资低成本ETF和指数基金。此外，仅仅因为某人戴着厚厚的眼镜、经常出现在 CNBC 上、或者在中国的亚马逊上进行了幸运的投资，并不意味着他们知道自己在做什么。事实上，他们可能是你资本的糟糕受托人。事实上，这并不准确。 <a

来到谈判桌前要求降低购买力。然后……没有得到他们要求的东西—— <a href="https://www.wgacontract2023.org/the-campaign/summary-of-the-2023-wga-mba#:~:text=Most%20MBA%20minimums%20will%20increase%20by%205%25%20on,the%20result%20of%20patterns%20established%20in%20the%20industry." target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">他们只接受了 5%</a> 。与此同时，罢工的UAW <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uaw-rejects-stellantis-21-pay-141135050.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">拒绝了加薪20%的提议</a>，并要求加薪40%。</p><p>公平地说，该协议包括第二年和第三年分别加薪 4% 和 3.5%。然而，为了跟上过去三年（自上一份合同签订以来）的通货膨胀，作者需要在第一年<a href="https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/wga-contract-inflation-minimums-1235564920/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">增加 10%</a> 。新协议还包括增加 1% 的健康和养老金福利缴费以及海外特许权使用费，从我的角度来看，这些费用故意不透明且冗长，足以给会员足够的裸盖菇素，让他们产生幻觉，以为那里有一种药物。</p><p>当你考虑到作家因罢工而减薪 100% 的五个月时，本来就丑陋的数学变得可怕起来。如果需要一份为期三年的工会合同来弥补这些损失，您需要将作家工资（再次）增加 14%。这<em>还不包括</em>通货膨胀损失。因此，作家在<em>不失去</em>购买力的情况下需要增加的最低限度是 24%。</p><p>协议中我最喜欢的爵士乐手是，如果平台订阅者的 20% 观看了他们的节目，作家将获得 50% 的版税提升。是的，每当喷气机队赢得超级碗比赛时，我都会给我的员工 50% 的奖金。当然，这种事确实发生过……只是不那么频繁。 <em>《继承之战》</em>系列大结局的收视人数为<a href="https://clutchpoints.com/succession-news-series-finale-draws-record-viewership" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">300 万</a>，占 HBO 5000 万订户的 6%。</p><h4>好东西</h4><p>WGA 确实取得了一些有意义的成果。就像两个一样。首先，现在对作家室的人员配备有最低要求，这意味着年轻作家有更多的就业机会。其次，他们提高了制片厂必须雇用编剧演出的最低周数。换句话说，工作的持续时间更长。这些让步很有意义，也很好地体现了行会对工艺投资和人才培养的承诺。</p><h4>跟随鼠标</h4><p>然而，这整个过程分散了编剧、演员和创意界所有工作者应该关注的焦点。亨利·基辛格曾经这样评价我的行业：“大学政治之所以如此邪恶，是因为赌注太小了。”媒体也是如此。</p><p>上周我与一群好莱坞高管和作家进行了交谈。 （我正在<a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/film-credits/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">第六次</a>尝试电视。）他们对罢工感到担忧，但<em>更</em>担心他们的中坚力量“老鼠之家”几乎在一夜之间变成了不良资产。迪士尼股价跌至九年来的最低点。订户损失继续增加，最近一个季度 Disney+ 订阅量<a

href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1690/religion.aspx" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">75% of us</a> believe religion is losing influence. We&#39;re correct. Napoleon said religion is the only thing that keeps the poor from murdering the rich. As our nation prints more wealth and poverty, and as we register a decline in reasons to congregate (church, work, the mall), we are witnessing a palpable increase in hostility among Americans toward … other Americans. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215399" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="548" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-300x183.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-520x317.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-768x468.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-1536x936.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-1200x731.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> Exceptions distort our view of the long-term trend. Compared to 40% of Americans generally, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/02/16/faith-among-black-americans/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">59% of Black Americans</a> say religion is very important to them. (In part this is a legacy of the role of churches and church leaders in the Civil Rights Movement.) But their fidelity is waning: 28% of Gen Z Black people are religiously unaffiliated, compared with just 11% of baby boomers. Membership in the Mormon church, once a growth engine, has also <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2023/01/04/mormon-land-why-lds-church-is/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">stalled</a> .</p><p> Abroad, religious nationalism (which may be more the latter than the former) is driving political change in India, and it remains a headline issue in the Middle East. But even Saudi Arabia is creeping toward secularization. Much of the rest of the world is already there. In China, only 10% of people claim affiliation with a religion, and only half of them attend services. Only 11% of Western Europeans say religion is very important in their lives, and only 22% attend services regularly. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215400" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="563" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart-300x188.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart-520x325.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart-768x480.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart-1536x960.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart-1200x750.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> Meet the New Gods</h4><p> It&#39;s worth taking a moment to consider the monumental nature of this shift. Our species hasn&#39;t known a time when religion played such a small role in our lives. Being religious is our natural state. And nature abhors a vacuum.</p><p> We are finding substitutes in two realms, the spiritual and the corporeal. Humans need meaning, we crave stories and reasons and higher explanations for things. We want someone (or something) to tell us what it all means. I believe this was a significant factor behind the rise of Google. Now, even more so, it&#39;s powering our fascination with AI. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215401" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1.png" alt="" width="900" height="553" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1.png 960w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1-300x184.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1-520x320.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1-768x472.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> Google and ChatGPT are omnipresent, all-knowing, and soon, all-powerful. Our god(s) can drive cars and use credit cards. Sentient yet immortal, everywhere and nowhere — feels like a god worthy of worship, no? A: No.</p><p> If we&#39;re not worshiping the tech itself, we are treating its masters as high priests. No group cements this more than the Elon stan army. Their idol is a brilliant entrepreneur, a world-changing innovator, and a <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/4192647-elon-musks-dangerous-tweets-are-empowering-antisemites/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Jew-baiting</a> absent father of 11 (or 12)? The refusal to hold Musk to the same standards we try to live up to defines the distinction between admiration and worship.</p><p> Tech is not our only new god, however. Our need to follow is easily transferred from the pulpit to the stump. I didn&#39;t plan to write about politics this week, but it&#39;s inescapable. Donald Trump looms over the American landscape, more myth than man, worshiped as a savior persecuted by the sinners of the left. There&#39;s ideological and demographic overlap between Trump&#39;s followers and fundamentalist religion: Christian nationalist identity is highly correlated with <a class="c-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8724742/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8724742/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">political extremism and violence</a> , and was bound up in the events of January 6. Equally concerning: 85% of adherents believe or mostly believe that God has called Christians to exercise dominion over all areas of American society. (Spoiler alert, they haven&#39;t succeeded.)</p><h4> Empty Pantry</h4><p> Religion is not merely a spiritual succor. Religious institutions have long provided the foundation and framework of society. Their declining relevance leaves a vacuum of more immediate and practical concern than our need for meaning. Catholic schools enroll <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/253607/us-catholic-school-growth-slows-after-two-years-of-notable-increases-data-show" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">1.7 million</a> American kids. Around <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/faith-based-child-care/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">15%</a> of parents rely on faith-based child care. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951938/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">More than half</a> of food pantries, which people rely on <a href="https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4152&amp;context=jssw" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">heavily</a> during economic downturns, are church-affiliated.</p><p> For decades, one of the major fault lines in American politics has been the social safety net. I, and half the country, believe the government&#39;s role is to provide it. The other half hates the notion. It&#39;s no coincidence that my half is largely (not entirely) made up of people whose religious connection is scant.</p><p> Alain de Botton has a book about this, <em>Religion for Atheists</em> , in which he goes through the practical things religious institutions have provided in the past. In our increasingly atomized society, the physical coming together of weekly church attendance is sorely missed. Most religions provide moral guidelines that (at their heart) are simple and useful. Don&#39;t steal. Be good to your parents. Render aid to the needy.</p><h4> 4x</h4><p> My father has been married and divorced four times, so my religious indoctrination has been more varied than consistent. When I was at my dad&#39;s, I&#39;d go with Linda (No. 3) to a Unitarian church. At my mom&#39;s, we&#39;d go intermittently to Temple.</p><p> Statistics and trends only tell us so much. The role of religion is personal. While inconsistent, the impact of religion on my development was real. I remember the rabbi at Temple Isaiah delivering a <em>d&#39;var Torah</em> that spanned from the conflict in the Middle East to the role of friendship. Afterward, over a brisket dip at Junior&#39;s Deli, my mom and I would discuss the sermon, and I remember thinking, “This is fun, and I&#39;m good at it.” I asked my mom what rabbis did and how much money they made. “They educate and comfort people, and not much. However, they command a great deal of respect.”</p><p> In high school, my closest friend was Mormon. He was part of a two-parent family who loved sports, laughed a lot, and treated me well. As a latch-key kid raised by a working single mother, I was at the Jarvis household almost every day. I went to church events, played on their sports teams, and even went to services a few times. I never felt any pressure to convert/sign-up/etc. My observation from spending several years in and around Mormons and their church: The Mormon faith is strange, and Mormons are wonderful.</p><h4> Devout Atheist</h4><p> My path to atheism has been downhill. I&#39;ve always been skeptical and judgmental, and consider myself a scientist. This made it easier to dismiss believers as idiots. As I got older, I realized my belief that all “this” was nothing and then it exploded sounded no less bat-shit crazy than the parables about loaves and fishes. Regardless, my atheism is a source of strength, as it motivates me to envision my death — the end of the road vs. an off-ramp. Imagining my death has made me less afraid of it and more bold in my behavior preceding the event (ie, now).</p><p> I&#39;ve been more bold in my career, but also in my emotions. Risking embarrassment, I frequently tell people I love them because … why wouldn&#39;t I? Those who might laugh, like me, face the same destination … soon. I&#39;d also like to think that the absence of preordained truths fosters a relentless pursuit of knowledge, a deeper appreciation for the wonders of the universe, and a profound respect for the inherent value of all living beings.</p><h4> Wanting</h4><p> It&#39;s clear to me that every being will register joy and tragedy, and the ratio is 90% a function of when and where you&#39;re born and the chemistry you inherit. Seneca believed religion was regarded by the poor as true, the wise as false, and the powerful as useful. As someone who has been all of those things, however, I find the absence of religion and opportunities to congregate with strangers leaves a void. I&#39;m getting older, wanting to serve in the agency of others, to be part of something bigger, and register comfort. I&#39;m left wanting. I&#39;m losing my religion.</p><p> Life is so rich, </p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/nmnm_images/Scott-Signature-NMNM.png" /></p><p> PS This week on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/63bnZv2u00uIkeXSCQJXmJ" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Prof G Markets podcast</a> we discussed the Google antitrust trial.

Its oxygen is innovation, which requires healthy markets. America has a</span> <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/umpires-not-kings/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proud legacy</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">of knowing when a corporate organism has morphed into an invasive species suffocating an ecosystem via predatory pricing, bundling, or other actions that control the supply of products and/or services. Historically, we step in — a competitive marketplace takes precedence over an aggregation of individual or corporate power. Antitrust laws pierce the canopy, oxygenating the marketplace and preserving a core attribute of innovation and prosperity: churn.</span></p><p> In the 19th century a series of “trusts” were established, in the belief that a centralization of power and sectors, run by thoughtful men, would be good for the economy. Soon there was recognition that the resultant abuse and income inequality warranted an antitrust movement. When Teddy Roosevelt broke up Standard Oil, it was a signal to the nation that Americans were in charge, not American corporations. The government was the sheriff, protecting the little guy.</p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">History is rhyming. This week in a</span> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/12/tech/google-antitrust-lawsuit-government-trial-duplicate-2/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal court in Washington</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Department of Justice is attempting a similar Heimlich maneuver on the $180 billion search market.</span></p><h4> Bill and Paul&#39;s Excellent Adventure</h4><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft in 1975, in the shadow of industry behemoth IBM. For decades, IBM was something akin today&#39;s Apple, Google, and Microsoft rolled into one dominant company. So dominant, it was sued by the US government for antitrust violations, which triggered a major change to IBM&#39;s business model: It</span> <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/mainframe-computers/7/172"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“unbundled” software and hardware</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">, meaning it stopped giving its software away for free to its hardware customers. This created, for the first time, a competitive market for software. A market that Gates and Allen would enter just six years later, developing software for the emerging category of personal computers.</span></p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next decade, MSFT software would power the PC revolution: MS-DOS in 1981, Word in 1983, Windows and Excel in 1985, PowerPoint in 1987. Tellingly, PowerPoint was acquired from a nascent competitor, not developed in-house. Over the next decade, Microsoft became known more for entrenchment than innovation. “Embrace, extend, and extinguish” was the company&#39;s strategy for suffocating would-be competitors. It worked — Microsoft supplanted IBM as the dominant force in computing. By 1998, Windows</span> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ms-doj-economist-calls-microsoft-a-harmful-monopoly/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">controlled over 90%</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">of the PC operating system market, and Bill Gates was the wealthiest person in the world.</span></p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As with IBM before it, Microsoft&#39;s success was recognized with the business world&#39;s Lifetime Achievement Award: a DOJ antitrust suit. The crux of the government&#39;s claim was similar to that made against IBM a quarter century earlier: Microsoft was abusing its commanding position to limit rivals&#39; ability to get traction with competing products. The headline product in 1998 was the browser: Netscape represented Microsoft&#39;s first serious competitive threat in a decade; to stop it, the company bundled its Explorer browser for free with Windows and cut deals with PC manufacturers to make Explorer the default browser on computers. The DOJ believed this was anticompetitive, the court agreed, and the company signed a consent decree ensuring PC manufacturers greater flexibility regarding the software they bundled with Windows-powered computers.</span></p><h4> Google It</h4><p> The DOJ&#39;s enforcement action oxygenated the marketplace in ways nobody could have foreseen. The same year the department sued Microsoft, the cycle was beginning again. Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google in 1998, and over the next decade their company rode a wave of innovation to global dominance. Adwords, the revenue-generating portion of the business, launched in 2000. Then Gmail in 2004, Maps in 2005, Docs in 2006, Android in 2007, and Chrome in 2008. All built on the success of the company&#39;s core products, Google search and the Android operating system — just as Microsoft built its empire on the dominance of its Windows operating system.</p><p> Would Google exist today had the DOJ not sued Microsoft? Unlikely. Microsoft tried to compete with Google in search and mobile in the 2000s, but, unable to deploy its bundling and exclusivity strategies, it had to rely on its products — which <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft-learns-to-crawl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were</a> <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3336057/how-microsoft-failed-with-windows-10-mobile.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inferior</a> .</p><p> Google doesn&#39;t dominate computing today to the extent Microsoft did in 1998. Nobody does, as “computing” is a much broader space. But its control of search — the most common entry point to the internet — is a nearly pitch-perfect echo of Microsoft circa 2001. Similarly, a quarter century after its founding, Google has a more than 90% market share, a sclerotic artifact of market power vs. a function of innovation. Its market dominance creates a virtuous cycle of increasing power. An estimated <a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/search-engine-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9 billion</a> Google searches occur every day, vs. 400 million for Bing. The massive delta of data and reach makes for a better product: Click-through rates for ads on Google are <a href="https://www.spyfu.com/blog/google-ads-vs-bing-ads/#:~:text=We%20found%20a%2030%25%20higher%20CTR%20from%20our,3.17%25%20Bing%E2%80%99s%20CTR%20for%20all%20industries%20%3D%202.83%25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30%</a> greater than on Bing. More usage = more data = more advertising, and so on. Today, Google&#39;s parent Alphabet is worth $1.75 trillion and employs 175,000 people. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215389" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/donut-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/donut-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/donut-chart-300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/donut-chart-520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/donut-chart-768x432.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/donut-chart-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/donut-chart-1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> However, what was the last innovative Google product? Restructuring the brand&#39;s architecture under Alphabet? Earnings growth has, mostly, been a function of finding new ways to extract profits from its monopoly: Google search results have become a billboard for Google-sponsored results interspersed with content harvested from other sites and links to Google&#39;s own services. In 2020, <em><a href="https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/07/28/how-we-analyzed-google-search-results-web-assay-parsing-tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Markup</a></em> found that Google-associated results (ads for or links to the company&#39;s other services) constituted over 60% of the first screen of an average Google search result. And in 1 of 5 searches, <em>the entire first screen is Google results</em> . This is the meat of its business: Search ads generate <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">57% of the company&#39;s revenue</a> . </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215391" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="544" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart-300x181.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart-520x314.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart-768x464.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart-1536x928.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart-1200x725.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite turning search results into a carousel of ads and Google services, Google has racked up 90% market share in search queries — 95% on mobile. How? As Microsoft once did, it leverages its control over the most popular mobile operating system (Android) and spends unprecedented sums on deals assuring it is the default search engine on computers and phones — more than $10 billion per year. Google says it&#39;s the leader because it has the best product, but if that&#39;s so … why pay $10 billion a year to be the default? Dominance in search is also self-fulfilling, as it gives the company unrivaled data re what people search for and what results generate clicks.

Yes, government action is a component of a free market, despite what the techno-libertarian crowd would have you believe. Markets are not the product of divine creation coupled with a laissez-faire approach to regulation but a function of human effort that depends on rules and enforcement to work efficiently. We&#39;ve lost our way with respect to this (see above: lobbying) and are paying the price with declining competition and innovation.</span></p><h4> Concentrate</h4><p> And not just in tech. Three companies control <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/business/dr-pepper-history/index.html#:~:text=By%20volume%2C%20Coca%2DCola%20controlled,according%20to%20Beverage%20Digest's%20data." target="_blank" rel="noopener">95%</a> of the US beverage market.

Four airlines control over two-thirds of US air travel, though they are substandard — the highest-ranked US airline by quality of service is Delta … in <a href="https://www.worldairlineawards.com/worlds-top-100-airlines-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20th place</a> , behind Air New Zealand. The next is United, in 49th place, trailing Azul Brazilian and Malaysia Airlines. Monopoly has its privileges, however: In 2014 the <em>Economist</em> calculated that US airlines generated $22.40 in profits per passenger, while European airlines, subject to the rigors of a free market, earned just $7.84.</p><p> We see similar consolidation in banking, pharmaceuticals, health care, retail drug stores, publishing (where the DOJ recently had a big win, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/penguin-random-house-blocked-from-acquiring-rival-publisher-simon-schuster-11667257838" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopping the merger</a> of Penguin Random House with Simon &amp; Schuster), <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/10/the-invisible-power-of-big-glasses-eyewear-industry-essilor-luxottica" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eyeglasses</a> , and <a href="https://www.fooddive.com/news/beer-industry-scrutinized-by-treasury-department-following-wave-of-consolid/618587/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beer</a> . <a href="https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/global-consolidation-5-charts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Waves of consolidation</a> are washing over nearly every sector. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215387" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1100" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-768x440.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1200x688.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><h4> Oxygenation</h4><p> Antitrust enforcement actions are perceived as punishments or moral judgments, but we should think of them as recognition. If a company is good enough for long enough, it can achieve market dominance and earn its profits from stifling competition vs. competing on products or services. It&#39;s the logical, shareholder-driven thing to do. And when we stop them, the benefits accrue to almost everyone. When the US broke up Standard Oil in 1911, its largest shareholder, John D. Rockefeller, became the wealthiest man in the world: The separated companies, free to compete and innovate in the market, were worth dramatically more than when bundled together. The breakup of AT&amp;T <a href="https://www.promarket.org/2023/02/20/when-considering-breaking-up-big-tech-we-should-look-back-to-att/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlocked enormous value in the telecommunications industry</a> , leading to more patents, more profits, and eventually the fertile ground needed for the internet market explosion in the 1990s. Microsoft wasn&#39;t broken up in 2001, but it flourished despite the limitations the DOJ put on it, becoming a more innovative company. The action also fired the starting gun for growth in a sector that&#39;s created enormous stakeholder value. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215393" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1200" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent-300x188.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent-520x325.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent-768x480.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent-1536x960.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent-1200x750.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><p> This month&#39;s trial concerning Google&#39;s search dominance likely won&#39;t lead to the breakup of Alphabet. However, I believe severing YouTube and Google would create significant value for shareholders, employees, and customers, who&#39;d see their rents decline. Soon after the breakup, the Alphabet board would demand a strategy for competing in video, and the newly constituted YouTube board would ask how the company was going to challenge its former parent in text search. Even without a breakup, limitations on Google&#39;s ability to perform infanticide on emerging competitors would be welcome. History suggests we are at the start of another 25-year cycle. Just as the web was driving innovation in 1998 (when Google was founded) and personal computers drove Microsoft&#39;s early success, AI appears to be the emerging volcanic force. We need to ensure that the nascent challengers to Google (and to Meta and Apple and Amazon) have the light, air, and space needed to survive and create trillions in shareholder value and hundreds of thousands of jobs.</p><h4> Ground Zero</h4><p> This isn&#39;t about just search engine advertising, or even tech. The power of incumbents to suffocate insurgents before they can grow is mirrored in our society at large. Ground zero for many of the biggest challenges facing America can be traced to one core problem: For the first time in our nation&#39;s history, 30-year-olds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUl5rSpfCeI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren&#39;t doing as well</a> as their parents were at 30. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215392" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1200" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children-300x188.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children-520x325.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children-768x480.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children-1536x960.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children-1200x750.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This creates rage, shame, and a loss of faith in one another and the country. Limiting Google&#39;s default deals or breaking it up won&#39;t cure these ills. But it&#39;s a step, and a model for what we need to do elsewhere: clear incumbent overgrowth, creating the light and space for the young to prosper.</span></p><p> Life is so rich, </p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/nmnm_images/Scott-Signature-NMNM.png" /></p><p> PS My newest lecture, The AI Optimist, is happening next week.

The doomed nation, according to Americans? A: America.</p><p> In the &#39;80s, we decided Japan was doing to us economically what they couldn&#39;t do militarily four decades prior. My second year in business school (Berkeley &#39;92) was devoted to a forensic analysis of our loss to Japan. Computers and cars were the future, and Japan was building them faster, better, and cheaper. In 1984, Walter Mondale asked Reagan at the presidential debates, “What do we want our kids to do? Sweep up around the Japanese computers?” Three years later, Paul Kennedy wrote a book about it, <em>The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers</em> , comparing the US empire to the British empire. Japan&#39;s GDP soared to 40% of ours, and we feared what might happen when that number hit 100. It never did. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215381" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-01.png" alt="" width="900" height="516" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-01.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-01-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-01-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-01-768x440.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-01-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-01-1200x688.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> In the early aughts, our soft tissue was geopolitical. The tragedy of 9/11 was described as an “inevitable outcome.” Our subsequent invasion of Afghanistan inspired books including <em>Dark Ages America: The Final Phase of Empire</em> , and <em>Are We Rome? The Fall of an Empire and the Fate of America</em> . Each offered a similar theme: Our time was running out.</p><p> Today the decline is (supposedly) more imminent. January 6 was the “ <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/us-news/2021/12/20/january-6-the-beginning-of-the-end-to-american-democracy/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">beginning of the end</a> .” Russia&#39;s invasion revealed a “ <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/08/europe-america-military-empire-decline/670960/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">great unwinding</a> .” Nations view us “ <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/29/bucerius-global-leadership-america-democratic-decline/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">with pity</a> ,” and we are “ <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/america-unrecognizable-brink-collapse-experts-warn-turning-own-legacy" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">on the brink of collapse</a> .” Just last week, the <em>New York Times</em> opinion page compared us <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/04/opinion/america-rome-empire.html?smid=url-share" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">to Rome</a> (again). These headlines are click bait, and we still take the bait: Three-quarters of Americans believe our country is in structural decline, and the song of the summer is an <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/rich-men-north-of-richmond-billboard-charts-b2398459.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">ode to our demise</a> . </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215379" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/people-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="461" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/people-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/people-chart-300x154.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/people-chart-520x266.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/people-chart-768x393.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/people-chart-1536x786.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/people-chart-1200x614.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> It&#39;s not just the public. Among economists there&#39;s a growing school of thought that our situation is dire. Two months ago, ratings agency Fitch <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/fitch-downgrades-united-states-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa-outlook-stable-01-08-2023" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">downgraded</a> America&#39;s credit rating due to “fiscal deterioration” and “erosion of governance.” The debt ceiling debacle didn&#39;t help: Investors “ <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/24085743-7cec-41a8-8d97-7d9e05a75df6" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">should worry</a> .” Our debt-to-GDP ratio is hovering around 120%; back when it was 70%, Brookings called it <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-real-national-security-threat-americas-debt/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">“the real national security threat.”</a></p><p> Many believe we are in the midst of “dedollarization,” ceding our status as the world&#39;s reserve currency because of our unsustainable spending habits and an overall loss of faith globally. JPMorgan recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/signs-de-dollarisation-emerge-dollar-top-currency-jpmorgan-2023-06-05/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">flagged it</a> , an ex-CIA adviser plainly <a href="https://mronline.org/2023/06/09/ex-cia-advisor-predicts-date-when-u-s-dollar-hegemony-will-collapse/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">predicted it</a> , and one prominent tech investor <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/18/buy-now-2-trillion-fed-bazooka-triggers-shock-hyperinflation-warning-amid-bitcoin-ethereum-and-crypto-price-boom/?sh=43a0558b7f38" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">bet $1 million</a> on it. Ray Dalio, the founder of the world&#39;s largest hedge fund, hinges his recent bestseller, <em>Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order</em> , on America&#39;s inability to adapt to our loss of status and power. Empires win and lose their hegemony depending on their reserve currency status, and in Ray&#39;s view, we&#39;re near freefall.</p><h4> We&#39;re Not</h4><p> Culturally you could build a compelling case. National pride is at an <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/394202/record-low-extremely-proud-american.aspx" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">all-time low</a> , and the “vibe” in America is that things are not good. (See above: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqSA-SY5Hro" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">the song</a> .) But these are functions of perception, and as I&#39;ve written before, <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/cognitive-dissonance/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">human perception is flawed</a> .</p><p> This is an economic discussion. And when you look at the data, you&#39;ll find every diagnosis of our supposedly terminal illness is proof the doctor is jonesing for us to die. We&#39;ll examine them, but first, a brief summary of the doomer&#39;s economic vision for America. It goes roughly as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 1) America keeps borrowing more money, leading to an increased burden of interest payments.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 2) Foreign nations increasingly question our ability to make good on our debts, leading to low demand for US Treasuries and thus low demand for dollars.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 3) Once dedollarization takes effect and the dollar is supplanted as the world&#39;s reserve currency, the US will be forced to ratchet up Treasury yields to increase demand for our debt, leading to even greater interest payments.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 4) This will crowd out private investment, as well as public investment in our own infrastructure. GDP growth will grind to a halt, and eventually we&#39;ll default on our debt.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 5) At that point we&#39;ll be unable to borrow or finance our growth, and</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 6) America will collapse.</p><h4> Dedollarized</h4><p> Doomsday is due next century or next year, depending on who you ask. (That ex-CIA adviser said it&#39;d be last month.) But the catalysts are consistent, and one of them is this notion of dedollarization.</p><p> The argument is that foreign central banks are losing interest in the dollar. The stat dedollarists point to is that the dollar has fallen from 70% share of the world&#39;s currency reserves to 60% in the past 20 years. That may sound significant, but the scope is comically small. When you zoom out you find that in the &#39;80s our share was 50%, and 30 years before it was 40%. The only accurate description of the dollar&#39;s reserve status over the past 75 years is … unwaveringly dominant. At 20%, the next-best option (the euro) is not within striking distance. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215376" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-02.png" alt="" width="900" height="516" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-02.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-02-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-02-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-02-768x440.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-02-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-02-1200x688.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> However, it&#39;s not the euro dedollarists are talking about, but the currencies of ascendant nations, including China. A common headline is “Yuan&#39;s share of global reserves hits record high.” Less common is any mention of that “high”: 2.6%. The president of Brazil made headlines recently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">calling on</a> the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) to join forces to create a new global reserve currency. The world&#39;s reaction was lackluster — and even South Africa&#39;s own central bank governor <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/what-is-brics-currency-could-one-be-adopted-2023-08-23/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">played it down</a> : “If you want it, you&#39;ll have to get a banking union, you&#39;ll have to get a fiscal union, you&#39;ve got to get macroeconomic convergence.” Translation: pipe dream.</p><p> Another pipe the hallucinations flow through is bitcoin. Among its many use cases is its potential to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/cryptoverse-10-billion-reasons-bitcoin-could-become-reserve-currency-2022-04-12/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">supplant the dollar</a> . The argument: The value of the dollar is predicated on faith in the US government; the value of bitcoin is predicated on faith in, well, bitcoin. Many bitcoin bulls argued the latter will ultimately win — and for a second there in 2021, it looked feasible. As with every other dollar competitor, though, the cryptocurrency ran out of steam. Today the total value of bitcoin is 12 times smaller than the amount of dollars held in global central bank reserves. So next time someone tells you the dollar will be replaced, ask: With what? By any metric, the most innovative payment platform or store of value has been, and remains, USD. More good news: Minting dollars doesn&#39;t require the energy consumption of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Argentina</a> .

This is true of the dollar, and it&#39;s also true of US debt.</p><p> Take Fitch&#39;s downgrade of our national credit rating, for example. What should have been a seismic shock to the global bond market by the premier ratings agency turned out to be a catastrophist headline. The bond market barely registered the news, with the 10-year Treasury yield inching up 4 basis points. Goldman put it deftly: “We do not believe there are any meaningful holders of Treasury securities who will be forced to sell due to a downgrade.” Jamie Dimon put it better: The downgrade was <a href="https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-080223/card/jamie-dimon-calls-fitch-downgrade-ridiculous--EyRt09DjeiPvbY2HNWNm?mod=livecoverage_web" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">“ridiculous.”</a></p><p> As with currencies, creditworthiness is relative. The question creditors should ask isn&#39;t “how likely am I to get my money back,” it&#39;s “who&#39;s <em>more</em> likely to give me my money back?” And when it comes to sovereign debt, there is no better option than the United States. Sure, Xi Jinping may make Biden look like a web browser with 19 tabs open, not knowing where the music is coming from — but the Chinese Communist Party also systematically <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-delays-release-economic-indicators-including-q3-gdp-2022-10-17/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">withholds</a> , <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/15/business/china-youth-unemployment.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">suspends</a> , and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-forensic-examination-of-chinas-national-accounts/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">lies</a> about the nation&#39;s economic data. The Party has even ordered its own economists to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b2e0ad77-3521-4da9-8120-1f0c1fdd98f8" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">stop talking</a> about negative trends. Who would you rather lend to?</p><h4> False Prophets</h4><p> This extends beyond national debt. There are several linchpin data points declinists point to that are supposed to forecast our imminent undoing, but the people who cite them also forget to compare those metrics to those of other nations.</p><p> For example: inflation. Last year, inflation hit a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/13/economy/cpi-inflation-june/index.html#:~:text=Inflation%20surged%20to%20a%20new%20pandemic-era%20peak%20in,by%208.6%25%20for%20the%20year%20ended%20in%20May." target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">40-year high</a> . Some predicted America would enter a period of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/balaji-srinivasan-says-hyperinflation-happening-now-makes-million-dollar-bets-on-bitcoin-price-exceeding-1m-in-90-days/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">hyperinflation</a> . However, when you compare our situation to those of other nations, it&#39;s less bad. Significantly less bad. In the US, prices have risen 3.2% year over year. In the UK, it&#39;s 6.8% — more than double. In the eurozone, it&#39;s 5.3%. And yet — despite US inflation continuing to come down and wage growth recently <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pay-raises-are-finally-beating-inflation-after-two-years-of-falling-behind-3e89bc2d" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">surpassing it</a> — 74% of Americans still believe inflation is <a href="https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/WSJ_Poll_Aug_2023.pdf?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">headed in the wrong direction</a> . </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215380" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inflation.png" alt="" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inflation.png 960w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inflation-300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inflation-520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inflation-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> Another catastrophist go-to: the debt-to-GDP ratio. Currently, our national debt amounts to 120% of our GDP. In other words, we&#39;re borrowing more money than we&#39;re making. Sounds bad. Until you look at other nations and realize it&#39;s, wait for it, less bad. Singapore is at 130%, Italy, at 150%, and Japan, at 260%.</p><p> For years, economists have been drawing red lines around “no-go” debt-to-GDP numbers, but time has shown these red lines are also meaningless. The Maastricht Treaty said don&#39;t go higher than <a href="https://www.bundesbank.de/en/statistics/public-finances/maastricht-deficit-and-debt-level/maastricht-deficit-and-debt-level-793140" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">60%</a> . The World Bank, <a href="https://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/1813-9450-5391" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">77%</a> . One landmark Harvard study, “Growth in a Time of Debt,” claimed 90% was the tipping point. That study caused panic until three years later researchers found the data was faulty and the conclusion <a href="https://peri.umass.edu/images/WP322.pdf" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">wrong</a> . The reality is there is no magic number. Japan is at 260% and Botswana, 20%. Would you rather hold Japanese yen or Botswanan pula?</p><h4> Vitals</h4><p> By nearly every measure, America is doing just fine. Better than fine. Our annual GDP is $26 trillion — 40% greater than China&#39;s, whose population is four times larger. And, despite our enormous output, our economy is still growing, with <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2023/gross-domestic-product-second-quarter-2023-advance-estimate" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">2.4%</a> GDP growth last quarter. China&#39;s is higher, but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-q2-gdp-growth-slows-08-qq-just-above-expectations-2023-07-17/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">slowing</a> faster than expected. Meanwhile the yuan continues to slide and this week hit a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-economic-woes-mount-yuan-193616370.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFHvi1YBbEpGlSYbrfLApuMW1Ke5TixdDL0Omrr_A5ie1xrktJGjtxS0Ng-cUimAjqC0KrpZ2qSGa2dfDuMpzkE5RbGI6p61Cvl6fAMvs3grsT5jBP_4fp7w8K4jhjZLY9yzGvPSfOzLBH0ZrP7QQFVtnB8WHQSw-VBAAWnARwz1" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">16-year low</a> . We have many unique advantages, including unrivaled innovation, the best universities, the best military, strong rule of law, a willingness to embrace risk, and a culture of doing the right thing (I believe this). Last year, US startups received <a href="https://dealroom.co/guides/global" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">$245 billion</a> in venture funding — roughly equal to the rest of the world combined. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215378" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bubble-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bubble-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bubble-chart-300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bubble-chart-520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bubble-chart-768x432.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bubble-chart-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bubble-chart-1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> Upstream in the public markets, we remain dominant. Nine of the ten largest companies in the world are domained in America. Nvidia, the undisputed leader in AI, the next world-changing technology, is headquartered in Santa Clara. Investors have reaped the benefits, and continue to wager their money on America. In the past decade the US stock market has returned <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-united-states-bmi/#overview" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">10%</a> per year. Compare that to Europe ( <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-europe-bmi/#overview" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">2%</a> ) or China ( <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-china-bmi/#overview" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">0.09%</a> ) or Australia ( <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-australia-bmi/#overview" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">-0.2%</a> ).</p><p> Meanwhile, our near-term economic prospects look good. <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Unemployment</a> is hovering at record lows. Inflation has fallen precipitously and is low relative to our peers (see above). <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2022/demo/SEHSD-wp2022-24.html#:~:text=We%20find%20that%20the%20Child,lifted%20above%20the%20poverty%20line." target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Poverty rates</a> are in decline. <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/disposable-income-by-country" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Disposable income</a> is higher than any other country. We have a lot to be proud of.</p><h4> Exceptionalism</h4><p> The schadenfreude we feel for our own country when it stumbles is nothing new. In fact, I would argue that in a democracy this is a feature not a bug. Things appear brighter when our favored political party is at the helm, and vice versa when it isn&#39;t. A case in point is the consumer sentiment index, which is supposed to be an economic barometer, but is really a political one. In 2019 Republicans felt great about the economy, Democrats less so. Then Biden got elected and the relationship flipped. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215375" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-03.png" alt="" width="900" height="516" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-03.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-03-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-03-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-03-768x440.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-03-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-03-1200x688.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> People will argue I&#39;m optimistic because a Democrat&#39;s in charge. I recognize my political bias and intentionally adjust for it. And still, when I look at the US economy and America&#39;s position as a global power, I repeatedly land on a singular conclusion: The glass is half-full.</p><p> This conclusion won&#39;t sell books nor grow this newsletter — history has proven that “Things Marginally Better Today” does not get clicks. But it&#39;s the truth. And the truth, as with most things in life, is usually not as good or bad as we&#39;d hoped. We are the least bad of our kind. When I look at the data, much less my personal situation, I can&#39;t help but hate my life less and less every day.</p><p> If you are healthy, have someone who loves you, and enjoy a household income greater than $34,000, then you are in the top 1% globally.

The markets recovered, led by a small number of stocks that dominate the Nasdaq. The hype machine has returned to full spin cycle. Animal spirits have returned as we, again, become increasingly skeptical of skepticism. Some of today&#39;s prophets will turn out to be frauds (just like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/18/former-theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-sentenced-to-more-than-11-years-in-prison.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">last</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/11/business/sam-bankman-fried-bail-hearing/index.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">time</a> )</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and, unable to raise money or hawk SPACs, will start podcasts. I wrote the following post 18 months ago during the froth and, as our subscribers have grown 50% and we enjoy a 44% open rate … three quarters of you have not read it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p><hr /><p>[The following was originally published on January 21, 2022.]</p><p> <em>“A man&#39;s reach should exceed his grasp, or what&#39;s a heaven for?”</em></p><p> — Robert Browning</p><p> Entrepreneur is a synonym for salesperson, and salesperson is the pedestrian term for storyteller. Pro tip: No startup makes sense. We (entrepreneurs) are all impostors who must deploy a fiction (ie story) that captures imaginations and capital to pull the future forward and turn rhyme into reason. No business I have started, at the moment of inception, made any sense … until it did. Or didn&#39;t. The only way to predict the future is to make it.</p><p> This is not the same as lying. There&#39;s a real distinction between an entrepreneur and a liar: Entrepreneurs believe their story will come true. This requires confidence … and delusion. It helps to be somewhat detached from reality — to assume that, for whatever reason, <em>you</em> are the one who can see into the future, and that in the new world your product/service will be needed and successful, despite overwhelming evidence (ie the current reality) that it&#39;s not. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">reality distortion field</a> if you will.</p><h4> The Crazy Ones</h4><p> A vision that&#39;s not widely derided likely isn&#39;t much of a vision. MLK was a radical reformer who had a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/17/politics/mlk-polling-analysis/index.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">63% disapproval rating</a> at the height of his activism. Women were perceived as physically incapable of the demands of flight, until Amelia Earhart landed her Lockheed Vega in an Irish farmer&#39;s field. Steve Jobs was a Zen Buddhist college dropout who believed he didn&#39;t need to shower because he only ate fruit and that you could treat pancreatic cancer with juice therapy. He also believed he could put computers in the homes and pockets of everyone on Earth. Crazy.</p><p> Being a great storyteller carries risks. Success begets acolytes who tell you you&#39;re right when you&#39;re wrong. Worse, you start believing them. This leads down a dangerous path where vision breaks from reality, and — likely aided by a fear of failure — curdles your confidence into a con.</p><h4> Elizabeth Holmes</h4><p> Holmes was assembled in a factory from parts of prior visionaries: smart, Stanford dropout, turtleneck, building blood-testing technology. Plus a nice backstory: Her professor told her the original concept for Theranos would never work. In addition, hundreds of millions in funding from backers including Tim Draper and Larry Ellison, coupled with covers on <em>Fortune</em> and <em>Forbes</em> , were a heavy blanket of affirmation that ensured Ms. Holmes was a visionary. The visionary narrative is a self-perpetuating machine: a flywheel of storytelling, capital, and the future that capital can pull forward, which buttresses the storytelling, and so on and so on.</p><p> Fun fact: Ms. Holmes cost her investors less than a billion dollars, didn&#39;t make any real money herself, and is going to prison. Adam Neumann cost his investors $11 billion, received a 10% commission on those losses, and is going to Coachella. Note: Ms. Holmes&#39;s vision progressed to the exaggeration/fabrication of contracts and clients, whereas Mr. Neumann&#39;s “only” went so far as accounting irregularities.</p><h4> When I Say Steve, You Say Jobs</h4><p> Fast forward: There was no working technology, and Ms. Holmes has been convicted by a jury of her peers — and faces <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/03/tech/elizabeth-holmes-verdict/index.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">20 years</a> in prison. Soon after, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/04/technology/elizabeth-holmes-verdict.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">VCs distanced themselves</a> , claiming they&#39;d seen through the facade. The tell for people who exaggerate for a living is, after it&#39;s been deemed illegal, they begin preaching the importance of restraint. The narrative being wrapped around the very unlikeable Ms. Holmes is that she&#39;s an outlier. No, she&#39;s just one point on the line that is our storytelling economy in a frothy part of the cycle.</p><p> The Valley&#39;s <a href="https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/what-happens-when-you-fake-it-and-dont-make-it-elizabeth-holmes-fraud-verdict-offers-a-warning/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">“always tell the truth”</a> sermon is reductionist and hypocritical. It ignores the fact that many of our nation&#39;s most valuable companies are priced on promises of technologies that don&#39;t exist. The entire venture capital industry, in fact, is predicated on promising things that don&#39;t exist.</p><p> Microsoft, perhaps the most successful tech company in history, got its break when Bill Gates <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/putting-microsoft-on-the-map-1991417" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">sold IBM an operating system</a> he didn&#39;t have. (He and Paul Allen subsequently bought what they needed from another programmer, but they didn&#39;t tell him they had the deal with IBM to distribute it.) Allegedly, an engineer at the company coined the term “vaporware” a year later. Promising something that doesn&#39;t exist is as central to the Valley ethos as late-night coding sessions, hoodies, and the hallucination that the public has asked you to solve the world&#39;s problems vs. just do less damage.</p><p> <em>“[Google Glass] will be broadly available. You won&#39;t have to jump through any hoops.”</em></p><p> — Sergey Brin, 2013</p><p> <em>“Can we build a better phone for prime members? The answer is yes.”</em></p><p> — Jeff Bezos, 2014</p><p> <em>“A year from now, We&#39;ll have over a million cars with full self-driving.”</em></p><p> — Elon Musk, 2019</p><p> Yes, claims about health-care solutions warrant scrutiny beyond whether or not rich investors get their money back, but Holmes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/03/technology/elizabeth-holmes-trial-verdict" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">wasn&#39;t convicted for defrauding patients</a> . She&#39;s going to prison because she ripped off George Schultz, not because her bogus blood-test machine errantly told someone they had HIV.</p><p> Florida AR company Magic Leap has (no joke) burnt billions since 2010, with nothing other than a failed $2,300 headset to show for it. The company routinely <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2017/12/20/magic_leap/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">hyped technology that didn&#39;t exist</a> , even using Hollywood special effects to mock up its PR videos. An early (fired) employee called the company&#39;s founder “ <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/09/26/magic-leap-tried-to-create-an-alternate-reality-its-founder-was-already-in-one/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">a believer in magic</a> .” It was meant as a compliment. And the tricks keep coming. In October, Magic Leap <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721345/magic-leap-500-million-funding-ar-headset" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">announced</a> it had raised another $550 million and was pivoting from consumer to … wait for it … health care. Nobody seems all that concerned that a company with a 12-year track record of false promises and fake products is now going into medicine. And, with the right leadership and engineers, it could build something valuable. You know … vision and capital … and more vision and more capital.</p><p> The line between vision and fraud is only drawn in hindsight. We set arbitrary deadlines for entrepreneurs to deliver on their vision, and their vision only becomes fraud when we say time&#39;s up. What if Holmes, with five more years and another billion dollars, shipped a working product? Or pivoted to a home-testing machine for an acute respiratory syndrome?</p><p> <em>“Real artists ship.”</em></p><p> — Steve Jobs</p><h4></h4><h4> Heretic</h4><p> When valuations are overwhelmingly driven by stories, things can get ugly. Investors will do whatever it takes to defend their narrative — their investment depends on their flocks screaming “heretic!” at anybody who questions the scripture, as the foundation doesn&#39;t hold up to more modern orthodoxies (ie math). Theranos employees <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/leaked-theranos-video-shows-employees-playing-video-game-where-you-shoot-at-wsj-reporter-2018-4" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">made a video game</a> where they shot at the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter who exposed the company&#39;s fraud. The firm also engaged Harvey Weinstein&#39;s attack-dog-attorney, David Boies, to try to shut down the story.</p><p> Swarming anyone who questions the narrative is a built-in feature of stocks and sectors that have gotten too far out over their skis. I often commit the crime against humanity of pushing back on Bernie Bros, VC-backed unicorns, Tesla longs, meme stocks, or web3. I do this knowing the flying monkeys and bots will attempt to burn the village to save it from my boomer views. These guys, and they&#39;re always guys, make the High Sparrow&#39;s Faith Militant look thoughtful.</p><p> Note: I&#39;m going to see if I can offend everyone with this post. #squadgoals.</p><h4> Pendulum</h4><p> The pendulum swings between stories and fundamentals. Right now, we&#39;re still deep in the story phase. Capital is cheap: $621 billion went to startups in 2021, a 111% jump from 2020. We&#39;re seeing record numbers of unicorns: 959 across the globe, up from 569 in 2020. The hottest sector is fintech, which accounts for 15% of these firms — all promising to become the next JPMorgan. Are they lying or telling the truth? A: Yes. <em>Vision.</em> </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215367" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/02.png" alt="" width="900" height="507" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/02.png 2048w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/02-300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/02-520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/02-768x433.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/02-1536x866.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/02-1200x676.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> There are few fundamental truisms in the markets.

It bears repeating. Holmes is going to prison because she defrauded <em>investors</em> — specifically, members of the Valley aristocracy and the global elite. Tim Draper led her seed round, and Rupert Murdoch invested $100 million. <em>That’s</em> what brings the feds to your door. Remember Martin Shkreli, the guy who raised the price of a life-saving treatment needed by AIDS patients 56x just because he could? He&#39;s in prison, but not for price gouging. He was convicted of defrauding … investors.</p><p> Our laws reflect our values. What we hold dear, who we deem precious (ie who needs protection).

Richard, a writer and a scholar whose work focuses on what I believe are pressing issues, has become my Yoda regarding the conversation concerning failing young men. We hosted Richard on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/failing-young-men-with-richard-reeves/id1498802610?i=1000584062413" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof G Pod</a> last fall, and it was our most-listened-to episode. He&#39;s a blue-flame thinker who combines data-driven insights with empathy and a perspective. You can hear from him regularly via his substack, <a href="https://ofboysandmen.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Of Boys and Men</a> . His 2022 book, <a href="https://a.co/d/hznt8K9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Of Boys and Men: Why the Modern Male Is Struggling, Why It Matters, and What to Do About It</a> , is a landmark book on the topic.</p><hr /><h4> Head of the Class</h4><p> <strong>by Richard Reeves</strong></p><p> My favorite high school teacher was Mr. Wyatt. He taught English, mostly poetry and Shakespeare. He was also a Korean War veteran, a part-time bus driver, and a curmudgeon. I loved him. And because of him, I also came to love reading and writing. It&#39;s no exaggeration to say that he changed my life.</p><p> Mr. Wyatt was living proof that masculinity and literacy could go together. To a 15-year-old boy, that really mattered. Seems I&#39;m not alone in this regard. In the UK, where I grew up, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/30/primaryschools.malerolemodels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 in 2 men</a> say a male teacher was an important role model. Ask the men in your lives about the educator who had the biggest impact on them; most will name a man.</p><p> But my own sons had fewer opportunities to connect with a male teacher, for the simple reason that there are many fewer of them around. In 1980 men accounted for 33% of K-12 teachers in the US Today it&#39;s down to 23%. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215357" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio.png" alt="" width="901" height="516" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-768x440.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-1200x688.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px" /></p><p> If the male share had remained at 1980 levels, we would have an extra 400,000 men teaching in our schools. (That&#39;s more than the total number of teachers in California.) The male share is set to drop even further unless something&#39;s done about it: In the 2019-20 school year, only <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ctes/tables/p131.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18% of education majors</a> in college were men.</p><p> Each year, the National Center on Education Statistics publishes a report blandly titled “ <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/clr/public-school-teachers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Characteristics of Public School Teachers</a> ” showing the steadily falling share of male teachers. Each year, it fails to get any serious attention from either the media or policymakers.</p><p> If the share of women was declining in a major profession, it would, quite rightly, generate headlines. There is lots of concern, for example, about the lack of women in the tech industry. Among the workers at the big five companies — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft — only 31% are women. That 31% may well be too low a share of women in Big Tech, but it&#39;s a lot higher than the 23% share of men in education. The lack of women in tech is often described as an existential crisis, while the lack of men in schools merits barely a mention.</p><p> Male teachers are especially scarce in the early years. Only 3% of pre-K and kindergarten teachers are men. In fact, as a share of their professions, there are twice as many women flying US military planes as there are men teaching kindergarten. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215356" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-03.png" alt="" width="900" height="516" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-03.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-03-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-03-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-03-768x440.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-03-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-03-1200x688.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> “It takes some degree either of social ignorance or of personal courage for a man to enter teaching at the elementary school level,” noted education professor <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/male-teachers-share-advice-for-getting-more-men-into-the-profession/2021/03" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Brown</a> . For a man to teach young children, he wrote, “is to spit in the face of a strong societal stereotype.” That was in 1960. Today I&#39;d wager the stigma is, if anything, even greater.</p><p> My own son, who teaches at the elementary level, has faced stigma and suspicion. A man who wants to work with children is seen as, well, weird. This is a vicious cycle. The more scarce men become in teaching, the weirder a decision to enter the profession will seem. My fear is that we are close to a tipping point, where, almost by definition, non-weird men will think twice about choosing teaching as a career option. (My son, for the record, is not weird.)</p><p> “If this trend continues, we may see a day when 8 of 10 teachers will be female,” wrote Richard Ingersoll and his colleagues in a <a href="https://repository.upenn.edu/items/f179131d-02df-47a7-b24d-0201ce0521e5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 report from the University of Pennsylvania</a> (one of the very few attempts to draw attention to this crisis). “Given the importance of teachers as role models, and even as surrogate parents for some students, certainly some will see this trend as a problem and a policy concern.”</p><p> I do think it is a problem and a policy concern. The emptying out of men from our schools is bad news for at least three reasons.</p><p> First, having a male teacher improves educational outcomes, especially in certain subjects like English (where boys are lagging furthest behind girls). One study suggests that If half the English teachers in middle schools were men the achievement gap in reading between girls and boys would <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/the-why-chromosome/#:~:text=For%20three%20subject%20areas%E2%80%94science,8%20percent%20of%20a%20standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fall by approximately a third</a> — a massive effect. (Important note: the performance of girls in English doesn&#39;t seem to be affected by teacher gender.)</p><p> But it turns out that English, where male teachers might have the biggest classroom impact, is the subject men are least likely to teach. Men account for <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ntps/tables/ntps1718_21011202_t1n.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 1 in 10 middle school English teachers</a> .</p><p> Second, male teachers are much more likely to take on after-school activities, especially coaching sports teams. A recent <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/gender-wage-gaps-policy-brief/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brookings study</a> finds a gender pay gap among K-12 teachers of about $2,200 a year in favor of men. The difference in base pay is just $700 a year. Most of the gap, about $1,200 a year, is explained by the extra pay men get from doing extracurricular work.</p><p> The researchers write about this as a problem to be solved. Which it is, if the only thing we&#39;re worried about is the gender pay gap. But if male teachers are working extra hours to coach their students on the soccer field or debate stage, and getting paid for it, I&#39;m more inclined to clap than wring my hands.</p><p> The role of coaches in the lives of many students is close to a sacred one in our culture. This is especially true for boys without dads. And there are more of those all the time. Since 1980, the share of children being raised by a single mom has risen from 18% to 24%.</p><p> So: More homes without dads and more classrooms without misters. That&#39;s a bad combination.</p><p> Third, the men in our schools are mentors to both male and female students. A <a href="https://t.co/0zyZ7127wa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent study</a> published by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that having an informal mentor in high school improved educational performance across a range of measures; most impressive was a 9% increase in college attendance.</p><p> But one finding in the paper did not get much attention. Men make up 59% of high school mentors, even though they account for only 40% of high school teachers. So male teachers are stepping up in a big way to mentor both boys and girls.</p><p> The term “teacher” doesn&#39;t get close to describing the impact of the men and the women working in our school system. But it does a particular disservice to male teachers, who are even more likely than their female colleagues to provide coaching and mentoring to their students.</p><p> In short: Male teachers rock. So, how do we get more of them? Here are five suggestions:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 1. <strong>Increase wages.</strong> K-12 teacher pay has been <a href="https://www.nea.org/resource-library/educator-pay-and-student-spending-how-does-your-state-rank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">essentially flat</a> , in real terms, for at least a decade. According to the National Education Association, in 2019 almost <a href="https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/average-teacher-salary-down-45-over-past-decade#:~:text=Most%20Starting%20Salaries%20Are%20Still%20Below%20$40%2C000&amp;text=The%202019%20report%20shows%20that,by%202.91%20percent%20since%20then." target="_blank" rel="noopener">two-thirds</a> of school districts offered a starting salary below $40,000 a year. The low salaries are especially offputting to men. (Caveat: The teachers who should get the most money are the good ones and/or those working with the poorest students.) </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215355" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/line-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="516" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/line-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/line-chart-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/line-chart-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/line-chart-768x440.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/line-chart-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/line-chart-1200x688.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 2. <strong>Double extra-duty pay</strong> . Teachers who stay late to run clubs or coach sports should not just be rewarded, they should be doubly rewarded. Extracurricular activities provide students with precious opportunities, especially for kids from poorer backgrounds, and there&#39;s a <a href="https://projectplay.org/state-of-play-2022/physical-mental-health-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing class gap</a> in access to after-school sports.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 3. <strong>Scholarships.</strong> Generous college scholarships ought to be available to men who want to pursue education as a career, especially in crucial subjects like English. This is not a radical idea: After all, there are thousands of <a href="https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/scholarships-for-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">college scholarships for women</a> seeking to enter traditionally male fields, including STEM.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 4. <strong>Celebrate misters.</strong> School districts, counties and states should support and fund the creation of male teacher learning networks, award “Male Mentor of the Year” prizes, and plaster the faces of successful male teachers across billboards. Remember the line that feminists taught us: You can&#39;t be it if you can&#39;t see it.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 5. <strong>Set a 1 in 3 target.</strong> Last but not least, let&#39;s set some concrete goals. How about we aim for the same share of male teachers as when Ronald Reagan was first elected? That means at least 1 in 3 teachers should be male. School districts, states, teacher training colleges, and the Department of Education should set this 1 in 3 share as an explicit goal and publish annual progress reports. The Biden Administration has a <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2022/10/secretary-raimondo-calls-more-women-construction-industry-nabtu-tradeswomen-build" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Million Women Into Construction Initiative</a> . California awards <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/DAS/e-News/2022/25-million.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$25 million a year</a> in grants toward the same end.伟大的！ Where are the equivalent initiatives and investments to get Men Into Education?</p><p> Unless we act quickly, there will be fewer and fewer men in our classrooms every passing year. If policymakers don&#39;t think that&#39;s a problem, they should explain why not. If they think it is a problem, they should do something about it.</p><p> Richard Reeves</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.profgalloway.com/head-of-the-class/">Head of the Class</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.profgalloway.com">No Mercy / No Malice</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.profgalloway.com/head-of-the-class/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 75</slash:comments></item><item><title> Grief and Happiness</title><link/> https://www.profgalloway.com/grief-and-happiness/<comments> https://www.profgalloway.com/grief-and-happiness/#comments</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Galloway]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Fri, 11 Aug 2023 14:59:40 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.profgalloway.com/?p=215351 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> This week on No Mercy No Malice, we&#39;re featuring a guest post from Mo Gawdat, an Egyptian entrepreneur, former senior executive at Google, and bestselling author on human happiness.

We had Mo on the Prof G Pod a few weeks ago, and his message deeply resonated with our team and listeners. Mo&#39;s passion for humanity, intellectual rigor, and strength of mind is inspiring. We asked him to share the origin story of his work on happiness with our No Mercy No Malice readers, and he agreed. His thoughts are below.</p><p></p><hr /><p></p><h4> Grief and Happiness</h4><p> <strong>by Mo Gawdat</strong></p><p> I spent over half my life working in technology, a career that culminated in a leadership role at Google, where I was chief business officer at Google X, the company&#39;s “moonshot factory.” It was in every sense a dream job, working with the world&#39;s smartest people on our most interesting problems. In 2014, however, my life changed irrevocably. The change originated in a profound tragedy. But then that tragedy led me to a new mission: to better understand happiness and communicate that understanding to the world. You can read more about that project on my website, <a href="https://www.mogawdat.com/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">mogawdat.com</a> . This is the story of how I got there.</p><p> For a long time, I sought out concrete accomplishments and rewards, and that drive helped me become successful as a technologist and business executive. I made a lot of money at a young age by understanding mathematics, programming, and online securities trading, and my career accelerated from there. But the more money I made, the more miserable I became. I was a rich, grumpy brat.</p><p> Eventually, I came to see this myself, through the eyes of my children. When my daughter was just 5 years old, full of joy and optimism, I snapped at her for interrupting something I was doing on my laptop, causing her to cry. I realized then: I didn&#39;t like the person I was. I started to research happiness — but knowledge is not always enough.</p><p> My son Ali, from the day of his birth, embodied the secret to happiness. He was like a little Buddha, an inscrutable monk with that peace of the truly happy about him. In 2014 I lived in Dubai, and my son lived in Boston, where he played in a band. He called me one day, out of the blue, and asked if he could come visit. He said, “I feel obligated to come and spend time with you.” An odd choice of words, right? Before his visit, however, he had to have surgery. It was one of the most common procedures you can imagine: removing his appendix. But the surgeon inexplicably made a cascading series of mistakes, five in a row. All preventable, and any one or two of them fixable. But five in a row was too much. Hours later, my son had left the world.</p><p> Not long before he died, Ali told his sister about a dream he&#39;d had, and she shared it with me. A dream that he was everywhere and part of everyone. I know now that in many spiritual traditions that is the definition of death. At the time, however, I saw it as a calling — and I still do — a challenge from my son to me. I was a senior executive at one of the world&#39;s largest and most connected companies; I knew exactly, literally, how to reach billions of people. “Consider it done,” I told my daughter when she described Ali&#39;s dream. I decided then to write a book about happiness, about everything Ali had taught me about it, to convey his essence through the written word to those billions of people. If I could do that, then Ali would be everywhere, be part of everyone, just as he had dreamed.</p><p> To jump ahead in my story: Somehow the universe made it work. Within six weeks of the book&#39;s launch, we were a bestseller in eight countries. My videos were viewed 180 million times. I formalized my life&#39;s goal: to make a billion people happy. Everything I do professionally — these days, I focus on AI — is in service of bringing happiness to a billion people.</p><p> Yet all that happiness was borne of the most terrible grief imaginable, a parent&#39;s loss of a child. Before I could truly understand happiness, I had to pass through grief.</p><p> There is a finality to death that contradicts everything we&#39;ve ever been told, undermines everything we&#39;ve relied upon. It triggers our fear, it triggers our helplessness, it triggers our insecurity. Suddenly, we can no longer trust life. We miss the person we love who left us. We are scared for them and where they are, and scared for ourselves without them. We have lots of uncertainties. It&#39;s an overwhelming trauma.</p><p> The first step through it is to grieve, fully grieve. If you are angry, be angry. If you are unsure, be unsure. If you want to take a break, take a break. This first step is largely out of our control. But then there are two steps that follow, one logical, one spiritual.</p><p> The logical step may sound harsh. But they say the truth will set you free. And this is the truth: There&#39;s absolutely nothing, nothing you can ever do to bring them back. I have a very mathematical, logical mind, so, believe it or not, I went out and did the research. Has anyone ever come back? I knew people do come back from near-death — I had to know, what&#39;s the limit to that? I was in the moonshot business, remember.</p><p> But, of course, Ali was truly gone. There was no technology or technique that could change that. I could hit my head against the laboratory wall for 27 years, but he&#39;s not coming back. And while I was torturing myself, the world wasn&#39;t getting better. So I had to get to a place of acceptance. I call this <strong>committed acceptance.</strong></p><p> “Acceptance” means understanding that this is your new baseline. I will never receive another hug from my son. I will not hear his voice on the phone or see him play music ever again. That&#39;s my new baseline. I will stop pretending otherwise. “Committed” means I can still improve my own life and the lives of those around me. You don&#39;t have to know how you&#39;ll do it. You tell yourself, “Now that I&#39;ve accepted this tragedy, I&#39;ve accepted this pain, I&#39;m going to crawl out of it.” The word is “crawl” because that&#39;s how it feels. Today I&#39;ll do one thing that makes my life better than yesterday, and tomorrow I&#39;ll do one thing that makes my life better than today.就是这样。</p><p> That&#39;s the practical step, committed acceptance. It&#39;s about the physical world, the reality we experience with our senses. The world which Ali has left, and the world I can make better, a little bit every day. But spirituality and science both tell us that this is not the only world, not the only way to understand existence. I call this other step the spiritual step, but you could also call it the quantum step. Quantum mechanics is physics at the atomic scale, the laws that govern the building blocks of what we know as space and time. And it teaches us that there is more to the universe than meets the eye. Which is something spiritual teachers have been telling us for centuries.</p><p> There is a nonphysical aspect to life. Call it consciousness, call it the spirit or soul: There is something beyond the physical about us. That nonphysical element is the part that disconnected from my son&#39;s body when he left. The handsome form he left behind on that intensive-care table was no longer him. You could feel it, you could feel that his essence was no longer there. That essence is life, and it is outside the realm of traditional physics, outside space and time. It has to be, or we wouldn&#39;t be able to perceive space or the passage of time. There&#39;s a subject-object relationship there, between consciousness (or the soul, or the life force, or the spirit) and the physical world.</p><p> That aspect of life, I will call it consciousness, is distinct from the physical form in which it resides. It neither comes into existence when that physical form is created nor goes out of existence when the form decays. Death is not the opposite of life. Death is the opposite of birth. Life exists before, during, and after. My son&#39;s physical form was born, and my son&#39;s physical form decayed. But the essence of my son, his consciousness, has never gone anywhere. His body will never again live — that&#39;s committed acceptance — but his consciousness never died.</p><p> I see this from a physics point of view more than a religious point of view, but either way, I tend to believe my son is OK. And I know that I, too, will leave this physical form and that I, too, will be OK. I don&#39;t know how, exactly, because I&#39;m still here, in the physical world. But whatever happens to our consciousness when the physical form decays, I don&#39;t believe it goes to a bad place. In fact, it&#39;s not even a place, it&#39;s not even a time. It&#39;s an eternity of consciousness. And that&#39;s the truth of who we are. My son taught this to me, in his dream. We are everywhere, part of everyone.</p><p></p><p> Mo Gawdat</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.profgalloway.com/grief-and-happiness/">Grief and Happiness</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.profgalloway.com">No Mercy / No Malice</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.profgalloway.com/grief-and-happiness/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 78</slash:comments></item><item><title> Trump and Math</title><link/> https://www.profgalloway.com/trump-and-math/<comments> https://www.profgalloway.com/trump-and-math/#comments</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Galloway]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 16:17:45 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.profgalloway.com/?p=215339 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> I don&#39;t know, nobody does.

However, I believe it is increasingly likely Donald Trump withdraws from the race for president as the result of a plea deal.为什么？ A: math.</p><p> Facing prosecutions in at least three jurisdictions, it&#39;s likely, if he is not reelected, Trump will be tried, convicted, and sent to prison. I don&#39;t believe this will happen, as a plea deal serves everyone&#39;s interests. Trump and the prosecutors, I speculate, will settle for a lifetime ban on serving in public office in exchange for the resolution of criminal proceedings against him. As the political map comes into focus, a plea deal will emerge as the best outcome for Trump. And as the knock-on effects of imprisoning a former president become a reality, a deal will also become the best (or least bad) outcome for the nation.</p><h4> Trump&#39;s Math</h4><p> President Trump is an obese 77-year-old male. Any sentence to a prison facility is likely a death sentence. Attorneys general wield the power of possible incarceration. Even more compelling? The prospect of survival — avoiding death behind bars. Incarceration, balanced against a life (post-deal) of golf clubs, sycophants, and porn stars weighs heavily on even the most delusional psyche.</p><p> How serious is the threat of prison? As I write this, President Trump has been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/02/trump-prison-sentence-risk-00109544" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">indicted</a> three times: in New York for tax and reporting violations related to hush money payments; in federal court in Miami for mishandling national security documents and obstructing the investigation into his conduct; and in federal court in DC for attempting to subvert the 2020 election. Later this month a fourth is expected, in Georgia, on charges of election tampering. But what is the risk he actually goes to jail? What sounds improbable looks more probable when we do the math.</p><p> Federal prosecutors rarely lose: In 2021, <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh236/files/media/document/fjs21.pdf" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">94%</a> of defendants charged with a federal felony were convicted. State and local prosecutors convict at high rates as well — the Atlanta office expected to indict Trump boasts a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/us/politics/fani-willis-trump-investigation.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">90% conviction rate</a> . Of those convicted by the feds, 74% received prison time. In cases for mishandling national security documents specifically, the DOJ regularly obtains <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-justice-department-routinely-prosecute-misuse-of-classified-documents/6694887.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">multiyear prison sentences</a> . And the documents case against the former president is notable for the weight of the evidence, including <a href="https://youtu.be/inVJF0Dr8mo" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">audio</a> of him sharing military secrets he admits he hadn&#39;t declassified, the sensitivity of the papers, and his blatant obstruction — offenses the DOJ and courts take very seriously. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215341" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dounut-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dounut-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dounut-chart-300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dounut-chart-520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dounut-chart-768x432.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dounut-chart-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dounut-chart-1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> It&#39;s not any one case that cements Trump&#39;s fate, but the compounding risk of several (indictments). Generally, defendants have a 3 in 10 chance of escaping an indictment without prison. A 30% chance of prevailing, four times in a row, is just under 1%.</p><h4> This Is Different</h4><p> OK, but Trump is not a typical defendant, and no case against him will be straightforward. He has unlimited resources and can deploy the full apparatus of a billionaire&#39;s legal defense. In addition, there is a non-zero probability any jury will have a Trumper who refuses to convict. Also, prosecuting each case presents obstacles.</p><p> The New York case is generally regarded as weak, and while the Manhattan DA&#39;s office is well resourced, it&#39;s not the DOJ. As heavy as the federal documents case looks on paper, trying it will be a challenge — just working out the logistics of handling sensitive government secrets in the context of a public trial could take months of litigation and appeals. The election interference charges are complex and based on novel or rarely tested legal theories — there just isn&#39;t a lot of precedent for the events of January 6. But the numbers remain stacked against Trump.</p><p> Still, let&#39;s improve his odds of exoneration from 3 in 10 to 8 in 10 — only a 20% chance in each case that he&#39;s convicted and sent to prison. The math is still ugly: 0.8 <b data-stringify-type="bold">⁴</b> = 0.41 which means Trump has only a 41% chance of escaping prison, even when given remarkably favorable, exceptional, odds. The most favorable math still lands him in prison.</p><h4> Get Out of Jail Card(s)</h4><p> There are two: 1) He retakes the White House, or 2) he (see above) reaches a plea deal.</p><p> The prison vaccine is Trump winning the presidency, or another GOP candidate winning and pardoning him. That resolves the federal charges — the greatest threats — and Trump likely believes he or some other Republican president could likely shut down the remaining prosecutions.</p><p> However, Trump&#39;s political power is about to crash onto the rocks of electoral math. Barring a dramatic change in the GOP primary, which could happen, the likely outcome is the former president wins the nomination, then loses decisively to Biden in the general. Current signals suggest the Republican nominee will be Trump. The strongest would-be contender, Ron DeSantis, went from anti-woke warrior to brightening every room he leaves. He&#39;s an awful candidate. In six months, DeSantis has plummeted from <a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/2024-gop-primary-election-tracker" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">34% to 15%</a> in Republican primary polling, ceding his ground to the former president. Our very stable genius is now polling at 58%. In the past half-century, no candidate leading by 20 points <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/upshot/poll-trump-republican-primary.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">at this stage</a> has lost the nomination. Trump is up by 43. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215342" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Rep-line-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="516" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Rep-line-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Rep-line-chart-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Rep-line-chart-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Rep-line-chart-768x440.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Rep-line-chart-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Rep-line-chart-1200x688.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> But Trump&#39;s favorable math across the primary is equally ugly in the general election. The media highlights national polls, favorable/unfavorable ratings, and other clickbait. But that&#39;s not how we elect presidents. As we&#39;re reminded every four years, we elect presidents by state.</p><p> Ninety percent of the states are foregone conclusions (Biden holds a <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2024/president/ca/california_trump_vs_biden-8131.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">30-point lead</a> in California; Trump, a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/south-dakota/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">21-point lead</a> in South Dakota). Pundits agree that only a handful of states will matter in 2024: UVA <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/electoral-college-ratings-expect-another-highly-competitive-election/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">names</a> Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and Wisconsin. <em>Roll Call</em> <a href="https://rollcall.com/2023/04/26/2024-presidential-outlook-meet-the-new-race-same-as-the-old-race/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">swaps</a> Pennsylvania for Nevada. <em>The Hill</em> drops Nevada but <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/3870203-these-6-states-will-determine-the-2024-presidential-election/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">adds</a> Michigan and a wild card, North Carolina. And the Biden campaign itself appears to be <a href="https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1650993992752922626?s=20" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">focused</a> on all of the above, minus North Carolina. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215347" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Artboard-1-copy-5.png" alt="" width="900" height="562" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Artboard-1-copy-5.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Artboard-1-copy-5-300x187.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Artboard-1-copy-5-520x325.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Artboard-1-copy-5-768x480.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Artboard-1-copy-5-1536x959.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Artboard-1-copy-5-1200x749.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> Demographics Are Destiny</h4><p> Biden only needs to win three of these states to reclaim the White House: Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. And his odds look good, great even. He won all three in 2020, and since then things are trending even bluer. In Pennsylvania, the Democrats flipped a Senate seat in 2022, and in Michigan, they took full control of the state government. In Wisconsin, the GOP had a slight edge in the midterms, but Biden leads in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/wisconsin/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">every</a> <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2024/president/wi/wisconsin_trump_vs_biden-7398.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">poll</a> taken in the state this year. He also has the edge in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/michigan/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Michigan</a> and <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/pennsylvania/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Pennsylvania</a> .</p><p> Trump&#39;s prospects are tenuous in the other four. Biden carried Georgia in 2020 (as well as Arizona and Nevada), and in 2021 the Democrats flipped a Georgia Senate seat, then defended it 2022 (though they lost a House seat). North Carolina reflects how change is not good for Trump. He won the state in 2020 by a 1.3% margin. However, it&#39;s a state in transition, a microcosm of the broader challenge faced by the GOP: The party&#39;s base is older and whiter, and that population is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/16/politics/demographic-changes-voters-fault-lines/index.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">giving way</a> to a younger, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/05/14/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far-2/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">more diverse, better-educated</a> electorate — <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/07/12/demographic-profiles-of-republican-and-democratic-voters/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">more likely</a> to vote blue. In North Carolina, those effects are magnified by economic growth from new <a class="c-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-30/north-carolina-moves-from-republican-to-swing-state-over-abortion-inflation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-30/north-carolina-moves-from-republican-to-swing-state-over-abortion-inflation" data-sk="tooltip_parent">tech and finance jobs</a> . Toyota, Apple, and other new employers are bringing in a younger, more educated workforce. In 2022, Democrats gained two House seats in North Carolina; the state&#39;s delegation is now even at seven and seven. Similar trends are present in Arizona and Nevada, both states Biden won in 2020. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215344" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NC-line-chart_1.png" alt="" width="900" height="516" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NC-line-chart_1.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NC-line-chart_1-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NC-line-chart_1-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NC-line-chart_1-768x440.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NC-line-chart_1-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NC-line-chart_1-1200x688.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> Nationwide, since Trump won the White House in 2016, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/07/19/gen-z-voters-2024/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">32 million</a> young people have become eligible to vote, and 20 million elderly voters have died. That&#39;s a 52 million voter swing from old to young. These younger citizens <a href="https://theconversation.com/us-midterms-why-gen-z-and-millennials-came-out-to-vote-and-why-it-marks-a-generational-shift-194947" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">vote in greater numbers</a> than previous younger generations, and they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/opinion/voting-trends-democrats.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">show no signs</a> of becoming more conservative as they age.</p><h4> Bidenomics</h4><p> We&#39;re still a long way from November 2024, and a lot could happen — war is still raging in Europe, and Biden is 81. However, the most important factor in almost every presidential election, by far, is the economy. On that front, everything&#39;s coming up Biden. GDP growth <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-27/us-gdp-growth-accelerates-to-2-4-as-consumers-show-resilience" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">accelerated</a> from 2% to 2.4% last quarter. Unemployment remains low (3.6%), and job growth continues to exceed expectations, with <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/08/economy/june-jobs-report-final/index.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">372,000</a> new jobs created in June. Inflation fell to 3% in June, its lowest rate in two years. Contrast that with other nations, including France (4.5%), Germany (6.4%), and the UK (7.9%). More importantly for voter economics, US wage growth is now <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/americans-are-finally-getting-raise-thanks-lower-inflation-rcna93844" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">outpacing</a> inflation. Perceptions haven&#39;t caught up with reality, but they will. If voters continue to vote on the economy, Trump loses badly. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215345" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bar-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bar-chart.png 960w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bar-chart-300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bar-chart-520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bar-chart-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> Devaluation</h4><p> The closer we get to a Trump loss in 2024, the more his currency for a plea deal diminishes. A loss would cement the notion that he has cost the party too much for too long. Traditional Republican leaders can&#39;t wait to see the last of Trump, and his acolytes now have power bases of their own. Fox will abandon him, the cloud cover provided by Lindsay Graham, Kevin McCarthy, and other sycophants will disappear, and the pool of jurors who&#39;d refuse to convict will shrink. He&#39;ll also lose access to any backroom influence his political allies might bring to bear on the DOJ or state and local prosecutorial offices. His currency is a single token, his potential return to the Oval Office. And once that&#39;s gone, so is his leverage.</p><p> Trump won&#39;t like the deal, but the decision will be easier to make than many people think. He has no observable ideological commitment or loyalty to the Republican Party compelling him to run again. In the 2022 midterms, Trump amassed a war chest of $108 million and gave <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-21/trump-s-not-giving-his-mountains-of-cash-to-other-republicans" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">none</a> to GOP candidates.</p><p> And he gives up all the time. His track record is quitting: from his six bankruptcies, including the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-trump-bankrupted-the-taj-mahal-2017-5" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Trump Taj Mahal Casino</a> , to his innumerable abandoned projects, such as his defunct <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/02/donald-trump-helped-kill-the-first-usfl-now-a-new-version-has-risen-in-its-place" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">New Jersey Generals</a> football team and the disgraced education for-profit <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/trump-university-scam/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Trump University</a> . And people who know him, including his former chief of staff, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12196697/Hes-scared-s-Trumps-former-chief-staff-says-ex-president-terrified-going-jail.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">John Kelly</a> , and his former footstool, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/why-trump-might-take-plea-deal-chris-christie-1812241" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Chris Christie</a> , say he has a real fear of going to jail.</p><p> In sum, Trump&#39;s odds of landing in prison are perhaps 50/50 right now and likely to get worse as we approach the election.</p><h4> Deal or No Deal?</h4><p> Is there a deal to be had? It won&#39;t be easy, but the array of prosecutors could work together to strike an agreement, for their own sake and the good of the nation. A coordinated negotiation between the DOJ, Georgia, and the Manhattan DA would be complex, but nothing precludes the effort. The alternative is worse: Trials would be a circus, convictions would be subject to years of appeals, and any ultimate incarceration would be a logistical nightmare. And when we step back from the details of these cases, what should the nation be seeking? Is it accountability? Or for the nation to move on? The answer is yes, and a plea deal achieves this.</p><p> There&#39;s a broader lesson here. Our successes and failures are not a function of probability, but patterns. Our actions, like interest, compound. A kind act may go unnoticed, but kindness fosters enduring relationships and goodwill. Criminal acts may or may not result in punishment. But criminality screams for justice&#39;s attention. And justice, while slow to act, is always listening.</p><p> Life is so rich, </p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/nmnm_images/Scott-Signature-NMNM.png" /></p><p> PS This week on the <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/ProfGPod?sid=newsletter" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Prof G Pod</a> , I spoke with Rutger Bregman, a Dutch historian and author.

As I&#39;ve <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/struck/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">written</a> before, their leaders have picked the wrong moment to cast themselves in a working-class drama. In sum, they have little leverage, as there are too many of them and the strike is a gift for studios looking to slow the arms race of the streaming wars and recalibrate costs for a leaner business cycle. Yet while the writers and actors are naive, the studios may, in the end, prove to be bigger fools. Their mistake is a familiar one, personally and professionally: the failure to discern among allies, competitors, and enemies.</p><h4> Real Enemy</h4><p> The studios&#39; real enemy isn&#39;t a pair of naive, shortsighted unions, or one another, or streaming. Their antagonist isn&#39;t even TikTok, though the short-video company will be happy to absorb the additional viewing hours once people have to adjust their habits. (Pro tip: Late-night TV will soon be a shadow of itself as consumers find substitutes.) The enemy is the same enemy the rest of media, and retail face, Big Tech. Specifically, in this case, Big Tech AI offerings that will digest content (at zero cost if they have their way) and wedge themselves between the consumer and repurposed content.</p><p> The writers and actors should get credit for identifying the threat AI presents. However, their demand for an extended pause in adopting the technology has been achieved a total of zero times by labor. Case in point: The teamsters and UPS came to an agreement before a walkout, because 1) they had leverage; UPS would have begun hemorrhaging cash vs. stockpiling it (as Netflix has done) in a strike; and 2) their demands were reasonable, raising hourly wages by $2.75 and installing AC in trucks. If the Teamsters&#39; requests mirrored the WGA&#39;s, the demands would have been a pause on autonomous driving research and a mandate that all trucks have three drivers in them. Also, and this is a key point, the delivery business needs more drivers, and Hollywood needs fewer writers/actors/execs.</p><p> The focus of the WGA, SAG-Aftra, and the studios should be capturing compensation for the coal powering these AI plants and demanding IP protection for their digital twin(s). (More on this later.) Their thinking is too small. The real threat is not studios <em>using</em> AI, but studios being <em>replaced</em> by AI. If you think the studios are mendacious, let me introduce you to ground zero for … mendacious fucks … Big Tech.</p><p> To appreciate how precarious the studios&#39; position is, consider what they actually do. It&#39;s <em>not</em> making movies and TV shows. Writers, actors, directors, and an army of skilled laborers do that. Promotion and distribution are still studio functions, but they rely heavily on the internet and third-party cloud providers. No, the primary function of the studio in today&#39;s ecosystem is to allocate capital to projects that offer the greatest ROI. This means having a stomach for losing capital. A lot of capital, in the hope that one hit will pay for all the misses. It&#39;s venture capital with better-looking people and worse traffic.</p><p> Filmed entertainment is ruinously expensive. It takes a special kind of edible to pile Benjamins and light them on fire greenlighting Pete Davidson in <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/marmaduke_2022" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener"><em>Marmaduke</em></a> ($50 million budget, $800,000 in box office, 0% on the Tomatometer). One signal capital allocation is the primary function for Hollywood studios is how easily Big Tech muscled its way in. Nobody brings a taller pile of Benjamins, or a stronger stomach to risk it, than Big Tech. Apple, Netflix, and Amazon now dominate Hollywood. And what did they bring? Cheaper capital.</p><p> A decent, if crude, algorithm for economic security is to find the biggest pile of money and stand as close to it as possible. The writers/actors and studios need to stand closer to the Big Tech pile. The numbers here are unfathomable. But … let&#39;s fathom. If you stacked the cash on hand of AAPL/NFLX/META/GOOG/MSFT in $100 bills, it would reach 262 miles into orbit. Low Earth orbit satellites would collide with the stack, as would the International Space Station. Meanwhile, Paramount&#39;s stack ($2 billion or about 7,500 feet) wouldn&#39;t crest LA&#39;s San Gabriel mountains.</p><p> As long as creating this content costs megayacht money, the competitive set for the studios will be relatively limited. The reason the writers and directors are standing in front of Loews instead of making <em>Marmaduke</em> 2 is they need the studios, which is to say they need access to the things only the studios can/will pay for: soundstages, cameras, special effects, and one another. The emerald sanctum level 9,000-light tier isn&#39;t going to unlock itself — <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/tom-cruise-scientology-mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-movie-savior-1234789015/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Tom Cruise</a> doesn&#39;t work for free.</p><p> But … ChatGPT will.</p><h4> The Universal Substance</h4><p> The secret to the greatest creation of shareholder value is simple: Tech inserts itself between consumers and content.</p><p> This often means creating a layer of innovation on top of other people&#39;s content. In the 1980s and &#39;90s, aggregating millions of individually meaningless credit card transactions gave direct marketers visibility into consumer spending patterns, letting them target consumers with unprecedented precision. In the 2000s, tech repeated the trick with voting data. Google, Yelp, and Travelocity all do something similar. They alloy disparate and independently valueless pieces of data into something worth more.</p><p> I&#39;ve been on both sides. Earlier in the Internet era, when Google&#39;s mission statement was “Don&#39;t be evil” and people believed this bullshit, I sat on the board of the New York Times Co. I made a scene at my second board meeting, urging the company to shut off access to Google, band together with other publishers, and protect the one thing we had: differentiated content. Nobody listened, I was politely ushered (ie, kicked) off the board, and Google (followed by Facebook) proceeded to eat the publishing industry like a snake swallowing a mouse … after suffocating it slowly. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215336" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/donut.png" alt="" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/donut.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/donut-300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/donut-520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/donut-768x432.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/donut-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/donut-1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> The newspaper industry is a shadow of itself and dependent on the kindness of strangers who are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/22/business/media/jeff-bezos-washington-post.html?smid=url-share" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">billionaires</a> . The result: The number of journalists has been cut in half, and the number of PR comms professionals working at Big Tech has increased sixfold. The ratio of bullshit/spin to journalism has gone the wrong way by 12x.</p><p> Tech has reconfigured the barriers for retail stock market investors, purchasers of used goods, and amateur filmmakers and musicians. Tech is both a universal solvent — it dissolves barriers — and a universal alloy, solidifying new, more powerful ones. It&#39;s a universal substance, practicing a metallurgy bordering on alchemy. I&#39;m not entirely sure what the point of this paragraph is, but it felt poetic. Edibles.</p><h4> First They Came for the Writers</h4><p> Just as the writers&#39; union has miscast itself as the Knights of Labor, studio heads are deluding themselves believing they are the Rockefellers and Morgans of the era, astride global empires that will benefit by replacing people with machines. The truth is, both are Native American tribes, feuding and weakening one another as European settlers lay in wait for their ultimate slaughter. And the studios have paved the way by converting their business into something that runs on the regurgitation of pre-existing IP, which is AI&#39;s best trick. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215337" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/movie-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="562" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/movie-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/movie-chart-300x187.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/movie-chart-520x325.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/movie-chart-768x480.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/movie-chart-1536x959.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/movie-chart-1200x749.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> Netflix is an outlier. Thanks to its access to foreign and nonunion content, its deep library of existing content, and disinterest in late-night content, the company is hoarding so much cash it&#39;s considering stock buybacks. Disney and Paramount, dependent on ad-supported and linear content, are deluding themselves if they believe they have shared interests with Netflix. Note: Netflix isn&#39;t just a studio, but a tech firm.</p><h4> What Can Be Done?</h4><p> You can&#39;t stop the universal substance, but you can direct it and insert yourself in between Big Tech and how it makes money. If the feuding Hollywood tribes want to participate in the next generation of the entertainment business they need to stand on the things they share, the stuff they can realistically defend. The characters, stories, icons — the <em>brands</em> they have built up in our collective consciousness. I&#39;m not a fan of doing business through lawyers — it&#39;s generally a value and innovation destroyer to rely on the legal process — but see above … slaughter.</p><p> The studios, in cooperation with the writers and actors they depend on, ironically, to make their business cost prohibitive, should hire competent, aggressive law firms and send <em>very</em> serious letters to every tech company with a large language model (LLM). Then sue them. Meanwhile, hire a slightly less aggressive law firm to start forging joint rights agreements (studios and actors/writers) that lock down the IP of digital twins (actors and their characters). License to LLMs limited rights to crawl their content and provide studios/labor persistent rights to any revenue the LLMs produce. Finally, hire likable lobbyists to push Congress for accommodations in the law that better protect IP and limit the freedom of maneuver for AI companies.</p><p> One area of opportunity is the Section 230 liability shield that protects social media platforms and other online publishers from liability stemming from the user-generated content they distribute. In my view, we should remove Section 230 protection for AI-generated content.</p><p> To date, the strike reflects that neither the studios nor the unions understand the technology. They are laggards: Barry Diller is <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/07/23/2023/publishers-want-billions-not-millions-from-ai" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">rallying</a> publishers (including the NYT) around a lawsuit, book authors and programmer have filed <a href="https://llmlitigation.com/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">class actions</a> over the scraping of their content, Getty Images is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/17/23558516/ai-art-copyright-stable-diffusion-getty-images-lawsuit" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">suing</a> the makers of AI image generator Stable Diffusion, and Shutterstock <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/25/after-inking-its-openai-deal-shutterstock-rolls-out-a-generative-ai-toolkit-to-create-images-based-on-text-prompts/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">cut a deal</a> with OpenAI. The unions&#39; demonization of studio heads makes for good TikToks, but it misses the larger point.</p><h4> Sabotage</h4><p> The unions are obsessed with how much money the studio heads make. Yes, Bob Iger will make $27 million this year, vacations on yachts, and wears a lot of cashmere. But Tom Cruise made $100 million from <em>Maverick</em> , and he&#39;s a Scientologist. There are too many actors, writers, and studio execs for an industry that cannot sustain current spend and has attracted the great white shark of business, Big Tech. Bob and Tom are allies, not enemies. The real nemeses are in San Jose and Redmond.</p><p> Too often, we sabotage our own happiness letting familiarity and dysfunction turn allies into perceived enemies. We inflate our contributions to a relationship, while diminishing the other party&#39;s. We let familiarity and contempt best our shared history. Your spouse, your parents, Republicans and Democrats, other Americans, other democracies, writers and studios. All allies. We&#39;re in this together.</p><p> Life is so rich, </p><p></p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/nmnm_images/Scott-Signature-NMNM.png" /></p><p> PS In this week&#39;s Office Hours edition of the <a href="https://pod.link/profg?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIoOWfztixgAMViLjICh0g_ARqEAAYASAAEgJH2_D_BwE" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">ProfG Pod</a> I answer questions on Apple&#39;s investments in health care, private schools, and teaching your kids about social media. <a href="https://pod.link/profg/episode/2b052bbd83144208ba74ac995b04620a" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Listen here</a> .</p><p> PPS Missed my talk on AI with Gary Marcus this week? <a href="https://www.sectionschool.com/events/companies/watch-recording-the-opportunities-and-threats-of-ai?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=nmnm&amp;utm_campaign=opportunitiesthreatsAI&amp;utm_content=0728" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Watch the recording here</a> .
