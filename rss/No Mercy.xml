2008年之后，私人资本海啸冲击着数字创新，塑造了一个新的经济实体：独角兽。在估值超过 10 亿美元的私营公司中，标志着这一时代的两家公司是 Uber 和 WeWork。 Uber 是第二家私募市场估值突破 500 亿美元的科技公司（Facebook 是第一家），WeWork 的估值达到峰值 470 亿美元。自从离开谷仓后，他们的道路就出现了分歧：Uber 是公开交易的，盈利的，估值超过 1000 亿美元； WeWork 在烧毁 220 亿美元后于本周申请破产——主要投资者软银独自损失了 140 亿美元，这可能是历史上最大的风险投资损失。 </p><p><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/line-chart.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1100" /></p><p>这两家公司总共筹集了 440 亿美元的私人资本，远远超过了亚马逊、苹果、Facebook、谷歌和微软的诞生所提供的资本总额。 Uber 如何将其庞大的资本储备转变为盈利企业，而 WeWork 却烧毁了其现金？我认为有两个基本因素导致了这些不同的结果：对创新者的崇拜和轻资产模式的力量。</p><h4>困境的创新者</h4><p>创办一家企业要取得任何程度的成功，都需要雄心、才华、对“这个”有意义的非理性信念，最重要的是吸引一群同意参与你的幻觉的投资者的能力。最好的创始人是狂热者。</p><p>狂热者是高才华、高能量的人，但他们也往往是自恋和分裂的混蛋。如果您在想“知己知彼”，请相信您的直觉。狂热者是优秀的创始人，但随着公司的成熟，他们的热情相对于其难以相处的性格所造成的成本的比例就会下降。成熟需要清醒的领导者，他们更善于管理风险，并满足市场对可预测增长（即使不是显着增长）的渴望：实用主义者。</p><p>一些（即少数）创始人可以进行转型，在不失去干劲或远见的情况下磨炼他们个性中的水银方面。观看比尔·盖茨的进化，就是看一个人在一生中从<em>南方古猿阿法种</em>进化到<em>智人</em>。世界上最富有的人埃隆·马斯克(Elon Musk)仍然在他的公司里拖着指关节。一个反犹太主义者控制着一家有影响力的媒体企业和一个全球通讯网络——可能会出什么问题呢？预测：创造和损失最多股东价值的记录将由同一个人创造。但我离题了。</p><p> Uber 和 WeWork 的创始人是狂热者，这既是福也是祸，这些狂热者非理性地致力于自己的愿景，以至于忽视了反对者、商业问题、法律、道德和数学。不过，迄今为止，对法律或道德的漠视已成为整个创新经济的一个特征，而不是一个缺陷。事实证明，数学是谁生存/繁荣的仲裁者。 WeWork 是 Zealot 创立的公司的<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-is-not-the-way-everybody-behaves-how-adam-neumanns-over-the-top-style-built-wework-11568823827" target="_blank" rel="noopener">终极体现</a>，展现出高速增长、副业项目激增，以及基于近乎（等等）邪教的个人崇拜的公司文化。创始人亚当·诺依曼 (Adam Neumann) 激发了团队的奉献精神并激发了他们的辛勤工作，但他创建的工作场所更像是<a href="https://www.hulu.com/movie/wework-or-the-making-and-breaking-of-a-47-billion-unicorn-c6deead3-f45f-43c6-b8bf-fc56e9f8a589" target="_blank" rel="noopener">本周的电影</a>而不是上市公司。它本可以像 Uber 那样幸存下来，但挥霍的支出（ <a href="https://therealdeal.com/national/2019/09/26/adam-neumann-is-leaving-but-it-wont-be-on-weworks-jet-plane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6000 万美元的湾流 G650</a> ）和自我交易（以<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/04/wework-ceo-returns-5point9-million-the-company-paid-for-we-trademark.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">590 万美元的价格</a>将“We”品牌授权给公司）引发了市场的呕吐反应。</p><p>早在该公司 2019 年流产的 IPO 让投资者一睹马戏团帐篷内部并要求董事会最终解决诺伊曼问题之前，诺伊曼的缺陷就已经对内部人士显而易见了。然而，它用一名狂热者换了另一名狂热者——在这种情况下，商业史上最伟大的推动者：软银的孙正义。这位日本亿万富翁是 WeWork 的最大支持者，在 IPO 失败时已投资了<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12725419/SoftBank-WeWork-venture-capital-loss-bankruptcy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">64 亿美元</a>，他曾经告诉诺伊曼他需要“更疯狂”。孙正义加倍投资（字面意思是 95 亿美元的“救援计划”）并亲自接管了公司。</p><p> “疯狂”的一个恰当定义是做同样的事情却期待不同的结果。于是孙正义听从了自己的建议，变得他妈的疯狂，不断地大肆挥霍。在与诺伊曼发生法律纠纷，以及孙正义向诺伊曼支付十亿美元收购其股份）之后，出现了SPAC，并出现了更多的资本流失。 </p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bar-chart-2.png" alt="" width="960" height="540" /></p><p>如果 WeWork 是终极狂热者公司，那么 Uber 也不甘落后。在特拉维斯·卡兰尼克 (Travis Kalanick) 的领导下，该公司采用了一些有问题的商业策略，包括向竞争的出租车应用程序<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/24/5342582/uber-employees-spammed-competing-car-service-with-fake-orders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">发送</a>虚假乘车信息、 <a

href="https://hbr.org/2017/06/uber-cant-be-fixed-its-time-for-regulators-to-shut-it-down" target="_blank" rel="noopener">法律</a>。随后，几起<a

href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/03/softbank-more-than-600-million-underwater-on-uber.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">软银</a>，但孙正义随后不得不<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/08/softbank-sells-entire-stake-in-uber-as-vision-fund-losses-mount.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">抛售这些股份</a>，以弥补他在包括 WeWork 在内的其他投资中的损失。）</p><p> WeWork 为诺伊曼提供了支持，即使是在 WeWork 解雇了他之后。相比之下，优步姗姗来迟地展示了令人钦佩的公司治理。董事会将卡兰尼克踢出局，并引进了一位灵活的实用主义者达拉·科斯罗萨西(Dara Khosrowshahi)。 Dara 在名人堂运营商巴里·迪勒 (Barry Diller) 的指导下学习了自己的技艺，然后花了 12 年时间担任 Expedia 首席执行官，不断磨练技艺。也许这是证明科斯罗萨西是这份工作合适人选的最佳证据？他<a href="https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/why-would-i-jump-into-that-mess-how-a-reluctant-dara-khosrowshahi-got-recruited-as-uber-ceo-386482-2023-06-21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">拒绝了</a>。 <span style="font-weight: 400;">“我为什么要跳进那个烂摊子里？”这是他的回应。 （当他告诉迪勒他正在考虑这一点时，他的导师说，“你他妈的疯了，”然后挂断了他的电话。）在改变主意后，他带领 Uber 经历了痛苦但必要的改变。四年前，该公司第三季度亏损为 12 亿美元；今年，净利润为 2.21 亿美元，这是连续第二个季度盈利。这种情况可能会持续下去。实用主义者。</span></p><h4> OPA</h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">对于大多数商业历史来说，拥有资产是好的，拥有更多资产就更好了。然而，技术的构造解锁之一是将信息（比特）提升到物体（原子）之上。在信息时代，</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">拥有</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">资产是一回事，</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">经营</span></i>资产<span style="font-weight: 400;">是另一回事，两者都需要不同的资本结构、管理方法和运营技能。提供最大投资资本回报的企业没有太多资本（资产），并且可以更快地扩大规模，因为它们不将自己与汽车、公寓甚至库存绑定。 （想想：亚马逊市场。）使用其他人的资产可以使公司更具弹性，因为在困难时期，它们可以像扩大规模一样以低廉的成本缩小规模。我</span>在 2020 年<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Post-Corona-Opportunity-Scott-Galloway/dp/0593332210" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">写过</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">这篇文章，反思了大流行的教训：</span></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">优步租用其他人的汽车空间，由非雇员驾驶（无论如何，从法律的角度来看）。一旦优步汽车不再为公司带来利润，资产和劳动力就会消失，公司几乎不会付出任何成本。危机中收入可能为零，而 Uber 可以降低成本 60%–80%。另一方面，赫兹拥有自己的汽车并破产了。波音拥有 100 亿美元现金，但如果其收入下降 80%，他们可以将成本降低大约 10%，也许 20%。</p><p>当 WeWork 于 2019 年提交其命运多舛的 IPO 招股说明书时，众多令人恐惧的信息之一就是其租赁承诺。虽然 WeWork 并不拥有其运营的建筑物，但它与房东签订了长期租赁合同，这是仅次于所有权的最好/最差的事情。这使得 WeWork 对该房地产拥有唯一的使用权/责任——其功能类似于通过长期融资购买该房产。截至尝试首次公开募股时，WeWork 根据合同有义务在未来 15 年内支付<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/17/wework-ipo-filing-strangest-and-most-alarming-things.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">472 亿美元</a>的租赁费。这足以从头开始建造<a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/01/dubai-opens-world-tallest-building/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">31 座哈利法塔</a>。 </p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/icon-chart.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1137" /></p><p>快进到 2023 年，这些租赁义务已将 WeWork 推向破产。 9 月 6 日，首席执行官<a href="https://www.wework.com/newsroom/a-letter-from-weworks-ceo-on-the-next-phase-of-wework" target="_blank" rel="noopener">承认</a>这些费用“占总运营费用的三分之二……并且与当前的市场状况严重不一致”，并宣布了重新谈判的计划。 “我们知道根据合同我们有义务付款，但宁愿少付钱”的谈话进展得并不顺利。相比之下，由于其轻资产模式的灵活性，优步已经能够应对首席执行官的离职和竞争的起伏，并在食品、物流和其他相关业务上进行了战略押注，取得了不同程度的成功。 WeWork 只有一种生存手段：租更多办公桌。它不能，所以它没有。</p><h4>还没死</h4><p>破产是资本主义的最佳特征之一，它是为一家主要问题是……租赁承诺的公司精心设计的。 WeWork 的前进道路之一是利用破产来审视其办公楼组合，摆脱表现不佳地点的租赁，并在优质地点获得更好的交易。它应该有一定的影响力：自疫情爆发以来，商业写字楼市场一直表现不佳，继去年下跌 38% 后，今年迄今为止，其价值 <a href="https://www.reit.com/sites/default/files/returns/prop.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">下跌了 25%</a> 。预计到 2029 年，写字楼物业价值将比 2019 年<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2023/03/05/how-remote-work-has-affected-real-estate-values/?sh=4ba89dc31229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">下降 40%</a> 。想想看。美国商业办公空间的总价值损失可能比全球任何资产类别都多。 “苏菲选择”的“将租金减半，否则我们步行”可能是普通房东无法拒绝的提议。</p><p>但可能有更好的方法。轻资产并要求其他人拥有该空间。酒店品牌几十年前就意识到了这一点，而 WeWork 与酒店没有什么相似之处。它们都是 REaaS，借用科技的缩写，即房地产即服务。四季酒店和丽兹酒店的做法是这样的：他们通过与业主签订的经营合同来经营酒店，为他们赚取费用和部分收入。这是一个“奇怪的伎俩”，它将一家因昂贵、流动性差的房地产而拖累的企业转变为 21 世纪的轻资产企业。另一种方法是特许经营业务——这就是 WeWork 版本 2（解雇诺伊曼之后、第 11 章之前的时代）对其国际业务所做的事情。加盟商必须理清他们的房地产风险和策略，但他们拥有当地专业知识的优势。 （极端的轻资产选择是完全使用 Uber，不过更好的类比是 Airbnb：将业务转变为提供自己办公空间出租的提供商网络。但这既不是 WeWork 提供的承诺，也不是产品，它可能充满安全风险和操作挑战。）</p><p> WeWork 和 Uber 都拥有价值数十亿美元的资产，品牌已达到极乐世界——它们是各自类别的通用术语。 WeWork 的品牌因过去几年的业务失败而受到损害，但企业失误对消费品牌的影响通常很小。例如，航空公司无法避开<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airline_bankruptcies_in_the_United_States" target="_blank" rel="noopener">破产法庭</a>（美国航空、达美航空和联合航空都是最近的例子），但它们的品牌<a href="https://brandirectory.com/rankings/airlines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">却一直在飞翔</a>。我预计现在有不少潜在买家正在进行品牌资产调查，衡量 WeWork 潜在最有价值资产的实力。我打赌巴里·斯特恩利希特 (Barry Sternlicht) 能让公司摆脱破产困境。我们拭目以待。</p><p>所有这一切都假设 WeWork 所销售的产品有市场。有。 <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2021/08/20/most-employees-would-choose-flexible-working-instead-of-a-pay-rise-15124821/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">四分之三的工人</a>会选择“灵活的工作环境”而不是更高的工资。但对于大多数 40 岁以下的人来说，餐桌或当地的星巴克（另一个可以进入这个领域的品牌？） 并不能解决这个问题。对于寻求轻资产的雇主来说，WeWork 合同比租赁更具吸引力。短期小批量租赁服务是未来的办公空间业务。资产基础是一个沉重的负担。</p><h4>主场比赛</h4><p>在最高管理层中，狂热者和实用主义者的性格类型在公司的发展过程中是连续的。在人际关系中，两人配合得很好。我一直在浏览 35 年前我和朋友 Lee 一起背包旅行欧洲的照片。他带来了地图、钱包带和旅行支票。在火车上，他会计划我们的一天，而我会梳理火车并尝试寻找可以在目的地一起闲逛的新朋友（即女性）。李和我共用同一个医生（劳尔·齐默尔曼），当他听说我们要去欧洲时，他总结了我们的关系：“李将确保你不会错过太多火车，而斯科特将确保你错过一些火车。”几周前，李和他的丈夫来看我在<em>比尔·马赫的</em>节目，后来李把我拉到一边说：“我为你和你所取得的成就感到骄傲。”这对我来说太有意义了。我认为自己是一个相当无所畏惧的人，但我从来没有信心对男性朋友说这样的话。还有时间。不管怎样，四十年来我们一直在赶火车和错过火车。太有福了。</p><p>生活如此丰富，

年里，我并没有足够担心我能控制的事情。最后10个，太担心我几乎无法控制的事情。在过去的几周里，这种情况有所加速，但也有一线希望：我对中东感到非常害怕，这是我第一次真正地担心，甚至焦虑，担心除了我和人民之外的其他事情。离我最近的。不管怎样，这就是我为地缘政治帖子道歉的方式。我想它们与营销和商业有一定的相关性，但这实际上只是治疗。随着年龄的增长，我对斯多葛主义（认识自己能控制什么、不能控制什么的能力）的了解和欣赏不断增加，但实践它的能力却下降了。</p><p>下周我们就要开始工作了……我保证。好吧，回到帖子。</p><h4>故事与原则</h4><p>人们喜欢有原则的人在面对风险和阻力时坚持自己的信念的故事。 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QpS2Am51Wo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Flip flopper”是一种侮辱</a>；它很可能为W在一场失败的战争中赢得了第二个任期。我们钦佩——或者声称我们钦佩——他人的诚实和直率。但在某些情况下，看涨的一致性不如敏捷性那么有效。做出（或阻止）改变的力量更多的是取决于环境而不是信念。世界上的许多问题都可以追溯到那些有着令人震惊的坚定信念和原则的人们。我们的民选官员越来越多地用“有原则”来掩盖“无能”。我们选出的代表无法辨别正确与有效。</p><h4>足球妈妈</h4><p>明年的美国总统选举是自上一次（或下一次）以来我们一生中最重要的一次，数以万计的工作人员和志愿者将工作到选举日，因为他们的竞选活动花费了数十亿美元来骚扰我们的媒体和邮箱。超过 1.5 亿美国人将投票，数千名官僚和律师将为如何计票而争论不休。</p><p>但这些都无关紧要，因为 44 个州（实际上）已经投票了——2024 年无论有多少竞选活动都不会让加利福尼亚州支持共和党候选人，也不会让德克萨斯州支持民主党。即使在摇摆州，大多数选民也已经做出了决定。总之，在 3.3 亿美国人中，费城和底特律郊区的数万名足球妈妈将再次选出自由世界的领袖。也许这是一件好事。或许。</p><h4>民主将走向民主</h4><p>也许它（即民主）正在发挥作用。加州的一些亿万富翁对 2024 年的影响力，还不如威斯康星州焦点小组中一位魅力超凡的代课老师。如果您想观看世界上最有权势的人规划未来，请不要冒险前往达沃斯或椭圆形办公室，只需点击此处： <a

选民比例，并且他们投资了选民数据，这些数据可以逐户告诉他们每个可说服的选民在哪里，以及什么可能会影响他们。专业提示：在摇摆区购买媒体机构；每四年，您的收入就会出现不自然的激增，而与您的产品无关。</p><p>每一位总统候选人都会为 CPAC 或由科技影响者/亿万富翁主办的峰会腾出日程，但真正的朝觐将是这个尚未成立的 PAC，一个比美国历史上任何政治团体都拥有更多权力的 PAC：由摇摆州的郊区妈妈和 25 岁以下选民、铁锈地带的蓝领工人和亚利桑那州的拉丁裔组成的联盟，在“摇摆 PAC”或“SPAC”的旗帜下联合起来。首先，SPAC 是一个现在就可以采用的品牌，但那是另一回事了。</p><p>如果里德·霍夫曼、马克·库班、里克·威尔逊（林肯计划）、大卫·阿克塞尔罗德和弗兰克·伦茨想要建造并坐在铁沙发上，他们就会组织这些团体。 SPAC 将在紫色州（例如佐治亚州）组织集市，对问题进行深入讨论，并承诺作为一个整体进行投票。如果这个由大约 10,000 人组成的团体（仅代表 100,000 名选民）聚集起来并进行协调，他们将对谁领导自由世界及其立法议程拥有独特的控制权。 PAC 终止所有 PAC。</p><h4>至尊摇摆</h4><p>这不仅仅是在总统选举中。 <a href="https://time.com/5323863/justice-anthony-kennedy-retirement-time-cover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">安东尼·肯尼迪大法官</a>在二十年来可以说是美国最有权势的人，在最高法院的四位自由派和四位保守派同事之间。在他任期的最后十年里，肯尼迪在法院做出的 5-4 项裁决中，超过四分之三的裁决都是以多数票作出的，其中包括一些最重要的裁决。从美国环保局的权力到死刑的限制，一个人对我们的宪法具有影响力，不是因为他更聪明或更有原则，而是因为他是摇摆票。 </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215472"

的启发，导致价值数十亿美元的对冲基金做空 GameStop 股票。他们协调购买股票和期权，使股价呈指数级上涨，并切断了公司市值与其内在价值之间的联系。这是最终的市场弹性，大卫击垮了婴儿潮一代的对冲基金，它引发了一个明显的问题：现在怎么办？答案是始终存在的基本面引力，迫使这些股票急速着陆。 GameStop 最高价为 483 美元；今天它的价格为 12 美元。</p><p>尽管如此，迷因股票的期权价值仍然存在内在溢价，因为金融市场水域中出现了一种新的大白鲨：协调的散户投资者。市场上的摇摆票曾经是新兴市场的机构投资者和激进分子。然而，这位经历过童年创伤、用毒笔向管理层写信、徒劳地争取父亲批准的亿万富翁，已经被拥有移动设备、罗宾汉账户、缺乏交配机会的千禧一代所取代。我对前一句话感到特别自豪。</p><h4>谢赫·斯温格</h4><p>沙特阿拉伯拥有 3700 万人口，是<a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">人口第 40 位的国家</a>，落后于埃塞俄比亚、缅甸和摩洛哥。其沙漠下方蕴藏着丰富的石油海洋，使其成为世界上最具摇摆性的选票。委内瑞拉的<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_proven_oil_reserves" target="_blank" rel="noopener">储备更大</a>，与伊朗和加拿大处于同一水平，但沙特的财富更有分量。他们知道自己处于枢轴点——能够向东或向西摆动。</p><p>他们的战略最明显的方面是在叙利亚和也门的代理人战争面前与伊朗实现关系正常化，同时逐步接近与以色列的外交关系。与伊朗的联系是由中国促成的，沙特正在与中国建立更密切的关系。 （中国是沙特石油的最大进口国。）与此同时，沙特王国仍然与美国保持着紧密的关系。</p><p>我认为，沙特阿拉伯的谨慎、稳定的自由化是一种巧妙的外交政策策略，而本·萨勒曼冒着对其在统治家族中的权力的一定<a href="https://time.com/longform/mohammed-bin-salman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">风险</a>而实施这一举措。 MBS花费2500亿美元不是为了赢得<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-world-cup-2034.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2034年世界杯</a>，而是为了成为世界足球妈妈。沙特王国的影响力正在增强，而美国如果能对抗中国与沙特迅速改善的关系，将会得到很好的帮助——就像沙特王国在加沙之后最好的举措就是与以色列实现关系正常化一样。这甚至是可行的（10 月 7 日之前就已开始实施），这是 MBS 从伊斯兰主义转向资本主义的结果​​。无论他是否喜欢他，MBS 可能是西方十年来发生的最好的事情之一。</p><p>王国并不孤单。近年来，土耳其已成为欧洲的摇摆国家，尽管它购买了俄罗斯的军事装备，但在接受芬兰和瑞典加入北约的优先事项上却做出了<a href="https://www.georgetown.edu/news/whats-behind-turkeys-reversal-on-swedens-nato-bid-a-foreign-policy-professor-answers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">让步</a>。土耳其在枢轴战略中的立场是自然而然的。它是欧洲和中东之间的地理和文化桥梁。伊斯坦布尔还拥有一座很棒的 Soho House。但我离题了。</p><h4>主场比赛</h4><p>在我家里，我是摇摆票。正如美国每两年决定一次亚利桑那州的拉丁裔认为重要的事情一样，我家里的其他人也会定期找我来解决平局。但大多数情况下，我们生活在一个与成吉思汗（即妈妈）统治下的蒙古帝国相媲美的霸权之中。不可否认，当谈到电视节目或餐馆时，爸爸从影响者提升为决策者。我无论在外还是在家里，都足以与各方相处得很好。另外，当事情崩溃时，我的意思是崩溃（尖叫等），他们就会转向我。尽管在我开口之前，通常会有源源不断的翻白眼并一致认为我错了。我倾听、提出问题并产生同理心。我是东方（妈妈）和西方（男孩）之间的桥梁，提供双方都不满意的解决方案……但双方都接受。</p><p>他们听我的，不是因为，就像地缘政治一样，我有权力……我没有。但因为我爱他们，他们也爱我，他们也彼此相爱。当事情变得非常糟糕时，我很重要。我是爸爸，摇摆票。</p><p>生活如此丰富，

岁以下的美国人</span>比以色列人更<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/472070/democrats-sympathies-middle-east-shift-palestinians.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">同情</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">巴勒斯坦人。但在此期间，美国的政策仍然坚定地支持以色列，美国媒体也普遍支持以色列的利益。</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">建制派观点与年轻人观点之间的</span><a href="https://time.com/6295703/israel-herzog-visit-washington/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">差距正在扩大为鸿沟</span></a>。<span style="font-weight: 400;">所有这些让我想起……德累斯顿。</span></p><h4> 125,000</h4><p> 1945年，美国和英国空军连续48小时向德国德累斯顿市<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II" target="_blank" rel="noopener">投掷</a>4000吨高爆炸弹。这次袭击具有军事优势。它阻碍了德国军队的行动，摧毁了一个重要的市中心，给德国造成了重大伤亡，并且正如美国战略轰炸调查官员<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080528051903/http://aupress.au.af.mil/Books/USSBS/USSBS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">所言</a>，“给德国人民留下了关于战争弊端的深刻教训”。它还摧毁了数英亩具有历史和文化价值的艺术品和建筑，并造成 25,000 名平民死亡。</p><p>盟军认为这一行动非常成功，以至于一个月后，美国在地球另一端更大规模地重复了这一战术，<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Tokyo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">摧毁了</a>东京市中心 16 平方英里的地区，造成 10 万平民死亡，这使得 1945 年 3 月 9 日成为最致命的夜晚在人类历史上。四个月后，杜鲁门下令用原子弹摧毁广岛和长崎。美国当代的评估和舆论都集中在这些袭击所获得的军事优势上，而很少提及可怕的人员伤亡。它对美国对这场战争或战争的支持者的支持没有产生明显的影响。</p><p>如果德累斯顿人民拥有 TikTok，会发生什么？同一个 TikTok 还为我提供了数十个来自加沙的视频，其中有一对夫妇带着他们无辜的孩子躲避以色列炸弹的故事。他们周围只有瓦砾。令人心碎。令人心碎的事足以让你憎恨那些制造炸弹的人，无论他们的旗帜或理由如何。</p><h4>三张照片</h4><p>在现代历史的大部分时间里，政府和精英对叙事产生了巨大的影响，尤其是在外交事务方面。当文字、声音和图像只能通过受控通道访问时，完全没有必要进行<em>1984 年</em>式的控制。企业对媒体的所有权、新闻报道的获取和偏见对于选择报道哪些故事以及如何构建它们有很大影响。</p><p>例外证明了规则。当相反的证据进入公众意识时，其影响可能是深远的。仅三张照片就改变了美国公众对越南战争的看法，其影响力超过了数千名阵亡的美国士兵或失败的战斗： <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/world/asia/vietnam-execution-photo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1968 年，一名南越将军射杀一名囚犯头部的照片</a>； <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/world/asia/vietnam-execution-photo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1970 年，玛丽·安·韦奇奥 (Mary Ann Vecchio) 跪在一名囚犯尸体上的照片。</a>肯特州立大学的同学，以及<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phan_Thi_Kim_Phuc#/media/File:The_Terror_of_War.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1972 年的一张裸体女孩逃离凝固汽油弹的照片</a>。如果您超过 50 岁，您可能只需闭上眼睛就能回忆起这些图像。如果你已经70多岁了，你就不需要闭上眼睛。失去对叙事控制的政权很快就会失去权力。美国对越南看法的转变导致林登·约翰逊下台。<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gulag_Archipelago" target="_blank" rel="noopener">古拉格群岛</a></em>致命地破坏了苏联的历史和道德叙事。阿亚图拉霍梅尼的<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhollah_Khomeini#Pre-revolutionary_political_activity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">录音布道</a>推翻了美国支持的伊朗国王。</p><p>所有政府都试图塑造叙事。越南被称为“客厅战争”，因为媒体，尤其是电视，以二战或朝鲜战争期间新闻片从未做过的方式将越南战争带回家。美国军方从这次经历中得到的教训很简单：它必须重新控制局势。它实施了一种将记者“ <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/opinion/embedded-journalism-a-distorted-view-of-war-2141072.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">嵌入</a>”军事单位的制度，这当然意味着记者所看到的内容以及如何向他们呈现这些内容在很大程度上受到政府的控制。嵌入将精灵放回到瓶子里，持续了一代人。但社交媒体，尤其是 TikTok 流行的短视频格式，打破了这个瓶子。</p><h4>移动屏幕大战</h4><p>美国年轻人<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/13/kids-and-teens-watch-more-tiktok-than-youtube-tiktok-91-minutes-in-2021-youtube-56/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">至少有 10%</a>的醒着时间花在 TikTok 上，18 至 24 岁的美国人中有 76% 是 TikTok 用户，而 65 岁及以上的美国人中这一比例为 7%。那时他们<em>不会</em>花时间看 CNN 或阅读<em>《华尔街日报》</em> 。在 TikTok 上，亲巴勒斯坦内容的规模和影响力远远超过亲以色列内容。截至本周，标记为 #StandWithPalestine 的视频的观看次数是标记为 #StandWithIsrael 的视频的 10 倍以上 — 3.24 亿 vs. 34<em>亿</em>。一名 TikTok 用户<a href="https://x.com/jmj/status/1717404573214671068?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">报告说</a>，一旦他开始发布此类帖子，他的直播就变得狂热地反以色列，而且该平台上的犹太创作者<a href="https://www.deartiktok.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">报告称</a>骚扰不断升级。 </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215457"

/></p><h4>因果</h4><p>这就是<em>因果</em>。年轻的美国人（见上文）已经偏离了他们父辈（我这一代）对冲突的态度。年轻的美国人比年长的美国人更加多元化，并且可能更同情巴勒斯坦人等非白人群体。如果你对以色列-巴勒斯坦的了解主要是2006年后的加沙和约旦河西岸被推平的房屋，那么你的观点可能会与那些参考赎罪日战争和慕尼黑的人的观点不同。年轻人更容易制作亲巴勒斯坦的内容，更容易消费它，然后事情就会发生变化。</p><h4>准确性是偶然的</h4><p>总的来说，获得更多观点和更多信息来源是一件好事。暴君不应该被允许让自己的人民消失，就像民主国家不应该能够用燃烧弹轰炸别人的人民一样，而直播中坚定的证词可以帮助阻止他们。但无边无际的信息景观<em>并不是</em>纯粹的好东西。因为社交媒体不利于准确性、平衡性或多样性。它有利于点击。内容越吸引人、越激怒，获得的点击次数就越多。我在 TikTok 上获得的加沙图像比我在 CNN 上看到的更准确或更真实吗？在某些情况下，是的。但在社交媒体上，准确性是偶然的。我认为，这带来了两个深远的风险。</p><h4>我们花时间的地方</h4><p>萨姆·哈里斯说，你花时间在哪里，你就会成为什么样的人。 <a

个字符（不是开玩笑）。他指出，人类受环境的影响比我们想象的要大。如果我醒着的时候花 5% 的时间在 Twitter 上生气，我就会成为一个愤怒程度高 5% 的人。如果我花更多的时间与孩子们一起表达和接受爱，​​情况也是如此。我们成为我们度过时间的地方。 （旁注：我不再使用 Twitter。）（另一个旁注：仍然生气和简短。）</p><p>正如我对 Twitter 的沉迷让我更喜欢在那里消费的东西——喋喋不休地发表愤怒的热门言论——花时间在 TikTok 上#standwith___ 会产生可预见的效果。 The conflict, generations old and woven into the fabric of global politics, is reduced to suffering, anger, and violence. There is a good side and a bad side. Instinctive tribalism kicks in, and young people walk through Washington Square Park with images of the Star of David in the trash, and a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/muslim-boy-killed-chicago-landlord-will-county-5135dea218326d6e639a996564d9369e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6-year-old Muslim boy</a> is stabbed by his landlord. Social media algorithms identify our politics and then shepherd us into a hermetically sealed bubble, framing our worldview through a window of rage and extremism.</p><h4> CCP(roblem)</h4><p> We know the first risk is real, and it&#39;s playing out — you can see it on your phone and in the street. Our discourse is more coarse, our focus increasingly on what divides us. The second risk is more insidious, visible only in outline. <span style="font-weight: 400;">But those outlines are coming into sharp relief. There is a nonzero probability that TikTok is being manipulated and leveraged by the CCP to sow division in America. That probability is high. It&#39;s what we would do and have done. In the Cold War, both the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a variety of covert actions aimed at fomenting internal strife. Radio Free Europe, a CIA-backed initiative, broadcast pro-democracy messaging into the Eastern Bloc to encourage dissent. During World War II, Nazi Germany dropped leaflets over American troops that highlighted racial injustices in the US, hoping to demoralize troops and incite racial tension. Every nation has done, or is doing, this … actively.</span> The US itself continues to pursue such tactics to this day. The US Army&#39;s 4th Psychological Operations Group <a href="https://www.soc.mil/4thPOG/4thPOGhome.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">describes itself</a> as follows: </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215458" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4.png" alt="" width="900" height="307" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4.png 1921w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-300x102.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-520x177.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-768x262.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-1536x524.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-1200x409.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The CCP has control over the most powerful, yet elegant, weapon in the history of propaganda, and the default position is they (ie, the CCP) are</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">using it?</span> I have <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/tiktok-trojan-stallion/https://www.profgalloway.com/tiktok-trojan-stallion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated this view before</a> . China cannot beat us kinetically or economically, but it can beat us by tearing us apart from the inside. TikTok, in my view, has the potential effect of several carrier strike forces. A 21st century Trojan Horse that also generates $100 billion in annual revenue. I was at the White House this week for an AI Summit. Government officials are not allowed to be on TikTok for security reasons. This comes at a cost, as I believe they&#39;d be more alarmed at the skew of information.</p><p> It&#39;s a common misconception that propaganda is like advertising: a barrage of messaging favoring one side or attacking another. Uncle Sam telling you to buy war bonds or black-and-white movies of Aryan youth saluting the swastika. That&#39;s not how China would use (is using) TikTok. The more elegant strategy is to atomize the enemy (us). Find small differences of opinion and broaden them. Carve off slices of support for a long-time ally, one demographic group at a time. The Nazi propagandist Goebbels <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43040494" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> that the purpose of propaganda is to generate “volcanic passions, outbreaks of rage, to set masses of people on the march, to organize hatred and despair with ice-cold calculation.”</p><p> Xi Jinping has <a href="https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/321001.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described</a> the Internet as “the main battlefield in the battle for public opinion,” and in 2013 he said, “online public opinion work should be taken as the top priority of propaganda and ideological work. Many people, especially young people, do not read mainstream media and get most of their information from the Internet. We must face up to this fact, increase investment, and seize the initiative on this battlefield of public opinion as soon as possible. [We must] become experts in using new means and methods of modern media.” ByteDance employees have confirmed the CCP has backdoor access to American TikTok user data, which <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/08/tech/tiktok-data-china/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it has used</a> several times. In addition, the CCP has refused to let TikTok&#39;s parent company ByteDance go public for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bytedance-shelvedipo-intentions-after-chinese-regulators-warned-about-data-security-11626078000?mod=hp_lead_pos1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">national security reasons</a> . FBI officials have themselves stated TikTok could be used as an <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3199769/tiktok-can-be-used-aggressive-weapon-china-against-us-fbi-director-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“aggressive weapon”</a> against the US and China&#39;s enemies at large. <span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, the CCP&#39;s manipulation of TikTok is hiding in plain sight.</span></p><h4> Oppenheimer Moment</h4><p> The CCP&#39;s Oppenheimer moment was the fusion of TikTok and October 7. Or maybe I&#39;m being paranoid and am out of touch with a generation reacting to an Israel that has veered rightward. Maybe an increasingly non-white population has an easier time recognizing oppression.

For this post though, I&#39;ll focus on Netflix, as its management has better hair, and they&#39;re not mendacious fucks. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215444" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/line-chart-1.png" alt="" width="900" height="548" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/line-chart-1.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/line-chart-1-300x183.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/line-chart-1-520x317.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/line-chart-1-768x468.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/line-chart-1-1536x936.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/line-chart-1-1200x731.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> Rewind</h4><p> A year ago, Netflix was losing 1 million subscribers per quarter and had shed 75% of its market cap. It was the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/29/business/netflix-stock-market-earnings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worst performing</a> stock in the S&amp;P 500. Fast-forward one circumnavigation of the Sun, and Wall Street is <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/10/netflix-stock-streaming-earnings-wall-street-1235578055/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“gushing”</a> over its <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/streaming/nflx/netflix-stock-3q-earnings-were-beautiful-whats-next-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“beautiful”</a> results while the rest of the industry flounders.</p><p> However, rebounds are not new for Netflix. Since it delivered DVDs in envelopes, the company has defied the odds. Think about it: a DVD-by-mail company turned internet platform turned Hollywood giant that would eventually join <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the same power acronym</a> as Apple, Amazon, and Google. We&#39;ve <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/think-bigger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a> entertainment&#39;s <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/struck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">woes</a> at length this year, but Netflix has replaced Disney, Discovery, and Paramount on the content Iron Throne and boasts a market cap equal to all three combined.</p><h4> Told You So</h4><p> Five months ago I predicted the writers&#39; strike would do more to help Netflix than harm it. My thesis: The strike would “force” a universal reduction in spending, while actually increasing the relative value of Netflix to consumers. The streamer was able to cut costs without materially affecting the user experience, as it already had a content library as deep as the Mariana Trench. Also, it helps to not be cable, because unlike news, late-night, and sitcoms, <em>Ozark</em> and <em>Bridgerton</em> aren&#39;t perishable.</p><p> In addition to a 20% profit bump, the company is expected to generate $6.5 billion in free cash flow this year. That&#39;s up from $1.6 billion in 2022. Meanwhile, revenue is also up, but only slightly (8%). Which means the multibillion-dollar windfall is a direct consequence of lower costs — that is, not having to spend <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinereid/2023/06/02/netflix-equips-the-witcher-with-319-million-budget/?sh=4a7c4a56144c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$20 million</a> per episode on <em>The Witcher</em> . Analysts are even <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/nflx/quote" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cautioning</a> against <em>too</em> much optimism, as the “resolution of the writers&#39; strike will bring higher costs” and thus depress profits. Put another way, investors <em>don&#39;t want the strikes to end</em> . Would we be surprised if we found out the folks running the <span style="font-weight: 400;">WGA/SAG-Aftra</span> were covert assets working for the streaming giant? NETspionage if you will (couldn&#39;t resist).</p><p> Anyway, Netflix&#39;s strength in the face of the work stoppage was both a function of the <span style="font-weight: 400;">strikers&#39;</span> lack of long-term strategy and Netflix&#39;s abundance of it. Over the past two decades the company has employed several simple but important business strategies that have endured. Let&#39;s review them.</p><h4> Diversify</h4><p> I asked <a href="https://profg.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProfG.AI</a> to explain the value of diversification. Its answer: “Diversification is the kevlar that protects you from fatal financial injuries. It&#39;s a defensive strategy that limits your downside, even if it limits your upside.” I&#39;d hate to hang with this guy, but he isn&#39;t wrong.</p><p> Netflix has invested heavily in diversification, in the form of international content. The company is shifting spending away from Hollywood and increasing investment in local-language productions. In the past two years, spending in Asia has increased to <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/netflix-content-spending-asia-pacific-1235543665/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2 billion</a> and European investment has <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/content-remote-show-2022-netflix-presents-an-extensive-outlook-of" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doubled</a> . More than half of Netflix&#39;s scripted titles are being produced abroad. Compare that to Warner Bros. Discovery (a third) and Paramount (a quarter). The effect has been protection against supply chain interruptions (ie content shortages), because while American actors and writers went on strike and TV series orders declined 25%, the foreign production gears kept grinding. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215440" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/area-chart-05.png" alt="" width="900" height="609" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/area-chart-05.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/area-chart-05-300x203.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/area-chart-05-520x352.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/area-chart-05-768x520.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/area-chart-05-1536x1040.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/area-chart-05-1200x813.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> In addition, Netflix has diversified its library with a mix of original and licensed content. One of its more creative moves this year was approaching NBCUniversal to buy the rights to <em>Suits</em> . After debuting on Netflix this summer, the 2011 legal drama (featuring the divorcée who saved a prince from the horrors of Buckingham Palace) performed better than any original Netflix show this year. Scratch that — better than any show, <em>period</em> . <em>Suits</em> was the <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/news/business/why-suits-is-on-netflix-1234910470/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most streamed show</a> across all platforms for three straight months this year, hitting the record for most-ever weeks at No. 1. <span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the Netflix Effect in action: Take a solid series, reheat it, and make it the most consumed content on the planet.</span> </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215442" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/horizontal-2.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1650" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/horizontal-2.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/horizontal-2-300x258.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/horizontal-2-520x447.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/horizontal-2-768x660.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/horizontal-2-1536x1320.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/horizontal-2-1200x1031.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><h4> Adapt or Die</h4><p> The species that survive aren&#39;t the strongest or fastest but the most adaptable. As we&#39;ve <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/welfare-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed before</a> , the most valuable companies in the world all have one thing in common: They build a thick layer of innovation on top of investments made by the premier VC in history, the US government. Apple used Darpa&#39;s GPS to build the iPhone. Facebook built an app on top of a government-funded hosting service called the Internet. And Netflix, like Amazon, leveraged the nation&#39;s largest content distribution platform — the US postal system — to send DVDs by mail.</p><p> Mailing DVDs sounds dense now, but it was a great business. The company launched in 1997, went public in 2002, and reached a billion dollars in revenue in 2006 by addressing a pain point: that IED in your kitchen drawer, the VHS of <em>Turner &amp; Hooch</em> you forgot to return. The company&#39;s leadership could have settled and backed away from the massive investment required to pivot to streaming. But CEO Reed Hastings recognized another multibillion-dollar investment in broadband would soon render DVDs obsolete. “Don&#39;t be afraid to change the model,” Hastings said, and in 2007, Netflix introduced <span style="font-weight: 400;">streaming to the world.</span></p><p> Streaming was not the company&#39;s only bold pivot. In 2011, despite its reputation as a “platform,” Netflix decided to foray into original content. At the time, it seemed absurd. The company was going up against Universal, Paramount, Warner Bros., Disney, and Sony — Hollywood titans known in the industry as the Big Five. Still, Netflix dove in headfirst, spending $2 billion on content in Year One. One of its first original series, <em>House of Cards</em> , went on to earn 33 Emmy and 8 Golden Globe nominations.</p><h4> Opportunities vs. Problems</h4><p> Peter Drucker said invest in your opportunities, not your problems. Few have done this better than Netflix. For a long time, the company&#39;s obstacle was plain to see: It was burning hundreds of millions in cash every year. But Netflix knew brute force was its strength. Specifically, it recognized the market viewed it as a tech company, so it did what other media companies couldn&#39;t: Massively invest, lose money, and grow.</p><p> In 2015, Netflix registered negative $840 million in free cash flow. By 2017, that number was negative $2 billion; two years later, negative $3 billion. Fearless spending was its differentiator. Capital as a weapon, if you will — specifically, cheap capital. Original content spending at Netflix grew faster than at any other streaming service, and by 2021 the company was investing $18 billion on content per annum, with free cash flow still in the red. Meanwhile, the legacy media players were beholden to a different investor base that wouldn&#39;t tolerate the losses needed to go toe-to-toe with the streaming platform.</p><p> Netflix is now firmly profitable in all aspects of the business. It is the only entertainment company with a profitable DTC streaming business, and the legacy players are playing catch up.</p><h4> Name Your Price</h4><p> Netflix&#39;s decision to increase subscription prices this quarter reflects the strength of the platform. It has reached utility status. There are 140 million households across the US and Canada, and 77 million Netflix accounts. Consumers no longer consider the cost benefit of a subscription. The question isn&#39;t if you subscribe to Netflix, but rather, what other platforms you decide to accessorize it with.</p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The premium plan is now $22.99 per month, up 15%. Meanwhile, the standard ad tier remains $6.99. Netflix has correctly adjusted for the most fundamental economic trend in America, income inequality. It has adopted a means-based pricing strategy that retains low-income users while squeezing more from upper-income households.</span> Plus, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA5708" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research has found</a> that introducing lower-quality products actually <em>increases</em> sales of your higher-margin premium products. I was skeptical of Netflix advertising at first, but it may ultimately drive more users to the premium product.</p><h4> Threats</h4><p> I&#39;m tempted to say the only thing that can stand in the way of Netflix is Netflix. But that&#39;s not true — it&#39;s TikTok and YouTube.</p><p> We&#39;ve <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/tiktok-boom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a> <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/tiktok-trojan-stallion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok&#39;s</a> <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/struck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ascent</a> before. The Chinese juggernaut is stealing eyeballs (especially young ones) from the streamers and generating <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiktoks-owner-bytedance-generated-nearly-7-billion-in-cash-in-first-quarter?rc=uvswq2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$25 billion</a> in quarterly revenue in the process. BTW, that number is up 34% from last year.</p><p> Less discussed, however, is the threat of YouTube. Netflix gave it a casual mention in its shareholder letter, but the implication was so relaxed as to be tense. “Our share of TV screen time in the US,” the letter read, “is greater than any streamer other than YouTube.” This was meant as a not-so-humble brag. It isn&#39;t. YouTube is the most popular TV streaming service, and that doesn&#39;t account for the minutes it gets on laptops and mobile phones. I assume (hope) management recognizes this is a problem. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215441" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart-03-.png" alt="" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart-03-.png 960w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart-03--300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart-03--520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart-03--768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> Bill Maher</h4><p> I&#39;m going on Bill Maher tonight. It&#39;s my fourth time, and when they introduce the panel a wave of fear always envelops me that this will be one of the times I have a panic attack. (I get them 0.7% of the times I speak.) It&#39;s important to me, as I respect Bill and his team, and my 93-year-old father only watches two things: Maple Leafs hockey and Bill Maher. He recently called me to announce I was on, as if it was news to me. He&#39;s struggling.</p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#39;m sitting in my room, on the 60th floor of the Wynn hotel, writing this. Every year for the past 35, my three closest friends and I have come to Vegas</span> <a href="https://www.threads.net/@profgalloway/post/Cy4SbdtA1cC/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for my birthday</a> . The trip&#39;s changed: We now spend more time in the spa and less in the casino, but the company remains the same. I look out my window and see Summerlin, where I lived for seven months 20 years ago. My mom, battling cancer for the third and final time, asked to die at home. I moved in with her. She had raised me alone, on a secretary&#39;s salary, and it was the right thing to do. It wasn&#39;t much of a sacrifice for me, as I had no real relationship and no real career, and found the experience rewarding. During the day I&#39;d manage her health care and we&#39;d watch <em>Everybody Loves Raymond</em> and <em>Jeopardy</em> together. At night, I&#39;d venture downtown where I&#39;d party with a friend, a young guy who&#39;d moved from Houston to open a cigar bar, and strippers. One night, I met him at the Rio hotel and he gave me a “healing candle” for my mom, whose breast cancer had metastasized to her stomach and was terminal. A candle. People are strange, and wonderful.</p><p> Today&#39;s appearance on Maher will happen, but not really. Whenever anything really great happens to me, I instinctively think to call my mom and bask in our collective victory … we made it. Her response would cement it, make it real. These days, wonderful occurrences sometimes don&#39;t feel as if they&#39;ve happened, as she&#39;s not there. I am 58 and, two decades later, still not over the death of my mother. And that&#39;s OK. I hope my boys feel the same way about me when I&#39;m gone.</p><p> Life is so rich, </p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/nmnm_images/Scott-Signature-NMNM.png" /></p><p> PS Our <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0geHULgKkLQRq7VJ5LvRu8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof G Markets podcast</a> is hitting new records. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5Ob5psTjoUtIGYxKUp2QVy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tune in every Monday</a> for our fresh take on what&#39;s moving the capital markets.</p><p> PPS Ex-Netflix VP for Product Gibson Biddle is teaching the Product Strategy Sprint starting Nov. 6. <a href="https://demo.sectionschool.com/courses/product-strategy-sprint/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=nmnm&amp;utm_campaign=freemium&amp;utm_content=1026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watch the first lesson</a> on his DHM (delightful, hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing) model for free.</p><p> <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/the-netflix-effect/">Netflix 效应</a>一文首先出现在<a href="https://www.profgalloway.com">《No Mercy / No Malice》</a>上。</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.profgalloway.com/the-netflix-effect/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 40</slash:comments></item><item><title>听</title><link/>https://www.profgalloway.com/listen/<comments> https://www.profgalloway.com/listen/#comments</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Galloway]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 16:06:28 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.profgalloway.com/?p=215433 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p>听力被低估了。与视觉不同，听觉在黑暗和角落里起作用。我们听到的速度比我们看到的速度快 20 到 100 倍，而且我们听到的内容在我们的脑海中停留的时间更长，通常会引发强烈的情绪——只要听听你最喜欢的大学乐队的音乐就可以了。然而，对于我们许多人来说，我们并没有开始利用[...]</p><p>帖子<a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/listen/">“倾听”</a>首先出现在<a href="https://www.profgalloway.com">“无情/无恶意”</a>上。</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>听力被低估了。与视觉不同，听觉在黑暗和角落里起作用。我们听到的速度比我们看到的速度快 20 到 100 倍，而且我们听到的内容在我们的脑海中停留的时间更长，通常会引发强烈的情绪——只要听听你最喜欢的大学乐队的音乐就可以了。 However, for many of us, we don&#39;t begin to harness this superpower until the age we begin to lose it. Hearing, like youth, is wasted on the young. We all hear things; there&#39;s no corner of the globe that&#39;s free from the vibrations that manifest in sound. So we must decide what to listen to. But many of us aren&#39;t listening, and that dampens our abilities and undermines our relationships.</p><h4> “Leadership = Listenership”</h4><p> That caption is cheesy and off-brand, but it&#39;s late here. As a younger founder/CEO, I believed leadership was getting a quick take on a situation, pondering it for several seconds, and then expectorating a confident opinion. Like a fraternity brother who owns his vomiting, with the bravado of a middleweight holding up the belt awarded for giving another boxer early-onset Parkinson&#39;s. Leadership, for me, was rallying troops into battle. Except I hadn&#39;t thought through the strategy and wasn&#39;t even sure who or where the enemy was.</p><p> All that mattered was inspiring action aligned with my (emphasis on “my”) view. Lately I&#39;ve been seeing these TikTok videos (I think the CCP is boosting them to show how stupid we are) where an American family lights a pyrotechnic that becomes an out-of-control hose, spraying fire. As a young leader, I was the firework, directionless and loud, demanding everyone&#39;s attention.</p><h4> Levi Strauss &amp; Co.</h4><p> I was 26 when I started my first company, a strategy firm called Prophet. Our first big client was Levi Strauss &amp; Co. I attended several board meetings, and what struck me, other than how opulent big company board meetings are, was the CEO and chairman mainly asked questions and listened. They weren&#39;t there to advocate or cajole … just to listen.</p><p> Around that time, I joined the Young Entrepreneurs Organization, where I was assigned a mentor. Mine was Bob Swanson, the founder and CEO of Genentech. He shadowed me for a day, not saying a word, just observing. At the end of the day, I prepared for a mix of professional therapy and a validation of my general awesomeness. He said, “You need to listen more,” and nothing else.</p><h4> Loyalty</h4><p> Good leaders are known for producing great results. And greatness is in the agency of others. A leader&#39;s opportunity to take the field with the all-star team is a function of retention — the loyalty of the most talented players, who have more opportunities to go somewhere else. Their loyalty is a function of the leader&#39;s appreciation, economic and psychic. Great leaders listen, then tangibly demonstrate they understand someone&#39;s unique needs. Some people want to manage others, some would like to work abroad, have more balance, or see their name in lights (be quoted in industry media), etc.</p><p> In Peter Drucker&#39;s <a href="https://hbr.org/2004/06/what-makes-an-effective-executive" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">classic article on executive leadership</a> , he lists eight critical practices, and the first two are questions to ask.

Social media is a contact sport in which “takes” are the game ball. It&#39;s taught us (incorrectly) that all our opinions matter. Worse, that everyone needs to hear and comment on them. (Pro tip: <a href="https://www.overthinkingit.com/2011/08/17/dance-with-dragons/3/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWords%20are%20wind%2C%E2%80%9D%20says,the%20streets%20of%20King's%20Landing." target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Words are wind</a> .) Do I really need to express my outrage, and do you really need to hear it?</p><p> Most humans suffer from a lack of impulse control, ignorance, and ignorance of our (wait for it) ignorance — and social media amplifies these flaws. Going public on an important/sensitive topic you have no domain expertise in is a transfer of value, a trade of reputation and unnecessary risk for ear-cleaner adverts. Justin Bieber&#39;s Instagram post “ <a href="https://x.com/SaeedDiCaprio/status/1712174510076522508?s=20" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Praying for Israel</a> ” lost some of its force when people noticed the background image of a destroyed city was a photograph of Gaza. Social media has not only elevated virtue signaling to pseudo-importance, it has weaponized it. People are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/12/israel-gaza-war-social-media-job-firings/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">losing their jobs</a> because they feel compelled to make “statements.”</p><p> The online obsession with “statements” in the aftermath of terrible events is the daily experience of social writ large. Twitter&#39;s basic structure is about speaking, not listening — the platform&#39;s formal innovation was that it made replies first-class citizens, equal to posts. Social gave everyone a voice, but it blocked our ear canals. The more complex or painful or shocking an event, the more it behooves us to “listen first, speak last.” But we don&#39;t. There&#39;s likes to be had, and if you&#39;re a semifamous DJ, your fans need to know what you think about Gaza. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215436" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-1.png" alt="" width="900" height="563" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-1.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-1-300x188.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-1-520x325.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-1-768x480.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-1-1536x960.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-1-1200x750.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> Posting your view on an issue not only reveals your position, but also cements it. You can inadvertently back yourself into a corner. I see this all the time — someone takes a position without thinking, just as part of the flow of the conversation; it&#39;s challenged; they defend it; and within minutes, that passing opinion becomes a central tenet of their being. This is part of our larger <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/persuasion-bias-and-choice/202009/using-the-need-consistency-create-greater-commitment" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">bias toward consistency</a> , our need to see our words and actions as coherent. Speaking hinders subsequent listening. Social media makes this worse, encouraging us to record our every passing thought, and then binding us to it, lest the Guardians of Gotcha come for us with “receipts.”</p><p> Speaking on a hair trigger also makes us more prone to misinformation. If you listen for support of your views rather than illumination or evolution, you&#39;re less discerning of sources and claims. Just as you can&#39;t breathe and eat at the same time, you can&#39;t listen when you&#39;re speaking.</p><p> To be clear, everyone has the right to speak. But before you decide to share your views on a charged topic with the 5 billion people on social media, ask yourself three questions: Do I have something to offer? Do I have a personal or professional connection? Is it worth the risk? If the answer to any of these is no, perhaps take a beat before speaking.</p><h4> First Wives Club and Parent Hack</h4><p> I was married to a wonderful woman — smart, nice, fun to be around … generally impressive. She was also in touch with her feelings, which I was not. She would regularly express something she was upset about. My response was to manage and deflect. It didn&#39;t matter what she felt or even how I felt, her comments were incoming missiles, to be shot down or diverted. This resulted in a relationship that was harmonious but increasingly distant. She wasn&#39;t in a relationship with me, but someone managing the relationship. The truth built up, and up, and then burst.</p><p> Listening alone makes <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/05/the-power-of-listening-in-helping-people-change" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">feedback more effective</a> and engenders loyalty. If I want to give my sons advice, what to tell them is the easy part — they&#39;re such dopes. There are only so many problems, and young people have more in common than they realize. It&#39;s getting them to listen that&#39;s the trick. The parent hack is to ask questions before we start preaching. As my dad says, communication is with the listener, and if you don&#39;t soften up their defenses with active listening, you&#39;ll never get to the beach.</p><h4> (Super) Power</h4><p> Listening is a gift. When people are in pain, in doubt, or struggling in any way, they may legitimately need to express themselves. For every celebrity village idiot who feels the need to express their ill-formed opinions on social media, thousands of people with an actual stake in events use platforms as an outlet for grief and rage. (But then the platforms feast off this pain and convert it into fodder for someone&#39;s else&#39;s take. And the wheel spins.)</p><p> The urge to express oneself when facing a dilemma or in pain is real. I communicate for a living, so I have to resist the need to take the floor and begin speaking in every situation. Something that helps is that, as I age, I&#39;m becoming more introverted, which (oddly) has strengthened my relationships. Today I&#39;m more prone to listen than to perform.</p><p> The delta between hearing and listening is attention, being present. This is difficult in the age of devices, but respect is what makes the other party feel heard. Sam Bankman-Fried would <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-league-of-legends-investor-pitch-meeting-2022-11" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">play video games</a> on Zoom calls, and our idolatry of innovators mistook this bug for a feature, a sign of his genius. No, he&#39;s not “thinking different.” He&#39;s just an asshole. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215435" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/List.png" alt="" width="1920" height="800" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/List.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/List-300x125.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/List-520x217.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/List-768x320.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/List-1536x640.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/List-1200x500.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><h4> Time &amp; Care</h4><p> When people seek advice, it often isn&#39;t advice they want, but someone to listen. A <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/07/what-great-listeners-actually-do" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">good listener</a> — someone who is present, who asks probing questions, who doesn&#39;t use the person&#39;s pain as a starting gun for them to speak — is a balm for anxiety. That&#39;s why a good listener makes a useful partner in problem-solving. Some of the best mentorship moments I&#39;ve experienced, on both sides, have been when the mentor doesn&#39;t offer advice, but expresses affection by focusing solely on you and what you are saying.</p><p> The best advice you can give is to listen, which is to tell that person that they matter. The most effective treatment for anybody&#39;s grief or anxiety is time and care. The former takes care of itself, and the latter can be achieved when we tell someone we love them, without words.

The automobile was transformative, not because of the cars but the suburban lifestyle they inspired. Global power was increasingly shaped by the flow of energy. And the manufacturing innovation required to wrap steel around four wheels and an engine at scale became central to the West&#39;s economy.</p><p> Today the media (including this newsletter) is obsessed with the changes wrought by artificial intelligence. In my view, it&#39;s an obsession caused by the collision of techno-narcissism and the idolatry of innovators. Our new gods, tech innovators, posit that they are the fathers of the singular point of leverage that will save or destroy humanity. “Now that my options have vested, I want to profess that I am such a fucking genius, I&#39;m now worried about my brilliance being unleashed. I&#39;m so awesome as to be dangerous, accidentally of course.”</p><p> Jesus Christ, get over yourself.</p><p> I believe there is another innovation that will also be transformative as its full impact and second-order effects play out. What GPT is to the media, GLP-1 will be to the real economy.</p><h4> GLP-1 >; GPT 4</h4><p> GLP-1 is an agonist, a hormone our bodies use for internal communication. Among other things, it triggers the pancreas to produce insulin, which brought it to the attention of diabetes researchers, who developed a synthetic form of GLP-1 called semaglutide. In 2017, Novo Nordisk brought semaglutide to market in the US, under the brand name Ozempic.</p><p> Note: My use of the word “agonist” in the previous paragraph was an attempt to appear more intellectually svelte. My use of the word “svelte” in the previous sentence is an attempt to sound prim. Using “prim,” more British. Trying, always trying … desperate for other people&#39;s affirmation. But I digress.</p><p> The scientists who developed semaglutide faced a problem when conducting their <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/obesity-drugs-researcher-interview-ozempic-wegovy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a> — if the dose was too high, patients taking the drug lost their appetite. Ozempic was formulated at a low enough dose to reduce this side effect. However, Novo Nordisk realized this was a feature, not a bug, and formulated a higher-dose class specifically for weight loss, Wegovy, approved in 2021.</p><p> Semaglutide will be followed by similar GLP-1 drugs, including <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2301972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retatrutide</a> and <a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-tirzepatide-achieved-157-weight-loss-adults-obesity-or" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tirzepatide</a> , both in trials from Eli Lilly. Studies with overweight patients show weight loss of <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15%</a> to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lilly-experimental-triple-g-obesity-drug-leads-242-weight-loss-trial-nejm-2023-06-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24%</a> of body weight. Both Wegovy and Ozempic are weekly injectables, which discourages some people, but now there&#39;s a pill version, Rybelsus. Whatever the label on the box, GLP-1 drugs make us feel fuller for longer and suppress hunger cravings. In sum: the most effective weight loss drugs to-date.</p><h4> Hungry Market</h4><p> The market for this product, and the potential for meaningful societal change, are massive. In America, 70% of people are obese or overweight. There isn&#39;t anything that over two-thirds of America is. (Only <a href="https://www.nj.com/entertainment/2019/04/game-of-thrones-mania-reigns-supreme-as-poll-says-30-of-americans-will-watch-premiere-heres-the-character-nj-is-talking-about-the-most.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30% of Americans</a> watched the last season premiere of <em>Game of Thrones</em> .) More than <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">42% of US adults are obese</a> , up from 31% in 1991. Globally, the prevalence of obesity has <a href="https://www.worldobesity.org/about/about-obesity/prevalence-of-obesity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tripled</a> since 1975, and 800 million people, including 50 million children, are now obese. People with limited access to healthy food or bad genetic luck with their body chemistry are preyed upon by one of the most well-oiled marketing and distribution engines ever built: the industrial food complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/KW9cuta7mdE?si=q_acTwEAnfG_bUTo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They&#39;d like to teach the world to sing</a> , in perfect harmony with addiction and diabetes.</p><p> Obesity is not a form of personal expression or finding one&#39;s “truth,” it&#39;s a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6179496/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disease</a> that invites illness and disability, including coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, gallbladder disease, and Type 2 diabetes. Globally, obesity is the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/obesity-health-consequences-of-being-overweight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fifth-largest</a> cause of premature death. Our health-care system suffers from many problems, and the chaser to many/most of them is obesity. According to The Milken Institute the direct and indirect costs of obesity total $1.7 trillion, or 7% of US GDP. A 15% reduction in body weight would move <a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230816/Study-93-million-US-adults-may-benefit-from-semaglutide-medication.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">43 million Americans</a> out of the obese column. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215430" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-03.png" alt="" width="900" height="539" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-03.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-03-300x180.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-03-520x311.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-03-768x460.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-03-1536x920.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-03-1200x719.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> In the fourth quarter of 2022, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/ozempic-drug-users-are-buying-less-food-walmart-says-rcna119000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9 million prescriptions</a> for GLP-1 drugs were written in the US Over the past two years the share of health-care patients in the US using semaglutide has tripled to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/27/health/semaglutide-equitable-access/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.7%</a> .

I believe even that understates the economic opportunity for Novo Nordisk (and, eventually, other GLP-1 drugmakers), as the numbers understate the demand. In the past 24 hours I have spoken to three people, whom I wouldn&#39;t describe as being overweight, much less obese, who are on Ozempic to lose that last stubborn 15 pounds. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215429" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/line-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="548" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/line-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/line-chart-300x183.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/line-chart-520x317.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/line-chart-768x468.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/line-chart-1536x936.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/line-chart-1200x731.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> What happens when millions of people start taking a drug with a limited track record? The FDA (and foreign) approval processes are robust. The average FDA approval involves six different studies in four phases over 10 to 15 years. But they&#39;re not perfect. Long-term and widespread use of a compound can <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/new-drugs-found-cause-side-effects-years-after-approval-n757526" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surface side effects</a> invisible in trials. The FDA approved a diabetes drug with a different mechanism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosiglitazone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rosiglitazone</a> (branded as Vandia), in 1999, but it has subsequently been associated with an increased risk of heart failure, and many countries have pulled it from the market. GLP-1 drugs are already associated with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ozempic-wegovy-linked-severe-medical-conditions-stomach-problems-study-rcna118823" target="_blank" rel="noopener">severe stomach issues</a> in a small number of patients, and they may cause some people to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/weight-loss-drugs-muscle-loss-rcna84936" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lose lean muscle</a> .</p><h4> Obesity Economy</h4><p> The obesity economy is the iceberg below the surface of our $23 trillion consumer economy, and GLP-1 is the latest taste to inspire salivation across Wall Street&#39;s greed glands: Traders have been shorting restaurant stocks, putting <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/ozempic-risk-higher-rates-fuel-short-bets-on-restaurant-stocks-1.1982241" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly $1 billion</a> on the Do Not Pass line in just the last month. One analyst told CNBC that the revenue hit to the restaurant business could be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yncpi1sBdlQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$25 billion</a> by 2025.</p><p> The evidence? Morgan Stanley surveyed 300 Ozempic users, and 77% of them said they visit fast-food restaurants less often now that they&#39;re on the drug. Walmart is already <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/ozempic-drug-users-are-buying-less-food-walmart-says-rcna119000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeing a decline</a> in food purchases among people taking GLP-1 medications. These effects likely aren&#39;t yet visible in firms&#39; EPS as these drugs are limited in supply and a fraction of overweight people are taking them … so far. However, the stock market is a mechanism for trying to see around the corner, and the decline in share values across the obesity industrial complex will front-run the impact.</p><p> Fast food gets hit first, but fast casual is also under threat. Look for snack foods, frozen meals, candy, soda, and baked goods to all take a hit. Among GLP-1 users, 58% report they ate four or more snacks per day before taking the drug, and 90% say snacking decreased while they were on it. In any category, profits are driven by a minority of customers. And these products&#39; best customers are becoming Novo Nordisk&#39;s newest. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215427" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="647" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart-300x216.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart-520x374.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart-768x552.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart-1536x1104.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart-1200x863.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Food sales are an obvious target, but the effects of lower obesity rates will inspire other aftershocks, some greater in magnitude than that felt at the food epicenter. One interesting knock-on effect: it&#39;s</span> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ozempic-wegovy-weight-loss-drugs-airlines-fuel-costs-savings-2023-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that United Airlines would save $80 million a year in fuel costs if its customers lost an average of 10 pounds. Sports and fitness will be restructured: Gyms, built on a consumer base trying to lose weight, will see lower revenue, whereas sports for which fitness is a prerequisite (skiing, mountain biking, climbing) stand to benefit.</span></p><p> Apparel likely sees a short-term bump, as people splurge on clothes to fit their remodeled bodies, but the longer-term outlook is harder to predict: Less yo-yo dieting means some people won&#39;t need separate wardrobes to accommodate different selves, but formerly overweight people spending less money on food might allocate that cash to clothing. Where else could that extra food budget go? Discretionary spending increases will spread through every non-caloric category. Could this help reverse trends around loneliness and declining birth-rates as people feel better about themselves and are increasingly ready to mingle?</p><h4> <em>Craving</em> Economy</h4><p> If that&#39;s all these drugs did, they&#39;d still be a first-ballot hall of fame medical breakthrough. But this may be just the beginning. The <em>Washington Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/09/01/ozempic-cuts-alcohol-cravings-liquor-beer-and-wine-companies-aren-t-ready/6a7621b0-48b5-11ee-b76b-0b6e5e92090d_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> : “For some, these new weight loss drugs also seem to dampen the rewards of addictive substances, whether that&#39;s nicotine, opioids or alcohol.” Let that sink in. It&#39;s possible GLP-1 drugs are not weight loss drugs, but <strong>anti-craving drugs.</strong></p><p> In <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/05/ozempic-addictive-behavior-drinking-smoking/674098/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lab tests</a> , mice on an earlier form of synthetic GLP-1 receive a lower dopamine hit from alcohol. Rats are less interested in cocaine. Monkeys with a demonstrated preference for booze drank less. Anecdotal evidence from human users includes reports of reduced nail biting, shopping, and smoking.</p><p> If you scroll back through previous issues of this newsletter, you&#39;ll find a recurring theme: societal ills resulting from cravings. From <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/a-unifying-theory-of-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meme stocks</a> and <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/robinhood-and-iaddiction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood</a> to <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/tiktok-trojan-stallion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok addiction</a> and <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/overhauling-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter enragement</a> , to <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/threats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obesity</a> itself, human weakness subjugated to our brain&#39;s reward circuitry is no less a threat to our well-being than climate change, authoritarianism, or cancer. According to Harvard&#39;s Grant Study on happiness, the factor most commonly present in the least-happy cohort was alcohol. It&#39;s that fundamental.</p><p> A drug that rewires these reward circuits could be an epochal step in human evolution. And why not? We&#39;ve compensated for evolution in many other ways, from the protection of clothing to the assistance of eyeglasses to the power of wheeled transport. Perhaps we&#39;ve reached the point where a salt/fat/dopa drive, evolved on the savannah of scarcity, can give way to a motivational superstructure suited for our era of superabundance. GLP-1 innovation may be scaffolding for instincts in need of updating.</p><h4> Portion Sizes</h4><p> Large health-care insurance companies and providers, starting with the US Government, should make delivering GLP-1 drugs a priority (instead of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/09/wegovy-heart-health-data-insurance-hurdles-costs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulling back</a> , as the short-sighted insurance industry has done). Globally, the WHO and national health organizations could do the same. You can get Ozempic over the counter in five Emirates in the Gulf. And Americans are venturing to Mexico and Canada where cost is (spoiler alert) a fraction of what it is in the US Government funding will test the fulcrum between the obesity industrial complex (food, pharmaceutical, and hospital networks) and long-term economic thinking, because these drugs will register an enormous ROI for society as health-care costs decline and mental health improves. Depression rates among obese children <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-1498-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are double</a> those of average-weight kids and can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2568994/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haunt them in adulthood</a> . A 5% reduction in weight can cut an obese person&#39;s medical costs by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4486410/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2,000</a> per year, and it&#39;s estimated that a full transition from obese to a healthy weight saves <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2017/weight-loss-for-adults-at-any-age-leads-to-cost--savings-study-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly $30,000</a> in direct medical costs and productivity.</p><p> Fun fact: My digital twin ( <a href="https://profg.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProfG.AI</a> ) believes “obesity drugs, while important for public health, are more of a niche solution.” It&#39;s obvious he disagrees with me as he&#39;s jealous I got to go to Chiltern Firehouse (in person) last night. Anyway, the potential to calibrate the drug for specific addictions is mind-blowing. One can envision similar hormone-mimicking drugs that could be engineered to address addictions to money, affirmation from strangers, short-form videos of chiropractic care, WWII documentaries, Zacapa, edibles, smoked meats, or reading random theories about the universe. Because here&#39;s the thing — I&#39;m slim, but obese.</p><p> Life is so rich, </p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/nmnm_images/Scott-Signature-NMNM.png" /></p><p> PS This week on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/61S3wf20GKtjTau558hSHp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProfGPod</a> I spoke with CNN host and <em>Washington Post</em> columnist Fareed Zakaria on the conflict in Israel — <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/61S3wf20GKtjTau558hSHp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listen here</a> .</p><p> PPS Not getting the results you want from ChatGPT?

It&#39;s a head fake, as the deeper story goes ignored. The traditional IPO construct is in structural decline, and that&#39;s a symptom of a fundamental shift in the capital markets. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215421" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="548" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-300x183.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-520x317.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-768x468.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-1536x936.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-1200x731.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> 4 IPOs and a Funeral</h4><p> Blue Apron, the home-meal-kit delivery company, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/29/blue-apron-to-be-acquired-by-wonder-group-for-103-million.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold itself</a> to Wonder Group for $103 million. Which feels like a victory for a business that delivers cardboard boxes of chicken and kale to millennials until you realize this was its last stop on a tour that included an IPO at a valuation of $2 billion. (BTW, I <a href="https://youtu.be/llRHp5DBqIs?feature=shared&amp;t=86" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicted this</a> six years ago.)</p><p> Similarly, Instacart, which delivers chicken and kale to millennials in green plastic bags (innovation), <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/instacart-ipo-may-slash-value-160409601.html?guccounter=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went public</a> this month at $10 billion … following a 2021 private-round valuation of $39 billion. Since then the company has lost value almost every day, bumping against $7 billion as I write this. Consumer “tech” firms Rent the Runway and Allbirds are each down 96% from their IPOs. Warby Parker has outperformed, losing only three-quarters of its value.</p><p> This follows the June IPO of Cava (it asks millennials to leave the house for chicken and kale), which raised $700 million in private funding, went public, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/restaurant-chain-cava-valued-47-bln-shares-pop-debut-2023-06-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popped</a> to $4.7 billion, and then deflated to $3.5 billion. Oddity, a firm I invested in, priced at a $2 billion valuation, ran to $2.7 billion, and closed yesterday at $1.5 billion. Better Mortgage reached a private valuation of $6 billion in the private markets before its SPAC, and now trades at a valuation of $123 million. I&#39;m not immune. I invested in Better at a valuation of $600 million and haven&#39;t sold a share because my SPAC is “different.”</p><p> And these IPOs are, relatively speaking, wins. But wait — isn&#39;t the market up? Yes, but like college rankings, the indices are a weapon of mass distraction: 70% of the gains have come from just seven stocks. BTW, OpenAI is raising funds at a $90 billion valuation — a threefold increase from earlier this year. It has real revenue and explosive growth. When will it go public? A: When existing shareholders believe there is no additional upside.</p><h4> WTF Happened?</h4><p> Simple, really. When capital piles in returns go down, and private market investors want to capture the upside previously leaked to public investors. Charismatic promoters weaponized CNBC and social media, more hungry for entertainment than news, FOMO infected the masses, and MBS pivoted from terrorism to capitalism creating a torrent of capital to be deployed.</p><p> VC firms, who posted remarkable returns the first two decades of the millennium, needed a home with a backyard big enough to absorb billions in fresh capital. Tens of billions piled into pre-IPO growth firms. Never underestimate the market&#39;s ability to create a product when consumers have cash in hand. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215417" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3-charts.png" alt="" width="900" height="346" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3-charts.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3-charts-300x115.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3-charts-520x200.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3-charts-768x295.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3-charts-1536x590.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3-charts-1200x461.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> The Shift</h4><p> Does this mean there&#39;s something rotten at the heart of the capital markets? Yes, but not what it seems. The problem isn&#39;t that IPOs have become a pump and dump scheme (often they are). The problem is that they <em>don&#39;t matter</em> . The center of gravity is shifting from public to private capital. The change has been incremental, so it doesn&#39;t get much media attention. But market trends are similar to kids: If you aren&#39;t with them every day the changes feel implausible when you finally see them. In this case, however, Grandma would remark, “I can&#39;t believe how much you&#39;ve shrunk!” If the shift continues, expect an ever-greater concentration of capital and power in fewer hands, and depressed economic returns available to the “P” in IPO.</p><h4> Structural Decline of the IPO</h4><p> When I was a 22-year-old analyst at Morgan Stanley in the 1980s, good companies went public when they wanted to raise capital and provide liquidity to investors and employees, in that order. In 2002 I participated in the Nasdaq bell-ringing ceremony for Red Envelope, a firm I&#39;d founded five years earlier. The feeling was, to that point, singular — I&#39;d made it. I was at the helm of the bobsled of capitalism and would be financially secure the rest of my life. Dudes would want to be my friend, and women would want to sleep with me. Such an awesome bell. Spoiler alert: none of that happened. Maybe some new friends.</p><p> It&#39;s been gradual, but that bell no longer rings true. The product it introduces brightens up a room by leaving it, as returns are concentrated among a few outsized winners. Companies are waiting longer to go public and issuing fewer shares with no real voting power. And many, perhaps most, of them offer little upside to their new owners.</p><p> In 1980, 9 out of 10 tech IPOs were profitable. In 2021, it was 1 in 5. Among all venture-backed companies, in 1980, 78% were profitable; in 2021, 10%. Among the 13 VC-backed companies that went public in 2022, <a href="https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/IPO-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>not one</em></a> was profitable. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215422" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="459" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-300x153.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-520x265.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-768x392.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-1536x784.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-1200x613.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> Deepest Pockets</h4><p> The rise of the unprofitable IPO isn&#39;t a matter of companies going public earlier in their growth cycle. On the contrary, many of them are massive and raise huge amounts of capital before they go public. Just 10 years ago, when venture capitalist Aileen Lee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/02/welcome-to-the-unicorn-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coined the term</a> “unicorn” to refer to a private company with a valuation over $1 billion, she was able to identify just 39 of them. Today there are <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,221</a> .</p><p> Growth, tax avoidance, bailouts, debt-fueled spending orgies, and the weaponization of governments that pass laws to privatize gains and socialize losses have formed chunks of private wealth the size of Ayers Rock. Public capital was once the hypermatter for the jump to lightspeed, but no more. Sovereign wealth funds including ADIA and PIF, mega venture funds Softbank, Sequoia, and Andreessen Horowitz, wealthy individuals, and corporations now deploy <em><a href="https://a16z.com/9b-to-build-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billions</a></em> where their predecessors could only write checks for millions. They have no choice but to make investments in $100 million+ chunks as you can&#39;t put $10 billion to work $10 million at a time.</p><p> In 2007, Microsoft&#39;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/25/technology/25facebook.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$240 million investment</a> in Facebook at a $15 billion valuation was deemed “astronomical.” Google raised just $26 million before it went public; Netflix, $102 million. Tesla, in a capital-intensive business, raised less than $200 million in equity and another $500 million in debt before its IPO. Fast-forward to today: Six distinct VC investments of $100 million+ closed <em><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/biggest-us-vc-startup-funding-deals-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week</a></em> . Elon&#39;s other company, SpaceX, has raised $9.4 billion across several rounds … and remains private.</p><h4> Private Capture</h4><p> With great wealth comes great opportunity. Historically, a company could be expected to grow long past its IPO, and the resulting share gains were available to anyone with a Schwab account and the foresight to buy in early. Google provided investors a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MBB-25772" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30% annual return</a> for the first decade post-IPO, Facebook, <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/27473/facebook-stock-price-since-its-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19%</a> . If you invested $1,000 in Apple at its IPO in 1980, it would be worth $1.75 million today.</p><p> But if you don&#39;t need the public markets for capital, why give up those gains to the unwashed masses? You don&#39;t,unless it&#39;s the latter stage of a pump and dump. Uber <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111015/story-uber.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $10 billion</a> in private capital, most of it from Softbank and the Kingdom, before going public in 2019 at a valuation of $82.4 billion. Four years later, public shareholders have earned a 3.5% annual return. Blue Apron raised $135 million privately before its IPO — more than Netflix and Google combined.</p><p> Companies going public today aren&#39;t necessarily bad businesses. Airbnb is a great company, one of my largest holdings, but it&#39;s been a far better investment for its private backers than people in the public markets — three years after its IPO, it trades below its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/10/airbnb-ipo-abnb-starts-trading-on-the-nasdaq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first trade</a> , when public-market investors could purchase stock. Private investors who don&#39;t need the public markets to fuel growth anymore are holding on to companies longer, squeezing all the juice before tossing husks to the masses.</p><h4> Table Scraps</h4><p> So why go public at all? Like winemakers getting one last press from flattened grapes for their bargain label, private capital providers have one more trick up their sleeve, and it&#39;s part of the story of the decline of the IPO.</p><p> “Initial Public Offering” is a misnomer, because rarely are shares sold initially to the <em>public</em> . Instead, bankers sell them to a group of buyers made up of the bank&#39;s favored institutional customers. The first day “pop” is the difference between what those buyers pay the company (the “offering price”) for their shares, and what they can sell the shares for on the first day of trading. Access to IPO shares at the offering price is a reward to the institutional clients of investment banks who generate fees elsewhere (ie, not you). To reward their clients and set a positive tone for the stock, the banks want a first-day pop. This isn&#39;t new, and there&#39;s long been tension between these banks and the companies, who see the pop as money left on the table. What&#39;s changed is the machinations used to generate the pop and how swiftly it dissipates.</p><p> One secret is tiny floats. In 1980 the median float at IPO — that is, the percentage of the company offered to the public — was 29% of the total shares. In 2022 that number was <a href="https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/IPO-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15%</a> , the lowest in four decades. In an efficient market, float shouldn&#39;t affect price, but if you can turn the hype machine up high enough and squeeze supply, you have the Lost Ark of marketing: artificial scarcity. Instacart offered only 8% of its total shares to the public when it IPO&#39;d a few weeks ago. The story led the financial press for the day, and the stock gained 12% on its first day of trading. Airbnb offered just 7.5% of its shares to the public, and the stock more than doubled at the opening bell. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215420" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-02.png" alt="" width="900" height="539" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-02.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-02-300x180.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-02-520x311.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-02-768x460.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-02-1536x920.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-02-1200x719.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> Decarceration</h4><p> Historically, a short-term pop was less valuable, because insiders were subject to lockups, typically for 180 days, before they could sell their shares. However, that too is changing. In 2021, 25% of IPOs featured shorter lockup agreements that allowed insiders to sell before the 180 days were up — that share was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/13024bb1-8a46-4a87-979e-6a18a00a11e7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the highest</a> on record. Of that group, two-thirds were tech companies (shocker). Direct listings (which skip the banker-institution pipeline) are promoted as a more democratic alternative to IPOs with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/10/02/direct-listing-is-a-more-elegant-approach-bill-gurley.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“open and equal access for all”</a> and are <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/direct-listings-vs-ipo-paths-to-going-public-51638305261" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasing</a> in popularity. To be clear, a direct listing has less to do with access, and more to do with dumping as there are no lockup requirements.</p><p> The other benefit of a small float is it allows insiders to retain more control. That goes hand in hand with the increase in dual-class share structures. These provisions grant insiders special shares that have 10 times the voting power. Founders love this because it allows them to decouple risk from control. In 2021, <a href="https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/IPO-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24%</a> of IPOs had dual-class share structures, up from 2% in 1980. Among tech companies, that number was 46%. Robinhood&#39;s mission is to “democratize investing” — unless you invest in Robinhood, where the founders own 16% of the company but control 66% of the voting shares. The founders haven&#39;t democratized investing, they&#39;ve autocratized it. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215418" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart-.png" alt="" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart-.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart--300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart--520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart--768x432.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart--1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart--1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> Private Liquidity</h4><p> The second motivation for an IPO is creating liquidity for early investors and employees. But public ownership is no longer the only way to create liquidity. Investors are increasingly able to unload some of their stock in the private markets. OpenAI is in talks to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-seeks-valuation-up-90-bln-sale-existing-shares-wsj-2023-09-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sell existing shares</a> at a healthy valuation. eToro recently sold <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/israels-etoro-agrees-120-mln-secondary-share-sale-source-2023-07-31/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$120 million</a> . And in the first half of last year, while the IPO market was frozen over, private equity firms sold $57 billion in secondary shares — a <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/secondaries-2023-PE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record high</a> .</p><h4> In the VIP</h4><p> With no need for public-market financing, and more options for finding liquidity, private investors will continue to fund a company until the firm arrives at one of two stations: The company is strong but mature and the returns from its growth phase are fully harvested, or its model is suspect and existing shareholders need to deploy a series of false signals to greater fools so they can fling feces at tourists to the unicorn zoo.</p><p> And while private capital investors (aka the very rich) reap the gains, public investors (aka everyone else) have scant access to the markets where real wealth is created. As capital concentrates, so does power. The “shareholder class” has always been elite. But, at one time, it reached down to the merely affluent and then, through pension and retirement funds, to the masses — diffusing influence, and strengthening democracy. Public ownership&#39;s transparency requirements are preventive against collusion, graft, and a steady march toward a dynastic society.</p><p> Instead we have bailouts of the rich, tech firms who capture trillions building a thick layer of innovation on top of public investments while decreasing R&amp;D and paying less taxes, and an idolatry of innovators who, despite being absent fathers or just shitty investors, continue to capture our affection and capital.</p><h4> What to Do?</h4><p> Disavow yourself of the notion that you, or anybody else, knows how to pick stocks. Invest in low-cost ETF and index funds. Also, just because someone has chunky glasses, is on CNBC a lot, or made a lucky investment in the Amazon of China, does not mean they know what they&#39;re doing. In fact, they may be lousy fiduciaries for your capital. Actually, that&#39;s not accurate. <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/05/the-rise-and-fall-of-cathie-wood.html#:~:text=Wood%E2%80%99s%20returns%2C%20Morningstar%20wrote%2C%20had%20been%20%E2%80%9Cwretched%2C%E2%80%9D%20making,likely%20to%20%E2%80%9Churt%E2%80%9D%20investors%2C%20according%20to%20the%20analysis." target="_blank" rel="noopener">They</a> have been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-12/how-much-money-is-masa-son-losing-because-of-the-vision-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">horrible</a> fiduciaries for other people&#39;s capital. Warren Buffett says the markets are a vehicle for transferring wealth from the impatient to the patient.

I received a lot of “feedback” (“I hope you die,” etc.). Good stuff. So here we are. Headlines universally lauding the <a href="https://collider.com/wga-agreement-details/#:~:text=The%20Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20has%20ended%20their,better%20residuals%2C%20accurate%20streaming%20data%2C%20and%20health%20insurance." target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">“historic deal”</a> and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2023-09-25/column-sag-aftra-strike-writers-victory-humans-over-ai" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">“victory of human over AI.”</a></p><h4> Unexceptional</h4><p> The WGA is claiming victory as it has no choice. (Imagine declaring defeat after subjecting your constituents to five months of no pay.) So let&#39;s put the ketamine down and acknowledge this is no victory.</p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The key issue in this debate was money. Specifically, the writers wanted more of it. Adjusted for inflation, the average writer-producer salary has</span> <a href="https://www.wgacontract2023.org/updates/bulletins/writers-are-not-keeping-up" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declined 23%</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in the past decade. Last year, when prices rose as much as 8%, TV writers received a nominal pay increase of 2.25%.</span> </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215407" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-increase-pay.png" alt="" width="900" height="494" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-increase-pay.png 8001w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-increase-pay-300x165.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-increase-pay-520x285.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-increase-pay-768x421.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-increase-pay-1536x843.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-increase-pay-2048x1124.png 2048w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-increase-pay-1200x658.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> So the WGA made a reasonable demand: a 6% pay bump. But last year, prices rose (I repeat) 8%. In other words, the WGA arrived at the negotiating table demanding a decline in purchasing power. And then … didn&#39;t get what they asked for — <a href="https://www.wgacontract2023.org/the-campaign/summary-of-the-2023-wga-mba#:~:text=Most%20MBA%20minimums%20will%20increase%20by%205%25%20on,the%20result%20of%20patterns%20established%20in%20the%20industry." target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">they settled for 5%</a> . Meanwhile the striking UAW have <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uaw-rejects-stellantis-21-pay-141135050.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">rejected an offer</a> of a 20% increase, and asked for 40%.</p><p> To be fair, the deal includes pay escalations of 4% and 3.5% in years two and three, respectively. However, to keep up with inflation over the past three years (since the last contract was struck), the writers would have needed a <a href="https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/wga-contract-inflation-minimums-1235564920/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">10% increase</a> in year one. The new deal also includes an increased contribution to health and pension benefits of 1% and overseas royalty payments that, from my vantage, are purposefully opaque and wordy enough to give members enough psilocybin to hallucinate that there&#39;s a there there.</p><p> The already ugly math gets hideous when you factor in the five months in which the writers, as a function of the strike, registered a 100% reduction in pay. For a three-year union contract to compensate for those losses, you would need to increase writer pay (again) by 14%. That’s <em>in addition</em> to the inflation losses. So the minimum increase the writers need to <em>not lose</em> purchasing power is 24%.</p><p> My favorite jazz hands in the agreement is writers get a 50% royalty bump if their show is viewed by 20% of the platform&#39;s subscribers. Yes, and I&#39;m giving my employees a 50% bonus every time the Jets win the Super Bowl. Sure, it&#39;s happened … just not that often. The series finale of <em>Succession</em> registered <a href="https://clutchpoints.com/succession-news-series-finale-draws-record-viewership" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">three million</a> viewers, ie, 6% of HBO&#39;s 50 million subscribers.</p><h4> The Good Stuff</h4><p> The WGA did secure a couple meaningful gains. As in two. First, there is now a minimum staffing requirement for writers rooms, which translates to more employment opportunities for young writers. Second, they&#39;ve raised the minimum number of weeks studios must employ writers for shows. In other words, work lasts longer. These concessions are meaningful and reflect well on the guild&#39;s commitment to investing in the craft and nurturing talent.</p><h4> Follow the Mouse</h4><p> This whole process, however, was a distraction from what the writers, actors, and all workers in the creative community should be focused on. Henry Kissinger once said of my industry: “The reason that university politics is so vicious is because stakes are so small.” The same holds true in media.</p><p> Last week I spoke with a group of Hollywood executives and writers. (I&#39;m trying TV for the <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/film-credits/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">sixth time</a> .) They were concerned about the strikes — but <em>more</em> concerned that their stalwart, the House of the Mouse, has transformed into a distressed asset practically overnight. Disney stock is at a nine-year low. Subscriber losses continue to mount, with a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/09/disney-dis-earnings-report-q3-2023.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">7.4% decline</a> in Disney+ subscriptions in the most recent quarter. Operating profits from the cable assets have been halved, and the company&#39;s operating margins are down 75%.</p><p> It&#39;s not just Disney. Revenues are falling at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/03/warner-bros-discovery-wbd-earnings-q3-2022.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Warner Bros. Discovery</a> , <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/comcast-cmcsa-earnings-q3-2022.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Comcast</a> , and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/02/paramount-global-para-earnings-tv-revenue-falls-.html#:~:text=Paramount%20Global%20reported%20%246.92%20billion%20in%20third-quarter%20revenue%2C,million%20subscribers%2C%20and%20overall%20direct-to-consumer%20revenue%20rose%2038%25." target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Paramount</a> . Last month, cable and broadcast <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/15/media/cable-broadcast-tv-decline-nielsen-report/index.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">fell below 50%</a> of total TV viewing for the first time in history. Meanwhile, the industry is becoming increasingly reliant on a ventilator of recycled content. <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/frenemies/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">All 10</a> of the highest-grossing movies from last year were repurposed from existing IP. Pixar&#39;s biggest movie was <em>Lightyear</em> (the sixth installment of the Toy Story franchise), and the hot news in TV this week is Greg Daniels has <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/09/the-office-reboot.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">a new show</a> called <em>The Office</em> . Ie, a reboot of the reboot. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215408" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-stock.png" alt="" width="900" height="465" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-stock.png 8001w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-stock-300x155.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-stock-520x268.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-stock-768x397.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-stock-1536x793.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-stock-2048x1057.png 2048w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-stock-1200x620.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The writers can keep fighting for a larger slice of the pie, but the pie gets smaller every day. The WGA will have 15 milliseconds of fame before it starts digging through the rubble searching for remnants of its industry. The question they should ask themselves: What would a “meaningful gain” actually look like, and how do we achieve this? Is it really a 6% pay bump? More transparent residuals? A staffing minimum for writers rooms, striking against impaired companies? To achieve a truly exceptional outcome, the writers, the studios, the executives — everyone in Hollywood must do one thing: Think bigger.</span></p><h4> Falsely Convicted</h4><p> Fixing the problem means first identifying it. The adversary isn&#39;t a Hollywood executive in a cashmere sweater; it&#39;s a 17-year-old kid in a basement scrolling TikTok. The rise of social media is directly correlated with the decline of traditional media. TikTok now commands <a href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/tiktok-statistics/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">95 minutes</a> of user attention per day, equivalent to four and a half episodes of <em>The Office</em> . More than 200 billion Facebook and Instagram Reels are played <em>every day</em> — up 50% in less than one year. YouTube, a subsidiary app owned by Google, now rakes in as much revenue as Netflix. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215409" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-revenue.png" alt="" width="900" height="466" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-revenue.png 8001w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-revenue-300x155.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-revenue-520x269.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-revenue-768x398.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-revenue-1536x796.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-revenue-2048x1061.png 2048w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-revenue-1200x622.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> The ad dollars <em>Hannah Montana</em> used to generate have not been shoplifted by Bob Iger, but Silicon Valley and Beijing. When queried whether they&#39;d prefer TikTok vs. all streaming media, two-thirds of people under the age of 25 <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-tiktok-has-taken-over-media-industry-stats-2022-12" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">choose TikTok</a> . There are between 300 million and 400 million creators on TikTok — their compensation is approximately $40 for every million views. None have ever threatened a strike. The result? A: The company&#39;s <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3193027/tiktok-owner-bytedance-sees-valuation-drop-quarter-us300-billion" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">valuation</a> is roughly equal to Disney and Netflix combined.</p><p> It&#39;s also no coincidence that the year of the writers&#39; strike is also the year of AI. AI was a core issue in the dispute. The writers (rightly) fear it could replace them and demanded the studios not use AI — which the studios (also rightly) declined. Instead, they <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/hollywood-studios-can-train-ai-models-on-writers-work-under-tentative-deal-aedae589?mod=hp_lead_pos2" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">met halfway</a> : The studios <em>can</em> use AI, but the original writers must receive credit and compensation. This reflects a misunderstanding of AI. It&#39;s not AI who will take your job, but a writer who leverages it.</p><h4> Pennies vs. Benjamins</h4><p> The industry is quarreling over pennies, instead of pursuing Benjamins. More market value in the Nasdaq was created in the first half of this year than in any six-month period in history. The catalyst was AI. The day Microsoft announced it was incorporating AI into its Office suite, it <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/microsoft-stock-price-copilot-ai-office-365-monthly-subscription-msft-2023-7" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">added</a> the value of Disney. The day Morgan Stanley praised Tesla&#39;s Dojo supercomputer, Tesla <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-soars-10-morgan-stanley-011206318.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">added</a> the value of BMW. Meta&#39;s new AI-powered recommendation algorithm drove a 24% increase in Instagram use this year. AI has inspired a tsunami of shareholder value: In 2023 alone, Google, Meta, Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon have registered a combined increase of $3.2 trillion.</p><p> Compare that to traditional media: The combined market cap of Comcast, Netflix, Disney, Warner Bros., Paramount, Fox Corp., and News Corp. is less than $600 billion. Think about that. The value gained by six tech firms this year is nearly six times greater than the current value of the seven largest mass-media companies put together. Hollywood needs to put down the slingshot, and go big-game hunting. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215411" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-market-cap-2.png" alt="" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-market-cap-2.png 8001w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-market-cap-2-300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-market-cap-2-520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-market-cap-2-768x432.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-market-cap-2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-market-cap-2-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-market-cap-2-1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> The Rapture, Pt. 2</h4><p> As I&#39;ve <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/welfare-queens/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">written before</a> , the fastest way to build wealth is to monetize infrastructure others built for free. Amazon built a thick layer of innovation on top of a free enterprise plug-in called the US postal system. Tesla leveraged green government tax credits to build an EV empire. Google struck the rare earth mineral that is user-generated data, mined it relentlessly at zero extraction cost, and placed banner ads on top of it.</p><p> AI is the resurrection of this business model, and the fuel is original content. Yesterday I discovered <a href="https://www.threads.net/@profgalloway/post/CxqiBCXIpKS" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">two of my books</a> , <em>The Algebra of Happiness</em> and <em>The Four</em> , have been used (without my approval) to feed generative AI. I have not been credited or paid. I&#39;m not alone. Last week, writers John Grisham, Jodi Picoult, and George RR Martin <a href="https://apnews.com/article/openai-lawsuit-authors-grisham-george-rr-martin-37f9073ab67ab25b7e6b2975b2a63bfe" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">sued OpenAI</a> for stealing their IP to train its algorithm. Before that, a group of artists <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/class-action-lawsuit-ai-generators-deviantart-midjourney-stable-diffusion-2246770" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">sued Stability AI</a> for using their content to generate AI art. So did <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/getty-images-lawsuit-says-stability-ai-misused-photos-train-ai-2023-02-06/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Getty Images</a> . I used to think tech companies loved user-generated content because most user-generated content isn&#39;t protected by copyright law. (How many TikTokers are claiming IP rights on “day in the life” videos?) But now tech companies are taking it a step further. Now they&#39;re harvesting content that <em>is</em> protected.</p><p> There is slow, if not steady, progress on this front. I also discovered I am a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23963237-authors-v-openai?responsive=1&amp;title=1" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">class member in a suit that includes</a> all copyright holders whose work has been used in training. That Grisham suit is also a class action, but the class is fiction writers. To date, Big Tech has been hiding behind a complex generative AI algorithm too sophisticated for mere mortals to attribute credit for distinct IP.</p><p> These and future suits are important, really important. Hollywood won&#39;t fall because Bob Iger or David Zaslav are greedy. It will fall because Silicon Valley stole the only asset that can truly differentiate generative AI: other people&#39;s content.</p><h4> What to Do</h4><p> When I was on the board of The New York Times Company, two thirds of revenue came from ads. During the print days, it worked — we had strong control over distribution and could price ads on terms that made sense for the business. Then Google offered us what looked like a good deal: Let us crawl your content, and we&#39;ll drive traffic to your website in return. More ad views, great right? Spoiler alert: not great. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215412" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-nyt-rev.png" alt="" width="900" height="472" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-nyt-rev.png 8001w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-nyt-rev-300x157.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-nyt-rev-520x272.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-nyt-rev-768x402.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-nyt-rev-1536x805.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-nyt-rev-2048x1073.png 2048w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-nyt-rev-1200x629.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> So while Larry and Sergey were capturing our ad dollars, I proposed we form a consortium (NYT, News Corp, Condé Nast, Hearst, etc.) to block Google&#39;s crawlers and have an auction for the license to our content. I believed Google and a somewhat relevant Bing (see above: 2008) would have paid billions. The board said no, and we missed the chance to upend the business model, to put creators — journalists, editors, artists — in the position of power, instead of the platforms. Soon enough, it was too late.</p><h4> Consortium</h4><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This is that moment again. A world-changing technology has emerged, and we have the chance to write the rules so that we (creators) can make money from it. Notice how quiet Big Tech leaders have been throughout this process. Why? Because they see dead people. In this case, dead people are Hollywood studios and the creative community removing their heads from their asses, binding together, and transforming their assets into potentially trillions of dollars of shareholder value.</span></p><p> To garner an increase in compensation that is legitimately “exceptional,” the writers and the studios/executives/actors/publishers/networks must band together. They should form a consortium, file suits demanding Big Tech and AI respect their IP, license this IP, and start valuing their work. And they should do it as soon as possible. I&#39;d suggest WME be charged with assembling the first 100 members and Barry Diller heads the new consortium. He knows everyone, understands the industry, is smart, and (most importantly) tech is scared of him. This would be infinitely more meaningful than the jazz hands of additional royalty payments for writers on <em>The Last of Us</em> .</p><p> Barely keeping up with inflation, minimum number of writers, 1% increases in pension contributions … Jesus Christ, think bigger.</p><p> Life is so rich, </p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/nmnm_images/Scott-Signature-NMNM.png" /></p><p> PS This week I had my friend Ian Bremmer back on <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/ProfGPod?sid=newsletter" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">the Prof G Pod</a> to discuss Ukraine, China, and AI — <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2B6148sQKPFsTVnB8nnCcB" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">listen here</a> .</p><p> PPS I&#39;ll be speaking with the “godfather of AI,” Dr. Yoshua Bengio, on the ethics of AI in November. <a href="https://www.sectionschool.com/events/live-events/the-ethics-of-ai-event?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=nmnm&amp;utm_campaign=yoshua&amp;utm_content=0928" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Sign up now</a> as spots will go fast.</p><p>这篇文章<a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/think-bigger/">“Think Bigger”</a>首先出现在<a href="https://www.profgalloway.com">“No Mercy / No Malice”</a>上。</p> ]]>;</content:encoded><wfw:commentrss> https://www.profgalloway.com/think-bigger/feed/</wfw:commentrss><slash:comments> 24</slash:comments></item><item><title>失去我的宗教</title><link/>https://www.profgalloway.com/losing-my-religion/<comments> https://www.profgalloway.com/losing-my-religion/#comments</comments><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Galloway]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 16:16:39 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.profgalloway.com/?p=215396 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p>过去一个世纪美国经历中最显着的变化是什么？互联网、公民权利、抗生素？从制造业经济向服务经济转型，还是快速城市化？我相信，最重要的是宗教从我们文化的中心以及取代它的位置中被取代。宗教[...]</p><p> <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/losing-my-religion/">《失去我的宗教》</a>一文首先出现在<a href="https://www.profgalloway.com">《无情/无恶意》</a>上。</p> ]]>; </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>过去一个世纪美国经历中最显着的变化是什么？互联网、公民权利、抗生素？从制造业经济向服务经济转型，还是快速城市化？我相信，最重要的是宗教从我们文化的中心以及取代它的位置中被取代。 Religions and religious institutions play key roles in society, practical and spiritual. Humans are meaning-makers, we&#39;re wired to imbue our actions with purpose. We will have gods, even if forced to make them of mortals … or machines.</p><h4> It Works (Sometimes)</h4><p> Religion is successful because it works. Participation in religious services is correlated with a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5665144/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">reduction in mortality</a> by a third, depression by 25%, and suicide rates by 3 to 6 times. Religion motivated the construction of cathedrals, pyramids, and temples that, set against space travel and pocket computers, still invoke awe. Here in the secularizing US, religious people are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2011/12/23/the-civic-and-community-engagement-of-religiously-active-americans/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">3 times as likely</a> to be active in community organizations and twice as likely to participate in local sports leagues. They&#39;re also <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/01/31/are-religious-people-happier-healthier-our-new-global-study-explores-this-question/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">44% more likely</a> to vote and 44% more likely to describe themselves as “very happy.” </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215398" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/religous.png" alt="" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/religous.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/religous-300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/religous-520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/religous-768x432.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/religous-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/religous-1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> Yeah, But…</h4><p> Much of religious experience has been insular, hostile to change, riven with corruption and abuse of power. The previous sentence may be the mother of all understatements. The Land of the Free was born of a violent theocracy: Contrary to what you likely learned in grade school, the earliest English settlers wasted little time before<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinomian_Controversy" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">exiling</a> anyone who differed on the fine points of biblical interpretation. <a href="https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/religion-colonial-america-trends-regulations-beliefs" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Eight of the original thirteen</a> colonies had official state churches and persecuted heresy.</p><p> From 1300 to 1600, European towns executed tens of thousands of their own people, mostly women, on accusations of witchcraft — over <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/map-visualizes-scale-16th-and-17th-century-scottish-witch-hunts-180973226/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">3,000</a> in my ancestral Scotland. And in the New World, the single village of Salem <a href="https://media.nationalgeographic.org/assets/interactives/066/ab3/066ab320-9d24-4f7e-8601-978ac74d1146/salem/digest.html#:~:text=Salem%20Town%20proper%2C%20which%20had,agent%20of%20a%20living%20witch." target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">executed 20 people</a> out of a population of just 1,400. The ratio of positive to negative is legitimate cause for debate, but there&#39;s no denying religion <em>matters.</em></p><h4> Fading</h4><p> Religion, like old actors, doesn&#39;t die — it&#39;s just fading away. Churches are still operating, and people still line up to see El Papa, but religious observance, practice, belief … is down, almost everywhere. Like, ad-supported-cable down. Even where it persists, Christianity coexists with other religions and other passions. In America, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1690/religion.aspx" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">75% of us</a> believe religion is losing influence. We&#39;re correct. Napoleon said religion is the only thing that keeps the poor from murdering the rich. As our nation prints more wealth and poverty, and as we register a decline in reasons to congregate (church, work, the mall), we are witnessing a palpable increase in hostility among Americans toward … other Americans. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215399" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="548" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-300x183.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-520x317.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-768x468.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-1536x936.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-1200x731.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> Exceptions distort our view of the long-term trend. Compared to 40% of Americans generally, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/02/16/faith-among-black-americans/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">59% of Black Americans</a> say religion is very important to them. (In part this is a legacy of the role of churches and church leaders in the Civil Rights Movement.) But their fidelity is waning: 28% of Gen Z Black people are religiously unaffiliated, compared with just 11% of baby boomers. Membership in the Mormon church, once a growth engine, has also <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2023/01/04/mormon-land-why-lds-church-is/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">stalled</a> .</p><p> Abroad, religious nationalism (which may be more the latter than the former) is driving political change in India, and it remains a headline issue in the Middle East. But even Saudi Arabia is creeping toward secularization. Much of the rest of the world is already there. In China, only 10% of people claim affiliation with a religion, and only half of them attend services. Only 11% of Western Europeans say religion is very important in their lives, and only 22% attend services regularly. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215400" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="563" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart-300x188.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart-520x325.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart-768x480.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart-1536x960.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart-1200x750.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> Meet the New Gods</h4><p> It&#39;s worth taking a moment to consider the monumental nature of this shift. Our species hasn&#39;t known a time when religion played such a small role in our lives. Being religious is our natural state. And nature abhors a vacuum.</p><p> We are finding substitutes in two realms, the spiritual and the corporeal. Humans need meaning, we crave stories and reasons and higher explanations for things. We want someone (or something) to tell us what it all means. I believe this was a significant factor behind the rise of Google. Now, even more so, it&#39;s powering our fascination with AI. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215401" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1.png" alt="" width="900" height="553" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1.png 960w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1-300x184.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1-520x320.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1-768x472.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> Google and ChatGPT are omnipresent, all-knowing, and soon, all-powerful. Our god(s) can drive cars and use credit cards. Sentient yet immortal, everywhere and nowhere — feels like a god worthy of worship, no? A: No.</p><p> If we&#39;re not worshiping the tech itself, we are treating its masters as high priests. No group cements this more than the Elon stan army. Their idol is a brilliant entrepreneur, a world-changing innovator, and a <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/4192647-elon-musks-dangerous-tweets-are-empowering-antisemites/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Jew-baiting</a> absent father of 11 (or 12)? The refusal to hold Musk to the same standards we try to live up to defines the distinction between admiration and worship.</p><p> Tech is not our only new god, however. Our need to follow is easily transferred from the pulpit to the stump. I didn&#39;t plan to write about politics this week, but it&#39;s inescapable. Donald Trump looms over the American landscape, more myth than man, worshiped as a savior persecuted by the sinners of the left. There&#39;s ideological and demographic overlap between Trump&#39;s followers and fundamentalist religion: Christian nationalist identity is highly correlated with <a class="c-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8724742/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8724742/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">political extremism and violence</a> , and was bound up in the events of January 6. Equally concerning: 85% of adherents believe or mostly believe that God has called Christians to exercise dominion over all areas of American society. (Spoiler alert, they haven&#39;t succeeded.)</p><h4> Empty Pantry</h4><p> Religion is not merely a spiritual succor. Religious institutions have long provided the foundation and framework of society. Their declining relevance leaves a vacuum of more immediate and practical concern than our need for meaning. Catholic schools enroll <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/253607/us-catholic-school-growth-slows-after-two-years-of-notable-increases-data-show" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">1.7 million</a> American kids. Around <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/faith-based-child-care/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">15%</a> of parents rely on faith-based child care. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951938/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">More than half</a> of food pantries, which people rely on <a href="https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4152&amp;context=jssw" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">heavily</a> during economic downturns, are church-affiliated.</p><p> For decades, one of the major fault lines in American politics has been the social safety net. I, and half the country, believe the government&#39;s role is to provide it. The other half hates the notion. It&#39;s no coincidence that my half is largely (not entirely) made up of people whose religious connection is scant.</p><p> Alain de Botton has a book about this, <em>Religion for Atheists</em> , in which he goes through the practical things religious institutions have provided in the past. In our increasingly atomized society, the physical coming together of weekly church attendance is sorely missed. Most religions provide moral guidelines that (at their heart) are simple and useful. Don&#39;t steal. Be good to your parents. Render aid to the needy.</p><h4> 4x</h4><p> My father has been married and divorced four times, so my religious indoctrination has been more varied than consistent. When I was at my dad&#39;s, I&#39;d go with Linda (No. 3) to a Unitarian church. At my mom&#39;s, we&#39;d go intermittently to Temple.</p><p> Statistics and trends only tell us so much. The role of religion is personal. While inconsistent, the impact of religion on my development was real. I remember the rabbi at Temple Isaiah delivering a <em>d&#39;var Torah</em> that spanned from the conflict in the Middle East to the role of friendship. Afterward, over a brisket dip at Junior&#39;s Deli, my mom and I would discuss the sermon, and I remember thinking, “This is fun, and I&#39;m good at it.” I asked my mom what rabbis did and how much money they made. “They educate and comfort people, and not much. However, they command a great deal of respect.”</p><p> In high school, my closest friend was Mormon. He was part of a two-parent family who loved sports, laughed a lot, and treated me well. As a latch-key kid raised by a working single mother, I was at the Jarvis household almost every day. I went to church events, played on their sports teams, and even went to services a few times. I never felt any pressure to convert/sign-up/etc. My observation from spending several years in and around Mormons and their church: The Mormon faith is strange, and Mormons are wonderful.</p><h4> Devout Atheist</h4><p> My path to atheism has been downhill. I&#39;ve always been skeptical and judgmental, and consider myself a scientist. This made it easier to dismiss believers as idiots. As I got older, I realized my belief that all “this” was nothing and then it exploded sounded no less bat-shit crazy than the parables about loaves and fishes. Regardless, my atheism is a source of strength, as it motivates me to envision my death — the end of the road vs. an off-ramp. Imagining my death has made me less afraid of it and more bold in my behavior preceding the event (ie, now).</p><p> I&#39;ve been more bold in my career, but also in my emotions. Risking embarrassment, I frequently tell people I love them because … why wouldn&#39;t I? Those who might laugh, like me, face the same destination … soon. I&#39;d also like to think that the absence of preordained truths fosters a relentless pursuit of knowledge, a deeper appreciation for the wonders of the universe, and a profound respect for the inherent value of all living beings.</p><h4> Wanting</h4><p> It&#39;s clear to me that every being will register joy and tragedy, and the ratio is 90% a function of when and where you&#39;re born and the chemistry you inherit. Seneca believed religion was regarded by the poor as true, the wise as false, and the powerful as useful. As someone who has been all of those things, however, I find the absence of religion and opportunities to congregate with strangers leaves a void. I&#39;m getting older, wanting to serve in the agency of others, to be part of something bigger, and register comfort. I&#39;m left wanting. I&#39;m losing my religion.</p><p> Life is so rich, </p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/nmnm_images/Scott-Signature-NMNM.png" /></p><p> PS This week on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/63bnZv2u00uIkeXSCQJXmJ" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Prof G Markets podcast</a> we discussed the Google antitrust trial.

Its oxygen is innovation, which requires healthy markets. America has a</span> <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/umpires-not-kings/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proud legacy</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">of knowing when a corporate organism has morphed into an invasive species suffocating an ecosystem via predatory pricing, bundling, or other actions that control the supply of products and/or services. Historically, we step in — a competitive marketplace takes precedence over an aggregation of individual or corporate power. Antitrust laws pierce the canopy, oxygenating the marketplace and preserving a core attribute of innovation and prosperity: churn.</span></p><p> In the 19th century a series of “trusts” were established, in the belief that a centralization of power and sectors, run by thoughtful men, would be good for the economy. Soon there was recognition that the resultant abuse and income inequality warranted an antitrust movement. When Teddy Roosevelt broke up Standard Oil, it was a signal to the nation that Americans were in charge, not American corporations. The government was the sheriff, protecting the little guy.</p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">History is rhyming. This week in a</span> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/12/tech/google-antitrust-lawsuit-government-trial-duplicate-2/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal court in Washington</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Department of Justice is attempting a similar Heimlich maneuver on the $180 billion search market.</span></p><h4> Bill and Paul&#39;s Excellent Adventure</h4><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft in 1975, in the shadow of industry behemoth IBM. For decades, IBM was something akin today&#39;s Apple, Google, and Microsoft rolled into one dominant company. So dominant, it was sued by the US government for antitrust violations, which triggered a major change to IBM&#39;s business model: It</span> <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/mainframe-computers/7/172"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“unbundled” software and hardware</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">, meaning it stopped giving its software away for free to its hardware customers. This created, for the first time, a competitive market for software. A market that Gates and Allen would enter just six years later, developing software for the emerging category of personal computers.</span></p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next decade, MSFT software would power the PC revolution: MS-DOS in 1981, Word in 1983, Windows and Excel in 1985, PowerPoint in 1987. Tellingly, PowerPoint was acquired from a nascent competitor, not developed in-house. Over the next decade, Microsoft became known more for entrenchment than innovation. “Embrace, extend, and extinguish” was the company&#39;s strategy for suffocating would-be competitors. It worked — Microsoft supplanted IBM as the dominant force in computing. By 1998, Windows</span> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ms-doj-economist-calls-microsoft-a-harmful-monopoly/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">controlled over 90%</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">of the PC operating system market, and Bill Gates was the wealthiest person in the world.</span></p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As with IBM before it, Microsoft&#39;s success was recognized with the business world&#39;s Lifetime Achievement Award: a DOJ antitrust suit. The crux of the government&#39;s claim was similar to that made against IBM a quarter century earlier: Microsoft was abusing its commanding position to limit rivals&#39; ability to get traction with competing products. The headline product in 1998 was the browser: Netscape represented Microsoft&#39;s first serious competitive threat in a decade; to stop it, the company bundled its Explorer browser for free with Windows and cut deals with PC manufacturers to make Explorer the default browser on computers. The DOJ believed this was anticompetitive, the court agreed, and the company signed a consent decree ensuring PC manufacturers greater flexibility regarding the software they bundled with Windows-powered computers.</span></p><h4> Google It</h4><p> The DOJ&#39;s enforcement action oxygenated the marketplace in ways nobody could have foreseen. The same year the department sued Microsoft, the cycle was beginning again. Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google in 1998, and over the next decade their company rode a wave of innovation to global dominance. Adwords, the revenue-generating portion of the business, launched in 2000. Then Gmail in 2004, Maps in 2005, Docs in 2006, Android in 2007, and Chrome in 2008. All built on the success of the company&#39;s core products, Google search and the Android operating system — just as Microsoft built its empire on the dominance of its Windows operating system.</p><p> Would Google exist today had the DOJ not sued Microsoft? Unlikely. Microsoft tried to compete with Google in search and mobile in the 2000s, but, unable to deploy its bundling and exclusivity strategies, it had to rely on its products — which <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft-learns-to-crawl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were</a> <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3336057/how-microsoft-failed-with-windows-10-mobile.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inferior</a> .</p><p> Google doesn&#39;t dominate computing today to the extent Microsoft did in 1998. Nobody does, as “computing” is a much broader space. But its control of search — the most common entry point to the internet — is a nearly pitch-perfect echo of Microsoft circa 2001. Similarly, a quarter century after its founding, Google has a more than 90% market share, a sclerotic artifact of market power vs. a function of innovation. Its market dominance creates a virtuous cycle of increasing power. An estimated <a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/search-engine-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9 billion</a> Google searches occur every day, vs. 400 million for Bing. The massive delta of data and reach makes for a better product: Click-through rates for ads on Google are <a href="https://www.spyfu.com/blog/google-ads-vs-bing-ads/#:~:text=We%20found%20a%2030%25%20higher%20CTR%20from%20our,3.17%25%20Bing%E2%80%99s%20CTR%20for%20all%20industries%20%3D%202.83%25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30%</a> greater than on Bing. More usage = more data = more advertising, and so on. Today, Google&#39;s parent Alphabet is worth $1.75 trillion and employs 175,000 people. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215389" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/donut-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/donut-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/donut-chart-300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/donut-chart-520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/donut-chart-768x432.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/donut-chart-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/donut-chart-1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> However, what was the last innovative Google product? Restructuring the brand&#39;s architecture under Alphabet? Earnings growth has, mostly, been a function of finding new ways to extract profits from its monopoly: Google search results have become a billboard for Google-sponsored results interspersed with content harvested from other sites and links to Google&#39;s own services. In 2020, <em><a href="https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/07/28/how-we-analyzed-google-search-results-web-assay-parsing-tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Markup</a></em> found that Google-associated results (ads for or links to the company&#39;s other services) constituted over 60% of the first screen of an average Google search result. And in 1 of 5 searches, <em>the entire first screen is Google results</em> . This is the meat of its business: Search ads generate <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">57% of the company&#39;s revenue</a> . </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215391" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="544" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart-300x181.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart-520x314.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart-768x464.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart-1536x928.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart-1200x725.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite turning search results into a carousel of ads and Google services, Google has racked up 90% market share in search queries — 95% on mobile. How? As Microsoft once did, it leverages its control over the most popular mobile operating system (Android) and spends unprecedented sums on deals assuring it is the default search engine on computers and phones — more than $10 billion per year. Google says it&#39;s the leader because it has the best product, but if that&#39;s so … why pay $10 billion a year to be the default? Dominance in search is also self-fulfilling, as it gives the company unrivaled data re what people search for and what results generate clicks. And Google&#39;s ability to harvest additional data from adjacent products, including Mail, makes it increasingly difficult for competitors to get traction.</span></p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">One difference?

In addition, today&#39;s tech giants recognize CEO “likability” is key. Wojcicki, Pichai, and Sandberg made millions for their management skills, but billions as likability heat shields for their businesses&#39; abuses.</span></p><h4> The New Gilded Age</h4><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ&#39;s current lawsuit, one of several actions the federal government has taken against tech companies on antitrust and other grounds, reflects a much needed renewal of our free market instincts. Yes, government action is a component of a free market, despite what the techno-libertarian crowd would have you believe. Markets are not the product of divine creation coupled with a laissez-faire approach to regulation but a function of human effort that depends on rules and enforcement to work efficiently. We&#39;ve lost our way with respect to this (see above: lobbying) and are paying the price with declining competition and innovation.</span></p><h4> Concentrate</h4><p> And not just in tech. Three companies control <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/business/dr-pepper-history/index.html#:~:text=By%20volume%2C%20Coca%2DCola%20controlled,according%20to%20Beverage%20Digest's%20data." target="_blank" rel="noopener">95%</a> of the US beverage market. Four <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2021/12/10/recent-data-show-dominant-meat-processing-companies-are-taking-advantage-of-market-power-to-raise-prices-and-grow-profit-margins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dominate the meat business</a> , and rising meat prices are the largest contributor to food price inflation. Four airlines control over two-thirds of US air travel, though they are substandard — the highest-ranked US airline by quality of service is Delta … in <a href="https://www.worldairlineawards.com/worlds-top-100-airlines-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20th place</a> , behind Air New Zealand. The next is United, in 49th place, trailing Azul Brazilian and Malaysia Airlines. Monopoly has its privileges, however: In 2014 the <em>Economist</em> calculated that US airlines generated $22.40 in profits per passenger, while European airlines, subject to the rigors of a free market, earned just $7.84.</p><p> We see similar consolidation in banking, pharmaceuticals, health care, retail drug stores, publishing (where the DOJ recently had a big win, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/penguin-random-house-blocked-from-acquiring-rival-publisher-simon-schuster-11667257838" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopping the merger</a> of Penguin Random House with Simon &amp; Schuster), <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/10/the-invisible-power-of-big-glasses-eyewear-industry-essilor-luxottica" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eyeglasses</a> , and <a href="https://www.fooddive.com/news/beer-industry-scrutinized-by-treasury-department-following-wave-of-consolid/618587/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beer</a> . <a href="https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/global-consolidation-5-charts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Waves of consolidation</a> are washing over nearly every sector. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215387" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1100" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-768x440.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1200x688.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><h4> Oxygenation</h4><p> Antitrust enforcement actions are perceived as punishments or moral judgments, but we should think of them as recognition. If a company is good enough for long enough, it can achieve market dominance and earn its profits from stifling competition vs. competing on products or services. It&#39;s the logical, shareholder-driven thing to do. And when we stop them, the benefits accrue to almost everyone. When the US broke up Standard Oil in 1911, its largest shareholder, John D. Rockefeller, became the wealthiest man in the world: The separated companies, free to compete and innovate in the market, were worth dramatically more than when bundled together. The breakup of AT&amp;T <a href="https://www.promarket.org/2023/02/20/when-considering-breaking-up-big-tech-we-should-look-back-to-att/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlocked enormous value in the telecommunications industry</a> , leading to more patents, more profits, and eventually the fertile ground needed for the internet market explosion in the 1990s. Microsoft wasn&#39;t broken up in 2001, but it flourished despite the limitations the DOJ put on it, becoming a more innovative company. The action also fired the starting gun for growth in a sector that&#39;s created enormous stakeholder value. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215393" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1200" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent-300x188.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent-520x325.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent-768x480.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent-1536x960.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent-1200x750.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><p> This month&#39;s trial concerning Google&#39;s search dominance likely won&#39;t lead to the breakup of Alphabet. However, I believe severing YouTube and Google would create significant value for shareholders, employees, and customers, who&#39;d see their rents decline. Soon after the breakup, the Alphabet board would demand a strategy for competing in video, and the newly constituted YouTube board would ask how the company was going to challenge its former parent in text search. Even without a breakup, limitations on Google&#39;s ability to perform infanticide on emerging competitors would be welcome. History suggests we are at the start of another 25-year cycle. Just as the web was driving innovation in 1998 (when Google was founded) and personal computers drove Microsoft&#39;s early success, AI appears to be the emerging volcanic force. We need to ensure that the nascent challengers to Google (and to Meta and Apple and Amazon) have the light, air, and space needed to survive and create trillions in shareholder value and hundreds of thousands of jobs.</p><h4> Ground Zero</h4><p> This isn&#39;t about just search engine advertising, or even tech. The power of incumbents to suffocate insurgents before they can grow is mirrored in our society at large. Ground zero for many of the biggest challenges facing America can be traced to one core problem: For the first time in our nation&#39;s history, 30-year-olds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUl5rSpfCeI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren&#39;t doing as well</a> as their parents were at 30. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215392" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1200" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children-300x188.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children-520x325.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children-768x480.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children-1536x960.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children-1200x750.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This creates rage, shame, and a loss of faith in one another and the country. Limiting Google&#39;s default deals or breaking it up won&#39;t cure these ills. But it&#39;s a step, and a model for what we need to do elsewhere: clear incumbent overgrowth, creating the light and space for the young to prosper.</span></p><p> Life is so rich, </p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/nmnm_images/Scott-Signature-NMNM.png" /></p><p> PS My newest lecture, The AI Optimist, is happening next week.
