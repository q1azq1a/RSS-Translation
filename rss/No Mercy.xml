href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/29/business/netflix-stock-market-earnings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">表现最差的</a>股票。快进一圈太阳，华尔街对其<a href="https://www.thestreet.com/streaming/nflx/netflix-stock-3q-earnings-were-beautiful-whats-next-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“漂亮”</a>的业绩<a href="https://deadline.com/2023/10/netflix-stock-streaming-earnings-wall-street-1235578055/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“滔滔不绝”</a> ，而其他行业则陷入困境。</p><p>然而，反弹对于 Netflix 来说并不新鲜。自从用信封递送 DVD 以来，该公司一直在克服困难。想一想：一家 DVD 邮寄公司转变为互联网平台，转变为好莱坞巨头，最终将加入与苹果、亚马逊和谷歌<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">相同的权力缩写</a>。我们已经详细<a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/think-bigger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">讨论了</a>今年娱乐业的<a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/struck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">困境</a>，但 Netflix 在内容铁王座上取代了迪士尼、Discovery 和派拉蒙，并拥有相当于这三者总和的市值。</p><h4>告诉过你了</h4><p>五个月前，我预测编剧罢工对 Netflix 的帮助大于伤害。我的论点是：罢工将“迫使”普遍减少支出，同时实际上增加了 Netflix 对消费者的相对价值。该流媒体能够在不严重影响用户体验的情况下削减成本，因为它已经拥有像马里亚纳海沟一样深的内容库。此外，不收有线电视也是有帮助的，因为与新闻、深夜和情景喜剧不同， <em>《黑钱胜地》</em>和<em>《布里奇顿》</em>不会过时。</p><p>除了利润增长 20% 外，该公司今年预计还将产生 65 亿美元的自由现金流。这比 2022 年的 16 亿美元有所增加。与此同时，收入也有所增加，但增幅很小 (8%)。这意味着数十亿美元的意外之财是成本降低的直接结果——也就是说， <em>《巫师》</em>每集不必花费<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinereid/2023/06/02/netflix-equips-the-witcher-with-319-million-budget/?sh=4a7c4a56144c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2000 万美元</a>。分析师甚至<a href="https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/nflx/quote" target="_blank" rel="noopener">警告</a>不要<em>过于</em>乐观，因为“作家罢工的解决将带来更高的成本”，从而压低利润。换句话说，投资者<em>不希望罢工结束</em>。如果我们发现<span style="font-weight: 400;">WGA/SAG-Aftra 的</span>运营人员是为这家流媒体巨头工作的秘密资产，我们会感到惊讶吗？ NETspionage 如果你愿意的话（无法抗拒）。</p><p>无论如何，Netflix在停工面前的强势既是<span style="font-weight: 400;">罢工者</span>缺乏长期战略的结果，也是Netflix拥有丰富的长期战略的结果。在过去的二十年里，该公司采用了几种简单但重要的业务策略，并一直持续至今。让我们回顾一下它们。</p><h4>多样化</h4><p>我请<a href="https://profg.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProfG.AI</a>解释多元化的价值。它的答案是：“多元化是保护你免受致命财务伤害的凯夫拉纤维。这是一种防御策略，即使它限制了你的优势，也限制了你的劣势。”我不想和这个人在一起，但他没有错。</p><p> Netflix 以国际内容的形式大力投资多元化。该公司正在将支出从好莱坞转移，并增加对本地语言制作的投资。过去两年，亚洲的支出已增至<a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/netflix-content-spending-asia-pacific-1235543665/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 亿美元</a>，欧洲的投资也<a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/content-remote-show-2022-netflix-presents-an-extensive-outlook-of" target="_blank" rel="noopener">翻了一番</a>。 Netflix 一半以上的剧本作品是在国外制作的。与华纳兄弟探索公司（三分之一）和派拉蒙（四分之一）相比。其效果是防止供应链中断（即内容短缺），因为虽然美国演员和作家进行罢工，电视剧订单下降了 25%，但外国制作齿轮仍在运转。 </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215440"

NBCUniversal 接洽购买<em>《金装律师》</em>的版权。这部 2011 年的律政剧（讲述了离婚女子从白金汉宫的恐怖中拯救王子的故事）今年夏天在 Netflix 上首映，今年的表现比任何 Netflix 原创剧都要好。从头开始——比任何<em>节目都</em>好，就这样。 <em>《金装律师》</em>今年连续三个月成为所有平台上<a href="https://www.indiewire.com/news/business/why-suits-is-on-netflix-1234910470/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">播放量最多的节目</a>，创下了有史以来连续几周排名第一的纪录<span style="font-weight: 400;">。这就是 Netflix 效应的实际应用：拍摄一部出色的剧集，重新加热它，使其成为最受关注的剧集。消费了地球上的内容。</span> </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215442"

href="https://www.profgalloway.com/welfare-queens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">之前讨论过的</a>，世界上最有价值的公司都有一个共同点：它们在历史上最重要的风险投资机构——美国政府的投资基础上建立了厚厚的创新层。 Apple 使用 Darpa 的 GPS 来制造 iPhone。 Facebook 在政府资助的称为互联网的托管服务之上构建了一款应用程序。 Netflix 和亚马逊一样，利用美国最大的内容分发平台——美国邮政系统——通过邮件发送 DVD。</p><p>现在邮寄 DVD 听起来很麻烦，但这是一门很棒的生意。该公司于 1997 年成立，2002 年上市，通过解决一个痛点，在 2006 年实现了 10 亿美元的收入：你厨房抽屉里的简易爆炸装置，你忘记归还的<em>Turner &amp; Hooch</em>的 VHS。该公司的领导层本可以安定下来，放弃转向流媒体所需的巨额投资。但首席执行官里德·黑斯廷斯 (Reed Hastings) 认识到，在宽带领域的另一项数十亿美元投资很快就会使 DVD 变得过时。黑斯廷斯说：“不要害怕改变模式。”2007 年，Netflix<span style="font-weight: 400;">向全世界推出了流媒体服务。</span></p><p>流媒体并不是该公司唯一大胆的重点。 2011 年，尽管 Netflix 享有“平台”的美誉，但仍决定进军原创内容。当时看来，这似乎很荒唐。该公司正在与环球影业、派拉蒙影业、华纳兄弟、迪士尼和索尼——业内称为“五巨头”的好莱坞巨头展开竞争。尽管如此，Netflix 还是一头扎进去，第一年就在内容上花费了 20 亿美元。其第一部原创剧集《<em>纸牌屋》</em>获得 33 项艾美奖提名和 8 项金球奖提名。</p><h4>机遇与问题</h4><p>彼得·德鲁克说过，投资于你的机会，而不是你的问题。很少有人能比 Netflix 在这方面做得更好。长期以来，该公司的障碍显而易见：每年烧掉数亿现金。但 Netflix 知道暴力是它的优势。具体来说，它认识到市场将其视为一家科技公司，因此它做了其他媒体公司无法做到的事情：大规模投资、亏损并实现增长。</p><p> 2015年，Netflix的自由现金流为负8.4亿美元。到 2017 年，这个数字已为负 20 亿美元；两年后，负值30亿美元。无所畏惧的消费是它的独特之处。资本作为一种武器，如果你愿意的话——特别是廉价资本。 Netflix 的原创内容支出增长速度超过任何其他流媒体服务，到 2021 年，该公司每年在内容上的投资达到 180 亿美元，但自由现金流仍处于亏损状态。与此同时，传统媒体玩家受制于不同的投资者基础，他们无法容忍与流媒体平台正面交锋所需的损失。</p><p> Netflix 现在在业务的各个方面都实现了稳定盈利。它是唯一一家拥有盈利的 DTC 流媒体业务的娱乐公司，而传统玩家正在迎头赶上。</p><h4>说出您的价格</h4><p>Netflix 本季度提高订阅价格的决定反映了该平台的实力。它已达到实用状态。美国和加拿大有 1.4 亿个家庭，以及 7700 万个 Netflix 帐户。消费者不再考虑订阅的成本效益。问题不在于您是否订阅 Netflix，而在于您决定使用哪些其他平台来搭配它。</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">保费计划现为每月 22.99 美元，上涨 15%。与此同时，标准广告等级仍为 6.99 美元。 Netflix 针对美国最基本的经济趋势——收入不平等做出了正确的调整。它采用了基于手段的定价策略，保留了低收入用户，同时从高收入家庭中榨取更多用户。</span>此外， <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA5708" target="_blank" rel="noopener">研究发现</a>，引入较低质量的产品实际上<em>会增加利润</em>较高的优质产品的销量。起初我对 Netflix 的广告持怀疑态度，但它最终可能会吸引更多用户使用这款优质产品。</p><h4>威胁</h4><p>我很想说，唯一能阻碍 Netflix 的是 Netflix。但事实并非如此——这是 TikTok 和 YouTube。</p><p>我们之前<a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/tiktok-boom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">讨论过</a><a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/tiktok-trojan-stallion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok 的</a><a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/struck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">崛起</a>。这家中国巨头正在从主播那里吸引眼球（尤其是年轻人），并在此过程中创造了<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiktoks-owner-bytedance-generated-nearly-7-billion-in-cash-in-first-quarter?rc=uvswq2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">250 亿美元的</a>季度收入。顺便说一句，这个数字比去年增加了 34%。</p><p>然而，较少讨论的是 YouTube 的威胁。 Netflix 在其股东信中无意中提到了这一点，但语气既轻松又紧张。信中写道：“我们在美国电视屏幕上所占的时间份额比 YouTube 以外的任何流媒体都多。”这是一种不那么谦虚的吹嘘。事实并非如此。 YouTube 是最受欢迎的电视流媒体服务，这还不包括它在笔记本电脑和手机上获得的分钟数。我认为（希望）管理层认识到这是一个问题。 </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215441"

style="font-weight: 400;">我坐在永利酒店 60 层的房间里写下这篇文章。过去 35 年来，每年我和三个最亲密的朋友都会来维加斯</span><a href="https://www.threads.net/@profgalloway/post/Cy4SbdtA1cC/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noopener">庆祝我的生日</a>。旅行发生了变化：我们现在花更多的时间在水疗中心，更少的时间在赌场，但公司保持不变。我向窗外望去，看到了萨默林，20 年前我在那里住了 7 个月。我的妈妈第三次也是最后一次与癌症作斗争，她要求在家中去世。我搬去和她一起住。她靠秘书的薪水独自抚养我长大，这是正确的做法。这对我来说并不是太大的牺牲，因为我没有真正的关系，也没有真正的职业，但我发现这段经历很有价值。白天我会照顾她的医疗保健，我们会一起看<em>《人人都爱雷蒙德》</em>和<em>《危险边缘》</em> 。晚上，我会冒险去市中心，与一位朋友（一个从休斯顿搬来开雪茄吧的年轻人）和脱衣舞娘一起聚会。一天晚上，我在里约酒店遇见了他，他给了我一支“治愈蜡烛”给我妈妈，她的乳腺癌已经转移到胃部，已经是晚期了。蜡烛。人们很奇怪，也很奇妙。</p><p>今天在马赫上的出现将会发生，但不是真的。每当任何真正伟大的事情发生在我身上时，我都会本能地想给我妈妈打电话，享受我们集体的胜利……我们成功了。她的回应将巩固它，使它成为现实。如今，美好的事情有时感觉好像没有发生过，因为她不在场。我今年 58 岁了，二十年后，我仍然没有从母亲去世的阴影中走出来。没关系。我希望当我离开后，我的孩子们对我也有同样的感觉。</p><p>生活如此丰富， </p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/nmnm_images/Scott-Signature-NMNM.png" /></p><p> PS

</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>听力被低估了。与视觉不同，听觉在黑暗和角落里起作用。我们听到的速度比我们看到的速度快 20 到 100 倍，而且我们听到的内容在我们的脑海中停留的时间更长，通常会引发强烈的情绪——只要听听你最喜欢的大学乐队的音乐就可以了。然而，对于我们许多人来说，直到我们开始失去这种超能力的年龄时，我们才开始利用它。听力就像青春一样，在年轻人身上被浪费了。我们都会听到一些事情；地球上没有一个角落不存在声音所体现的振动。所以我们必须决定听什么。但我们中的许多人没有倾听，这削弱了我们的能力并破坏了我们的人际关系。</p><h4> “领导=倾听”</h4><p>这个标题很俗气而且不合时宜，但现在已经晚了。作为一名年轻的创始人/首席执行官，我相信领导层能够快速了解​​情况，思考几秒钟，然后期待一个自信的意见。就像一个兄弟会的兄弟承认自己呕吐，一个中量级的人虚张声势地举起因让另一名拳击手患上早发性帕金森氏症而获得的腰带。对我来说，领导力就是集结军队投入战斗。只是我没有仔细考虑策略，甚至不确定敌人是谁或在哪里。</p><p>重要的是与我（强调“我的”）观点相一致的鼓舞人心的行动。最近我看到了这些TikTok视频（我认为中共是在宣扬这些视频，以显示我们有多么愚蠢），其中一个美国家庭点燃了烟火，烟火变成了失控的软管，喷出火焰。作为一名年轻的领导者，我就像烟花，没有方向，声音很大，需要每个人的关注。</p><h4>李维·施特劳斯公司</h4><p>我 26 岁时创办了我的第一家公司，一家名为 Prophet 的战略公司。我们的第一个大客户是李维斯特劳斯公司。我参加了几次董事会会议，让我印象深刻的除了大公司的董事会会议多么丰富之外，主要是首席执行官和董事长主要提问和倾听。他们不是来倡导或哄骗的……只是来倾听。</p><p>大约在那个时候，我加入了青年企业家组织，在那里我被指派了一位导师。我的是鲍勃·斯旺森 (Bob Swanson)，他是基因泰克 (Genentech) 的创始人兼首席执行官。他跟踪了我一天，没有说一句话，只是观察。一天结束时，我准备接受专业治疗并验证我的总体实力。他说，“你需要更多地倾听”，除此之外什么也没有。</p><h4>忠诚</h4><p>优秀的领导者以创造伟大的成果而闻名。伟大在于他人的代理。领导者与全明星队一起上场的机会是保留的功能——最有才华的球员的忠诚度，他们有更多机会去其他地方。他们的忠诚取决于领导者的赏识、经济和精神。伟大的领导者会倾听，然后切实地表明他们了解某人的独特需求。有些人想管理别人，有些人想出国工作，有更多的平衡，或者看到自己的名字在灯光下（被行业媒体引用）等等。</p><p>在彼得·德鲁克<a href="https://hbr.org/2004/06/what-makes-an-effective-executive" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">关于高管领导力的经典文章</a>中，他列出了八个关键实践，前两个是要提出的问题。他的结论性建议是：<em>先听，最后说</em>。马德琳·奥尔布赖特<a

<a href="https://x.com/SaeedDiCaprio/status/1712174510076522508?s=20" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">为以色列祈祷</a>”失去了一些力量。社交媒体不仅将美德信号提升为伪重要性，而且还将其武器化。人们<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/12/israel-gaza-war-social-media-job-firings/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">失去工作</a>是因为他们觉得有必要发表“声明”。</p><p>可怕事件发生后，网上对“言论”的痴迷是社会日常的经历。 Twitter 的基本结构是说，而不是听——该平台的形式创新在于，它使回复成为一等公民，与帖子同等。社交让每个人都有发言权，但它却堵住了我们的耳道。事件越复杂、越痛苦或越令人震惊，我们就越有必要“先听，最后说”。但我们不这样做。喜欢是有的，如果您是一位半知名的 DJ，您的粉丝需要知道您对加沙的看法。 </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone

href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/persuasion-bias-and-choice/202009/using-the-need-consistency-create-greater-commitment" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">对一致性的更大偏见</a>的一部分，我们需要看到我们的言语和行为是连贯的。说会妨碍随后的听。社交媒体让情况变得更糟，它鼓励我们记录每一个转瞬即逝的想法，然后将我们束缚在其中，以免“陷阱守护者”带着“收据”来找我们。</p><p>说话一触即发也让我们更容易受到错误信息的影响。如果你倾听的是对你观点的支持而不是启发或进化，你就不太能辨别来源和主张。正如你无法同时呼吸和进食一样，你在说话时也无法倾听。</p><p>需要明确的是，每个人都有发言权。但在您决定在社交媒体上与 50 亿人分享您对热门话题的看法之前，请先问自己三个问题：我有什么可以提供的吗？我有个人或职业关系吗？值得冒这个风险吗？如果其中任何一个的答案是否定的，也许在说话之前先缓一缓。</p><h4>第一任妻子俱乐部和家长黑客</h4><p>我嫁给了一位很棒的女人——聪明、友善、有趣……总的来说令人印象深刻。她也能体会到自己的感受，而我则不然。她经常会表达一些她不高兴的事情。我的反应是管理和转移注意力。无论她的感受如何，甚至我的感受如何，她的评论都是来袭的导弹，将被击落或转移。这导致了一种和谐但日益疏远的关系。她与我没有关系，而是有人在管理这种关系。真相逐渐建立起来，然后又破裂了。</p><p>单独倾听可以使<a href="https://hbr.org/2018/05/the-power-of-listening-in-helping-people-change" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">反馈更有效</a>并产生忠诚度。如果我想给我儿子建议，告诉他们什么是最容易的部分——他们太笨了。问题就这么多，而年轻人的共同点比他们意识到的要多。让他们倾听，这就是诀窍。家长的秘诀是在我们开始讲道之前提出问题。正如我父亲所说，沟通是与倾听者进行的，如果你不通过积极倾听来软化他们的防御，你将永远无法到达海滩。</p><h4> （超级）力量</h4><p>倾听是一份礼物。当人们处于痛苦、怀疑或以任何方式挣扎时，他们可能需要表达自己的想法。对于每一个觉得有必要在社交媒体上表达自己不恰当观点的名人村白痴来说，成千上万与事件有实际利害关系的人都使用平台作为悲伤和愤怒的发泄渠道。 （但随后平台会利用这种痛苦并将其转化为其他人的素材。然后轮子开始旋转。）</p><p>当面临困境或痛苦时，表达自己的冲动是真实的。我以沟通为生，因此我必须抵制在任何情况下发言并开始发言的需要。有用的是，随着年龄的增长，我变得更加内向，这（奇怪的是）加强了我的人际关系。今天我更倾向于倾听而不是表演。</p><p>聆听和倾听之间的差异是注意力和存在感。这在设备时代很困难，但尊重可以让对方感到自己被倾听。萨姆·班克曼·弗里德 (Sam Bankman-Fried) 会通过 Zoom 通话<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-league-of-legends-investor-pitch-meeting-2022-11" target="”_blank”"

href="https://hbr.org/2016/07/what-great-listeners-actually-do" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">好的倾听者</a>——一个在场的人，一个提出探究性问题的人，一个不以对方的痛苦为发令枪的人——是缓解焦虑的一剂良药。这就是为什么好的倾听者是解决问题的有用伙伴。我经历过的一些最好的指导时刻，无论是双方，都是导师不提供建议，而是通过只关注你和你所说的话来表达感情。</p><p>你能给出的最好建议就是倾听，也就是告诉那个人他们很重要。对于任何人的悲伤或焦虑来说，最有效的治疗方法就是时间和关怀。前者会自然而然地实现，而后者则可以在我们无需言语地告诉某人我们爱他们时实现。通过聆听。</p><p>生活如此丰富，

—</p><h4>被破坏</h4><p>颠覆性创新通常更多地体现在二阶效应中，远离原始想法的爆炸区。汽车具有变革性，不是因为汽车，而是因为它们激发了郊区生活方式。全球权力日益受到能源流动的影响。将钢铁大规模包裹在四个轮子和发动机上所需的制造创新成为西方经济的核心。</p><p>如今，媒体（包括本通讯）痴迷于人工智能带来的变化。在我看来，这是技术自恋与创新者偶像崇拜碰撞而产生的痴迷。我们的新神，技术创新者，认为他们是拯救或毁灭人类的奇点杠杆之父。 “现在我的选择权已经既定，我想承认我真是一个他妈的天才，我现在担心我的才华会被释放出来。我太棒了，以至于很危险，当然是偶然的。”</p><p>耶稣基督，克服你自己吧。</p><p>我相信，随着其全面影响和二阶效应的发挥，还有另一项创新也将具有变革性。 GPT 之于媒体，GLP-1 之于实体经济。</p><h4> GLP-1 >; GPT 4</h4><p> GLP-1 是一种激动剂，是我们身体用于内部通讯的一种激素。除此之外，它还能触发胰腺产生胰岛素，这引起了糖尿病研究人员的注意，他们开发了一种名为索马鲁肽的合成形式的 GLP-1。 2017年，诺和诺德将索马鲁肽以Ozempic品牌推向美国市场。</p><p>注：我在上一段中使用“激动剂”一词是为了让自己在智力上显得更加苗条。我在前一句中使用“svelte”这个词是为了显得一本正经。使用“prim”，更英国化。尝试，总是尝试……渴望得到别人的肯定。但我离题了。</p><p>开发索马鲁肽的科学家在进行<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/obesity-drugs-researcher-interview-ozempic-wegovy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">研究</a>时面临一个问题——如果剂量太高，服用该药物的患者会失去食欲。 Ozempic 的配制剂量足够低，以减少这种副作用。然而，诺和诺德意识到这是一个功能，而不是一个缺陷，并制定了专门用于减肥的更高剂量类别 Wegovy，并于 2021 年获得批准。</p><p>索马鲁肽之后将推出类似的 GLP-1 药物，包括<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2301972" target="_blank" rel="noopener">瑞他鲁肽</a>和<a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-tirzepatide-achieved-157-weight-loss-adults-obesity-or" target="_blank" rel="noopener">替泽帕肽</a>，这两种药物均在礼来公司进行试验。对超重患者的研究表明，体重减轻了<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15%</a>至<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lilly-experimental-triple-g-obesity-drug-leads-242-weight-loss-trial-nejm-2023-06-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24%</a> 。 Wegovy 和 Ozempic 都是每周注射一次，这让一些人望而却步，但现在有药丸版本，Rybelsus。无论盒子上的标签是什么，GLP-1 药物都能让我们更长时间地感到饱腹感并抑制饥饿感。总而言之：迄今为止最有效的减肥药。</p><h4>饥饿市场</h4><p>该产品的市场以及有意义的社会变革的潜力是巨大的。在美国，70% 的人肥胖或超重。没有任何东西是美国三分之二以上的人所拥有的。 （只有<a

年内分四个阶段的六项不同研究。但它们并不完美。长期和广泛使用某种化合物可能会<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/new-drugs-found-cause-side-effects-years-after-approval-n757526" target="_blank" rel="noopener">产生试验中看不见的副作用</a>。 FDA于1999年批准了一种具有不同作用机制的糖尿病药物<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosiglitazone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">罗格列酮</a>（商品名为Vandia），但随后它被认为会增加心力衰竭的风险，许多国家已将其从市场上撤下。 GLP-1 药物已经与少数患者的<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ozempic-wegovy-linked-severe-medical-conditions-stomach-problems-study-rcna118823" target="_blank"

Ozempic 使用者进行了调查，其中 77% 的人表示，服用该药后，他们去快餐店的次数减少了。沃尔玛已经<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/ozempic-drug-users-are-buying-less-food-walmart-says-rcna119000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">发现服用 GLP-1 药物的人的食品购买量有所下降</a>。这些影响可能尚未在公司每股收益中显现出来，因为这些药物的供应有限，而且到目前为止，一小部分超重的人正在服用这些药物。然而，股市是一种试图预见未来的机制，整个肥胖产业综合体的股价下跌将领先于这一影响。</p><p>快餐首先受到冲击，但休闲快餐也受到威胁。寻找零食、冷冻食品、糖果、苏打水和烘焙食品，这些都会受到欢迎。在 GLP-1 使用者中，58%

Sports and fitness will be restructured: Gyms, built on a consumer base trying to lose weight, will see lower revenue, whereas sports for which fitness is a prerequisite (skiing, mountain biking, climbing) stand to benefit.</span></p><p> Apparel likely sees a short-term bump, as people splurge on clothes to fit their remodeled bodies, but the longer-term outlook is harder to predict: Less yo-yo dieting means some people won&#39;t need separate wardrobes to accommodate different selves, but formerly overweight people spending less money on food might allocate that cash to clothing. Where else could that extra food budget go? Discretionary spending increases will spread through every non-caloric category. Could this help reverse trends around loneliness and declining birth-rates as people feel better about themselves and are increasingly ready to mingle?</p><h4> <em>Craving</em> Economy</h4><p> If that&#39;s all these drugs did, they&#39;d still be a first-ballot hall of fame medical breakthrough. But this may be just the beginning. The <em>Washington Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/09/01/ozempic-cuts-alcohol-cravings-liquor-beer-and-wine-companies-aren-t-ready/6a7621b0-48b5-11ee-b76b-0b6e5e92090d_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> : “For some, these new weight loss drugs also seem to dampen the rewards of addictive substances, whether that&#39;s nicotine, opioids or alcohol.” Let that sink in. It&#39;s possible GLP-1 drugs are not weight loss drugs, but <strong>anti-craving drugs.</strong></p><p> In <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/05/ozempic-addictive-behavior-drinking-smoking/674098/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lab tests</a> , mice on an earlier form of synthetic GLP-1 receive a lower dopamine hit from alcohol. Rats are less interested in cocaine. Monkeys with a demonstrated preference for booze drank less. Anecdotal evidence from human users includes reports of reduced nail biting, shopping, and smoking.</p><p> If you scroll back through previous issues of this newsletter, you&#39;ll find a recurring theme: societal ills resulting from cravings.

According to Harvard&#39;s Grant Study on happiness, the factor most commonly present in the least-happy cohort was alcohol. It&#39;s that fundamental.</p><p> A drug that rewires these reward circuits could be an epochal step in human evolution. And why not? We&#39;ve compensated for evolution in many other ways, from the protection of clothing to the assistance of eyeglasses to the power of wheeled transport. Perhaps we&#39;ve reached the point where a salt/fat/dopa drive, evolved on the savannah of scarcity, can give way to a motivational superstructure suited for our era of superabundance. GLP-1 innovation may be scaffolding for instincts in need of updating.</p><h4> Portion Sizes</h4><p> Large health-care insurance companies and providers, starting with the US Government, should make delivering GLP-1 drugs a priority (instead of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/09/wegovy-heart-health-data-insurance-hurdles-costs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulling back</a> , as the short-sighted insurance industry has done). Globally, the WHO and national health organizations could do the same. You can get Ozempic over the counter in five Emirates in the Gulf. And Americans are venturing to Mexico and Canada where cost is (spoiler alert) a fraction of what it is in the US Government funding will test the fulcrum between the obesity industrial complex (food, pharmaceutical, and hospital networks) and long-term economic thinking, because these drugs will register an enormous ROI for society as health-care costs decline and mental health improves. Depression rates among obese children <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-1498-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are double</a> those of average-weight kids and can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2568994/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haunt them in adulthood</a> . A 5% reduction in weight can cut an obese person&#39;s medical costs by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4486410/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2,000</a> per year, and it&#39;s estimated that a full transition from obese to a healthy weight saves <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2017/weight-loss-for-adults-at-any-age-leads-to-cost--savings-study-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly $30,000</a> in direct medical costs and productivity.</p><p> Fun fact: My digital twin ( <a href="https://profg.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProfG.AI</a> ) believes “obesity drugs, while important for public health, are more of a niche solution.” It&#39;s obvious he disagrees with me as he&#39;s jealous I got to go to Chiltern Firehouse (in person) last night. Anyway, the potential to calibrate the drug for specific addictions is mind-blowing. One can envision similar hormone-mimicking drugs that could be engineered to address addictions to money, affirmation from strangers, short-form videos of chiropractic care, WWII documentaries, Zacapa, edibles, smoked meats, or reading random theories about the universe. Because here&#39;s the thing — I&#39;m slim, but obese.</p><p> Life is so rich, </p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/nmnm_images/Scott-Signature-NMNM.png" /></p><p> PS This week on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/61S3wf20GKtjTau558hSHp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProfGPod</a> I spoke with CNN host and <em>Washington Post</em> columnist Fareed Zakaria on the conflict in Israel — <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/61S3wf20GKtjTau558hSHp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listen here</a> .</p><p> PPS Not getting the results you want from ChatGPT?

A reality show, minus hot people and Andy Cohen. The charismatic carnival barkers on CNBC serve up a steady diet of SPACs, social media, and space, and would have you believe that&#39;s the center of the economic universe.它不是。 Of the 310 SPACs launched in the past three years, <a href="https://www.valuationresearch.com/pure-perspectives/spac-market-update-who-turned-on-the-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 have registered positive returns</a> . It&#39;s a head fake, as the deeper story goes ignored. The traditional IPO construct is in structural decline, and that&#39;s a symptom of a fundamental shift in the capital markets. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215421" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="548" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-300x183.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-520x317.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-768x468.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-1536x936.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-1200x731.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> 4 IPOs and a Funeral</h4><p> Blue Apron, the home-meal-kit delivery company, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/29/blue-apron-to-be-acquired-by-wonder-group-for-103-million.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold itself</a> to Wonder Group for $103 million. Which feels like a victory for a business that delivers cardboard boxes of chicken and kale to millennials until you realize this was its last stop on a tour that included an IPO at a valuation of $2 billion. (BTW, I <a href="https://youtu.be/llRHp5DBqIs?feature=shared&amp;t=86" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicted this</a> six years ago.)</p><p> Similarly, Instacart, which delivers chicken and kale to millennials in green plastic bags (innovation), <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/instacart-ipo-may-slash-value-160409601.html?guccounter=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went public</a> this month at $10 billion … following a 2021 private-round valuation of $39 billion. Since then the company has lost value almost every day, bumping against $7 billion as I write this. Consumer “tech” firms Rent the Runway and Allbirds are each down 96% from their IPOs. Warby Parker has outperformed, losing only three-quarters of its value.</p><p> This follows the June IPO of Cava (it asks millennials to leave the house for chicken and kale), which raised $700 million in private funding, went public, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/restaurant-chain-cava-valued-47-bln-shares-pop-debut-2023-06-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popped</a> to $4.7 billion, and then deflated to $3.5 billion. Oddity, a firm I invested in, priced at a $2 billion valuation, ran to $2.7 billion, and closed yesterday at $1.5 billion. Better Mortgage reached a private valuation of $6 billion in the private markets before its SPAC, and now trades at a valuation of $123 million. I&#39;m not immune. I invested in Better at a valuation of $600 million and haven&#39;t sold a share because my SPAC is “different.”</p><p> And these IPOs are, relatively speaking, wins. But wait — isn&#39;t the market up? Yes, but like college rankings, the indices are a weapon of mass distraction: 70% of the gains have come from just seven stocks. BTW, OpenAI is raising funds at a $90 billion valuation — a threefold increase from earlier this year. It has real revenue and explosive growth. When will it go public? A: When existing shareholders believe there is no additional upside.</p><h4> WTF Happened?</h4><p> Simple, really. When capital piles in returns go down, and private market investors want to capture the upside previously leaked to public investors. Charismatic promoters weaponized CNBC and social media, more hungry for entertainment than news, FOMO infected the masses, and MBS pivoted from terrorism to capitalism creating a torrent of capital to be deployed.</p><p> VC firms, who posted remarkable returns the first two decades of the millennium, needed a home with a backyard big enough to absorb billions in fresh capital. Tens of billions piled into pre-IPO growth firms. Never underestimate the market&#39;s ability to create a product when consumers have cash in hand. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215417" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3-charts.png" alt="" width="900" height="346" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3-charts.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3-charts-300x115.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3-charts-520x200.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3-charts-768x295.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3-charts-1536x590.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3-charts-1200x461.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> The Shift</h4><p> Does this mean there&#39;s something rotten at the heart of the capital markets? Yes, but not what it seems. The problem isn&#39;t that IPOs have become a pump and dump scheme (often they are). The problem is that they <em>don&#39;t matter</em> . The center of gravity is shifting from public to private capital. The change has been incremental, so it doesn&#39;t get much media attention. But market trends are similar to kids: If you aren&#39;t with them every day the changes feel implausible when you finally see them. In this case, however, Grandma would remark, “I can&#39;t believe how much you&#39;ve shrunk!” If the shift continues, expect an ever-greater concentration of capital and power in fewer hands, and depressed economic returns available to the “P” in IPO.</p><h4> Structural Decline of the IPO</h4><p> When I was a 22-year-old analyst at Morgan Stanley in the 1980s, good companies went public when they wanted to raise capital and provide liquidity to investors and employees, in that order. In 2002 I participated in the Nasdaq bell-ringing ceremony for Red Envelope, a firm I&#39;d founded five years earlier. The feeling was, to that point, singular — I&#39;d made it. I was at the helm of the bobsled of capitalism and would be financially secure the rest of my life. Dudes would want to be my friend, and women would want to sleep with me. Such an awesome bell. Spoiler alert: none of that happened. Maybe some new friends.</p><p> It&#39;s been gradual, but that bell no longer rings true. The product it introduces brightens up a room by leaving it, as returns are concentrated among a few outsized winners. Companies are waiting longer to go public and issuing fewer shares with no real voting power. And many, perhaps most, of them offer little upside to their new owners.</p><p> In 1980, 9 out of 10 tech IPOs were profitable. In 2021, it was 1 in 5. Among all venture-backed companies, in 1980, 78% were profitable; in 2021, 10%. Among the 13 VC-backed companies that went public in 2022, <a href="https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/IPO-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>not one</em></a> was profitable. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215422" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="459" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-300x153.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-520x265.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-768x392.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-1536x784.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pie-chart-1200x613.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> Deepest Pockets</h4><p> The rise of the unprofitable IPO isn&#39;t a matter of companies going public earlier in their growth cycle. On the contrary, many of them are massive and raise huge amounts of capital before they go public. Just 10 years ago, when venture capitalist Aileen Lee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/02/welcome-to-the-unicorn-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coined the term</a> “unicorn” to refer to a private company with a valuation over $1 billion, she was able to identify just 39 of them. Today there are <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,221</a> .</p><p> Growth, tax avoidance, bailouts, debt-fueled spending orgies, and the weaponization of governments that pass laws to privatize gains and socialize losses have formed chunks of private wealth the size of Ayers Rock. Public capital was once the hypermatter for the jump to lightspeed, but no more. Sovereign wealth funds including ADIA and PIF, mega venture funds Softbank, Sequoia, and Andreessen Horowitz, wealthy individuals, and corporations now deploy <em><a href="https://a16z.com/9b-to-build-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billions</a></em> where their predecessors could only write checks for millions. They have no choice but to make investments in $100 million+ chunks as you can&#39;t put $10 billion to work $10 million at a time.</p><p> In 2007, Microsoft&#39;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/25/technology/25facebook.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$240 million investment</a> in Facebook at a $15 billion valuation was deemed “astronomical.” Google raised just $26 million before it went public; Netflix, $102 million. Tesla, in a capital-intensive business, raised less than $200 million in equity and another $500 million in debt before its IPO. Fast-forward to today: Six distinct VC investments of $100 million+ closed <em><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/biggest-us-vc-startup-funding-deals-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week</a></em> . Elon&#39;s other company, SpaceX, has raised $9.4 billion across several rounds … and remains private.</p><h4> Private Capture</h4><p> With great wealth comes great opportunity. Historically, a company could be expected to grow long past its IPO, and the resulting share gains were available to anyone with a Schwab account and the foresight to buy in early. Google provided investors a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MBB-25772" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30% annual return</a> for the first decade post-IPO, Facebook, <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/27473/facebook-stock-price-since-its-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">19%</a> . If you invested $1,000 in Apple at its IPO in 1980, it would be worth $1.75 million today.</p><p> But if you don&#39;t need the public markets for capital, why give up those gains to the unwashed masses? You don&#39;t,unless it&#39;s the latter stage of a pump and dump. Uber <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111015/story-uber.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $10 billion</a> in private capital, most of it from Softbank and the Kingdom, before going public in 2019 at a valuation of $82.4 billion. Four years later, public shareholders have earned a 3.5% annual return. Blue Apron raised $135 million privately before its IPO — more than Netflix and Google combined.</p><p> Companies going public today aren&#39;t necessarily bad businesses. Airbnb is a great company, one of my largest holdings, but it&#39;s been a far better investment for its private backers than people in the public markets — three years after its IPO, it trades below its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/10/airbnb-ipo-abnb-starts-trading-on-the-nasdaq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first trade</a> , when public-market investors could purchase stock. Private investors who don&#39;t need the public markets to fuel growth anymore are holding on to companies longer, squeezing all the juice before tossing husks to the masses.</p><h4> Table Scraps</h4><p> So why go public at all? Like winemakers getting one last press from flattened grapes for their bargain label, private capital providers have one more trick up their sleeve, and it&#39;s part of the story of the decline of the IPO.</p><p> “Initial Public Offering” is a misnomer, because rarely are shares sold initially to the <em>public</em> . Instead, bankers sell them to a group of buyers made up of the bank&#39;s favored institutional customers. The first day “pop” is the difference between what those buyers pay the company (the “offering price”) for their shares, and what they can sell the shares for on the first day of trading. Access to IPO shares at the offering price is a reward to the institutional clients of investment banks who generate fees elsewhere (ie, not you). To reward their clients and set a positive tone for the stock, the banks want a first-day pop. This isn&#39;t new, and there&#39;s long been tension between these banks and the companies, who see the pop as money left on the table. What&#39;s changed is the machinations used to generate the pop and how swiftly it dissipates.</p><p> One secret is tiny floats. In 1980 the median float at IPO — that is, the percentage of the company offered to the public — was 29% of the total shares. In 2022 that number was <a href="https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/IPO-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15%</a> , the lowest in four decades. In an efficient market, float shouldn&#39;t affect price, but if you can turn the hype machine up high enough and squeeze supply, you have the Lost Ark of marketing: artificial scarcity. Instacart offered only 8% of its total shares to the public when it IPO&#39;d a few weeks ago. The story led the financial press for the day, and the stock gained 12% on its first day of trading. Airbnb offered just 7.5% of its shares to the public, and the stock more than doubled at the opening bell. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215420" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-02.png" alt="" width="900" height="539" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-02.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-02-300x180.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-02-520x311.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-02-768x460.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-02-1536x920.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IPO-line-chart-02-1200x719.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> Decarceration</h4><p> Historically, a short-term pop was less valuable, because insiders were subject to lockups, typically for 180 days, before they could sell their shares. However, that too is changing. In 2021, 25% of IPOs featured shorter lockup agreements that allowed insiders to sell before the 180 days were up — that share was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/13024bb1-8a46-4a87-979e-6a18a00a11e7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the highest</a> on record. Of that group, two-thirds were tech companies (shocker). Direct listings (which skip the banker-institution pipeline) are promoted as a more democratic alternative to IPOs with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/10/02/direct-listing-is-a-more-elegant-approach-bill-gurley.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“open and equal access for all”</a> and are <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/direct-listings-vs-ipo-paths-to-going-public-51638305261" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasing</a> in popularity. To be clear, a direct listing has less to do with access, and more to do with dumping as there are no lockup requirements.</p><p> The other benefit of a small float is it allows insiders to retain more control. That goes hand in hand with the increase in dual-class share structures. These provisions grant insiders special shares that have 10 times the voting power. Founders love this because it allows them to decouple risk from control. In 2021, <a href="https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/IPO-Statistics.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24%</a> of IPOs had dual-class share structures, up from 2% in 1980. Among tech companies, that number was 46%. Robinhood&#39;s mission is to “democratize investing” — unless you invest in Robinhood, where the founders own 16% of the company but control 66% of the voting shares. The founders haven&#39;t democratized investing, they&#39;ve autocratized it. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215418" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart-.png" alt="" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart-.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart--300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart--520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart--768x432.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart--1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bar-chart--1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> Private Liquidity</h4><p> The second motivation for an IPO is creating liquidity for early investors and employees. But public ownership is no longer the only way to create liquidity. Investors are increasingly able to unload some of their stock in the private markets. OpenAI is in talks to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-seeks-valuation-up-90-bln-sale-existing-shares-wsj-2023-09-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sell existing shares</a> at a healthy valuation. eToro recently sold <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/israels-etoro-agrees-120-mln-secondary-share-sale-source-2023-07-31/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$120 million</a> . And in the first half of last year, while the IPO market was frozen over, private equity firms sold $57 billion in secondary shares — a <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/secondaries-2023-PE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record high</a> .</p><h4> In the VIP</h4><p> With no need for public-market financing, and more options for finding liquidity, private investors will continue to fund a company until the firm arrives at one of two stations: The company is strong but mature and the returns from its growth phase are fully harvested, or its model is suspect and existing shareholders need to deploy a series of false signals to greater fools so they can fling feces at tourists to the unicorn zoo.</p><p> And while private capital investors (aka the very rich) reap the gains, public investors (aka everyone else) have scant access to the markets where real wealth is created. As capital concentrates, so does power. The “shareholder class” has always been elite. But, at one time, it reached down to the merely affluent and then, through pension and retirement funds, to the masses — diffusing influence, and strengthening democracy. Public ownership&#39;s transparency requirements are preventive against collusion, graft, and a steady march toward a dynastic society.</p><p> Instead we have bailouts of the rich, tech firms who capture trillions building a thick layer of innovation on top of public investments while decreasing R&amp;D and paying less taxes, and an idolatry of innovators who, despite being absent fathers or just shitty investors, continue to capture our affection and capital.</p><h4> What to Do?</h4><p> Disavow yourself of the notion that you, or anybody else, knows how to pick stocks. Invest in low-cost ETF and index funds. Also, just because someone has chunky glasses, is on CNBC a lot, or made a lucky investment in the Amazon of China, does not mean they know what they&#39;re doing.

I received a lot of “feedback” (“I hope you die,” etc.). Good stuff. So here we are. Headlines universally lauding the <a href="https://collider.com/wga-agreement-details/#:~:text=The%20Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20has%20ended%20their,better%20residuals%2C%20accurate%20streaming%20data%2C%20and%20health%20insurance." target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">“historic deal”</a> and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2023-09-25/column-sag-aftra-strike-writers-victory-humans-over-ai" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">“victory of human over AI.”</a></p><h4> Unexceptional</h4><p> The WGA is claiming victory as it has no choice. (Imagine declaring defeat after subjecting your constituents to five months of no pay.) So let&#39;s put the ketamine down and acknowledge this is no victory.</p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The key issue in this debate was money. Specifically, the writers wanted more of it. Adjusted for inflation, the average writer-producer salary has</span> <a href="https://www.wgacontract2023.org/updates/bulletins/writers-are-not-keeping-up" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declined 23%</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in the past decade. Last year, when prices rose as much as 8%, TV writers received a nominal pay increase of 2.25%.</span> </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215407" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-increase-pay.png" alt="" width="900" height="494" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-increase-pay.png 8001w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-increase-pay-300x165.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-increase-pay-520x285.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-increase-pay-768x421.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-increase-pay-1536x843.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-increase-pay-2048x1124.png 2048w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-increase-pay-1200x658.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> So the WGA made a reasonable demand: a 6% pay bump. But last year, prices rose (I repeat) 8%. In other words, the WGA arrived at the negotiating table demanding a decline in purchasing power. And then … didn&#39;t get what they asked for — <a href="https://www.wgacontract2023.org/the-campaign/summary-of-the-2023-wga-mba#:~:text=Most%20MBA%20minimums%20will%20increase%20by%205%25%20on,the%20result%20of%20patterns%20established%20in%20the%20industry." target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">they settled for 5%</a> . Meanwhile the striking UAW have <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uaw-rejects-stellantis-21-pay-141135050.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">rejected an offer</a> of a 20% increase, and asked for 40%.</p><p> To be fair, the deal includes pay escalations of 4% and 3.5% in years two and three, respectively. However, to keep up with inflation over the past three years (since the last contract was struck), the writers would have needed a <a href="https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/wga-contract-inflation-minimums-1235564920/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">10% increase</a> in year one. The new deal also includes an increased contribution to health and pension benefits of 1% and overseas royalty payments that, from my vantage, are purposefully opaque and wordy enough to give members enough psilocybin to hallucinate that there&#39;s a there there.</p><p> The already ugly math gets hideous when you factor in the five months in which the writers, as a function of the strike, registered a 100% reduction in pay. For a three-year union contract to compensate for those losses, you would need to increase writer pay (again) by 14%. That’s <em>in addition</em> to the inflation losses. So the minimum increase the writers need to <em>not lose</em> purchasing power is 24%.</p><p> My favorite jazz hands in the agreement is writers get a 50% royalty bump if their show is viewed by 20% of the platform&#39;s subscribers. Yes, and I&#39;m giving my employees a 50% bonus every time the Jets win the Super Bowl. Sure, it&#39;s happened … just not that often. The series finale of <em>Succession</em> registered <a href="https://clutchpoints.com/succession-news-series-finale-draws-record-viewership" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">three million</a> viewers, ie, 6% of HBO&#39;s 50 million subscribers.</p><h4> The Good Stuff</h4><p> The WGA did secure a couple meaningful gains. As in two. First, there is now a minimum staffing requirement for writers rooms, which translates to more employment opportunities for young writers. Second, they&#39;ve raised the minimum number of weeks studios must employ writers for shows. In other words, work lasts longer. These concessions are meaningful and reflect well on the guild&#39;s commitment to investing in the craft and nurturing talent.</p><h4> Follow the Mouse</h4><p> This whole process, however, was a distraction from what the writers, actors, and all workers in the creative community should be focused on. Henry Kissinger once said of my industry: “The reason that university politics is so vicious is because stakes are so small.” The same holds true in media.</p><p> Last week I spoke with a group of Hollywood executives and writers. (I&#39;m trying TV for the <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/film-credits/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">sixth time</a> .) They were concerned about the strikes — but <em>more</em> concerned that their stalwart, the House of the Mouse, has transformed into a distressed asset practically overnight. Disney stock is at a nine-year low. Subscriber losses continue to mount, with a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/09/disney-dis-earnings-report-q3-2023.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">7.4% decline</a> in Disney+ subscriptions in the most recent quarter. Operating profits from the cable assets have been halved, and the company&#39;s operating margins are down 75%.</p><p> It&#39;s not just Disney. Revenues are falling at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/03/warner-bros-discovery-wbd-earnings-q3-2022.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Warner Bros. Discovery</a> , <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/comcast-cmcsa-earnings-q3-2022.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Comcast</a> , and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/02/paramount-global-para-earnings-tv-revenue-falls-.html#:~:text=Paramount%20Global%20reported%20%246.92%20billion%20in%20third-quarter%20revenue%2C,million%20subscribers%2C%20and%20overall%20direct-to-consumer%20revenue%20rose%2038%25." target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Paramount</a> . Last month, cable and broadcast <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/15/media/cable-broadcast-tv-decline-nielsen-report/index.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">fell below 50%</a> of total TV viewing for the first time in history. Meanwhile, the industry is becoming increasingly reliant on a ventilator of recycled content. <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/frenemies/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">All 10</a> of the highest-grossing movies from last year were repurposed from existing IP. Pixar&#39;s biggest movie was <em>Lightyear</em> (the sixth installment of the Toy Story franchise), and the hot news in TV this week is Greg Daniels has <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/09/the-office-reboot.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">a new show</a> called <em>The Office</em> . Ie, a reboot of the reboot. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215408" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-stock.png" alt="" width="900" height="465" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-stock.png 8001w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-stock-300x155.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-stock-520x268.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-stock-768x397.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-stock-1536x793.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-stock-2048x1057.png 2048w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-stock-1200x620.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The writers can keep fighting for a larger slice of the pie, but the pie gets smaller every day. The WGA will have 15 milliseconds of fame before it starts digging through the rubble searching for remnants of its industry. The question they should ask themselves: What would a “meaningful gain” actually look like, and how do we achieve this? Is it really a 6% pay bump? More transparent residuals? A staffing minimum for writers rooms, striking against impaired companies? To achieve a truly exceptional outcome, the writers, the studios, the executives — everyone in Hollywood must do one thing: Think bigger.</span></p><h4> Falsely Convicted</h4><p> Fixing the problem means first identifying it. The adversary isn&#39;t a Hollywood executive in a cashmere sweater; it&#39;s a 17-year-old kid in a basement scrolling TikTok. The rise of social media is directly correlated with the decline of traditional media. TikTok now commands <a href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/tiktok-statistics/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">95 minutes</a> of user attention per day, equivalent to four and a half episodes of <em>The Office</em> . More than 200 billion Facebook and Instagram Reels are played <em>every day</em> — up 50% in less than one year. YouTube, a subsidiary app owned by Google, now rakes in as much revenue as Netflix. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215409" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-revenue.png" alt="" width="900" height="466" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-revenue.png 8001w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-revenue-300x155.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-revenue-520x269.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-revenue-768x398.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-revenue-1536x796.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-revenue-2048x1061.png 2048w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-revenue-1200x622.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> The ad dollars <em>Hannah Montana</em> used to generate have not been shoplifted by Bob Iger, but Silicon Valley and Beijing. When queried whether they&#39;d prefer TikTok vs. all streaming media, two-thirds of people under the age of 25 <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-tiktok-has-taken-over-media-industry-stats-2022-12" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">choose TikTok</a> . There are between 300 million and 400 million creators on TikTok — their compensation is approximately $40 for every million views. None have ever threatened a strike.结果？ A: The company&#39;s <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3193027/tiktok-owner-bytedance-sees-valuation-drop-quarter-us300-billion" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">valuation</a> is roughly equal to Disney and Netflix combined.</p><p> It&#39;s also no coincidence that the year of the writers&#39; strike is also the year of AI. AI was a core issue in the dispute. The writers (rightly) fear it could replace them and demanded the studios not use AI — which the studios (also rightly) declined. Instead, they <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/hollywood-studios-can-train-ai-models-on-writers-work-under-tentative-deal-aedae589?mod=hp_lead_pos2" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">met halfway</a> : The studios <em>can</em> use AI, but the original writers must receive credit and compensation. This reflects a misunderstanding of AI. It&#39;s not AI who will take your job, but a writer who leverages it.</p><h4> Pennies vs. Benjamins</h4><p> The industry is quarreling over pennies, instead of pursuing Benjamins. More market value in the Nasdaq was created in the first half of this year than in any six-month period in history. The catalyst was AI. The day Microsoft announced it was incorporating AI into its Office suite, it <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/microsoft-stock-price-copilot-ai-office-365-monthly-subscription-msft-2023-7" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">added</a> the value of Disney. The day Morgan Stanley praised Tesla&#39;s Dojo supercomputer, Tesla <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-soars-10-morgan-stanley-011206318.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">added</a> the value of BMW. Meta&#39;s new AI-powered recommendation algorithm drove a 24% increase in Instagram use this year. AI has inspired a tsunami of shareholder value: In 2023 alone, Google, Meta, Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon have registered a combined increase of $3.2 trillion.</p><p> Compare that to traditional media: The combined market cap of Comcast, Netflix, Disney, Warner Bros., Paramount, Fox Corp., and News Corp. is less than $600 billion. Think about that. The value gained by six tech firms this year is nearly six times greater than the current value of the seven largest mass-media companies put together. Hollywood needs to put down the slingshot, and go big-game hunting. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215411" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-market-cap-2.png" alt="" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-market-cap-2.png 8001w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-market-cap-2-300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-market-cap-2-520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-market-cap-2-768x432.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-market-cap-2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-market-cap-2-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-market-cap-2-1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> The Rapture, Pt. 2</h4><p> As I&#39;ve <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/welfare-queens/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">written before</a> , the fastest way to build wealth is to monetize infrastructure others built for free. Amazon built a thick layer of innovation on top of a free enterprise plug-in called the US postal system. Tesla leveraged green government tax credits to build an EV empire. Google struck the rare earth mineral that is user-generated data, mined it relentlessly at zero extraction cost, and placed banner ads on top of it.</p><p> AI is the resurrection of this business model, and the fuel is original content. Yesterday I discovered <a href="https://www.threads.net/@profgalloway/post/CxqiBCXIpKS" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">two of my books</a> , <em>The Algebra of Happiness</em> and <em>The Four</em> , have been used (without my approval) to feed generative AI. I have not been credited or paid. I&#39;m not alone. Last week, writers John Grisham, Jodi Picoult, and George RR Martin <a href="https://apnews.com/article/openai-lawsuit-authors-grisham-george-rr-martin-37f9073ab67ab25b7e6b2975b2a63bfe" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">sued OpenAI</a> for stealing their IP to train its algorithm. Before that, a group of artists <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/class-action-lawsuit-ai-generators-deviantart-midjourney-stable-diffusion-2246770" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">sued Stability AI</a> for using their content to generate AI art. So did <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/getty-images-lawsuit-says-stability-ai-misused-photos-train-ai-2023-02-06/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Getty Images</a> . I used to think tech companies loved user-generated content because most user-generated content isn&#39;t protected by copyright law. (How many TikTokers are claiming IP rights on “day in the life” videos?) But now tech companies are taking it a step further. Now they&#39;re harvesting content that <em>is</em> protected.</p><p> There is slow, if not steady, progress on this front. I also discovered I am a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23963237-authors-v-openai?responsive=1&amp;title=1" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">class member in a suit that includes</a> all copyright holders whose work has been used in training. That Grisham suit is also a class action, but the class is fiction writers. To date, Big Tech has been hiding behind a complex generative AI algorithm too sophisticated for mere mortals to attribute credit for distinct IP.</p><p> These and future suits are important, really important. Hollywood won&#39;t fall because Bob Iger or David Zaslav are greedy. It will fall because Silicon Valley stole the only asset that can truly differentiate generative AI: other people&#39;s content.</p><h4> What to Do</h4><p> When I was on the board of The New York Times Company, two thirds of revenue came from ads. During the print days, it worked — we had strong control over distribution and could price ads on terms that made sense for the business. Then Google offered us what looked like a good deal: Let us crawl your content, and we&#39;ll drive traffic to your website in return. More ad views, great right? Spoiler alert: not great. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215412" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-nyt-rev.png" alt="" width="900" height="472" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-nyt-rev.png 8001w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-nyt-rev-300x157.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-nyt-rev-520x272.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-nyt-rev-768x402.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-nyt-rev-1536x805.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-nyt-rev-2048x1073.png 2048w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5-nyt-rev-1200x629.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> So while Larry and Sergey were capturing our ad dollars, I proposed we form a consortium (NYT, News Corp, Condé Nast, Hearst, etc.) to block Google&#39;s crawlers and have an auction for the license to our content. I believed Google and a somewhat relevant Bing (see above: 2008) would have paid billions. The board said no, and we missed the chance to upend the business model, to put creators — journalists, editors, artists — in the position of power, instead of the platforms. Soon enough, it was too late.</p><h4> Consortium</h4><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This is that moment again. A world-changing technology has emerged, and we have the chance to write the rules so that we (creators) can make money from it. Notice how quiet Big Tech leaders have been throughout this process.为什么？ Because they see dead people. In this case, dead people are Hollywood studios and the creative community removing their heads from their asses, binding together, and transforming their assets into potentially trillions of dollars of shareholder value.</span></p><p> To garner an increase in compensation that is legitimately “exceptional,” the writers and the studios/executives/actors/publishers/networks must band together. They should form a consortium, file suits demanding Big Tech and AI respect their IP, license this IP, and start valuing their work. And they should do it as soon as possible. I&#39;d suggest WME be charged with assembling the first 100 members and Barry Diller heads the new consortium.

The internet, civil rights, antibiotics? The transition from a manufacturing to a service economy, or rapid urbanization? Right up there, I believe, is the displacement of religion from the center of our culture and what has taken its place. Religions and religious institutions play key roles in society, practical and spiritual. Humans are meaning-makers, we&#39;re wired to imbue our actions with purpose. We will have gods, even if forced to make them of mortals … or machines.</p><h4> It Works (Sometimes)</h4><p> Religion is successful because it works. Participation in religious services is correlated with a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5665144/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">reduction in mortality</a> by a third, depression by 25%, and suicide rates by 3 to 6 times. Religion motivated the construction of cathedrals, pyramids, and temples that, set against space travel and pocket computers, still invoke awe. Here in the secularizing US, religious people are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2011/12/23/the-civic-and-community-engagement-of-religiously-active-americans/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">3 times as likely</a> to be active in community organizations and twice as likely to participate in local sports leagues. They&#39;re also <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/01/31/are-religious-people-happier-healthier-our-new-global-study-explores-this-question/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">44% more likely</a> to vote and 44% more likely to describe themselves as “very happy.” </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215398" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/religous.png" alt="" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/religous.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/religous-300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/religous-520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/religous-768x432.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/religous-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/religous-1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> Yeah, But…</h4><p> Much of religious experience has been insular, hostile to change, riven with corruption and abuse of power. The previous sentence may be the mother of all understatements. The Land of the Free was born of a violent theocracy: Contrary to what you likely learned in grade school, the earliest English settlers wasted little time before<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinomian_Controversy" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">exiling</a> anyone who differed on the fine points of biblical interpretation. <a href="https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/religion-colonial-america-trends-regulations-beliefs" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Eight of the original thirteen</a> colonies had official state churches and persecuted heresy.</p><p> From 1300 to 1600, European towns executed tens of thousands of their own people, mostly women, on accusations of witchcraft — over <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/map-visualizes-scale-16th-and-17th-century-scottish-witch-hunts-180973226/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">3,000</a> in my ancestral Scotland. And in the New World, the single village of Salem <a href="https://media.nationalgeographic.org/assets/interactives/066/ab3/066ab320-9d24-4f7e-8601-978ac74d1146/salem/digest.html#:~:text=Salem%20Town%20proper%2C%20which%20had,agent%20of%20a%20living%20witch." target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">executed 20 people</a> out of a population of just 1,400. The ratio of positive to negative is legitimate cause for debate, but there&#39;s no denying religion <em>matters.</em></p><h4> Fading</h4><p> Religion, like old actors, doesn&#39;t die — it&#39;s just fading away. Churches are still operating, and people still line up to see El Papa, but religious observance, practice, belief … is down, almost everywhere. Like, ad-supported-cable down. Even where it persists, Christianity coexists with other religions and other passions. In America, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1690/religion.aspx" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">75% of us</a> believe religion is losing influence. We&#39;re correct. Napoleon said religion is the only thing that keeps the poor from murdering the rich. As our nation prints more wealth and poverty, and as we register a decline in reasons to congregate (church, work, the mall), we are witnessing a palpable increase in hostility among Americans toward … other Americans. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215399" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="548" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-300x183.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-520x317.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-768x468.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-1536x936.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-1200x731.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> Exceptions distort our view of the long-term trend. Compared to 40% of Americans generally, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/02/16/faith-among-black-americans/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">59% of Black Americans</a> say religion is very important to them. (In part this is a legacy of the role of churches and church leaders in the Civil Rights Movement.) But their fidelity is waning: 28% of Gen Z Black people are religiously unaffiliated, compared with just 11% of baby boomers. Membership in the Mormon church, once a growth engine, has also <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2023/01/04/mormon-land-why-lds-church-is/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">stalled</a> .</p><p> Abroad, religious nationalism (which may be more the latter than the former) is driving political change in India, and it remains a headline issue in the Middle East. But even Saudi Arabia is creeping toward secularization. Much of the rest of the world is already there. In China, only 10% of people claim affiliation with a religion, and only half of them attend services. Only 11% of Western Europeans say religion is very important in their lives, and only 22% attend services regularly. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215400" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="563" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart-300x188.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart-520x325.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart-768x480.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart-1536x960.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pie-chart-1200x750.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> Meet the New Gods</h4><p> It&#39;s worth taking a moment to consider the monumental nature of this shift. Our species hasn&#39;t known a time when religion played such a small role in our lives. Being religious is our natural state. And nature abhors a vacuum.</p><p> We are finding substitutes in two realms, the spiritual and the corporeal. Humans need meaning, we crave stories and reasons and higher explanations for things. We want someone (or something) to tell us what it all means. I believe this was a significant factor behind the rise of Google. Now, even more so, it&#39;s powering our fascination with AI. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215401" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1.png" alt="" width="900" height="553" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1.png 960w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1-300x184.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1-520x320.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1-768x472.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> Google and ChatGPT are omnipresent, all-knowing, and soon, all-powerful. Our god(s) can drive cars and use credit cards. Sentient yet immortal, everywhere and nowhere — feels like a god worthy of worship, no? A: No.</p><p> If we&#39;re not worshiping the tech itself, we are treating its masters as high priests. No group cements this more than the Elon stan army. Their idol is a brilliant entrepreneur, a world-changing innovator, and a <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/4192647-elon-musks-dangerous-tweets-are-empowering-antisemites/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Jew-baiting</a> absent father of 11 (or 12)? The refusal to hold Musk to the same standards we try to live up to defines the distinction between admiration and worship.</p><p> Tech is not our only new god, however. Our need to follow is easily transferred from the pulpit to the stump. I didn&#39;t plan to write about politics this week, but it&#39;s inescapable. Donald Trump looms over the American landscape, more myth than man, worshiped as a savior persecuted by the sinners of the left. There&#39;s ideological and demographic overlap between Trump&#39;s followers and fundamentalist religion: Christian nationalist identity is highly correlated with <a class="c-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8724742/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8724742/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">political extremism and violence</a> , and was bound up in the events of January 6. Equally concerning: 85% of adherents believe or mostly believe that God has called Christians to exercise dominion over all areas of American society. (Spoiler alert, they haven&#39;t succeeded.)</p><h4> Empty Pantry</h4><p> Religion is not merely a spiritual succor. Religious institutions have long provided the foundation and framework of society. Their declining relevance leaves a vacuum of more immediate and practical concern than our need for meaning. Catholic schools enroll <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/253607/us-catholic-school-growth-slows-after-two-years-of-notable-increases-data-show" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">1.7 million</a> American kids. Around <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/faith-based-child-care/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">15%</a> of parents rely on faith-based child care. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951938/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">More than half</a> of food pantries, which people rely on <a href="https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4152&amp;context=jssw" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">heavily</a> during economic downturns, are church-affiliated.</p><p> For decades, one of the major fault lines in American politics has been the social safety net. I, and half the country, believe the government&#39;s role is to provide it. The other half hates the notion. It&#39;s no coincidence that my half is largely (not entirely) made up of people whose religious connection is scant.</p><p> Alain de Botton has a book about this, <em>Religion for Atheists</em> , in which he goes through the practical things religious institutions have provided in the past. In our increasingly atomized society, the physical coming together of weekly church attendance is sorely missed. Most religions provide moral guidelines that (at their heart) are simple and useful. Don&#39;t steal. Be good to your parents. Render aid to the needy.</p><h4> 4x</h4><p> My father has been married and divorced four times, so my religious indoctrination has been more varied than consistent. When I was at my dad&#39;s, I&#39;d go with Linda (No. 3) to a Unitarian church. At my mom&#39;s, we&#39;d go intermittently to Temple.</p><p> Statistics and trends only tell us so much. The role of religion is personal. While inconsistent, the impact of religion on my development was real. I remember the rabbi at Temple Isaiah delivering a <em>d&#39;var Torah</em> that spanned from the conflict in the Middle East to the role of friendship. Afterward, over a brisket dip at Junior&#39;s Deli, my mom and I would discuss the sermon, and I remember thinking, “This is fun, and I&#39;m good at it.” I asked my mom what rabbis did and how much money they made. “They educate and comfort people, and not much. However, they command a great deal of respect.”</p><p> In high school, my closest friend was Mormon. He was part of a two-parent family who loved sports, laughed a lot, and treated me well. As a latch-key kid raised by a working single mother, I was at the Jarvis household almost every day. I went to church events, played on their sports teams, and even went to services a few times. I never felt any pressure to convert/sign-up/etc. My observation from spending several years in and around Mormons and their church: The Mormon faith is strange, and Mormons are wonderful.</p><h4> Devout Atheist</h4><p> My path to atheism has been downhill. I&#39;ve always been skeptical and judgmental, and consider myself a scientist. This made it easier to dismiss believers as idiots. As I got older, I realized my belief that all “this” was nothing and then it exploded sounded no less bat-shit crazy than the parables about loaves and fishes. Regardless, my atheism is a source of strength, as it motivates me to envision my death — the end of the road vs. an off-ramp. Imagining my death has made me less afraid of it and more bold in my behavior preceding the event (ie, now).</p><p> I&#39;ve been more bold in my career, but also in my emotions. Risking embarrassment, I frequently tell people I love them because … why wouldn&#39;t I? Those who might laugh, like me, face the same destination … soon. I&#39;d also like to think that the absence of preordained truths fosters a relentless pursuit of knowledge, a deeper appreciation for the wonders of the universe, and a profound respect for the inherent value of all living beings.</p><h4> Wanting</h4><p> It&#39;s clear to me that every being will register joy and tragedy, and the ratio is 90% a function of when and where you&#39;re born and the chemistry you inherit. Seneca believed religion was regarded by the poor as true, the wise as false, and the powerful as useful. As someone who has been all of those things, however, I find the absence of religion and opportunities to congregate with strangers leaves a void. I&#39;m getting older, wanting to serve in the agency of others, to be part of something bigger, and register comfort. I&#39;m left wanting. I&#39;m losing my religion.</p><p> Life is so rich, </p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/nmnm_images/Scott-Signature-NMNM.png" /></p><p> PS This week on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/63bnZv2u00uIkeXSCQJXmJ" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Prof G Markets podcast</a> we discussed the Google antitrust trial.

Its oxygen is innovation, which requires healthy markets. America has a</span> <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/umpires-not-kings/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proud legacy</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">of knowing when a corporate organism has morphed into an invasive species suffocating an ecosystem via predatory pricing, bundling, or other actions that control the supply of products and/or services. Historically, we step in — a competitive marketplace takes precedence over an aggregation of individual or corporate power. Antitrust laws pierce the canopy, oxygenating the marketplace and preserving a core attribute of innovation and prosperity: churn.</span></p><p> In the 19th century a series of “trusts” were established, in the belief that a centralization of power and sectors, run by thoughtful men, would be good for the economy. Soon there was recognition that the resultant abuse and income inequality warranted an antitrust movement. When Teddy Roosevelt broke up Standard Oil, it was a signal to the nation that Americans were in charge, not American corporations. The government was the sheriff, protecting the little guy.</p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">History is rhyming. This week in a</span> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/12/tech/google-antitrust-lawsuit-government-trial-duplicate-2/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal court in Washington</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Department of Justice is attempting a similar Heimlich maneuver on the $180 billion search market.</span></p><h4> Bill and Paul&#39;s Excellent Adventure</h4><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft in 1975, in the shadow of industry behemoth IBM. For decades, IBM was something akin today&#39;s Apple, Google, and Microsoft rolled into one dominant company. So dominant, it was sued by the US government for antitrust violations, which triggered a major change to IBM&#39;s business model: It</span> <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/mainframe-computers/7/172"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“unbundled” software and hardware</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">, meaning it stopped giving its software away for free to its hardware customers. This created, for the first time, a competitive market for software. A market that Gates and Allen would enter just six years later, developing software for the emerging category of personal computers.</span></p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next decade, MSFT software would power the PC revolution: MS-DOS in 1981, Word in 1983, Windows and Excel in 1985, PowerPoint in 1987. Tellingly, PowerPoint was acquired from a nascent competitor, not developed in-house. Over the next decade, Microsoft became known more for entrenchment than innovation. “Embrace, extend, and extinguish” was the company&#39;s strategy for suffocating would-be competitors. It worked — Microsoft supplanted IBM as the dominant force in computing. By 1998, Windows</span> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ms-doj-economist-calls-microsoft-a-harmful-monopoly/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">controlled over 90%</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">of the PC operating system market, and Bill Gates was the wealthiest person in the world.</span></p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As with IBM before it, Microsoft&#39;s success was recognized with the business world&#39;s Lifetime Achievement Award: a DOJ antitrust suit. The crux of the government&#39;s claim was similar to that made against IBM a quarter century earlier: Microsoft was abusing its commanding position to limit rivals&#39; ability to get traction with competing products. The headline product in 1998 was the browser: Netscape represented Microsoft&#39;s first serious competitive threat in a decade; to stop it, the company bundled its Explorer browser for free with Windows and cut deals with PC manufacturers to make Explorer the default browser on computers. The DOJ believed this was anticompetitive, the court agreed, and the company signed a consent decree ensuring PC manufacturers greater flexibility regarding the software they bundled with Windows-powered computers.</span></p><h4> Google It</h4><p> The DOJ&#39;s enforcement action oxygenated the marketplace in ways nobody could have foreseen. The same year the department sued Microsoft, the cycle was beginning again. Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google in 1998, and over the next decade their company rode a wave of innovation to global dominance. Adwords, the revenue-generating portion of the business, launched in 2000. Then Gmail in 2004, Maps in 2005, Docs in 2006, Android in 2007, and Chrome in 2008. All built on the success of the company&#39;s core products, Google search and the Android operating system — just as Microsoft built its empire on the dominance of its Windows operating system.</p><p> Would Google exist today had the DOJ not sued Microsoft? Unlikely. Microsoft tried to compete with Google in search and mobile in the 2000s, but, unable to deploy its bundling and exclusivity strategies, it had to rely on its products — which <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft-learns-to-crawl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were</a> <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3336057/how-microsoft-failed-with-windows-10-mobile.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inferior</a> .</p><p> Google doesn&#39;t dominate computing today to the extent Microsoft did in 1998. Nobody does, as “computing” is a much broader space. But its control of search — the most common entry point to the internet — is a nearly pitch-perfect echo of Microsoft circa 2001. Similarly, a quarter century after its founding, Google has a more than 90% market share, a sclerotic artifact of market power vs. a function of innovation. Its market dominance creates a virtuous cycle of increasing power. An estimated <a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/search-engine-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9 billion</a> Google searches occur every day, vs. 400 million for Bing. The massive delta of data and reach makes for a better product: Click-through rates for ads on Google are <a href="https://www.spyfu.com/blog/google-ads-vs-bing-ads/#:~:text=We%20found%20a%2030%25%20higher%20CTR%20from%20our,3.17%25%20Bing%E2%80%99s%20CTR%20for%20all%20industries%20%3D%202.83%25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30%</a> greater than on Bing.

Restructuring the brand&#39;s architecture under Alphabet? Earnings growth has, mostly, been a function of finding new ways to extract profits from its monopoly: Google search results have become a billboard for Google-sponsored results interspersed with content harvested from other sites and links to Google&#39;s own services. In 2020, <em><a href="https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/07/28/how-we-analyzed-google-search-results-web-assay-parsing-tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Markup</a></em> found that Google-associated results (ads for or links to the company&#39;s other services) constituted over 60% of the first screen of an average Google search result. And in 1 of 5 searches, <em>the entire first screen is Google results</em> . This is the meat of its business: Search ads generate <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">57% of the company&#39;s revenue</a> . </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215391" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="544" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart-300x181.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart-520x314.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart-768x464.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart-1536x928.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Iphone-chart-1200x725.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite turning search results into a carousel of ads and Google services, Google has racked up 90% market share in search queries — 95% on mobile.如何？ As Microsoft once did, it leverages its control over the most popular mobile operating system (Android) and spends unprecedented sums on deals assuring it is the default search engine on computers and phones — more than $10 billion per year. Google says it&#39;s the leader because it has the best product, but if that&#39;s so … why pay $10 billion a year to be the default? Dominance in search is also self-fulfilling, as it gives the company unrivaled data re what people search for and what results generate clicks. And Google&#39;s ability to harvest additional data from adjacent products, including Mail, makes it increasingly difficult for competitors to get traction.</span></p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">One difference?

In addition, today&#39;s tech giants recognize CEO “likability” is key. Wojcicki, Pichai, and Sandberg made millions for their management skills, but billions as likability heat shields for their businesses&#39; abuses.</span></p><h4>新镀金时代</h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ&#39;s current lawsuit, one of several actions the federal government has taken against tech companies on antitrust and other grounds, reflects a much needed renewal of our free market instincts. Yes, government action is a component of a free market, despite what the techno-libertarian crowd would have you believe. Markets are not the product of divine creation coupled with a laissez-faire approach to regulation but a function of human effort that depends on rules and enforcement to work efficiently. We&#39;ve lost our way with respect to this (see above: lobbying) and are paying the price with declining competition and innovation.</span></p><h4> Concentrate</h4><p> And not just in tech. Three companies control <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/business/dr-pepper-history/index.html#:~:text=By%20volume%2C%20Coca%2DCola%20controlled,according%20to%20Beverage%20Digest's%20data." target="_blank" rel="noopener">95%</a> of the US beverage market.

Four airlines control over two-thirds of US air travel, though they are substandard — the highest-ranked US airline by quality of service is Delta … in <a href="https://www.worldairlineawards.com/worlds-top-100-airlines-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20th place</a> , behind Air New Zealand. The next is United, in 49th place, trailing Azul Brazilian and Malaysia Airlines. Monopoly has its privileges, however: In 2014 the <em>Economist</em> calculated that US airlines generated $22.40 in profits per passenger, while European airlines, subject to the rigors of a free market, earned just $7.84.</p><p> We see similar consolidation in banking, pharmaceuticals, health care, retail drug stores, publishing (where the DOJ recently had a big win, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/penguin-random-house-blocked-from-acquiring-rival-publisher-simon-schuster-11667257838" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopping the merger</a> of Penguin Random House with Simon &amp; Schuster), <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/10/the-invisible-power-of-big-glasses-eyewear-industry-essilor-luxottica" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eyeglasses</a> , and <a href="https://www.fooddive.com/news/beer-industry-scrutinized-by-treasury-department-following-wave-of-consolid/618587/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beer</a> . <a href="https://www.capitalgroup.com/advisor/insights/articles/global-consolidation-5-charts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Waves of consolidation</a> are washing over nearly every sector. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215387" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1100" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-768x440.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bar-chart-1200x688.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><h4> Oxygenation</h4><p> Antitrust enforcement actions are perceived as punishments or moral judgments, but we should think of them as recognition. If a company is good enough for long enough, it can achieve market dominance and earn its profits from stifling competition vs. competing on products or services. It&#39;s the logical, shareholder-driven thing to do. And when we stop them, the benefits accrue to almost everyone. When the US broke up Standard Oil in 1911, its largest shareholder, John D. Rockefeller, became the wealthiest man in the world: The separated companies, free to compete and innovate in the market, were worth dramatically more than when bundled together. The breakup of AT&amp;T <a href="https://www.promarket.org/2023/02/20/when-considering-breaking-up-big-tech-we-should-look-back-to-att/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlocked enormous value in the telecommunications industry</a> , leading to more patents, more profits, and eventually the fertile ground needed for the internet market explosion in the 1990s. Microsoft wasn&#39;t broken up in 2001, but it flourished despite the limitations the DOJ put on it, becoming a more innovative company. The action also fired the starting gun for growth in a sector that&#39;s created enormous stakeholder value. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215393" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1200" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent-300x188.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent-520x325.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent-768x480.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent-1536x960.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-patent-1200x750.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><p> This month&#39;s trial concerning Google&#39;s search dominance likely won&#39;t lead to the breakup of Alphabet. However, I believe severing YouTube and Google would create significant value for shareholders, employees, and customers, who&#39;d see their rents decline. Soon after the breakup, the Alphabet board would demand a strategy for competing in video, and the newly constituted YouTube board would ask how the company was going to challenge its former parent in text search. Even without a breakup, limitations on Google&#39;s ability to perform infanticide on emerging competitors would be welcome. History suggests we are at the start of another 25-year cycle. Just as the web was driving innovation in 1998 (when Google was founded) and personal computers drove Microsoft&#39;s early success, AI appears to be the emerging volcanic force. We need to ensure that the nascent challengers to Google (and to Meta and Apple and Amazon) have the light, air, and space needed to survive and create trillions in shareholder value and hundreds of thousands of jobs.</p><h4> Ground Zero</h4><p> This isn&#39;t about just search engine advertising, or even tech. The power of incumbents to suffocate insurgents before they can grow is mirrored in our society at large. Ground zero for many of the biggest challenges facing America can be traced to one core problem: For the first time in our nation&#39;s history, 30-year-olds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUl5rSpfCeI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren&#39;t doing as well</a> as their parents were at 30. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-215392" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1200" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children-300x188.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children-520x325.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children-768x480.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children-1536x960.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-children-1200x750.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p><p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This creates rage, shame, and a loss of faith in one another and the country. Limiting Google&#39;s default deals or breaking it up won&#39;t cure these ills. But it&#39;s a step, and a model for what we need to do elsewhere: clear incumbent overgrowth, creating the light and space for the young to prosper.</span></p><p> Life is so rich, </p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/nmnm_images/Scott-Signature-NMNM.png" /></p><p> PS My newest lecture, The AI Optimist, is happening next week.

The doomed nation, according to Americans? A: America.</p><p> In the &#39;80s, we decided Japan was doing to us economically what they couldn&#39;t do militarily four decades prior. My second year in business school (Berkeley &#39;92) was devoted to a forensic analysis of our loss to Japan. Computers and cars were the future, and Japan was building them faster, better, and cheaper. In 1984, Walter Mondale asked Reagan at the presidential debates, “What do we want our kids to do? Sweep up around the Japanese computers?” Three years later, Paul Kennedy wrote a book about it, <em>The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers</em> , comparing the US empire to the British empire. Japan&#39;s GDP soared to 40% of ours, and we feared what might happen when that number hit 100. It never did. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215381" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-01.png" alt="" width="900" height="516" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-01.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-01-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-01-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-01-768x440.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-01-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-01-1200x688.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> In the early aughts, our soft tissue was geopolitical. The tragedy of 9/11 was described as an “inevitable outcome.” Our subsequent invasion of Afghanistan inspired books including <em>Dark Ages America: The Final Phase of Empire</em> , and <em>Are We Rome? The Fall of an Empire and the Fate of America</em> . Each offered a similar theme: Our time was running out.</p><p> Today the decline is (supposedly) more imminent. January 6 was the “ <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/us-news/2021/12/20/january-6-the-beginning-of-the-end-to-american-democracy/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">beginning of the end</a> .” Russia&#39;s invasion revealed a “ <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/08/europe-america-military-empire-decline/670960/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">great unwinding</a> .” Nations view us “ <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/29/bucerius-global-leadership-america-democratic-decline/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">with pity</a> ,” and we are “ <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/america-unrecognizable-brink-collapse-experts-warn-turning-own-legacy" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">on the brink of collapse</a> .” Just last week, the <em>New York Times</em> opinion page compared us <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/04/opinion/america-rome-empire.html?smid=url-share" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">to Rome</a> (again). These headlines are click bait, and we still take the bait: Three-quarters of Americans believe our country is in structural decline, and the song of the summer is an <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/rich-men-north-of-richmond-billboard-charts-b2398459.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">ode to our demise</a> . </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215379" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/people-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="461" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/people-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/people-chart-300x154.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/people-chart-520x266.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/people-chart-768x393.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/people-chart-1536x786.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/people-chart-1200x614.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> It&#39;s not just the public. Among economists there&#39;s a growing school of thought that our situation is dire. Two months ago, ratings agency Fitch <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/fitch-downgrades-united-states-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa-outlook-stable-01-08-2023" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">downgraded</a> America&#39;s credit rating due to “fiscal deterioration” and “erosion of governance.” The debt ceiling debacle didn&#39;t help: Investors “ <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/24085743-7cec-41a8-8d97-7d9e05a75df6" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">should worry</a> .” Our debt-to-GDP ratio is hovering around 120%; back when it was 70%, Brookings called it <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-real-national-security-threat-americas-debt/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">“the real national security threat.”</a></p><p> Many believe we are in the midst of “dedollarization,” ceding our status as the world&#39;s reserve currency because of our unsustainable spending habits and an overall loss of faith globally. JPMorgan recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/signs-de-dollarisation-emerge-dollar-top-currency-jpmorgan-2023-06-05/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">flagged it</a> , an ex-CIA adviser plainly <a href="https://mronline.org/2023/06/09/ex-cia-advisor-predicts-date-when-u-s-dollar-hegemony-will-collapse/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">predicted it</a> , and one prominent tech investor <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/18/buy-now-2-trillion-fed-bazooka-triggers-shock-hyperinflation-warning-amid-bitcoin-ethereum-and-crypto-price-boom/?sh=43a0558b7f38" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">bet $1 million</a> on it. Ray Dalio, the founder of the world&#39;s largest hedge fund, hinges his recent bestseller, <em>Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order</em> , on America&#39;s inability to adapt to our loss of status and power. Empires win and lose their hegemony depending on their reserve currency status, and in Ray&#39;s view, we&#39;re near freefall.</p><h4> We&#39;re Not</h4><p> Culturally you could build a compelling case. National pride is at an <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/394202/record-low-extremely-proud-american.aspx" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">all-time low</a> , and the “vibe” in America is that things are not good. (See above: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqSA-SY5Hro" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">the song</a> .) But these are functions of perception, and as I&#39;ve written before, <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/cognitive-dissonance/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">human perception is flawed</a> .</p><p> This is an economic discussion. And when you look at the data, you&#39;ll find every diagnosis of our supposedly terminal illness is proof the doctor is jonesing for us to die. We&#39;ll examine them, but first, a brief summary of the doomer&#39;s economic vision for America. It goes roughly as follows:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 1) America keeps borrowing more money, leading to an increased burden of interest payments.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 2) Foreign nations increasingly question our ability to make good on our debts, leading to low demand for US Treasuries and thus low demand for dollars.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 3) Once dedollarization takes effect and the dollar is supplanted as the world&#39;s reserve currency, the US will be forced to ratchet up Treasury yields to increase demand for our debt, leading to even greater interest payments.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 4) This will crowd out private investment, as well as public investment in our own infrastructure. GDP growth will grind to a halt, and eventually we&#39;ll default on our debt.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 5) At that point we&#39;ll be unable to borrow or finance our growth, and</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 6) America will collapse.</p><h4> Dedollarized</h4><p> Doomsday is due next century or next year, depending on who you ask. (That ex-CIA adviser said it&#39;d be last month.) But the catalysts are consistent, and one of them is this notion of dedollarization.</p><p> The argument is that foreign central banks are losing interest in the dollar. The stat dedollarists point to is that the dollar has fallen from 70% share of the world&#39;s currency reserves to 60% in the past 20 years. That may sound significant, but the scope is comically small. When you zoom out you find that in the &#39;80s our share was 50%, and 30 years before it was 40%. The only accurate description of the dollar&#39;s reserve status over the past 75 years is … unwaveringly dominant. At 20%, the next-best option (the euro) is not within striking distance. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215376" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-02.png" alt="" width="900" height="516" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-02.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-02-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-02-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-02-768x440.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-02-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-02-1200x688.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> However, it&#39;s not the euro dedollarists are talking about, but the currencies of ascendant nations, including China. A common headline is “Yuan&#39;s share of global reserves hits record high.” Less common is any mention of that “high”: 2.6%. The president of Brazil made headlines recently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">calling on</a> the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) to join forces to create a new global reserve currency. The world&#39;s reaction was lackluster — and even South Africa&#39;s own central bank governor <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/what-is-brics-currency-could-one-be-adopted-2023-08-23/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">played it down</a> : “If you want it, you&#39;ll have to get a banking union, you&#39;ll have to get a fiscal union, you&#39;ve got to get macroeconomic convergence.” Translation: pipe dream.</p><p> Another pipe the hallucinations flow through is bitcoin. Among its many use cases is its potential to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/cryptoverse-10-billion-reasons-bitcoin-could-become-reserve-currency-2022-04-12/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">supplant the dollar</a> . The argument: The value of the dollar is predicated on faith in the US government; the value of bitcoin is predicated on faith in, well, bitcoin. Many bitcoin bulls argued the latter will ultimately win — and for a second there in 2021, it looked feasible. As with every other dollar competitor, though, the cryptocurrency ran out of steam. Today the total value of bitcoin is 12 times smaller than the amount of dollars held in global central bank reserves. So next time someone tells you the dollar will be replaced, ask: With what? By any metric, the most innovative payment platform or store of value has been, and remains, USD. More good news: Minting dollars doesn&#39;t require the energy consumption of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Argentina</a> . But I digress. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215377" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/columns-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="525" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/columns-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/columns-chart-300x175.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/columns-chart-520x303.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/columns-chart-768x448.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/columns-chart-1536x896.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/columns-chart-1200x700.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><h4> Theory of Relativity</h4><p> Arguments for America&#39;s decline are rarely accompanied by a credible alternative. This is true of the dollar, and it&#39;s also true of US debt.</p><p> Take Fitch&#39;s downgrade of our national credit rating, for example. What should have been a seismic shock to the global bond market by the premier ratings agency turned out to be a catastrophist headline. The bond market barely registered the news, with the 10-year Treasury yield inching up 4 basis points. Goldman put it deftly: “We do not believe there are any meaningful holders of Treasury securities who will be forced to sell due to a downgrade.” Jamie Dimon put it better: The downgrade was <a href="https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-080223/card/jamie-dimon-calls-fitch-downgrade-ridiculous--EyRt09DjeiPvbY2HNWNm?mod=livecoverage_web" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">“ridiculous.”</a></p><p> As with currencies, creditworthiness is relative. The question creditors should ask isn&#39;t “how likely am I to get my money back,” it&#39;s “who&#39;s <em>more</em> likely to give me my money back?” And when it comes to sovereign debt, there is no better option than the United States. Sure, Xi Jinping may make Biden look like a web browser with 19 tabs open, not knowing where the music is coming from — but the Chinese Communist Party also systematically <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-delays-release-economic-indicators-including-q3-gdp-2022-10-17/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">withholds</a> , <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/15/business/china-youth-unemployment.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">suspends</a> , and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-forensic-examination-of-chinas-national-accounts/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">lies</a> about the nation&#39;s economic data. The Party has even ordered its own economists to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b2e0ad77-3521-4da9-8120-1f0c1fdd98f8" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">stop talking</a> about negative trends. Who would you rather lend to?</p><h4> False Prophets</h4><p> This extends beyond national debt. There are several linchpin data points declinists point to that are supposed to forecast our imminent undoing, but the people who cite them also forget to compare those metrics to those of other nations.</p><p> For example: inflation. Last year, inflation hit a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/13/economy/cpi-inflation-june/index.html#:~:text=Inflation%20surged%20to%20a%20new%20pandemic-era%20peak%20in,by%208.6%25%20for%20the%20year%20ended%20in%20May." target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">40-year high</a> . Some predicted America would enter a period of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/balaji-srinivasan-says-hyperinflation-happening-now-makes-million-dollar-bets-on-bitcoin-price-exceeding-1m-in-90-days/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">hyperinflation</a> . However, when you compare our situation to those of other nations, it&#39;s less bad. Significantly less bad. In the US, prices have risen 3.2% year over year. In the UK, it&#39;s 6.8% — more than double. In the eurozone, it&#39;s 5.3%. And yet — despite US inflation continuing to come down and wage growth recently <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pay-raises-are-finally-beating-inflation-after-two-years-of-falling-behind-3e89bc2d" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">surpassing it</a> — 74% of Americans still believe inflation is <a href="https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/WSJ_Poll_Aug_2023.pdf?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">headed in the wrong direction</a> . </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215380" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inflation.png" alt="" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inflation.png 960w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inflation-300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inflation-520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/inflation-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> Another catastrophist go-to: the debt-to-GDP ratio. Currently, our national debt amounts to 120% of our GDP. In other words, we&#39;re borrowing more money than we&#39;re making. Sounds bad. Until you look at other nations and realize it&#39;s, wait for it, less bad. Singapore is at 130%, Italy, at 150%, and Japan, at 260%.</p><p> For years, economists have been drawing red lines around “no-go” debt-to-GDP numbers, but time has shown these red lines are also meaningless. The Maastricht Treaty said don&#39;t go higher than <a href="https://www.bundesbank.de/en/statistics/public-finances/maastricht-deficit-and-debt-level/maastricht-deficit-and-debt-level-793140" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">60%</a> . The World Bank, <a href="https://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/1813-9450-5391" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">77%</a> . One landmark Harvard study, “Growth in a Time of Debt,” claimed 90% was the tipping point. That study caused panic until three years later researchers found the data was faulty and the conclusion <a href="https://peri.umass.edu/images/WP322.pdf" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">wrong</a> . The reality is there is no magic number. Japan is at 260% and Botswana, 20%. Would you rather hold Japanese yen or Botswanan pula?</p><h4> Vitals</h4><p> By nearly every measure, America is doing just fine. Better than fine. Our annual GDP is $26 trillion — 40% greater than China&#39;s, whose population is four times larger. And, despite our enormous output, our economy is still growing, with <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2023/gross-domestic-product-second-quarter-2023-advance-estimate" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">2.4%</a> GDP growth last quarter. China&#39;s is higher, but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-q2-gdp-growth-slows-08-qq-just-above-expectations-2023-07-17/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">slowing</a> faster than expected. Meanwhile the yuan continues to slide and this week hit a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-economic-woes-mount-yuan-193616370.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFHvi1YBbEpGlSYbrfLApuMW1Ke5TixdDL0Omrr_A5ie1xrktJGjtxS0Ng-cUimAjqC0KrpZ2qSGa2dfDuMpzkE5RbGI6p61Cvl6fAMvs3grsT5jBP_4fp7w8K4jhjZLY9yzGvPSfOzLBH0ZrP7QQFVtnB8WHQSw-VBAAWnARwz1" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">16-year low</a> . We have many unique advantages, including unrivaled innovation, the best universities, the best military, strong rule of law, a willingness to embrace risk, and a culture of doing the right thing (I believe this). Last year, US startups received <a href="https://dealroom.co/guides/global" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">$245 billion</a> in venture funding — roughly equal to the rest of the world combined. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215378" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bubble-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bubble-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bubble-chart-300x169.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bubble-chart-520x293.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bubble-chart-768x432.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bubble-chart-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bubble-chart-1200x675.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> Upstream in the public markets, we remain dominant. Nine of the ten largest companies in the world are domained in America. Nvidia, the undisputed leader in AI, the next world-changing technology, is headquartered in Santa Clara. Investors have reaped the benefits, and continue to wager their money on America. In the past decade the US stock market has returned <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-united-states-bmi/#overview" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">10%</a> per year. Compare that to Europe ( <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-europe-bmi/#overview" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">2%</a> ) or China ( <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-china-bmi/#overview" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">0.09%</a> ) or Australia ( <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-australia-bmi/#overview" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">-0.2%</a> ).</p><p> Meanwhile, our near-term economic prospects look good. <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Unemployment</a> is hovering at record lows. Inflation has fallen precipitously and is low relative to our peers (see above). <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2022/demo/SEHSD-wp2022-24.html#:~:text=We%20find%20that%20the%20Child,lifted%20above%20the%20poverty%20line." target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Poverty rates</a> are in decline. <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/disposable-income-by-country" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">Disposable income</a> is higher than any other country. We have a lot to be proud of.</p><h4> Exceptionalism</h4><p> The schadenfreude we feel for our own country when it stumbles is nothing new. In fact, I would argue that in a democracy this is a feature not a bug. Things appear brighter when our favored political party is at the helm, and vice versa when it isn&#39;t. A case in point is the consumer sentiment index, which is supposed to be an economic barometer, but is really a political one. In 2019 Republicans felt great about the economy, Democrats less so. Then Biden got elected and the relationship flipped. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215375" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-03.png" alt="" width="900" height="516" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-03.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-03-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-03-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-03-768x440.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-03-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-chart-03-1200x688.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> People will argue I&#39;m optimistic because a Democrat&#39;s in charge. I recognize my political bias and intentionally adjust for it. And still, when I look at the US economy and America&#39;s position as a global power, I repeatedly land on a singular conclusion: The glass is half-full.</p><p> This conclusion won&#39;t sell books nor grow this newsletter — history has proven that “Things Marginally Better Today” does not get clicks. But it&#39;s the truth. And the truth, as with most things in life, is usually not as good or bad as we&#39;d hoped. We are the least bad of our kind. When I look at the data, much less my personal situation, I can&#39;t help but hate my life less and less every day.</p><p> If you are healthy, have someone who loves you, and enjoy a household income greater than $34,000, then you are in the top 1% globally.

I wrote the following post 18 months ago during the froth and, as our subscribers have grown 50% and we enjoy a 44% open rate … three quarters of you have not read it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p><hr /><p>[The following was originally published on January 21, 2022.]</p><p> <em>“A man&#39;s reach should exceed his grasp, or what&#39;s a heaven for?”</em></p><p> — Robert Browning</p><p> Entrepreneur is a synonym for salesperson, and salesperson is the pedestrian term for storyteller. Pro tip: No startup makes sense. We (entrepreneurs) are all impostors who must deploy a fiction (ie story) that captures imaginations and capital to pull the future forward and turn rhyme into reason. No business I have started, at the moment of inception, made any sense … until it did. Or didn&#39;t. The only way to predict the future is to make it.</p><p> This is not the same as lying. There&#39;s a real distinction between an entrepreneur and a liar: Entrepreneurs believe their story will come true. This requires confidence … and delusion. It helps to be somewhat detached from reality — to assume that, for whatever reason, <em>you</em> are the one who can see into the future, and that in the new world your product/service will be needed and successful, despite overwhelming evidence (ie the current reality) that it&#39;s not. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">reality distortion field</a> if you will.</p><h4> The Crazy Ones</h4><p> A vision that&#39;s not widely derided likely isn&#39;t much of a vision. MLK was a radical reformer who had a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/17/politics/mlk-polling-analysis/index.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">63% disapproval rating</a> at the height of his activism. Women were perceived as physically incapable of the demands of flight, until Amelia Earhart landed her Lockheed Vega in an Irish farmer&#39;s field. Steve Jobs was a Zen Buddhist college dropout who believed he didn&#39;t need to shower because he only ate fruit and that you could treat pancreatic cancer with juice therapy. He also believed he could put computers in the homes and pockets of everyone on Earth. Crazy.</p><p> Being a great storyteller carries risks. Success begets acolytes who tell you you&#39;re right when you&#39;re wrong. Worse, you start believing them. This leads down a dangerous path where vision breaks from reality, and — likely aided by a fear of failure — curdles your confidence into a con.</p><h4> Elizabeth Holmes</h4><p> Holmes was assembled in a factory from parts of prior visionaries: smart, Stanford dropout, turtleneck, building blood-testing technology. Plus a nice backstory: Her professor told her the original concept for Theranos would never work. In addition, hundreds of millions in funding from backers including Tim Draper and Larry Ellison, coupled with covers on <em>Fortune</em> and <em>Forbes</em> , were a heavy blanket of affirmation that ensured Ms. Holmes was a visionary. The visionary narrative is a self-perpetuating machine: a flywheel of storytelling, capital, and the future that capital can pull forward, which buttresses the storytelling, and so on and so on.</p><p> Fun fact: Ms. Holmes cost her investors less than a billion dollars, didn&#39;t make any real money herself, and is going to prison. Adam Neumann cost his investors $11 billion, received a 10% commission on those losses, and is going to Coachella. Note: Ms. Holmes&#39;s vision progressed to the exaggeration/fabrication of contracts and clients, whereas Mr. Neumann&#39;s “only” went so far as accounting irregularities.</p><h4> When I Say Steve, You Say Jobs</h4><p> Fast forward: There was no working technology, and Ms. Holmes has been convicted by a jury of her peers — and faces <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/03/tech/elizabeth-holmes-verdict/index.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">20 years</a> in prison. Soon after, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/04/technology/elizabeth-holmes-verdict.html" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">VCs distanced themselves</a> , claiming they&#39;d seen through the facade. The tell for people who exaggerate for a living is, after it&#39;s been deemed illegal, they begin preaching the importance of restraint. The narrative being wrapped around the very unlikeable Ms. Holmes is that she&#39;s an outlier. No, she&#39;s just one point on the line that is our storytelling economy in a frothy part of the cycle.</p><p> The Valley&#39;s <a href="https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/what-happens-when-you-fake-it-and-dont-make-it-elizabeth-holmes-fraud-verdict-offers-a-warning/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">“always tell the truth”</a> sermon is reductionist and hypocritical. It ignores the fact that many of our nation&#39;s most valuable companies are priced on promises of technologies that don&#39;t exist. The entire venture capital industry, in fact, is predicated on promising things that don&#39;t exist.</p><p> Microsoft, perhaps the most successful tech company in history, got its break when Bill Gates <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/putting-microsoft-on-the-map-1991417" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">sold IBM an operating system</a> he didn&#39;t have. (He and Paul Allen subsequently bought what they needed from another programmer, but they didn&#39;t tell him they had the deal with IBM to distribute it.) Allegedly, an engineer at the company coined the term “vaporware” a year later. Promising something that doesn&#39;t exist is as central to the Valley ethos as late-night coding sessions, hoodies, and the hallucination that the public has asked you to solve the world&#39;s problems vs. just do less damage.</p><p> <em>“[Google Glass] will be broadly available.

The company routinely <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2017/12/20/magic_leap/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">hyped technology that didn&#39;t exist</a> , even using Hollywood special effects to mock up its PR videos. An early (fired) employee called the company&#39;s founder “ <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/09/26/magic-leap-tried-to-create-an-alternate-reality-its-founder-was-already-in-one/" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">a believer in magic</a> .” It was meant as a compliment. And the tricks keep coming. In October, Magic Leap <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721345/magic-leap-500-million-funding-ar-headset" target="”_blank”" rel="noopener">announced</a> it had raised another $550 million and was pivoting from consumer to … wait for it … health care. Nobody seems all that concerned that a company with a 12-year track record of false promises and fake products is now going into medicine. And, with the right leadership and engineers, it could build something valuable. You know … vision and capital … and more vision and more capital.</p><p> The line between vision and fraud is only drawn in hindsight. We set arbitrary deadlines for entrepreneurs to deliver on their vision, and their vision only becomes fraud when we say time&#39;s up. What if Holmes, with five more years and another billion dollars, shipped a working product? Or pivoted to a home-testing machine for an acute respiratory syndrome?</p><p> <em>“Real artists ship.”</em></p><p> — Steve Jobs</p><h4></h4><h4> Heretic</h4><p> When valuations are overwhelmingly driven by stories, things can get ugly.

Right now, we&#39;re still deep in the story phase. Capital is cheap: $621 billion went to startups in 2021, a 111% jump from 2020. We&#39;re seeing record numbers of unicorns: 959 across the globe, up from 569 in 2020. The hottest sector is fintech, which accounts for 15% of these firms — all promising to become the next JPMorgan. Are they lying or telling the truth?

Tim Draper led her seed round, and Rupert Murdoch invested $100 million. <em>That’s</em> what brings the feds to your door.

Richard, a writer and a scholar whose work focuses on what I believe are pressing issues, has become my Yoda regarding the conversation concerning failing young men. We hosted Richard on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/failing-young-men-with-richard-reeves/id1498802610?i=1000584062413" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof G Pod</a> last fall, and it was our most-listened-to episode. He&#39;s a blue-flame thinker who combines data-driven insights with empathy and a perspective. You can hear from him regularly via his substack, <a href="https://ofboysandmen.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Of Boys and Men</a> . His 2022 book, <a href="https://a.co/d/hznt8K9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Of Boys and Men: Why the Modern Male Is Struggling, Why It Matters, and What to Do About It</a> , is a landmark book on the topic.</p><hr /><h4> Head of the Class</h4><p> <strong>by Richard Reeves</strong></p><p> My favorite high school teacher was Mr. Wyatt. He taught English, mostly poetry and Shakespeare. He was also a Korean War veteran, a part-time bus driver, and a curmudgeon. I loved him. And because of him, I also came to love reading and writing. It&#39;s no exaggeration to say that he changed my life.</p><p> Mr. Wyatt was living proof that masculinity and literacy could go together. To a 15-year-old boy, that really mattered. Seems I&#39;m not alone in this regard. In the UK, where I grew up, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/30/primaryschools.malerolemodels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 in 2 men</a> say a male teacher was an important role model. Ask the men in your lives about the educator who had the biggest impact on them; most will name a man.</p><p> But my own sons had fewer opportunities to connect with a male teacher, for the simple reason that there are many fewer of them around. In 1980 men accounted for 33% of K-12 teachers in the US Today it&#39;s down to 23%. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215357" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio.png" alt="" width="901" height="516" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-768x440.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-1200x688.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px" /></p><p> If the male share had remained at 1980 levels, we would have an extra 400,000 men teaching in our schools. (That&#39;s more than the total number of teachers in California.) The male share is set to drop even further unless something&#39;s done about it: In the 2019-20 school year, only <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ctes/tables/p131.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18% of education majors</a> in college were men.</p><p> Each year, the National Center on Education Statistics publishes a report blandly titled “ <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/clr/public-school-teachers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Characteristics of Public School Teachers</a> ” showing the steadily falling share of male teachers. Each year, it fails to get any serious attention from either the media or policymakers.</p><p> If the share of women was declining in a major profession, it would, quite rightly, generate headlines. There is lots of concern, for example, about the lack of women in the tech industry. Among the workers at the big five companies — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft — only 31% are women. That 31% may well be too low a share of women in Big Tech, but it&#39;s a lot higher than the 23% share of men in education. The lack of women in tech is often described as an existential crisis, while the lack of men in schools merits barely a mention.</p><p> Male teachers are especially scarce in the early years. Only 3% of pre-K and kindergarten teachers are men. In fact, as a share of their professions, there are twice as many women flying US military planes as there are men teaching kindergarten. </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215356" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-03.png" alt="" width="900" height="516" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-03.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-03-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-03-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-03-768x440.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-03-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teachers-gender-ratio-03-1200x688.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p> “It takes some degree either of social ignorance or of personal courage for a man to enter teaching at the elementary school level,” noted education professor <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/male-teachers-share-advice-for-getting-more-men-into-the-profession/2021/03" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Brown</a> . For a man to teach young children, he wrote, “is to spit in the face of a strong societal stereotype.” That was in 1960. Today I&#39;d wager the stigma is, if anything, even greater.</p><p> My own son, who teaches at the elementary level, has faced stigma and suspicion. A man who wants to work with children is seen as, well, weird. This is a vicious cycle. The more scarce men become in teaching, the weirder a decision to enter the profession will seem. My fear is that we are close to a tipping point, where, almost by definition, non-weird men will think twice about choosing teaching as a career option. (My son, for the record, is not weird.)</p><p> “If this trend continues, we may see a day when 8 of 10 teachers will be female,” wrote Richard Ingersoll and his colleagues in a <a href="https://repository.upenn.edu/items/f179131d-02df-47a7-b24d-0201ce0521e5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 report from the University of Pennsylvania</a> (one of the very few attempts to draw attention to this crisis). “Given the importance of teachers as role models, and even as surrogate parents for some students, certainly some will see this trend as a problem and a policy concern.”</p><p> I do think it is a problem and a policy concern. The emptying out of men from our schools is bad news for at least three reasons.</p><p> First, having a male teacher improves educational outcomes, especially in certain subjects like English (where boys are lagging furthest behind girls). One study suggests that If half the English teachers in middle schools were men the achievement gap in reading between girls and boys would <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/the-why-chromosome/#:~:text=For%20three%20subject%20areas%E2%80%94science,8%20percent%20of%20a%20standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fall by approximately a third</a> — a massive effect. (Important note: the performance of girls in English doesn&#39;t seem to be affected by teacher gender.)</p><p> But it turns out that English, where male teachers might have the biggest classroom impact, is the subject men are least likely to teach. Men account for <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ntps/tables/ntps1718_21011202_t1n.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 1 in 10 middle school English teachers</a> .</p><p> Second, male teachers are much more likely to take on after-school activities, especially coaching sports teams. A recent <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/gender-wage-gaps-policy-brief/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brookings study</a> finds a gender pay gap among K-12 teachers of about $2,200 a year in favor of men. The difference in base pay is just $700 a year. Most of the gap, about $1,200 a year, is explained by the extra pay men get from doing extracurricular work.</p><p> The researchers write about this as a problem to be solved. Which it is, if the only thing we&#39;re worried about is the gender pay gap. But if male teachers are working extra hours to coach their students on the soccer field or debate stage, and getting paid for it, I&#39;m more inclined to clap than wring my hands.</p><p> The role of coaches in the lives of many students is close to a sacred one in our culture. This is especially true for boys without dads. And there are more of those all the time. Since 1980, the share of children being raised by a single mom has risen from 18% to 24%.</p><p> So: More homes without dads and more classrooms without misters. That&#39;s a bad combination.</p><p> Third, the men in our schools are mentors to both male and female students. A <a href="https://t.co/0zyZ7127wa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent study</a> published by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that having an informal mentor in high school improved educational performance across a range of measures; most impressive was a 9% increase in college attendance.</p><p> But one finding in the paper did not get much attention. Men make up 59% of high school mentors, even though they account for only 40% of high school teachers. So male teachers are stepping up in a big way to mentor both boys and girls.</p><p> The term “teacher” doesn&#39;t get close to describing the impact of the men and the women working in our school system. But it does a particular disservice to male teachers, who are even more likely than their female colleagues to provide coaching and mentoring to their students.</p><p> In short: Male teachers rock. So, how do we get more of them? Here are five suggestions:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 1. <strong>Increase wages.</strong> K-12 teacher pay has been <a href="https://www.nea.org/resource-library/educator-pay-and-student-spending-how-does-your-state-rank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">essentially flat</a> , in real terms, for at least a decade. According to the National Education Association, in 2019 almost <a href="https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/average-teacher-salary-down-45-over-past-decade#:~:text=Most%20Starting%20Salaries%20Are%20Still%20Below%20$40%2C000&amp;text=The%202019%20report%20shows%20that,by%202.91%20percent%20since%20then." target="_blank" rel="noopener">two-thirds</a> of school districts offered a starting salary below $40,000 a year. The low salaries are especially offputting to men. (Caveat: The teachers who should get the most money are the good ones and/or those working with the poorest students.) </p><p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-215355" src="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/line-chart.png" alt="" width="900" height="516" srcset="https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/line-chart.png 1920w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/line-chart-300x172.png 300w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/line-chart-520x298.png 520w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/line-chart-768x440.png 768w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/line-chart-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/line-chart-1200x688.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 2. <strong>Double extra-duty pay</strong> . Teachers who stay late to run clubs or coach sports should not just be rewarded, they should be doubly rewarded. Extracurricular activities provide students with precious opportunities, especially for kids from poorer backgrounds, and there&#39;s a <a href="https://projectplay.org/state-of-play-2022/physical-mental-health-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing class gap</a> in access to after-school sports.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 3. <strong>Scholarships.</strong> Generous college scholarships ought to be available to men who want to pursue education as a career, especially in crucial subjects like English. This is not a radical idea: After all, there are thousands of <a href="https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/scholarships-for-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">college scholarships for women</a> seeking to enter traditionally male fields, including STEM.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 4. <strong>Celebrate misters.</strong> School districts, counties and states should support and fund the creation of male teacher learning networks, award “Male Mentor of the Year” prizes, and plaster the faces of successful male teachers across billboards. Remember the line that feminists taught us: You can&#39;t be it if you can&#39;t see it.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"> 5. <strong>Set a 1 in 3 target.</strong> Last but not least, let&#39;s set some concrete goals. How about we aim for the same share of male teachers as when Ronald Reagan was first elected? That means at least 1 in 3 teachers should be male. School districts, states, teacher training colleges, and the Department of Education should set this 1 in 3 share as an explicit goal and publish annual progress reports. The Biden Administration has a <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2022/10/secretary-raimondo-calls-more-women-construction-industry-nabtu-tradeswomen-build" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Million Women Into Construction Initiative</a> . California awards <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/DAS/e-News/2022/25-million.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$25 million a year</a> in grants toward the same end.伟大的！ Where are the equivalent initiatives and investments to get Men Into Education?</p><p> Unless we act quickly, there will be fewer and fewer men in our classrooms every passing year. If policymakers don&#39;t think that&#39;s a problem, they should explain why not.
