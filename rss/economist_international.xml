data-caps="initial">唐纳德</span><small>·特朗普</small>关于乌克兰战争的花言巧语在战场上飘荡，如同俄罗斯炸弹笼罩的黑暗。 “我希望每个人都停止死亡。他们快死了。俄罗斯人和乌克兰人，”他在五月宣称。如果明年连任总统，他将“在 24 小时内”结束战争。如何？他没有明说，但他的话暗示停止对乌克兰的军事援助，让俄罗斯保留其入侵的成果。</p><p class="article__body-text">如果是这样，“不受约束的特朗普”的回归——比他的第一个任期更怨恨、更有组织、更少约束——可能对乌克兰来说是一场灾难。从其他方面来说，这对欧洲来说可能是一场灾难。他很可能从他的第一个任期开始就发出离开<small>北约的威胁。</small>他将在国会面临严厉的反对。但联盟依赖于信任。仅仅暗示他不会为盟友而战就可能彻底摧毁俄罗斯正在试图的欧洲秩序。

class="article__body-text">在乔·拜登总统的领导下，美国向乌克兰提供了大部分<a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/02/21/military-and-financial-support-to-ukraine-hits-a-record-high">军事援助</a>，并领导西方做出反应。如果这场战争显示了美国保护的价值，那么特朗普的民粹主义可能会证明它的消失速度有多快。</p><p class="article__body-text">因此，欧洲各国政府面临着三种恐惧：俄罗斯的攻击、中国的经济削弱以及美国的放弃。法国对这三个问题给出了明确的答案：欧洲“战略自主”。 5 月，法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙 (Emmanuel Macron) 在布拉迪斯拉发发表讲话时提出了一个难以启齿的问题：“（美国）政府会永远保持不变吗？没有人能说清楚，我们不能将我们的集体安全和稳定委托给美国选民的选择。”他认为，欧洲人需要能够保卫自己，不仅在军事上，而且在经济上。</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image"

href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/01/12/the-destructive-new-logic-that-threatens-globalisation">保护主义程度并不比特朗普</a>低。在欧洲的强烈抗议中，他告诉马克龙，他“不知道”《通货膨胀削减法案》中的巨额绿色补贴会威胁欧洲的工业。</p><p class="article__body-text">他们认为，美国的首要任务是<a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/03/30/americas-commercial-sanctions-on-china-could-get-much-worse">与中国的竞争</a>。迟早，即使是拜登先生也会希望减少在欧洲的工作，而将重点放在亚洲。如果台湾爆发危机，可能会更早。未来的民主党或共和党总统之间的区别可能只是美国从欧洲转向的速度和程度。大多数欧洲政府并不完全同意这一分析——美国对欧洲的军事承诺正在增加——但很少有人忽视这一点。</p><p class="article__body-text">如果被抛弃，欧洲还能自力更生吗？理论上是的。欧洲<small>北约</small>盟国已实现工业化，人口近 6 亿。他们拥有近 200 万人的武装人员和数十年的合作经验。其中两个国家——英国和法国——拥有核武器并拥有<small>联合国</small>安理会常任理事国席位。</p><p class="article__body-text">诚然，<small>北约</small>得到了美国实力的支持，美国的军费占<small>北约</small>军费总额的三分之二。美国30个盟国中只有10个能够实现今年国防开支占<small>GDP</small> 2%的目标。即使这样也应该足以抵御俄罗斯。智库斯德哥尔摩国际和平研究所估计，欧洲盟国在 2022 年总共花费了 3330 亿美元。相比之下，俄罗斯的支出可能为 860 亿美元。考虑到其更大的购买力，将该金额增加一倍或三倍仍然存在很大差距。但欧洲并没有采取集体行动。它的开支分散在数十个实力往往不足的陆军、空军和海军上。其中大部分都流向了备受宠爱的民族工业。 </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J

）最近发表的一篇论文指出，从根本上来说，欧洲人遭受着“附庸化”的痛苦。欧洲人在优先事项上没有达成一致。他们彼此之间也没有足够的信任来决定应该采取什么更大的自主权。欧洲两个最重要的机构——<small>北约</small>和<small>欧盟</small>——并不完全契合。英国、挪威和土耳其等重要盟友均处于<small>欧盟</small>之外。集体防御是<small>北约</small>的事，由美国指挥。经济政策主要由<small>欧盟</small>制定，欧盟的成立是为了与军事联盟对立。尤其是法国，一直试图利用它来制衡美国。</p><h2>一个人去吗？</h2><p class="article__body-text">尽管<small>北约</small>峰会在 7 月 11 日承诺“只要需要”就支持乌克兰，如果美国放弃乌克兰，欧洲人还会继续战争吗？一些外交官表示他们会这样做；但也有一些外交官表示他们会这样做。许多人对此表示怀疑。欧洲的核武库比美国的核武库规模更小、消耗更严重。它的国防工业也遭受着与美国类似的弊病——按时生产处于和平时期的水平——而且缺乏规模。意大利智库国际研究所的娜塔莉·托奇表示，矛盾的是，随着各国争相从美国、以色列、韩国和其他国家购买现成的工具包，乌克兰战争使情况变得更糟。</p><p class="article__body-text">法国回避了德国主导的防空天盾项目，因为它依赖非欧洲供应商。德国官员反驳说，法国将战略自主视为利用德国资金支持法国企业的一种方式。尽管如此，还是取得了一些进展。<small>欧盟</small>正在为合作性武器项目提供激励措施，使用共同基金来支付军用物资，并推动企业在一年内向乌克兰供应 100 万发火炮。</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>北约</small>前助理秘书长、 <small>ECFR</small>的卡米尔·格兰德 (Camille Grand) 表示，如果特朗普让美国完全退出<small>北约</small>，欧洲人将试图接管其机制，而不是将<small>欧盟</small>变成一个军事联盟。欧洲人必须填补美国在欧洲的 85,000 多名军队所填补的缺口，其中包括总部人员和 22 个作战营（大约与英国总数大致相同）。他们还必须采购美国大量供应的昂贵的“推动者”，例如航空运输和加油、太空资产和<a href="https://www.economist.com/military-terms-a-to-z#command-control-communications-computers-intelligence-surveillance-and-reconnaissance"><small>ISR</small></a> （情报、监视和侦察）。格兰德先生相信，所有这一切可能需要欧洲十年的时间才能实现。</p><p class="article__body-text">领导力将是一个问题。即使在最好的情况下，跨国决策也很困难，在军事事务上更是如此。欧洲缺乏一位领导人来取代美国霸主。尽管德国承诺增强其军力，但它仍秉持和平主义。由于脱欧，英国与欧洲事务半脱节。法国渴望领导一个更强大的欧洲，但遭到广泛不信任。</p><p class="article__body-text">然后是核威慑。俄罗斯拥有近6000枚核弹头；英国和法国各约200-300人。格兰德认为，如果没有美国，欧洲核大国将不得不重新考虑其库存、理论以及与剩余盟友的合作。</p><p class="article__body-text">至于经济层面的自治，<small>欧盟</small>已经取得了显着进展。在布鲁塞尔，它有时被称为“开放战略自主”，以表明对世界的开放。欧洲人正在逐渐将更多的经济决策集中在<small>欧盟</small>内部。在经历了从大流行期间疫苗短缺到俄罗斯入侵等一系列冲击之后，他们有充分的理由这样做。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">最引人注目的成功是欧洲不再依赖俄罗斯的石油和天然气。来自美国和其他地方的替代供应以及<small>欧盟</small>内部能源市场（允许天然气和电力跨境交易）帮助了这一转变。<small>欧盟</small>新的经济武器库中有很大一部分是针对中国的。即将出台的“反胁迫”文书允许采取贸易报复措施，以防止<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/01/22/what-chinas-bullying-of-lithuania-reveals-about-europe">立陶宛重蹈中国在立陶宛</a>向台湾倾斜后的欺凌行为。新规定加强了对外国人投资的审查。与美国一样，国家和<small>欧盟的</small>补贴旨在促进半导体生产和绿色能源。欧洲正在与美国合作，实现关键矿产供应多元化，并限制敏感技术的对外投资。</p><p class="article__body-text">对马克龙来说，这些举措是战略自主的“基石”。 “今天意识形态之战已经胜利，”他相信。然而，两种模式正在争夺欧洲和马克龙本人的灵魂。好的版本认为，欧洲应该增强自身实力，更有能力捍卫与美国的共同价值观和利益。坏的做法是法国戴高乐主义的传统，它试图将欧洲从美国手中拉开，并建立一个与之竞争的地缘政治极点。</p><p class="article__body-text">在布拉迪斯拉发，马克龙的善良天使占了上风，他主张欧洲承担更多的国防负担。他来了个<small>180度大</small>转弯，支持乌克兰加入<small>北约</small>和<small>欧盟</small>东扩。然而一个月前，在访问北京后，他表现出了更糟糕的本性。他说，欧洲绝不能卷入中美竞争和“不属于我们的”台湾危机。此后，马克龙先生态度有所转变，派出一艘军舰通过台湾海峡。然而，他削弱了一项未宣布的协议，激怒了许多欧洲领导人：作为美国帮助击退俄罗斯的回报，欧洲应该支持其盟友遏制中国。</p><p class="article__body-text">美国智库布鲁金斯学会的康斯坦泽·施特尔岑米勒表示，特朗普的当选将是一场“预言中的灾难”。很少有欧洲领导人能对此给出好的答案。许多人忽视了它；其他人则祈祷特朗普的破坏性不会像人们担心的那么大，或许会受到国会和五角大楼的克制。有人谈到要争取他的温和派追随者。另一家智库卡内基国际和平基金会的索菲亚·贝施预测，许多人会争先恐后地与他建立“双边”关系。他们可能会诉诸奉承，例如波兰将基地重新命名为“特朗普堡”的短暂计划，或者购买更多美国武器和其他东西来为他提供“好交易”。</p><p class="article__body-text">一个问题是，特朗普的当选可能会在多大程度上推动欧洲极右翼的小特朗普。民意调查显示，德国另类选择党与德国总理奥拉夫·肖尔茨领导的社会民主党旗鼓相当。与此同时，在法国，人们越来越担心全国集会领袖马琳·勒庞 (Marine Le Pen) 可能会在 2027 年成为总统。两党都与俄罗斯关系密切，并批评西方对乌克兰的支持。正如拜登证明美国的力量可以团结欧洲人一样，特朗普也可能会展示其分裂欧洲人的力量。</p><p class="article__body-text">人们常说，<small>北约</small>的目的是“阻止苏联、阻止美国、阻止德国”。或许战略自主权也能起到类似的作用。如果它能产生更多的军事能力，当美国转向亚洲时，它将让欧洲更好地掌控自己的安全——并在这个伟大盟友变得敌对时提供对冲。事实上，这可能是驳斥特朗普贪图便宜的指控并向美国展示欧洲价值的最佳方式。如果做得好，这可能有助于将俄罗斯拒之门外，将美国拒之门外，将中国拒之门外，同时将<small>北约拒之门外</small>。

href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/06/15/joe-biden-and-narendra-modi-are-drawing-their-countries-closer">美国</a>，超过 835,000 人居住在英国，720,000 人居住在加拿大，579,000 人居住在澳大利亚。年轻的印度人涌向中东，那里的低技能建筑和酒店业工作报酬更高。阿拉伯联合酋长国有 350 万印度移民，沙特阿拉伯有 250 万印度移民（<small>联合国</small>将印度公民视为印度出生人口的代表）。更多人居住在非洲以及亚洲和加勒比地区的其他地区。</p><p class="article__body-text">印度拥有成为领先的人才输出国的基本要素：大量的年轻人和一流的高等教育。印度人对英语的掌握，这是英国殖民统治的遗产，可能也有帮助。美国智库移民政策研究所 ( <small>mpi</small> ) 的数据显示，在美国五岁以上的印度移民中，只有 22% 的人表示自己的英语能力有限，而中国移民的这一比例为 57%。</p></div><h2>事情本来的样子</h2><p class="article__body-text">自 1947 年印度独立以来，出现了几波向富裕国家移民的浪潮，使得海外侨民的数量和实力不断增长。第一个是在第二次世界大战后的几年里，涉及主要来自古吉拉特邦和旁遮普邦的低技能工人。许多人前往面临严重劳动力短缺的英国。他们在艰苦的地方工作，例如纺织厂和其他工业设备。许多在殖民时期举家作为契约劳工移居东非的印度人后来也去了西部。 1965年，美国通过彻底修改移民法，成功吸引了大批人才。禁止印度公民的配额被取消，有利于高技术移民的新规则出台。澳大利亚和加拿大随后效仿，出台了一批类似的法规。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">随着印度侨民的增长，它也变得更加多样化。越来越多来自贫困和边缘化背景的印度人移居国外。华盛顿智库卡内基国际和平基金会 2020 年发布的一项调查显示，在认同种姓群体的印度裔美国人中<small>，</small> 17% 的人认为自己是低种姓。移民不再主要来自古吉拉特邦和旁遮普邦。南印度人正在成群结队地移民。美国驻南部城市海得拉巴的领事馆是美国在南亚最大的前哨基地。与此同时，美国发展最快的语言是泰卢固语，几乎只在印度南部使用。</p><h2>大脑在移动</h2><p class="article__body-text">随着未来几十年印度人口的增长，印度人民将继续移居海外寻找有利可图的工作并躲避酷暑。富裕国家的移民规则会筛选那些能够从事需要更多员工的职业的毕业生，例如医学和信息技术。 2022 年，美国 73% 的<small>H-1B</small>签证（颁发给计算机科学家等“专业职业”技术工人）由印度出生的人获得。 </p><p

class="article__body-text">印度许多最优秀、最聪明的人似乎都做好了移民的准备。印度政府前经济顾问阿文德·萨勃拉曼尼安 (Arvind Subramanian) 表示，用经济术语来说，他们是“高度积极选择的移民”。考虑一下哈佛商学院的 Prithwiraj Choudhury、马萨诸塞大学阿默斯特分校的 Ina Ganguli 和布里斯托大学的 Patrick Gaule 即将在<i>《发展经济学杂志》</i>上发表的一篇论文的研究结果。它分析了 2010 年参加印度理工学院（该国精英工程学校）竞争激烈的入学考试的学生的成绩。八年后，研究人员发现，在 1,000 名表现最好的学生中，有 36% 移居国外，这一比例上升到62% 跻身 100 名最佳之列。大多数去了美国。</p><p class="article__body-text">另一项研究考察了人工智能领域排名前 20% 的研究人员（定义为那些论文被 2019 年竞争性会议接受的人）。研究发现，8% 的人在印度获得了第一个学位。但现在只有极少数研究人员在那里工作。</p><p class="article__body-text">根据<small>mpi 的珍妮·巴塔洛娃 (Jeanne Batalova) 的数据分析，在美国，近 80% 的印度出生的学龄以上人口至少拥有本科学位。</small>只有50%的中国出生人口和30%的总人口可以这么说。澳大利亚的情况也类似，印度出生的超过学龄人口中有近三分之二，中国出生的人口有一半，总人口中只有三分之一拥有学士或更高学位。其他富裕国家不收集可比数据。但从现有的数据来看，几乎所有地方似乎都存在同样的模式。 </p><div

称，去年从印度移民的美元百万富翁（约 7,500 人）比除中国和俄罗斯以外的任何地方都多。</p><p class="article__body-text">事实上，即使在他们移居的国家，印度移民也相对富裕。印度人是美国收入最高的移民群体，家庭年收入中位数接近 15 万美元。这是全国平均水平的两倍，远远领先于家庭收入中位数超过 95,000 美元的中国移民。在澳大利亚，印度移民的家庭收入中位数接近每年 87,000 澳元，而所有家庭的平均收入约为 62,000 澳元，中国出生的家庭平均收入约为 58,000 澳元。</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text">阅读我们有关印度的更多信息：</p><ul><li> <a

class="article__body-text">印度侨民的力量越来越多地在商界和政府高层展现出来。约翰·霍普金斯大学的德韦什·卡普尔（Devesh Kapur）和阿迪蒂·马赫什（Aditi Mahesh）统计了担任高层职位的印度裔人士的数量，其中包括出生在印度的人和祖先是印度人的人。他们确定了<small>标普 500</small>指数公司中 25 名印度裔首席执行官，而十年前这一数字为 11 名。鉴于这些公司的其他高级职位中有大量印度裔高管，这一数字几乎肯定会进一步上升。</p><h2>在顶部</h2><p class="article__body-text">直到最近，国外的印度人才开始赢得如此有声望的职位。 1960 年，梅格纳德·德赛 (Meghnad Desai) 获得了宾夕法尼亚大学的奖学金，他是美国大学里为数不多的几位印度人之一。他指出，当时的侨民并不富裕或强大。 “我记得人们说过：‘美国人永远不会让印度人担任高层职位’，”他回忆道。</p><p class="article__body-text">在科技行业，计算机制造商 Sun Microsystems 联合创始人维诺德·科斯拉 (Vinod Khosla) 解释说，在 20 世纪 80 年代的美国，印度企业家很难筹集资金。 “你们口音很奇怪，名字也很难发音，你们必须通过更高的标准，”他说。现在 Adob​​e、Alphabet、谷歌的母公司、 <small>IBM</small>和微软都由印度裔人士领导。五所领先商学院中三所的院长，包括哈佛商学院，也是如此。</p><p class="article__body-text">印度侨民在政治和政策领域也蓬勃发展。约翰·霍普金斯大学的研究人员统计了英国下议院有 19 名印度裔人士，其中包括首相里希·苏纳克 (Rishi Sunak)。他们确定了澳大利亚议会中有六名议员，美国国会有五名议员。美国副总统卡马拉·哈里斯由她的泰米尔印度母亲抚养长大。出生于印度西部浦那的阿贾伊·班加 (Ajay Banga) 在经营万事达卡十多年后，于上个月被选为世界银行行长。</p><p class="article__body-text">海外华人是世界上唯一具有同等影响力的群体。 <i>《经济学人》</i>在 covid-19 大流行开始时进行的一项分析估计，东南亚亿万富翁总财富 3,690 亿美元中，有超过四分之三由<i>华侨</i>控制。国家。</p><p class="article__body-text">在欧洲和整个北美，情况有所不同。经营<small>标准普尔 500 强</small>公司的华裔老板比印度裔老板还要少。这可能是因为许多最成功的企业类型选择留在中国，为中国基金工作并投资快速增长的中国企业，例如智能手机制造商小米、互联网搜索巨头百度和字节跳动。总部位于北京的 TikTok 母公司，一款充满视频的社交媒体应用程序。</p><h2>印度规则</h2><p class="article__body-text">此外，随着美国与中国走向新冷战，西方人越来越将中国视为敌人。始于中国武汉市的 covid-19 大流行可能使情况变得更糟。最近的恐慌——一月下旬中国间谍气球出现在美国上空，以及本月有报道称中国已与古巴政府达成协议，在岛上设立电子窃听站——进一步强化了中国的形象作为一个敌对的对手。盖洛普民意调查公司最近对美国人的态度进行的一项调查显示，84%的受访者表示他们对中国大多或非常不利。对于印度，只有 27% 的受访者表示持同样的负面看法。</p><p class="article__body-text">这种对中国的不信任渗透到政策中。华为是一家中国电信设备制造商，过去曾涉嫌违反禁运并成为中国政府间谍活动的渠道，现已在美国被禁止。一些欧洲国家也在效仿。以国家安全为由对美国公司的外国投资进行严格审查，公开针对硅谷的中国资金。被发现听从中国命令的个人，包括一名前哈佛大学教授，已受到惩罚。印度公司不会面临这样的审查。</p><figure>

）上台之前——一直都是世界观至少部分受到西方教育影响的人。印度首任总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁曾就读于剑桥大学。莫迪的前任曼莫汉·辛格曾就读于牛津大学和剑桥大学。莫迪上任时，央行由前<small>国际货币基金组织</small>官员、芝加哥大学教授拉古拉姆·拉詹 (Raghuram Rajan) 掌管。</p><p class="article__body-text">印度声称自己是一个充满自由价值观的民主国家，这有助于其侨民更容易融入西方。侨民反过来又将印度与西方联系在一起。 2005年就是一个令人震惊的例子，当时美国达成了一项协议，实际上承认印度是一个核国家，尽管印度拒绝签署《核不扩散条约》（以及巴基斯坦和以色列）。印度裔美国人的游说和筹款帮助推动该协议在国会获得通过。 </p><div

class="article__body-text">印度侨民也回到印度参与政治。 2014 年大选前，莫迪先生首次上台，据估计，有超过 8,000 名来自英国和美国的海外印度人飞往印度参加他的竞选活动。还有成群结队的人使用短信和社交媒体从远处投票给<small>印度人民党</small>。他们为竞选活动捐赠了数额不详的资金。</p><p class="article__body-text">许多人感兴趣的是莫迪先生本人。当他五月份访问澳大利亚时，他此行的亮点是在一个适合摇滚明星的 21,000 个座位的体育场举行的印度侨民集会。莫迪在讲话中称赞印度裔澳大利亚人是两国之间的“活桥梁”。在莫迪即将对美国进行国事访问期间，吸引侨民可能会再次成为他的首要议程。他之前接见印度裔美国人的活动包括 2014 年在纽约麦迪逊广场花园举行的 18,000 人集会和 2019 年在休斯敦举行的 50,000 人“莫迪你好”集会。</p><p class="article__body-text">远离人群的乔·拜登将于 6 月 22 日主持与莫迪先生的会谈。两人将讨论各自国家“对自由、开放、繁荣和安全的印太地区的承诺”以及其他几个话题。 <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/06/15/on-defence-america-and-india-edge-closer-together">讨论</a>可能会很困难。在莫迪的领导下，印度与西方的关系受到了考验。印度重申其不结盟国家的地位，拒绝谴责<a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/06/15/indias-foreign-minister-on-ties-with-america-china-and-russia">俄罗斯</a>入侵乌克兰，并储备了廉价的俄罗斯石油和化肥。印度作为今年<small>G20</small>论坛主席国，大声疾呼要促进发展中国家的利益。它也是<small>金砖国家</small>集团中的重要声音，该论坛包括巴西、俄罗斯、中国、南非以及印度。俱乐部正在考虑是否让沙特阿拉伯和伊朗加入。</p><h2>相互保证的吸引力</h2><p class="article__body-text">在国内，官员们发表了大量民族主义言论，取悦右翼印度教头脑发热的人。自由主义自由也受到攻击。今年三月，印度法院判定反对党国大党领袖拉胡尔·甘地犯有诽谤罪，他因虚假诽谤指控而被取消议会议员资格。与此同时，记者受到当局的骚扰，他们的办公室也遭到突击搜查。</p><p class="article__body-text">哈佛大学的奈警告说，莫迪在印度推行的印度教民族主义的沙文主义品牌使该国的声誉面临风险。明年的选举可能会导致宗教紧张局势加剧，民主规范进一步受到侵蚀。 “印度喜欢吹嘘自己是世界上最大的民主国家，”奈先生说。 “如果达不到这一点，就会损害印度的软实力。”</p><p class="article__body-text">但海外印度人帮助限制了损害，并确保印度和西方都不放弃对方。莫迪知道他不能失去他们的支持，也不可能强迫印度人选边站队。当中国及其朋友想要对抗其竞争对手制定的世界秩序时，西方让印度站在一边至关重要。尽管它在倒退，但它仍然是无价的——就像它的移民一样。 <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p>

class="article__body-text">在许多富裕国家，传统的私立学校正在衰落。在<small>经合组织</small>（主要由富裕国家组成的俱乐部）的 30 多个成员国中，来自政府资助不到一半的学校的儿童比例从 2000 年的约 8% 下降到 2018 年的约 5%。美国的表现要好一些，而两国关于这些问题的争论仍然特别具有政治色彩。</p><p class="article__body-text">最近的证据表明，对于英国大多数私立学校的孩子和美国精英私立院校的孩子来说，昂贵的教育优势仍然很大。美国的好处可能比英国更大，至少对于坐在最豪华私人教室里的学生来说是这样。这是因为他们的校友继续以会在祖国引起轰动的价格进入最好的大学。这可能会让那些认为美国社会不像英国社会那样受阶级束缚的人感到惊讶。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">英国的私立学校为大约 6.5% 的孩子提供服务，与 20 世纪 60 年代的比例大致相同。 （曲棍球棒和大米布丁对各个年龄段的人都很有吸引力。）美国约有 9% 的儿童接受曲棍球棒和大米布丁的教育，这一比例在新冠肺炎 (covid-19) 大流行期间一直保持稳定十年。在美国，大约 75% 的私立学校学生就读于有宗教信仰的机构（其中很大一部分机构的收费与公立学校的每名学生的资助费用相似或更低）。但该国也有一个独特的学校子集，通常被称为“独立”学校，它们最接近英国的付费学校。这些教育只占不到 2% 的美国年轻人。</p><p class="article__body-text">英国的生活成本是世界上最高的。那里的一个家庭每年预计要花费超过 16,000 英镑（20,000 美元）让一个孩子进入私立走读学校。这是他们在 20 世纪 80 年代支付的三倍；现在大约是英国家庭收入中位数的一半，而以前是五分之一。 Fees in America are lower on average, but also rocketed by 60% in the first decade of this century, according to the most recent good government data. The most snooty schools bill parents on average $28,000 each year for a day pupil.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Measuring what benefits flow from these outlays matters both to critics of private schooling—who accuse posh schools of perpetuating elites—and to those who pay for it. At first glance, the pay-offs are clear: all around the rich world privately educated pupils do better in exams, go to better universities and end up with better-paid jobs. But some of that success derives from advantages outside the classroom, such as having wealthy, encouraging or intelligent parents. Understanding the boost from private education involves comparing pupils&#39; fortunes with those of otherwise similar peers in government schools. Good research of this sort is easiest to find in Britain.</p><h2> Getting the abacus out</h2><p class="article__body-text"> By the time they turn 25 Britons with private education earn 17% more than other workers from similar homes, according to a study from 2015. The pay premium widens by the age of 42, according to earlier research, to around 21% for women and 35% for men. In part this is because privately schooled people are more likely to enter high-earning professions, such as finance. Alumni networks may help in this, but peer pressure and parental expectations probably play a big role, too.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A larger reason for higher incomes is because private-schoolers get more and better academic qualifications than they otherwise would. They enjoy a “modest” boost in test scores when compared with children from similar homes who enroll in government classrooms, reckons Francis Green at University College London. This advantage accumulates with every additional year they spend in private schooling. One study finds that the edge they enjoy by the time they are 18 is roughly the equivalent of moving from grades of <small>AAB</small> to <small>AAA</small> (school-leavers on England&#39;s academic track commonly take nationally standardised exams in three subjects). </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The critical point is that even a modest boost in results can have a big effect on the size of additional earnings. That is because better grades might secure a pupil a slot at a more prestigious university than they would have gone to otherwise, or a slot at a university at all. In 2021 more than half of privately educated pupils who started a degree in Britain attended one of the 24 “Russell Group” universities (a club that includes most of the best ones). Such pupils are more likely to spend their last years at school studying the tough, traditional subjects that very selective universities most want to see on applications. They are also more likely to get extra help so as to ace interviews and admissions tests.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Private-schoolers no longer nab quite such unfair shares of top university places as they once did. They comprise around 18% of all pupils aged 16-19 in England, as well as about 25% of all those with top grades in school-leavers&#39; exams. Last year they were 20% of new undergraduates at Russell Group universities.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230610_IRC445.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230610_IRC445.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230610_IRC445.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230610_IRC445.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230610_IRC445.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230610_IRC445.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230610_IRC445.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230610_IRC445.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230610_IRC445.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> In 2016 about 6% of all private-schoolers who began a degree in Britain won places at the universities of Oxford or Cambridge; that share has since fallen to about 4% (it is around 2% for those from government schools). Last year private-schoolers made up 32% and 27% of the pair&#39;s new British undergraduates, down from 43% and 39% a decade before. This shift has rocked the handful of elite private schools which once sent hordes of pupils to the two universities.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Picking apart the benefits of private education in America is difficult, because its schools are a more motley bunch than Britain&#39;s. Since religion is banned from government schools, many pious parents pick private classes for reasons other than academic performance alone. Overall, evidence to suggest that America&#39;s private-schoolers learn more than they would if they went to government schools is less secure than it is in Britain.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A study published in 2018 by two academics at the University of Virginia, Robert Pianta and Arya Ansari, analysed the test scores of 1,000 children who were born in the 1990s. It found that by age 15 the ones who attended American private schools were getting no better grades, after adjusting for their backgrounds. There is not much good research, however, singling out the extra benefits rich children gain from attending America&#39;s subset of “independent” schools. But it is reasonable to think that they boost a child&#39;s prospects by at least as much as their British cousins.</p></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/967/90/media-assets/image/20230610_IRC446.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/318/90/media-assets/image/20230610_IRC446.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/477/90/media-assets/image/20230610_IRC446.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/636/90/media-assets/image/20230610_IRC446.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/954/90/media-assets/image/20230610_IRC446.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1018/90/media-assets/image/20230610_IRC446.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1272/90/media-assets/image/20230610_IRC446.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1590/90/media-assets/image/20230610_IRC446.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2036/90/media-assets/image/20230610_IRC446.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> America&#39;s universities welcome those from grand schools with open arms. In 2021 James Murphy of Education Reform Now, a think-tank in Washington, <small>DC,</small> collected data from 35 of America&#39;s highest-ranked universities and liberal-arts colleges. He found that on average about 34% of their new undergraduates were educated in private high schools (see chart). That is astonishing given that the private sector educates just 8.5% of American high-schoolers. Pupils from “independent” schools do brilliantly. The most recently published data suggest they made up about one-third of new undergraduates at Dartmouth and more than a quarter at Princeton. “Legacy” preference, whereby the relatives of alumni get a leg-up in admissions, may explain some of this. Nothing so brazenly unfair happens at British universities.</p></div><h2> Green lawns and greenbacks</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Money helps, too. Whereas English universities charge every domestic student the same tuition fees (though those from abroad pay more), America&#39;s best universities vary the cost according to means. This allows exceptional pupils from poor backgrounds to study for little or nothing. But it also gives universities good reason to keep in with dependable “feeder” schools, full of clever pupils with ample wealth.</p><p class="article__body-text"> It follows that Britain&#39;s private schools are pointing more of their leavers overseas. Last year about 6% of those who went to university chose to study abroad, up from 4% in 2016. America is the most popular destination. Its universities demand top grades, says Barnaby Lenon of the Independent School Council, which represents British private schools. But he adds that they also value non-academic achievements, such as those obtained through extra-curricular activities of a kind that private schools try hard to provide. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The edge enjoyed by private-schoolers is much less discussed in America than it is in Britain, in part because questions of race, rather than class, tend to take centre stage in debates about university admissions. Political battles that have broken out over the teaching of race, sex and history are benefiting private providers, in part because states are choosing to put money into private “school-choice” programmes. These involve local governments paying for some private-school places (commonly only for poor children and usually in the cheapest kinds of private institutions).</p><p class="article__body-text"> America may be on the verge of change, however. Imminent rulings from its Supreme Court could ban the use of affirmative action in university admissions. And if colleges and universities can no longer boost applicants from underrepresented minority groups, the advantages enjoyed by posh pupils may receive greater scrutiny. Private schools in Britain face a bumpy ride, too. The Labour Party, which looks likely to win power at elections due in the next 18 months, talks of abolishing private schools&#39; charitable status and stripping them of tax breaks. That could cause tuition fees to jump. Meanwhile, the paths to Oxford and Cambridge will keep narrowing. Expect a growing gang of Brits to head across the Atlantic. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 08 Jun 2023 13:48:58 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/3l9t2qdsc540spactim6stu34qa251qk</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/06/08/should-you-send-your-children-to-private-school</item><item><title><![CDATA[The speech police are coming for social media]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230603_IRD001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230603_IRD001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230603_IRD001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230603_IRD001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230603_IRD001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230603_IRD001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230603_IRD001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230603_IRD001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230603_IRD001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230603_IRD001.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">I</span> <small>N RECENT DAYS</small> Ron DeSantis, Florida&#39;s governor and Donald Trump&#39;s chief rival for the Republican nomination, chose to announce his bid for the White House via Twitter.

Most are zapped by automated filters, but Meta and Google also employ more than 40,000 content-reviewers between them.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230603_IRC348.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230603_IRC348.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230603_IRC348.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230603_IRC348.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230603_IRC348.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230603_IRC348.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230603_IRC348.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230603_IRC348.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230603_IRC348.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Most of this housekeeping is uncontroversial: 90% of the posts that Facebook, the largest network, took down last year were simply spam. But many moderation decisions are hard (see chart). In the latest quarter, Facebook removed or blocked 10.7m posts that it deemed hate speech and 6.9m that it considered bullying, both concepts where there is room for disagreement. To take one recent dilemma, Meta recently ordered a review of whether it has been overzealous in its policing of the Arabic word <i>shaheed</i> , which is generally translated as “martyr” but whose meaning can change in different contexts. The platforms have mostly been left to resolve such quandaries by themselves.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Now, however, politicians are stepping in. In America Democrats and Republicans agree that social networks are doing a lousy job of moderation, and that it is time to change Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields online platforms from liability for content posted by users (with exceptions such as content linked to sex trafficking). But they disagree completely on what to do about it.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Democrats, who accuse tech billionaires of stoking rage and misinformation for clicks, want platforms to remove more content. Republicans, who think woke California busybodies are gagging conservatives, want them to remove less. (By a ratio of three to one, voters suspect tech firms of favouring liberal viewpoints over conservative ones, according to the Pew Research Centre, an American think-tank.) The result is congressional deadlock.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The Supreme Court has had the chance to tinker with Section 230. But on May 18th, in rulings on two similar cases involving YouTube and Twitter, which had hosted content uploaded by terrorists, it declined to alter the status quo, rejecting the idea that online platforms have liability for crimes their users commit. NetChoice, a tech lobby group, described the decision as a “huge win for free speech on the internet”. Section 230 looks safe for now.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> With no luck at the federal level, reformers on left and right are focusing on the states. Last year California passed a law forcing tech companies to collect less user information on children, among other things. Several states have passed or proposed laws requiring those under 18 to get parental permission before using social media. On May 17th Montana banned TikTok altogether, over its Chinese ownership (TikTok is suing and is expected to win).</p><h2> States of denial</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Most controversially, in 2021 Florida and Texas, both Republican-controlled, passed laws restricting social networks&#39; ability to moderate political speech. Courts have upheld Texas&#39;s law and struck down Florida&#39;s, paving the way for a return to the Supreme Court, which is expected to take up the cases later this year. “If the court opens up the door to regulation in this space, many [states] will jump at the opportunity,” says Evelyn Douek of Stanford University.</p><p class="article__body-text"> They will have two transatlantic models to follow. Passed in July 2022, the <small>EU</small> ’s <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2022/04/30/free-speech-idealism-will-clash-with-laws-and-reality">Digital Services Act</a> ( <small>DSA</small> ) will kick in next year. Britain&#39;s <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/05/25/britains-online-safety-bill-could-change-the-face-of-the-internet">Online Safety Bill</a> , four years in the making, is expected to be enacted later this year. Both take a different approach from America&#39;s. Rather than altering who has liability for online content (the issue at the heart of the Section 230 debate), they force platforms to do a kind of due diligence, to keep bad content to a minimum. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Europe&#39;s <small>DSA</small> requires online platforms to set up complaint-handling processes and demands that they tell users how their algorithms work, allowing them to change the recommendations they receive. Smaller platforms, defined as those with fewer than 45m users in the <small>eu</small> , will be let off some of these obligations to stop them from drowning in red tape (some larger rivals warn that this could make them a haven for harmful material). For those big enough to qualify for full oversight, the <small>DSA</small> represents “a significant financial burden”, says Florian Reiling of Clifford Chance, a law firm. There is grumbling in Washington that of the 19 platforms so far earmarked by the <small>EU</small> for the most intensive scrutiny, only one—Zalando, a German e-commerce site—is European.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Twitter, which has cut its staff by about 80% since Mr Musk took over in October, may be one of those that struggles to meet the <small>DSA</small> ’s requirements. Mr Musk seems to have taken over from Mark Zuckerberg, Meta&#39;s boss, as social media&#39;s greatest villain in the eyes of some. On May 26th Thierry Breton, a European commissioner, tweeted that Twitter had left the <small>EU</small> ’s voluntary code of practice against disinformation, adding what sounded like a threat: “You can run but you can&#39;t hide.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Britain&#39;s parallel legislative effort is shaping up to be more far-reaching. The Online Safety Bill was conceived in 2019 after the suicide of a 14-year-old who had binged on algorithmically recommended depressive material. Four prime ministers later, the text of the bill has almost doubled in length. An American tech firm dubs it “one of the most complex bills we face anywhere in the world”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> It goes further than the <small>EU</small> in its loosely worded requirement for platforms to proactively screen material. The larger social networks already check videos for matches with known child-abuse content. But subtler crimes, such as incitement to violence, are harder to detect automatically. The scale of some platforms—YouTube uploads 500 hours of video per minute—means that a strict requirement to pre-screen content could throttle the amount of new material uploaded.</p><p class="article__body-text"> As in America, British conservatives worry about the over-moderation of right-wing views. The bill therefore imposes a duty to ensure that moderation “[applies] in the same way to a wide diversity of political opinion”. Similarly, the <small>EU</small> has promised that it will provide “protection for media against unjustified online content removal” as part of its forthcoming European Media Freedom Act, a response to crackdowns on the press in members states such as Hungary and Poland.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The most controversial part of Britain&#39;s bill, which required platforms to identify content that is “legal but harmful” (eg, material that encourages eating disorders), has been dropped where adults are concerned. But there remains a duty to limit its availability to children, which in turn implies the need for widespread age checks. Tech firms say they can guess users&#39; ages from their search history and mouse movements, but that a strict duty to verify users&#39; ages would threaten anonymity.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some suspect that their real objection is the price. “I don&#39;t think &#39;It costs money and is hard&#39; is an excuse,” says Keily Blair, chief operations officer of OnlyFans, a porn-centric platform which checks the age of its users and doesn&#39;t see why others shouldn&#39;t do the same. Yet some platforms are adamant: the Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, says it has no intention of verifying users&#39; ages. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The stricter the rules in jurisdictions such as Britain or the <small>eu</small> , the likelier tech companies will be to opt to offer different services there, rather than to apply the same rules worldwide. Some may even quit. WhatsApp, a Meta-owned messaging app, says it is unwilling to break its end-to-end encryption to meet a requirement in Britain&#39;s bill that companies must scan private messages for child abuse. It may not come to that: the bill would let Ofcom demand the data only in cases where it determined that such a measure was proportionate. Still, threats to up sticks are becoming more common. On May 24th Sam Altman, the head of Open <small>AI</small> , said he would consider leaving the <small>eu</small> if its regulation of artificial intelligence went too far. (He later rowed back his remarks.)</p><h2> Network effects</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Whether or not Britain or the <small>eu</small> use the full extent of their new powers, they set a handy precedent for countries that might use them oppressively. Britain&#39;s bill, which proposes prison for executives of companies that break the rules, is “a blueprint for repression around the world”, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil-liberties group. One American executive snipes that Britain&#39;s claim to be “world-leading” in tech is true only in the sense that it is blazing a trail for non-democracies to pass repressive laws of their own.</p><p class="article__body-text"> They need little encouragement. Turkey ordered Twitter to censor information during its recent election; that free-speech enthusiast, Mr Musk, complied. Brazil has proposed a “fake news law” that would penalise social networks for failing to identify misinformation. Modelled on the European legislation, it has been dubbed the “ <small>DSA</small> of the tropics”. India is to publish an internet-regulation bill in June which will reportedly make platforms liable for users&#39; content if they do not agree to identify and trace those users when directed.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The international impact of the British and <small>eu</small> proposals is influencing the debate in America. “No matter how much you think that social networks have been corrupting to American politics,” says Matthew Prince, head of Cloudflare, an American networking firm, “they&#39;ve been incredibly destabilising to other regimes that are against the United States&#39; interests.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 29 May 2023 17:48:03 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/i3alak4erigqrg6rgf6jpsqsvhgq4qe5</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/05/29/the-speech-police-are-coming-for-social-media </item><item><title><![CDATA[The cost of the global arms race]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="TOURNAI, BELGIUM - FEBRUARY 02: German-made Leopard 1 tanks, which were removed from the Belgian army's inventory years ago and sold to a defense industry company are seen at a warehouse in Tournai, Belgium on February 02, 2023.

In 2018 the body recommended raising it by 3% to 5% in real terms every year for at least five years. Overall America&#39;s advantage over its rivals has eroded in the past century, reckons Andrew Krepinevich, an American strategist. During the first, second and cold wars America&#39;s adversaries had much smaller economies than America did. No longer. Today China&#39;s <small>GDP</small> alone is nearly 80% of America&#39;s.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In the decades after the cold war, the thinking was that to spend less on armies meant to spend more on infrastructure and public services and to lower debt or taxes. Since the 1960s the world has “released” about $4trn a year of spending at current prices in this way, equivalent to the global government budget for education. Now the peace dividend is turning into a “war tax”. How heavy will it be?</p><p class="article__body-text"> Working out accurately who is spending what can be difficult. For international comparison, defence spending is usually reckoned as a share of <small>gdp</small> , at market exchange rates. By this measure global military expenditures appear close to a post-cold-war low, at around 2.5%. But market exchange rates greatly underestimate the true size of defence establishments in countries such as China and Russia, where a given dollar of military spending can pay for a lot more weapons and soldiers. The proportion will also increase in the coming years if great-power rivalry grows as expected. In a more insecure world, countries will arm themselves because their neighbours are doing so or because their allies encourage them to.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Splurging more on weapons raises several questions. What will countries buy, might money be squandered and could the global economy be damaged?</p><p class="article__body-text"> America, by far the world&#39;s largest defence spender, is devoting growing sums to research and development of future weapons. This includes hypersonic missiles, to catch up with China and Russia; “directed energy” such as powerful lasers to shoot down drones and missiles; and artificial intelligence and robotics. It is also buying as many munitions as its factories can produce—from 155mm artillery shells to anti-ship missiles. The war in Ukraine has exposed the extraordinary quantities of munitions needed in a conflict, as well as the inability of peacetime production lines to meet such demand.</p><p class="article__body-text"> China is investing on all fronts and expenditures grew by 4.2% in real terms last year. The breakdown of its budget is opaque, not least because of “civil-military fusion” in technological development. It has developed a thicket of anti-access/area denial ( <small>A2/AD</small> ) weapons, with ground-attack and anti-ship missiles able to reach deep into the Pacific. It also has a lead in some types of hypersonic missiles (which are harder to intercept than ballistic ones). Its navy is already larger than America&#39;s. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> America, Russia and China are investing in their nuclear arsenals, too. America is upgrading all legs of its “triad” of ground-, air- and submarine-launched nukes. Russia is working on esoteric weapons, such as the long-distance, nuclear-powered Poseidon torpedo designed to set off an underwater nuclear explosion that, propagandists boast, can cause destructive tidal waves. China is quickly expanding its arsenal, from several hundred warheads to 1,500 by 2035, according to the Pentagon.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Equipment is also at the top of the shopping list for many smaller countries. Germany is buying stealthy new <small>F-35</small> jets as well as command-and-control systems. Poland is spending heavily on land forces—buying tanks, howitzers, precision rockets and more from America and South Korea—as well as combat aircraft. Japan is seeking, among many other things, long-range “counter-strike” missiles to hit back at China and North Korea.</p><p class="article__body-text"> This shopping spree comes with several risks. Given the bottlenecks, one danger is escalating costs, in an industry where prices can be hard to control because of long development processes, changing requirements and because defence firms operate at the technological edge, with all the associated overheads.</p><p class="article__body-text"> American defence budgets can be subject to the whims of politicians seeking benefits for their districts. Congress has persistently refused to let the air force retire obsolescent aircraft, for instance. European countries, for their part, are poor at co-ordinating procurement at scale. McKinsey, a consultancy, notes that they operate many more models of weapons than America does: 15 types of main battle tanks compared with one in America; 20 fighter jets versus seven, and so on.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Worse, the defence industry is especially prone to graft, notes Josie Stewart of Transparency International, an anti-corruption group. That is because of the secrecy that surrounds many of its dealings, its importance to national security and the “revolving door” of experts versed in its technicalities. An onrush of money could make everything worse.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There are wider concerns that big defence establishments, and the industries supplying them, will weigh down the global economy by stoking inflation or slowing growth, or both. Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard has noted that “the need to front-load massive temporary expenditures can easily push up borrowing costs”.</p><h2> Expectations for inflation?</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Certain fears may be misplaced. Take defence inflation in America—the increase in prices facing buyers of military equipment. It is running at about 5% year on year, the highest rate in decades. During previous military build-ups this sort of defence inflation has sharply increased. In the early 1980s, a period in which Ronald Reagan built up America&#39;s military capabilities, it easily outpaced economy-wide price rises. In the Vietnam war it briefly hit 48% on an annual basis.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Even so, there is little reason to believe that the new cold war will be sharply inflationary. Not even the fiercest hawks are calling for defence spending, as a share of <small>gdp</small> , to return to the levels of the 1960s or 1970s. Barring a hot war between big powers, global defence spending is unlikely to grow above the low single digits of global <small>gdp</small> —meaning that its impact on global aggregate demand, and thus inflation, will be similarly small.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Spending can remain historically low, in large part, because defence is more efficient than it used to be. Modern armies require ever fewer people—allowing military planners to cut headcounts (though service members can become more expensive). Brazil spends 78% of its budget on people compared with less than 50% in the West. In place of people you have better machines. Many planners bemoan the growing cost of each platform, but they improve with each iteration. “These days you can hit dozens of targets with a single bomber, rather than vice versa, which used to be the case,” argues James Geurts, a retired air-force colonel who advises Lux Capital, a venture-capital firm.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Official data from America suggest that once you adjust for improvements in quality, the price of a missile has fallen in nominal terms by about 30% since the late 1970s. The price of military aircraft is about flat. Today a country can spend relatively modestly to acquire fearsome capabilities. As such, defence spending tends to fall relative to <small>gdp</small> , particularly in peacetime.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Defence could continue to get better and cheaper in relative terms because of the changing nature of what Dwight Eisenhower, a general-turned-president, called the “military-industrial complex”. In the past defence departments exported technology to civilians—think of the global-positioning system and the internet. Increasingly, the opposite is happening, with military industries importing technology from outside.</p><h2> Technological trajectories</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Cyber-security, drones and satellite technology straddle both the civilian and military worlds. SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, has launched American military satellites. Ukrainian warriors make extensive use of his Starlink constellation of satellites. America&#39;s defence department has identified 14 critical technologies deemed vital to national security. Perhaps ten or 11 of these areas are being led commercially. Tech firms such as Google and Microsoft help out with cyber-security, data-processing and artificial intelligence. Several firms provide cloud computing.</p><p class="article__body-text"> It all amounts to a change of cultural mindset from tech firms that once shunned defence as morally tainted. A defence-tech ecosystem has sprung up in America, with lots of engineering expertise in Colorado; regulation wonks in Washington, <small>DC</small> ; aerospace types in Los Angeles; and investors in San Francisco. But it is not just an American phenomenon. About half of the biggest defence-and-aerospace firms founded within the past decade are headquartered in other parts of the world. “Founders no longer want to do the next social-media startup,” says Paul Kwan of General Catalyst, an American investment firm. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Big investors in Silicon Valley, including General Catalyst and the venture-capital outfit Andreessen Horowitz, are increasingly interested in national security, broadly defined. Tech firms smell opportunity. Palantir, which specialises in big-data analytics, recently released a new defence platform powered by <small>AI</small> to speed up decision-making. Defence was one of the few sectors where there were more venture-capital deals in 2022 than in 2021.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There is also a growing effort to inject defence firms themselves with tech&#39;s dynamism. A recent parliamentary report in Britain noted that “old &#39;legacy&#39; systems complicate tasks as routine as ordering a pair of boots”. It can take ten to 20 years to produce a new plane. But rather than develop new planes every decade or so, says Jim Taiclet, the boss of Lockheed Martin, the world&#39;s largest defence contractor, his firm aims to mimic Silicon Valley by offering software upgrades to improve performance every six to 12 months.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The fiscal consequences of the new defence boom may be modest if the industry becomes more efficient. The defence-versus-everything-else trade-off was acute in decades past: in 1944 America spent 53% of its <small>GDP</small> on military forces. But it is less so today. If the world doubled its military spending overnight (assuming no increases in taxes or debt) public spending would need to be cut by about 5% to balance the books. Not easy, but not that hard.</p><p class="article__body-text"> What of the impact on growth? Many historians argue that defence spending is a drain on the rest of the economy. Keeping a country secure has great economic value. But once you buy a missile, say, it tends to sit in storage rather than being put to productive use. During the second world war productivity growth slowed in America, as people were pulled from the fields into munitions factories and military units. Forced limits on military spending in postwar Japan and West Germany, by contrast, coincided with huge productivity improvements in both countries.</p><p class="article__body-text"> This is only a partial story, however. Countries such as Israel and South Korea combine vibrant economies with big defence sectors. We analysed World Bank data from the 1960s to 2021, exploring the relationship between military spending and <small>GDP</small> growth. Both within a single country over many years, and between countries in a single year, we find practically no correlation between the two. Put simply, more guns need not mean less butter.</p><p class="article__body-text"> More defence-related <small>R&amp;D</small> could boost wider innovation. And more investment in defence capabilities could also have positive spillover effects on the rest of the economy. A recent paper by Enrico Moretti of the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues finds that “government-funded <small>R&amp;D</small> in general—and defence <small>R&amp;D</small> in particular—[is] effective at raising a country&#39;s total expenditures on innovation in a given industry.”</p><h2> Of taxes and tanks</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Governments have plenty of competing demands for their cash: among them caring for ageing populations, fighting climate change and paying higher interest on their debts. Some fear that higher taxes are inevitable, or that the cost will be passed to future generations as borrowing. Many governments will face pressure to backpedal on commitments to higher military expenditures. According to a recently leaked intelligence report, Justin Trudeau, Canada&#39;s prime minister, told <small>NATO</small> leaders that his country would never reach the 2% target. It is not yet clear how Japan or Poland will pay for their big rises in defence.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Goings-on in Washington, above all, will determine the size and duration of the boom. The mainstream still wants America to maintain primacy and fend off both Russia and China. But many on the “America First” populist wing want to cut support for Ukraine and, in some cases, even for the Pentagon. A third group favours redirecting military spending away from Europe and the Middle East to concentrate on China. And a fourth contains figures from the left who want less spending on defence and more on social matters. The first category, the internationalist hawks, seem to have the upper hand. Confronting America&#39;s rival is one of the few issues where there is bipartisan support.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Several things might push up spending. A crisis might escalate—or even draw America into direct fighting—forcing a military surge. Harry Truman, for instance, oversaw one as president during the Korean war. Short of conflict, a future president may opt for a military build-up. Many credit Reagan&#39;s decision to boost defence outlays as crucial to bankrupting the Soviet Union and winning the cold war.</p><p class="article__body-text"> One way or another, a new era of rearmament beckons. As General Mark Milley, chairman of America&#39;s joint chiefs of staff, told the Senate recently: “Preventing great-power war through readiness and deterrence is very expensive, but not as expensive as fighting a war.” And the only thing more costly than that, as he explained, is losing one. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i>Correction (May 24th): A previous version of this article misstated Japan&#39;s defence-spending plans, and the number of NATO countries that spend 2% of GDP on defence.

But it is far from clear what that strategy might be, or whether Europe would remain so closely aligned with America in the event of a war over Taiwan.</p><p class="article__body-text"> An awkward procession of Europe&#39;s leaders to Beijing in the past few months points to the lack of a plan. Germany&#39;s <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2022/11/02/olaf-scholz-leads-a-blue-chip-business-delegation-to-china">Olaf Scholz</a> paid a visit accompanied by business leaders in November; his foreign minister, who is from a different political party, went last month and struck a tough tone. Spain&#39;s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, went to open doors to his country&#39;s trade. <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/04/04/will-xi-jinping-outsmart-emmanuel-macron">Emmanuel Macron</a> ostentatiously sought to strike a partnership with Xi Jinping. The French president took 53 corporate bosses with him, and insisted that Europe distance itself from Sino-American tensions and from a conflict over Taiwan. His clumsy comments caused an uproar in Europe and America. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The war in Ukraine has complicated matters further as the mood has turned against autocracies. Most countries on the <small>eu</small> ’s eastern flank—which once opened their arms to Chinese investors—have become hawkish. “Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine had a sorting effect in Europe when it comes to China,” says Janka Oertel of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank. It seems that those in the east are as leery of the “no-limits” friendship between Moscow and Beijing as they are of Mr Macron&#39;s talk of “strategic autonomy” from America. Meanwhile, everyone knows that China remains keen to exploit transatlantic differences.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Finding common cause is onerous because it is hard to tell what America wants. Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden&#39;s national security adviser, and Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, have each recently distanced the Biden administration from hard talk of “decoupling”, in favour of “de-risking”—a term also used in the past few months by Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission. (She had intended to distinguish Europe&#39;s policy of managing risk from what seemed to be a tougher American approach akin to economic divorce.) Yet it is not long since the <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/02/09/tensions-will-linger-over-a-chinese-balloon-downed-by-america">spy-balloon episode</a> , when <small>us</small> -China relations hit a 30-year low. Congress and public opinion in America are hostile to China. Tensions may rise during the election campaign in 2024, and a pugnacious Republican, perhaps Donald Trump, may win.</p><h2> Attachment styles</h2><p class="article__body-text"> All this makes it urgent for Europe to devise a coherent China policy. Its leaders need to work out how far they want to reduce its dependency on China, and in so doing also respond to the hundreds of billions of dollars in green-industry subsidies unveiled last year in America&#39;s Inflation Reduction Act. They also need to decide what they would do if America became more demanding. In an extreme case, in the event of a war over Taiwan, Europe might be expected to impose sanctions on China like those it has slapped on Russia, and to back a military campaign. Some hope that the new doctrine of de-risking is a compromise that solves the dilemma. Others fear that it will prove meagre and inflexible in the face of changing technological and geopolitical realities. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Europe is more economically exposed to China than America is. Some 8% of publicly listed European firms&#39; revenues are from China, compared with 4% for American ones, according to Morgan Stanley, an American bank. Europe and America send a similar share of goods exports to China (7-9%), but because Europe is a more trade-intensive economy its sensitivity is higher. Multinational investments in China are worth 2% of Europe&#39;s <small>gdp</small> compared with 1% for America.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1172/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC170.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/386/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC170.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/578/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC170.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/771/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC170.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/1157/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC170.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1234/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC170.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1542/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC170.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1928/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC170.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2467/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC170.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> To form a holistic view we have come up with a yardstick of “total China exposure” (see chart 1). This has three elements: exports of goods, exports of services and the sales of Western-owned subsidiaries in China. These figures are for 2020, the last year for which data are available. The services and subsidiaries data include Hong Kong. We define Europe as its six largest economies, including Britain. We measure each country&#39;s exposure as a share of its own economy.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The European big six&#39;s total China exposure has hit 5.6% of their combined <small>gdp</small> , up from 3.9% in 2011. That is higher than America&#39;s at 4.2%. There is a big range: Italy and Spain are at just 1-2%, France and Britain are at 4-5%. Germany is a huge outlier at 9.9%. Two-thirds of the European big six&#39;s exposure is from the sales of subsidiaries in China rather than from exports from Europe. Often these are the Chinese arms of industrial giants such as Volkswagen and <small>basf</small> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> In the event of a “rigid” fragmentation of supply chains, the eurozone&#39;s gross national expenditure would drop by over 2%; roughly double the amount America&#39;s would, according to the European Central Bank. Germany&#39;s fall would presumably be higher. Similarly, an <small>imf</small> study in April found that in the event of an investment split between the West and China, European <small>gdp</small> would fall by 2%, more than twice the hit to America. In addition, a separation would cause a crisis at some leading European firms that rely on China, including Germany&#39;s carmakers, France&#39;s luxury empires and two British banks.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The emerging policy of de-risking refers to a calibrated reduction in links with China, rather than a wholesale economic decoupling. Even this is a big departure from how things were a decade ago. Back then European businesses were still stuffing their order books with Chinese contracts, suppressing their doubts about rising industrial competition. Overall trade between China and the <small>eu</small> grew 428% between 2002 and 2019.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> An <small>eu</small> strategic paper four years ago marked the first stage of the pivot. It argued that China was not just a partner and an economic competitor, but a systemic rival. The effects were swift. Capitals across Europe, which flogged ports and other infrastructure to Chinese investors, started to have second thoughts. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> To America&#39;s delight, many countries in Europe began to <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2018/12/15/can-huawei-survive-an-onslaught-of-bans-and-restrictions-abroad">prise Huawei</a> from their <small>5g</small> networks (though Germany still let the Chinese telecoms firm in). Remonstrations over human-rights abuses, particularly of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, grew louder. Supply-chain glitches during the pandemic showed the perils of relying too much on Chinese industry. The Sino- <small>eu</small> “Comprehensive Agreement on Investment”, struck in December 2020, was put to one side by Europe. And China&#39;s declaration of a “no-limits” friendship with Russia just weeks before the invasion of Ukraine soured the mood further.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mrs von der Leyen thinks that de-risking is the next step, and one that Europeans can agree on. But what it means in practice has yet to be clearly defined. It does not mean shutting the door to China altogether. It is partly about diversification, bolstering economic security and eradicating forced labour from supply chains. It is also focused on security concerns: hampering China&#39;s ability to get its hands on security-relevant technology such as quantum computing, which threatens encryption, or semiconductors for military purposes.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Like America, Europe is most strategically vulnerable when it comes to its critical dependence on China for certain supplies. In 2022 China mined nearly three-fifths of global <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2019/06/15/rare-earths-give-china-leverage-in-the-trade-war-at-a-cost">rare-earth elements</a> , used as components in electronic equipment. It also refined 60% of the world&#39;s lithium and 80% of its cobalt, two core inputs for the production of high-capacity electric batteries. Europe imports 98% of its rare earths from China, even more than America, which imports 80% from the Asian power. According to a study by <small>merics</small> , a German think-tank, the <small>eu</small> relies on China for 97% of its chloramphenicol, used to manufacture antibiotics. For America, the figure is 93%.</p><h2> Just friends</h2><p class="article__body-text"> European firms have already been diversifying suppliers since the pandemic, “friend-shoring” to allies, and “near-shoring” closer to home. America&#39;s energy secretary also declared in March that the Biden administration wanted supply chains in countries “whose values we share.” “All of us learned from covid-19 that we have to double- and triple-source, and not only from China,” says a French corporate titan. Firms are looking to India, Mexico, Morocco, Norway and Turkey, among others. Policymakers are pushing in the same direction. The <small>eu</small> has unveiled a Critical Raw Materials Act, designed to ensure that no more than 65% of annual consumption of any listed material should be sourced from any single country by 2030.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1137/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC172.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/374/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC172.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/561/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC172.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/748/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC172.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/1122/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC172.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1197/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC172.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1496/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC172.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1870/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC172.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2394/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC172.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> In the realm of technology European firms that are embedded into America&#39;s technology industry are mirroring American export controls. <small>asml</small> , a Dutch firm which makes equipment used to build semiconductors, has limited the sale of its cutting-edge machines to China. Europe&#39;s multinational companies are adjusting how they operate in China, too. In some cases they are divesting. In others they are making subsidiaries in China more self-sufficient, with a higher share of inputs and sales made locally. One measure of this is the share of investment by subsidiaries in China financed from their own profits, rather than from capital sent from Europe. For German subsidiaries in China this has risen from 2% in 2002 and 52% in 2012 to a new high of 85% in 2022 (see chart 2).</p><p class="article__body-text"> If these Chinese subsidiaries were perfectly self-sufficient they could in an extreme scenario be separated from the European parent, with both arms able to continue to operate: think of <small>vw</small> Germany and <small>vw</small> China. The result would be huge wealth destruction for shareholders in big European firms (many of whom are not actually European) but less damage to Europe&#39;s economy. In practice this shift to “one company, two systems” is only just beginning and for many large firms decoupling would be severely disruptive.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A final element of de-risking is stricter screening of Chinese investment coming into Europe. Strategic infrastructure is increasingly off-limits for Chinese investors, as inward investment in Europe is screened for security risks. Overall Chinese investment in Europe last year fell to its lowest point since 2013, according to a study by <small>merics</small> and Rhodium Group, a consultancy based in New York. China&#39;s foreign direct investment peaked in Europe back in 2016, Rhodium estimates.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The emergence of de-risking is understandable, but Europe&#39;s middle way is riddled with potholes. Big companies, still keen on the China dream, may refuse to go along for the ride. “There are certain no-go areas on tech in China,” says one senior European industrialist, “but on the rest we are not decoupling; it is business as usual, and the more the better.” When Mr Macron was in Beijing, Airbus, a European aircraft manufacturer, agreed to expand an assembly line in Tianjin, and confirmed an order to sell China 160 planes.</p></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1081/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC164.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/356/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC164.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/533/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC164.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/711/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC164.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/1067/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC164.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1138/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC164.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1422/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC164.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1778/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC164.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2276/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC164.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> De-risking may also struggle to adapt to technological change and its commercial effects, which can create new links even as old ones are dismantled. Cars are a good example. The <small>eu</small> exports almost no electric vehicles to China. Yet almost all of China&#39;s car exports to the <small>eu</small> , many of which are made for European brands, are battery-powered (see chart 3). Exports have shot up from less than €100m ($112m) a month before the pandemic to around €1bn a month now. As Europe&#39;s motorists seek greener transport, China is both eager and well positioned to flood the continent with cheaper electric models.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The greatest weakness of de-risking in its current guise is that it little prepares Europe for the shock that would follow an attempt by China to seize Taiwan. Europe&#39;s armed forces and its defence industry are already stretched, and the continent would struggle to find the capacity to provide much military support to America and Taiwan. Its leaders have little appetite for involvement in another war. But America would probably expect Europe to enforce the kind of embargo put in place on Russia. That would hurt American firms: despite Apple&#39;s efforts to diversify its production to India, the tech giant still relies on China. But it would harm Europe more, causing a bigger economic hit and destabilising more companies.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Macron&#39;s recent suggestion that Europe should not follow America&#39;s lead on Taiwan, in case it is dragged “into crises that are not [its] own”, delighted Beijing and <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/04/12/emmanuel-macrons-blunder-over-taiwan">dismayed European capitals</a> . Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania&#39;s foreign minister, retorted tartly that, at a time when Europeans depend on America&#39;s backing of Ukraine, they should be trying to preserve transatlantic unity rather than “begging for dictators to help secure peace in Europe”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Officials in Paris note, as Mr Macron eventually did, that it is official French policy to support the status quo over Taiwan. With naval bases and territories in the Indo-Pacific, France has direct interests in the region. “The problem isn&#39;t French policy but the disconnect between what we do and what Macron says, which creates unnecessary doubts among our partners,” notes Antoine Bondaz, at the Foundation for Strategic Research, a French think-tank. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> One virtue of Mr Macron&#39;s comments, notes a Scandinavian minister, is that they have prompted Europeans to talk more about China. Many on the continent fret about escalatory American rhetoric. On May 12th the <small>eu</small> ’s foreign ministers managed to agree to a set of principles for future dealings with the country. It will be discussed at the <small>eu</small> ’s next summit in June.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The bloc&#39;s deliberations in the coming months will depend heavily on France and Germany, which are its two biggest economies, and among the most exposed to China, and some of the least keen on cutting commercial ties. Mr Macron has long pushed Europe to become more self-reliant. Mr Scholz, faced with divergent views in his coalition government and a strong industry lobby, is still working on a national strategy that will shape Germany&#39;s approach to China (which keeps on being delayed). He is expected to host a bilateral summit with the country next month.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Much of eastern Europe seems wary of Chinese influence. The country&#39;s <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/01/22/what-chinas-bullying-of-lithuania-reveals-about-europe">bullying of Lithuania</a> in recent years over a Taiwanese diplomatic office in the country disgusted many. That is in spite of the fact that central and eastern Europe received some €3.8bn through China&#39;s clubby “16+1” initiative between 2000 and 2017. Comments made last month by Lu Shaye, the Chinese ambassador to France, helped focus minds. He appeared to dispute the legal status of all former Soviet countries (even if China later corrected his remarks).</p><h2> The end of the affair?</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Europe needs a measured debate about what to do next. France and Germany both have reservations about Mrs von der Leyen&#39;s de-risking measures, but they back the principle. Outward investment screening is under discussion, though will be difficult to put into practice. Inward investment screening is up and running, although Europeans disagree on how much to tighten the rules.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Beyond de-risking, collective <small>eu</small> policy has not been thought through. That is in spite of the fact that de-risking doesn&#39;t provide an answer to a scenario in which relations between America and China were to rupture. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, the transatlantic alliance has stood remarkably firm. A Chinese move on Taiwan would prove an even more dangerous, and far more difficult, test. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 15 May 2023 19:59:43 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/3ot5roakj7ad6okvm2jegeip06cjm00d</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/05/15/europe-cant-decide-how-to-unplug-from-china </item><item><title><![CDATA[After 12 years of blood, Assad’s Syria rejoins the Arab League]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Syrian President Bashar al-Assad President al-Assad performs Eid al-Fitr prayers at President Hafez al-Assad mosque Syrian President Bashar al-Assad President al-Assad performs Eid al-Fitr prayers at President Hafez al-Assad mosque in Damascuss, on April 21, 2023.

Syria has been suspended from the league since 2011, when Mr Assad began a brutal crackdown on anti-government protests that plunged the country into civil war (see map). On May 7th, however, the body agreed to readmit Syria and said it would invite Mr Assad to a summit in Saudi Arabia on May 19th.</p><p class="article__body-text"> An invitation from a dull talking shop crammed with dictators may seem hollow. For Mr Assad, though, it is the culmination of a long effort to end his Arab isolation—and, he may hope, another step towards <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/05/11/the-rehabilitation-of-syrias-dictator-raises-awkward-questions-for-the-west">acceptance in the West</a> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> His regime has done nothing so far to merit a renewed embrace: neither making concessions towards political reform nor taking accountability for war crimes, nor trying to bring home Syria&#39;s 6m refugees, most of them in neighbouring countries. Before the war the country had some 22m people; roughly half of them had to flee either abroad or elsewhere in Syria because of it. He rules a kleptocracy that floods the Gulf with illicit drugs and maintains close ties with Iran, an arch-rival to some Arab states. Poverty is widespread. Yet even the bloodiest dictator, it seems, can find a road to diplomatic redemption—if he simply causes enough problems for others.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That is one lesson from his return to the world stage. Another is that the autocrats and warlords who court Russian support are likely to end up disappointed. Mr Assad needs the Arab world—and the wealthy Gulf states in particular—because Russia cannot rebuild his ruined country. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Better still, for him, would be a rapprochement with the West, which has placed his regime under sanctions meant to deter reconstruction. Those on the energy sector, for example, bar firms from building new power plants or supplying equipment. Would-be investors in the Gulf are even jittery about small-scale solar-energy projects, fearing they might run afoul of the measures. So a rapprochement seems unlikely. But talk of one raises an unsavoury question, one that has echoes from Venezuela to Zimbabwe: if a regime endures and sanctions fail to force change, should they be maintained despite their toll on civilians?</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Assad was never entirely a pariah in his own region. Algeria declined to cut ties with his regime. Egypt briefly did, under its short-lived democratic government, but restored them after a military coup in 2013. Still, the past decade was lonely. When Mr Assad arrived in the United Arab Emirates ( <small>uae</small> ) for an official visit last year, it was his first trip to an Arab country in 11 years.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The <small>uae</small> was among the first to break his isolation when it reopened its embassy in Damascus in 2018 and urged allies to do the same. The massive earthquakes that struck Syria (and Turkey) in February gave a larger jolt to <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/02/16/bashar-al-assad-does-not-want-to-let-a-calamity-go-to-waste">Syria&#39;s diplomatic standing</a> . Many Arab leaders had wanted to reach out to Mr Assad; the disaster gave them an excuse, as they called to offer condolences and co-ordinate aid.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There are several reasons why they sought normalisation. One is a broader spirit of detente. The Saudis struck a deal in March with Iran to restore diplomatic ties and reopen embassies. After years of proxy wars in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere, both sides were keen to lower tensions and shore up their positions at home. Turkey and Egypt, mired in mutual economic crises, are trying to end a decade of animosity. Gulf states have ended their embargo of Qatar, their tiny, wayward neighbour on the Arabian peninsula, which accomplished little. Old foes across the region are keen to pretend they are friends. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> When it comes to Syria, however, they want something bigger in return. Its neighbours hope to get rid of millions of Syrian refugees. The <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/04/lebanons-government-is-squeezing-out-syrian-refugees">2m or so in Lebanon</a> , with a population of just 5m, are seen as a burden, blamed unfairly for the country&#39;s economic collapse. In Turkey the mood has also turned hostile. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the main opposition candidate in the election on May 14th, vows to <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/03/02/syrian-earthquake-survivors-in-turkey-have-nowhere-to-go">send Syrians packing</a> within two years if elected.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some also wager that closer ties with Mr Assad could peel him away from Iran. After relying for years on Iranian military support, his country is now a base for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hizbullah and other armed groups linked to Iran. Their presence is unsettling for countries including Saudi Arabia and Jordan, which see Iran as a menace.</p><p class="article__body-text"> No one should be too hopeful. Some in the sprawling Syrian diaspora have built decent lives in their adopted countries, although others are consigned to squalor, living in tents and surviving on handouts. Few, however, wish to return to Syria. They are unlikely to—at least not by choice—unless the regime makes both political reforms and progress on reconstruction.</p><p class="article__body-text"> As for Iran, it is hard to imagine Mr Assad booting out the forces that kept him in power. When Ebrahim Raisi, the arch-conservative Iranian president, visited Damascus this month, he was treated to a musical number extolling Iran. Many Syrians doubt that their president, whose capital is ringed by Iranian militias, would even have the power to push them out.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Still, Syria may make a few gestures. It has become the world&#39;s leading producer of Captagon, an amphetamine that is a popular recreational drug in the Gulf. Authorities in the <small>uae</small> seized almost 36m tablets in 2020, hidden inside a shipment of electric cables. The following year Saudi customs officials found 20m pills in a cargo of grapefruit. Jordan says it intercepted 17m pills in the first four months of 2022, up from 15m in all of 2021 and just 1.4m in 2020. Border guards have been killed in shoot-outs with armed smugglers.</p><p class="article__body-text"> For every high-profile bust, many shipments go undetected. The <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/07/19/syria-has-become-a-narco-state">scale of the Captagon trade</a> is often exaggerated. The British government put its annual value at $57bn, a patently absurd figure, larger than the <small>gdp</small> of Jordan or the combined annual revenue of Mexico&#39;s drug cartels. The real figure is probably an order of magnitude smaller—but that is still large enough to make it Syria&#39;s top export.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> The past 12 years have been good for the small clique of drug dealers and war profiteers around the president. For everyone else in Syria, they have been miserable. The Syrian pound, stable at around 50 to the dollar before the war, now trades at around 6,500 according to an official rate published by the country&#39;s central bank (see chart) and at 8,700 on the black market. Official statistics are unreliable, but annual inflation is probably above 100%. Syria exports just $1bn-worth of licit goods a year, down from $11bn before the war. The government is able to provide only a few hours of electricity a day.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Assad owes his survival partly to Russia, which in 2015 sent thousands of troops and dozens of warplanes to back his regime. What it helped destroy, though, it has done little to rebuild. In 2019 and 2020, with much fanfare, Russian officials announced projects worth billions of dollars for Syria: a modernised electricity network, a grain hub at the port of Tartus, a cross-country railway. Years later the country still endures blackouts and wheat shortages; its trains sit idle.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Lately Russia has stopped making even empty promises. Bogged down in Ukraine, mired in its own sanctions, it has little to offer. Vladimir Putin has secured his own narrow interests in Syria: a naval base at Tartus and some phosphate-mining concerns, among other things. Those interests do not extend to providing homes and jobs for impoverished Syrians.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Other aspiring presidents-for-life should take note. The Wagner Group, a mercenary outfit that fought in Syria, also has a presence in Sudan, where it oversees a gold-mining operation. It works closely with <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/11/what-the-west-gets-wrong-about-peacemaking-in-sudan" data-tegid="r2qgo30vrm2vvubej1e0i7mrifjskmp6">Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo</a> (known as Hemedti), a warlord whose paramilitary Rapid Support Forces are now fighting the Sudanese army for control of the country. Russia has been happy to send men and munitions to support his fighters; it is unlikely to kick in much for reconstruction. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> If Syria is to be rebuilt, the money will have to come from elsewhere. Western governments, understandably, are loth to foot the bill. The Gulf states might be more willing—if it wins them either political influence or economic returns.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Officially, America opposes this: it wants Mr Assad to remain a pariah. Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, called his Jordanian counterpart on May 4th and reiterated that America would not recognise the regime and “does not support others normalising”. The <small>eu</small> has also maintained a tough line, even though some countries in central and southern Europe would prefer to restore ties (in the hope of getting rid of their Syrian-refugee populations). In private, though, Arab diplomats say the Americans gave them a “yellow light” to reach out to the Assad regime. Try it, they were told—but make sure you get something out of it.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The Captagon crisis shows why this is a fraught endeavour. Western officials make a straightforward argument: since Mr Assad created the problem, restoring ties with his regime would reward him for flooding the region with drugs. Arab leaders think the diagnosis is correct but the prescription is not. If Mr Assad is using drugs as leverage, they say, the only solution is to work with him. They risk endless blackmail. Perhaps Mr Assad will stem the flow—but he can easily turn it back on when he wants further concessions.</p><p class="article__body-text"> At the same time, though, Western policy is fanciful. America wants Mr Assad to abide by <small>un</small> Security Council resolution 2254, which calls for a ceasefire, a new constitution and free elections in Syria. A less odious Syrian government would probably not want the country to be a narco-state. Unsurprisingly, though, Mr Assad has shown no interest in such reforms in what has been a hereditary dictatorship since 1971. Arab states are probably too optimistic about what their outreach can achieve—but shunning him has already failed. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 09 May 2023 18:53:32 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/p74kr1mrd9ro58nqm3l8lbg62a7vmovt</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/05/09/after-12-years-of-blood-assads-syria-rejoins-the-arab-league </item><item><title><![CDATA[The 2023 crony-capitalism index]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230506_IRD001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230506_IRD001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230506_IRD001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230506_IRD001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230506_IRD001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230506_IRD001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230506_IRD001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230506_IRD001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230506_IRD001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230506_IRD001.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">O</span> <small>ver the</small> past 20 years, Britain&#39;s capital was so welcoming to oligarchs that it became known as <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/03/05/the-rise-and-fall-of-londongrad">“Londongrad”</a> .

Some 65% of the increase has come from America, China, India and Russia. Overall 40% of crony-capitalist wealth derives from autocratic countries and amounts to 9% of their <small>gdp</small> . There are hundreds of billionaires around the world whose riches are largely believed to derive from sectors which often feature chummy dealings with the state.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The way we estimate all this is to start with data from <i>Forbes.</i> The magazine has published an annual stock-take of the world&#39;s wealthy for nearly four decades. In 1998 it reckoned that there were 209 billionaires with a total worth of $1trn, equivalent to 3% of global <small>gdp</small> . This year the publication details 2,640 billionaires worth $12trn or 12% of <small>gdp</small> . Most of those listed do not operate in rent-seeking sectors. Adjusting for rising prices—$1bn in 1998 is now equivalent to $3.3bn—there are 877 billionaires (at 1998 prices) with a collective worth of $9trn.</p><p class="article__body-text"> We classify the source of wealth into rent-seeking and non-rent-seeking sectors. An economic rent is the surplus remaining once capital and labour have been paid which, with perfect competition, tends towards zero. Rent-seeking is common in sectors close to the state, including banking, construction, property and natural resources. It can sometimes be possible for rent-seekers to inflate their earnings by gaining favourable access to land, licences and resources. They may form cartels to limit competition or lobby the government for cosy regulations. They may bend rules, but do not typically break them. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/967/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/318/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/477/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/636/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/954/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1018/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1272/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1590/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2036/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Russia is, once again, the most crony-capitalist country in our index (see chart 2). Billionaire wealth from crony sectors amounts to 19% of <small>gdp</small> . The effects of the Ukrainian war are clear, however. Crony wealth declined from $456bn in 2021 to $387bn this year. Only one-fifth of Russian billionaires&#39; wealth is derived from non-crony sectors, which shows just how distorted the economy is.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In March last year, the <small>g7</small> , the <small>eu</small> and Australia launched the Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs ( <small>repo</small> ) Task Force to “isolate and exert unprecedented pressure on sanctioned Russian individuals”. A year later it announced that it had blocked or frozen $58bn of assets. But <small>repo</small> admits that in some cases oligarchs have found it easy to evade sanctions by using shell companies, passing assets to family members or investing in property. Wealth is increasingly stored in manicured lawns and marble columns.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Pressure on the oligarchs comes from Russia, too. In March Mr Putin chastised them for becoming “dependent on foreign authorities” by hiding their assets offshore. Mr Putin is a hypocrite. By one estimate he has stolen more than $100bn from Russia—which has helped pay for a compound on the Black Sea estimated to cost $1.4bn and a $700m yacht impounded by the Italian authorities last year. But he is not on the <i>Forbes</i> billionaires&#39; list.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Our index illuminates other trends among the mega-wealthy. Many of America&#39;s 735 billionaires have been hit by the crash in tech stocks last year; three-fifths of global tech-billionaire wealth originates there. The country&#39;s <small>nasdaq</small> composite, a tech-tilted index, lost about a third of its value between November 2021 and December 2022. We reckon American tech billionaires saw their riches decline by 18%. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Overall crony-sector wealth amounts to around 2% of <small>gdp</small> in America, whereas non-crony-sector wealth is 15%. But tech exhibits some crony characteristics. America&#39;s 20 biggest tech companies raked in half of all the industry&#39;s sales in 2017, making it the country&#39;s most concentrated sector. Tech firms are among the biggest lobbyists in Washington, with eight firms collectively spending $100m last year. Reclassify tech as a crony industry in our index and America&#39;s crony wealth increases to 6% of <small>gdp</small> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> Meanwhile, Chinese billionaires continue to struggle with the vagaries of their government. Since Xi Jinping launched a crackdown on private capital, crony wealth has fallen sharply, from a peak of 4.4% of <small>gdp</small> in 2018 to 2.5% now. Tycoons of all stripes operate only with the consent of the state. In 1998 there were just eight billionaires in the country (including Hong Kong and Macau), with a total worth of $50bn. Now its 562 billionaires command $2trn.</p><p class="article__body-text"> By our measure crony capitalists account for about one-quarter of that total. A recent working paper published by the Stone Centre on Socio-Economic Inequality, part of the City University of New York, finds that between 83% and 91% of corrupt senior officials were in the top 1% of the urban income distribution because of their illegal incomes. Without that money, just 6% would be in that bracket.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Since Mr Xi came to power in 2012 over 1.5m people have been punished in an ongoing anti-corruption drive. High-profile tycoons also face more scrutiny. When Jack Ma, a co-founder of the tech giant Alibaba, disappeared in late 2020 after criticising the authorities, he was worth nearly $50bn. He recently re-emerged worth half of what he had been. Bao Fan, a billionaire banker, was whisked away in February to help with an investigation. He has not been seen since.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Official talk of “common prosperity” has created a cottage industry for getting money out of China. Singapore is a prime destination for it. In 2019 the country had just 33 Chinese family offices—firms which manage a family&#39;s assets. There were perhaps 750 by the end of 2022.</p><p class="article__body-text"> India&#39;s leader, Narendra Modi, has favourites among the country&#39;s corporate captains. Over the past decade, wealth from crony-capitalist sectors has risen from 5% to nearly 8% of its <small>gdp</small> . Gautam Adani, the owner of the conglomerate of the same name, was briefly the world&#39;s third-richest person in September. But in January his company was accused of fraud and stockmarket manipulation by Hindenburg Research, an American short-seller. It denies all accusations. His wealth has fallen from $90bn to $47bn.</p><h2> Don&#39;t take a slice of my pie</h2><p class="article__body-text"> What happens when cronyism gets completely out of control? If elites so enrich themselves that they impoverish a country, a “kleptocracy” forms, declared Stanislav Andreski, a Polish sociologist. He warned against such regimes and their effects in the late 1960s. It has taken more than 50 years for Western countries to heed him.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Identifying kleptocracy is more art than science. Our findings correlate only somewhat to indices of democracy and corruption. And in any case, at what level does corruption destroy the functions of the state? <small>usaid,</small> America&#39;s agency for international development, issued an 84-page “dekleptification” guide last year. After studying 13 countries including Brazil, Malaysia and Ukraine, it recommends breaking up corrupt monopolies and digitising ownership registries, among other important measures. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> America is also trying to whip up international fervour for a crackdown. In March it hosted its second “summit for democracy”. Seventy-four countries representing two-thirds of global <small>gdp</small> declared that, among other things, they would work to “prevent and combat corruption”. Russia and China were understandably missing. Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa were among those less understandably so.</p><p class="article__body-text"> At the summit Janet Yellen, America&#39;s treasury secretary, pointed out that “kleptocrats launder kickbacks through anonymous purchases of foreign real estate”. So starting next year America will require firms formed or operating in the country to reveal their real, or “beneficial”, owners. Another 36 countries have signed up to America&#39;s declaration to make concealing identity more difficult. But transparency is not a silver bullet. Last year a new law in Britain required foreign businesses that own property assets to register themselves and disclose their true owners. A report in February by an anti-corruption watchdog found that the owners of 52,000 of the 92,000 properties subject to the new rule remained undisclosed. Shady owners skirt rules and registries often lack the resources to police them.</p><p class="article__body-text"> America also frets about “golden” visas, which sell citizenship for a chunk of cash. Five Caribbean tax havens sell passports which provide visa-free travel to around 150 countries for $100,000-150,000 each. Britain&#39;s tier-one visa scheme, launched in 2008, gave permanent residency within five years to foreigners who could prove they had £1m ($1.25m) to invest in British bonds or shares. It closed a week before the war in Ukraine started because of fears about Russian money (talk about closing the stable door once the thoroughbred has bolted). Of the 13,777 visas issued, a fifth went to Russians (including ten to oligarchs now under sanctions), a third to Chinese.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Back in London, a warning lies in Highgate cemetery. There you can find the grave of Alexander Litvinenko, not far from oligarch mansions (and also Karl Marx&#39;s tomb). He was murdered in 2006 by Russian agents with a dose of polonium-210 after making lurid allegations about Mr Putin&#39;s circle. Litvinenko is buried in a specially sealed lead-lined casket to prevent radiation leaking out.
