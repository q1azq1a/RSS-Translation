e190yofl0">直到三月份，世界上两个最大核大国的核风险降低中心（ <small>NRRC</small> ）之间的直接联系仍然活跃，相互通报导弹和轰炸机的动向。根据 2011 年生效的《新<small>起点》</small> ，其中包括对远程核武器的限制，到 2022 年，此类通知数量已超过 2,000 份。但现在不再了。弹头数量半年更新一次也已停止。自2020年3月以来，未再进行过现场检查。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">目前，俄罗斯和美国仍然遵守该条约对弹头数量的限制。他们还根据之前的协议交换即将发射弹道导弹的通知（近几个月他们只交换了一些此类信息）。他们仍然通过单独的多边渠道相互听取意见，这些渠道用于十几个需要通过<small>NRRC</small>进行通知的协议。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs

e190yofl0">人类避免了毁灭在很大程度上要归功于美国和苏联（现在的俄罗斯）之间的许多协议，这些协议限制核武器并建立信任，尽管双方都保留了摧毁对方的手段。他们将全球核库存从 1986 年的 70,400 枚弹头减少到今天的 12,500 枚（见图表）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">那个时代正在结束，原因有四个：美国放弃协议、俄罗斯入侵乌克兰、中国的核建设和颠覆性技术。从美国开始。 2002 年，乔治·W·布什总统因朝鲜和伊朗的威胁而退出了《反弹道导弹条约》（该条约限制了反导防御）。 2019 年，另一位共和党总统唐纳德·特朗普以俄罗斯的欺骗和中国的崛起为由，退出了《 <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/02/01/america-withdraws-from-the-intermediate-range-nuclear-forces-treaty">中程核力量条约</a>》（该条约取消了此类导弹）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">民主党总统对军备控制更加热衷。 <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/01/30/the-world-is-facing-an-upsurge-of-nuclear-proliferation">新的<small>开始</small></a>是由巴拉克·奥巴马(Barack Obama)谈判达成的，然后由乔·拜登(Joe拜登)在2021年续签五年。它将双方的“战略”核武器(具有高破坏力的远程武器)限制在1,550枚部署的弹头和700枚部署的洲际弹道导弹<small>(ICBM)</small> s)、轰炸机和潜射弹道导弹。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但新<small>起点</small>不控制“非战略”或“战术”武器，通常是用于战场的较小武器。俄罗斯被认为拥有 1,800 枚，而美国只有 200 枚。它也没有记录俄罗斯在核推进巡航导弹和鱼雷等方面的工作。反过来，俄罗斯抱怨英国和法国这两个美国盟友的核武库被排除在外，两国各自拥有超过 200 枚弹头。新<small>合同</small>将于 2026 年 2 月到期，后续交易的可能性很小。在不到三年的时间里，对世界核储备的最后一个主要限制很可能被取消。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这要归咎于俄罗斯入侵乌克兰以及<a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2022/09/29/could-the-war-in-ukraine-go-nuclear">一再威胁</a>使用核武器。西方国家武装了乌克兰，但没有派遣自己的军队，部分原因是担心“第三次世界大战”。俄罗斯二月份表示将“暂停”新的<small>启动</small>，停止通知。美国在三月和六月<a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/03/30/perils-grow-as-america-and-russia-stop-sharing-data-on-nukes">做出了同样的回应</a>。此后，双方对对方的姿态都变得越来越不确定，从而放大了核边缘政策的风险——尤其是在克里姆林宫处于战争状态的时候。波兰称俄罗斯已开始向白俄罗斯运送战术武器。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然后是中国，它已经在竞相建设<a href="https://www.economist.com/china/china-seeks-to-join-the-nuclear-big-league/21806104">核力量</a>。它不受条约约束，长期以来一直奉行拥有数百枚弹头的“最低威慑”政策。但五角大楼估计，到 2035 年，其库存可能会增加到 1,500 枚。这接近“新<small>起点”</small>的部署极限。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">核紧张局势可能会不可预测地进一步蔓延。印度与中国的边界争端尚未解决，因此可能会觉得有必要增加其弹头库存，目前估计有超过 160 枚弹头。这反过来可能会促使拥有类似数量的巴基斯坦进行建设。朝鲜大约拥有 30 枚弹头，正在密集测试<small>洲际弹道导弹</small>。而伊朗已经成为一个有核国家的门槛。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">新技术可能会使问题变得更加严重。高超音速导弹比弹道导弹更难被发现和击落。传感器和准确性的改进加剧了人们对突然袭击致残的担忧。人工智能（ <small>AI</small> ）的传播引发了这样的问题：核战争可以由计算机打到什么程度。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">作为回应，美国一直亮出核武刀，尽管还没有完全惊动它。它的弹道导弹潜艇通常在长达数月的巡逻中不被发现，但最近已在世界各地浮出水面。 7月，<i>肯塔基号航空母舰</i>停泊在韩国釜山港，<i>田纳西号航空母舰</i>停靠在苏格兰的法斯兰。 5月，日本和韩国的海军指挥官在关岛附近登上了<i>缅因号航空母舰</i>。去年十月，<i>西弗吉尼亚号航空母舰</i>突然出现在阿拉伯海，这显然是向伊朗发出信号，欢迎美国中央司令部司令的访问。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “沉默的服务”不再沉默。美国印太潜艇部队司令、海军少将杰弗里·贾布隆对<i>《突破防御》</i>杂志表示：“如果不传达自己的能力，就无法形成可信的威慑力量。” “如果对手对具体威慑一无所知，那么它就不是威慑。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国希望向盟友保证，其“延伸威慑”——即使他们避免使用核武器，也能保护他们免受核攻击的承诺——依然强大。波兰和韩国的一些人希望美国在他们的国家储存<small>b</small> 61核重力炸弹。它已经反抗了。但展示“婴儿潮一代”潜艇可以作为对敌人的警告和对朋友的保证。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国正忙于通过新的地面、空中和海上系统对其核“三位一体”的所有三个支柱进行现代化改造。一个不言而喻的目标是加快核工业基础，以便在未来需要时能够生产更多武器。有些人想走得更远。劳伦斯·利弗莫尔实验室（Lawrence Livermore Laboratory）是一家由政府资助、主要设计核弹头的机构，三月份发表的一篇论文称，美国目前的核力量“仅勉强够用”。美国应该在新<small>起点</small>到期时通过“迅速上传”来扩大这一范围，部署目前储备的武器，例如<small>洲际</small>弹道导弹上的多弹头；在此之前，它应该展示这样做的能力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国的“上传能力”比俄罗斯更大。旨在尽量减少全球风险的美国科学家联合会计算出，根据目前部署的战略弹头总数约 1,670 枚（它使用与新<small>起点</small>不同的计数规则），美国可以在几年内部署 3,570 枚，而俄罗斯为 2,629。一些专家担心大国也可能恢复核武器试验，这一想法在特朗普时代就曾讨论过。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">拜登的国家安全顾问杰克·沙利文(Jake Sullivan)在谈到核平衡的“拐点”时宣称，美国准备“无条件”与俄罗斯和中国讨论军备控制问题。两人都不急于接受他的提议。鉴于在乌克兰遭受的惨重损失，俄罗斯要么过于愤慨，要么过于依赖核武器，以至于无法考虑达成新协议。就中国而言，它似乎对限制不感兴趣，可能直到它达到与美国平起平坐为止。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">事实上，对等一直是美俄之间军控的基础。但当涉及三种权力时，就很难达成一致。美国尤其担心俄罗斯和中国可能结盟反对它，因为两国已宣布建立“无限的友谊”并进行联合空中和海上巡逻。沙利文先生坚称，美国不需要“数量超过我们竞争对手的总和”来阻止他们。然而，美国智库卡内基国际和平基金会的詹姆斯·阿克顿表示，美国增加其人数的压力可能是不可抗拒的。只要美国的瞄准政策仍停留在“反制力量”上——将核武器瞄准对方的核设施以压制它们——对手手中拥有更多武器就意味着美国也需要更多武器。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">世界毁灭者</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">布什领导下的前五角大楼负责政策的副部长埃里克·埃德尔曼(Eric Edelman)提出了不同的说法，他回顾了冷战时期关于承受第一次打击的能力并仍然能够对敌人造成不可接受的伤害的计算：“如果你有两个对手各拥有 1,500 件武器，其中一人发起攻击，你安然度过，然后进行报复：你还剩下什么储备来对付另一个对手？”他补充道：“我们还不知道正确的数字是多少，但可能在 1,550 以上。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">鉴于限制核武器的新条约前景黯淡，美国正在探索与中国达成不太正式的安排，以防止危机演变成冲突。例如，沙利文先生提议将与俄罗斯的热线和通知系统扩展到<small>联合国</small>安理会所有五个常任理事国。但中国的反应却令人沮丧。他这样总结道：“如果你在车里系上安全带，你就会被激励开得更快、更疯狂，然后你就会发生车祸。所以，从某种程度上来说，最好不要系安全带。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">控制人工智能的使用更加困难，因为它无法像<small>洲际弹道导弹</small>那样被看到和计算。即使<small>人工智能</small>可以帮助决策，美国、英国和法国也已推动制定一项规范，要求在使用核武器时始终应有“一个人参与其中”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国的<small>NRRC</small>人员仍然充足，有 40 多人在排队等候，希望华盛顿和莫斯科之间能有更好的时光。 “在关系良好的时期保持这条路线很重要；当紧张局势加剧时，这一点就更加重要，因为随着其他渠道紧张，误判的潜在影响也会增加，”一位美国官员表示。一位会说俄语的人随时待命。在一个更明智的世界里，也会有一个说中文的人。屏幕上<a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/07/14/realism-with-oppenheimer-or-escapism-with-barbie">奥本海默</a>被告知，他赋予了人们“毁灭自己的力量”。现在的问题是，面对新的核噩梦，人类是否仍有能力拯救自己。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div>

点刚过，叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德的<small>军队</small><span>发动</span>了袭击。大马士革郊区古塔的居民告诉记者，他们听到一种奇怪的声音，好像有人在打开一瓶百事可乐。当地一名医生强忍着泪水解释说，许多人已经在地下寻求庇护，但气体比空气重，因此聚集在地下室和地窖中。如果他们爬楼梯的话，他们就能活下来。当晚，超过 1000 人丧生。医生向医疗队分发了约 25,000

class="article__body-text"> 2013 年 8 月 21 日，阿萨德向古塔发射了<a href="/middle-east-and-africa/2013/08/24/if-this-isnt-a-red-line-what-is">装有沙林的火箭。</a>这是叙利亚内战中伤亡最惨重的一天。它<a href="/leaders/2013/04/27/acid-test">要求时任美国总统巴拉克·奥巴马(Barack Obama)</a>按照他的警告采取行动，即“我们的红线是我们开始看到一大堆化学武器被转移或使用。这会改变我的计算。”</p><p class="article__body-text">古塔事件发生十年后，奥巴马在叙利亚问题上的红线被人们铭记为他总统任期的决定性时刻。他没有立即发动袭击，而是首先决定要求国会投票，然后同意<a href="/middle-east-and-africa/2013/09/20/an-unlikely-band-of-brothers">如果俄罗斯介入</a>监督叙利亚的化学武器裁军，他将完全不采取行动。批评者认为，奥巴马不愿惩罚阿萨德削弱了美国的信誉，而且其后果至今仍在显现。</p><p class="article__body-text">时任法国总统弗朗索瓦·奥朗德上个月在接受英国<small>广播公司</small>采访时表示，这“对中东尤其不利。对于西方与俄罗斯之间的关系而言，这具有决定性意义。”早在2013年， <i>《经济学人》</i>就曾对奥巴马的选择表示遗憾，指责他“<a href="/leaders/2013/09/20/the-weakened-west">削弱了西方</a>”。但值得重新审视这一判断。尽管西方国家的信誉在过去十年中受到侵蚀是无可争议的，但向阿萨德发射巡航导弹却很难拯救它。它甚至可能无法使叙利亚人民免受进一步的神经毒气袭击。</p><p class="article__body-text">奥巴马的红线是一个奇怪的例子，它的政策纯属偶然，后来取得了辉煌的成功，却被视为历史性的失败。它提出了这样的问题：领导人可以——或者应该——在多大程度上将可信度置于其计划的中心。</p><p class="article__body-text">对于如此一丝不苟的政治家来说，奇怪的是奥巴马先生竟然无意中划下了他的<a href="/middle-east-and-africa/2012/08/25/more-than-they-can-chew">红线</a>。尽管这个词表明他在仔细权衡自己的选择后做出了最后通牒，但总统在 2012 年 8 月 20 日的白宫新闻发布会上谈到了如果叙利亚使用化学武器的后果，这让他的助手们感到震惊。 。只有少数新闻媒体真正报道了他的言论，也许是因为官员们匆忙通报说，政府仍然不太可能干预叙利亚。</p><p class="article__body-text">官员们来得太晚了。美国政府内部和国外（包括伦敦）的许多人希望美国使用武力阻止阿萨德每天犯下暴行。他们抓住了奥巴马先生的话。 “它会立即引爆，”奥巴马前官员、美国中东政策新史《大妄想》一书的作者史蒂文·西蒙 (Steven Simon) 说。 “这上面没有安装延时保险丝。” </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HQhKnW2uWv8?enablejsapi=1" class></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text">更重要的是，奥巴马本人也动摇了。 2012年12月和2013年3月，阿萨德先生被指控对他的人民使用化学武器。奥巴马先生第一次称此类武器“完全不可接受”，第二次则称其为“游戏规则改变者”。然而，在建立了期望之后，古塔事件发生三周后，总统突然否认自己的信誉受到威胁，并表示：“我没有设定红线。世界设定了一条红线。”</p><p class="article__body-text">事后看来，奥巴马的错误似乎是想要两全其美。当阿萨德似乎正在考虑使用神经毒气来恐吓他的人民时，红线的制定有助于加强美国的警告。然而，暴行发生后，其坚定态度使其成为强大的威胁，但也增加了似乎做得太少的代价。美国第 26 任总统西奥多·罗斯福有一句著名的建议，即领导人要“轻声细语，大棒大棒”。奥巴马用噪音换成了大棒，并为此付出了惨重的代价。</p><h2>最后通牒中的 -um</h2><p class="article__body-text">除此之外，如果奥巴马的目的是阻止叙利亚使用神经毒气，那么他也取得了超出预期的成功。袭击发生几周后，俄罗斯制定了一项计划，如果美国不发动袭击，国际视察员将监督叙利亚化学武器计划的拆除。</p><p class="article__body-text"> “让叙利亚加入化学武器公约 ( <small>CWC</small> ) 的协议是 21 世纪最伟大的防扩散成就之一，”在弗吉尼亚州费尔法克斯乔治梅森大学任教的化学武器专家格雷戈里·科布伦茨 (Gregory Koblentz) 认为。</p><p class="article__body-text">叙利亚拥有中东最先进的计划，旨在阻止以色列的常规军事攻击。在俄罗斯的鼓励、国际社会的帮助以及<small>禁止</small>化学武器组织的斡旋下，它销毁了1300吨武器和易制毒化学品、1200件弹药并拆除了27个生产设施。 Koblentz 博士指出，8 月 21 日，10 到 12 枚火箭弹已造成 1000 多人死亡。每人携带约 50 升神经毒剂，重量略低于 55 公斤。相比之下，他估计叙利亚摧毁的神经毒剂可能重达 1,000 吨，足以攻击古塔 1,800 次。</p><p class="article__body-text">这个记录远非完美。叙利亚继续使用氯气，包括在 2018 年的<a href="/middle-east-and-africa/2018/04/09/america-vows-to-respond-to-a-suspected-chemical-attack-in-syria">一次高度致命的袭击</a>中，奥巴马的继任者唐纳德·特朗普以及英国和法国遭到了一系列巡航导弹的攻击。科布伦茨博士还观察到，叙利亚保留了一些神经毒剂——尽管只是最初库存的一小部分——因为阿萨德先生又发动了三起神经毒剂袭击，尽管这些袭击造成的伤害比古塔要小得多。在每一次事件中，俄罗斯都为其盟友掩盖事实，将袭击归咎于叛军。在禁止<small>化学武器组织</small>举行的紧急会议上，叙利亚大使通过在手机上播放“愤怒的小鸟”来表达他的蔑视。</p><p class="article__body-text">但这一记录肯定比美国及其盟国试图从远处消除叙利亚化学武器要好。西蒙先生回忆起战争的最初几个月，人们都在讨论如何阻止化学武器落入坏人之手。他说：“我花了很多时间与<small>美国</small>和以色列情报部门打交道，以查明所有这些东西的位置，并跟踪或监控特定设施对反对派力量的破坏的脆弱性，并与<small>美国</small>探索方法军方了解美国如何单方面销毁这些库存而不造成巨大的公共健康危害。”</p><div

表示，答案之一是政策选择的受众远远超出了其狭隘目标。就奥巴马先生而言，听众中挤满了已经怀疑他决心的人。他在叙利亚红线问题上的强硬言论被他经常表示的希望美国减少在中东乃至整个世界的治安上投入资源的愿望所掩盖。美国在阿富汗和伊拉克陷入困境。在英国和法国的要求下，利比亚“幕后领导”推翻残暴总统穆阿迈尔·卡扎菲的决定以混乱告终。以色列和海湾地区的一些领导人认为，奥巴马试图与伊朗就其核计划达成协议的做法过于宽容。</p><p class="article__body-text">亚里-米洛博士认为，除了根据政策来评判领导人之外，领导人还获得了“标志性声誉”，反映了他们执行威胁和兑现承诺的记录。对于这一声誉的价值，专家们意见不一。一些人认为，外国势力做出的决定是基于对领导人当前能力和利益的评估，而不是基于他或她的过去。然而，亚里-米洛博士的研究表明，在现实世界中，外国势力以声誉为指导。 “像普京这样的人不会进行那种超理性主义的算计，”她说。 “他们使用捷径。而那些……很多时候都是基于他们与那个国家互动的个人经历。”</p><p class="article__body-text">西蒙先生认为奥巴马先生的声誉极其不公平。他指出，2013年，这位前总统开始了一项大规模行动，训练和支持叙利亚的叛军战士，并认为这比对古塔的惩罚性打击意义重大得多。中东领导人知道这一承诺，但似乎并没有赢得他们太多的信任。此外，西蒙先生在他的书中描述了自乔治·W·布什第二任期以来，历任美国总统如何试图限制美国对中东的承诺。然而叙利亚的红线仍然被视为一个转折点。</p></div><p class="article__body-text">回顾十年，奥巴马的记录表明其可信度是多么难以捉摸。奥巴马坚称他并不后悔。 2016年，他对《<i>大西洋月刊》</i>表示，“向某人投掷炸弹来证明你愿意向某人投掷炸弹，这几乎是使用武力的最糟糕的理由”。这肯定是正确的。当理查德·尼克松 (Richard Nixon) 在 20 世纪 70 年代轰炸柬埔寨和越共时，他相信发展中国家会像多米诺骨牌一样倒塌，结果造成了很多人的生命损失，却没有挽救美国的声誉。此外，土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安等领导人可以随意改变立场，但仍然能够发挥权力。</p><p class="article__body-text">即便如此，美国在中东的地位已经削弱（部分是出于选择）这一更普遍的事实使处理叙利亚化学武器的成功黯然失色。 2014 年伊斯兰国作为无政府状态和混乱的暴力根源的崛起凸显了这一点。更糟糕的是，在奥巴马先生的支持下介入叙利亚问题的人是弗拉基米尔·普京(Vladimir Putin)。此后，他加强了对该国的控制，嘲笑美国假装充当全球警察，并向乌克兰派遣军队。红线之所以被保留，是因为它代表了美国为应对复杂世界而持续努力的有力隐喻。 <span>■</span></p></div>

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>就像</span>iPod 和 MySpace<small>一样</small>，<small>金砖国家</small>集团是 2000 年代良性乐观主义的产物。 2001年，高盛在一篇有关巴西、俄罗斯、印度和中国经济潜力的论文中创造了<small>“金砖四国”</small>这个缩写词。四方根据这个想法，于 2009 年举行了第一次峰会。一年后，南非受邀加入。一些分析人士担心<small>金砖国家</small>可能很快就会开始与<small>七国集团竞争，</small>但该组织很快就失去了动力。亚洲以外的<small>金砖国家</small>经济体在 2010 年代陷入停滞。在峰会上，欧盟将发布关于背信弃义的西方的含混不清的公报，而背信弃义的西方很快就会忽视这些公报。<small>金砖国家</small>看起来已经死了。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但这个集团依然存在。 8 月 22 日，第十五次<small>金砖国家</small>峰会将在南非主要城市约翰内斯堡开幕，这是许多地缘政治领域最摇摆选民的聚会场所。南非总统西里尔·拉马福萨将与印度纳伦德拉·莫迪、巴西路易斯·伊纳西奥·卢拉·达席尔瓦（俗称卢拉）和中国国家主席习近平等领导人一同出席。弗拉基米尔·普京不会亲自出席。如果他出席，那么南非作为国际刑事法院的成员，将有义务根据法院三月份向俄罗斯总统发出的逮捕令采取行动。这可能会破坏乐趣。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这次会议将强调俄罗斯入侵乌克兰以及西方与中国之间日益紧张的关系如何使欧盟重新焕发活力。以北京为首的<small>金砖国家</small>成员正在考虑是否扩大和深化该集团。一些中等强国认为该组织可能是实现其利益的工具。该集团表示，已有 40 多个国家申请加入或表示有兴趣加入。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “大<small>金砖国家</small>”对西方来说将是一个挑战。但这并不是致命的威胁。中国扩大欧盟的努力暴露了其紧张和矛盾。俄罗斯的衰弱也随之而来，但巴西、印度和南非对此持怀疑态度。<small>金砖五国的</small>多样性远高于<small>七国集团</small>。成员在政治、经济和军事上存在分歧；扩张将使杂乱无章的船员变得更加杂乱。这意味着，尽管<small>金砖国家</small>可以更大声地批评西方主导的国际秩序，但他们将更加难以阐明替代方案。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">那么，是什么让<small>金砖国家</small>团结在一起呢？与<small>七国集团一样，</small>该组织没有章程或正式的成员资格标准。它的砂浆也不是个人化学反应的产物。六月，在开普敦举行的外交部长会议上，作为主要活动的热身活动，本报记者偷偷溜进了为政要们准备午餐的餐厅。意大利面沙拉并不是这次舞会唯一令人悲伤的景象。代表团很分散：中国人太忙于开会，南非人太杂乱，巴西人太迟了。外面，印度外交部长苏杰生 (Subrahmanyam Jaishankar) 与他的官员开庭。里面，俄罗斯同行谢尔盖·拉夫罗夫（Sergey Lavrov）默默地喝着一杯白葡萄酒。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">在房间里工作</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><small>金砖国家</small>之所以能够长久存在，是因为该俱乐部承担着多种职能。一是为成员国提供一个平台，以批评世界银行、<small>国际货币基金组织</small>和<small>联合国</small>安理会等机构对“全球南方”（发展中国家的流行术语）的排斥态度，而这种批评往往是有道理的。在开普敦，苏杰生谈到全球经济力量的“集中”，“让太多国家受到少数国家的摆布”。奇怪的是，随着<small>金砖国家</small>占世界<small>GDP的</small>份额从2001年的8%上升到如今的26%，这种观点变得更加尖锐。同期， <small>G7</small>的份额从 65% 下降至 43%（见图 1）。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px"

e190yofl0"><small>金砖国家</small>的俱乐部性质也是声望的来源，特别是对于陷入困境的成员而言。自 2013 年以来，巴西、俄罗斯和南非的<small>GDP</small>平均年增长率不到 1%（而中国和印度的增长率约为 6%）。任何将它们列为当今最有前途的新兴市场的投资分析师都会对她的 Zoom 电话一笑置之。但作为该集团中唯一的拉丁美洲国家和唯一的非洲国家，巴西和南非能够在非洲大陆发挥影响力：拉马福萨先生邀请了大量非洲领导人参加约翰内斯堡峰会。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">欧盟也在孤立时期提供支持。巴西前总统雅伊尔·博尔索纳罗在其盟友唐纳德·特朗普离开白宫后转向金砖<small>国家</small>。如今，俄罗斯比以往任何时候都更需要<small>金砖国家</small>。在外交部长会议上，你们的记者试图询问俄罗斯驻南非大使，该集团对南非的目的是什么。 “为了结交更多朋友，”他咕哝道。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs

<small>G20</small>过于由西方成员主导。<small>金砖国家</small>代表了最好的政党。一位中国官员将北京对<small>金砖</small>国家“大家庭”的渴望与西方的“小圈子”进行了对比。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">超大号习</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs

<i>《经济学人》</i>根据截至 7 月底至少满足三个标准之一的情况，统计了 18 个可能的候选国家（见地图）。首先，该国已公开表示已提出申请。其次，南非官员已将该国列为申请国。第三，该国外交部长以欧盟“朋友”的身份亲自或虚拟出席了开普敦会议。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">嘉宾名单中包括一些日益自信的地缘政治浪荡公子。对于沙特阿拉伯和<small>阿拉伯联合酋长国</small>来说，加入<small>金砖国家</small>将有助于他们重新调整与长期盟友美国的关系，并拉近与中国的距离。孟加拉国和印度尼西亚与印度一样，都是人口众多的亚洲民主国家，它们声称不结盟，而且可能也希望得到一些保护，免受西方对其人权记录的批评。阿根廷、埃塞俄比亚、墨西哥和尼日利亚都是各自大陆上最大的国家。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">万一所有 18 名学生都被录取，世界上最好的拼字游戏玩家将面临挑战，需要想出一个新的缩写词。它还将使<small>金砖</small>国家的人口从 32 亿（占世界人口的 41%）增加到 46 亿（占世界人口的 58%），而<small>七国集团</small>成员的人口仅为 10%。金砖<small>国家</small>占世界<small>GDP的</small>份额将上升至34%，仍落后于<small>七国集团</small>，但是<small>欧盟</small>份额的两倍。它将把该集团在世界贸易中的份额从18%提高到27%。然而，中国仍然是该党的生命、灵魂和钱包。它将占23个国家产出的55%（作为参考，美国占<small>G7</small>的58%）。中国在<small>金砖国家</small>全球贸易中所占的份额仍约为一半（46%）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管欧盟就扩张展开辩论，但它仍在深化现有关系。除了一年一度的大佬峰会之外，金砖国家及其友好国家的学者、企业、部长、执政党和<small>智库</small>的会议名单也越来越长。其中一些可能看起来像是按日津贴的借口。上个月，“<small>金砖国家</small>青年峰会”由南非74岁的青年部长主持。俄罗斯表示将在明年巴黎奥运会之前举办“<small>金砖国家</small>运动会”。但巴西智库 Getulio Vargas 基金会的奥利弗·斯图恩克尔 (Oliver Stuenkel) 认为，与官员关系的重要性不应被忽视。 “这些会议通常很无聊，但它们让官僚们能够将他们的网络全球化。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><small>金砖</small>国家集团也有更认真的努力。它建立了两个金融机构，据报道俄罗斯财政部长曾将其称为“迷你<small>国际货币基金组织”</small>和“迷你世界银行”。前者是2014年<small>金砖</small>国家峰会上达成的应急储备安排（ <small>CRA</small> ）。这是一系列尚未经过考验的互换额度，可供各国央行在出现国际收支问题时获得硬通货。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">迷你世界银行是新开发银行（ <small>NDB</small> ）。 Since its establishment in 2015 it has lent $33bn for almost 100 projects. Three new members have joined in the past three years: Bangladesh, Egypt and the <small>UAE</small> . Uruguay is set to be admitted soon. (A state does not need to be a member of the <small>BRICS</small> to join the bank.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The possibility of expanding and deepening the grouping is seen by members as proof of its strength. Yet these efforts also highlight divisions among the gang. Economically and politically the <small>BRICS</small> are a mess—adding more members or functions would only emphasise that fact.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Start with the economic differences. The <small>GDP</small> per person of the poorest member, India, is roughly a fifth of that of China and Russia. The latter pair run current-account surpluses, the others deficits. Russia, an important member of the <small>OPEC+</small> cartel, and Brazil are net oil exporters; the other three depend on imports. China actively manages the exchange rate of its currency; the other four intervene less often. And so on.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All of this complicates the bloc&#39;s attempt to change the global economic order. A common <small>BRICS</small> reserve currency—something Mr Putin claimed the bloc was working on a year ago—would collapse on first contact with reality; no member would give up the power held by their central bank. Members regularly guard their own power at economic institutions. South Africa&#39;s efforts to have more African representation on the <small>IMF</small> board have been rejected. China has around 40% of the voting rights at the <small>CRA</small> , in line with its capital contribution, and insisted on a limit to what any country can receive in the absence of an <small>IMF</small> programme.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>NDB</small> has had a slow start. Its total lending since 2015 is a third of what the World Bank Group committed in 2021 alone. The World Bank is more transparent and accountable than the <small>NDB</small> , notes Daniel Bradlow of the University of Pretoria in South Africa. That the <small>NDB</small> mostly issues loans in <small>US</small> dollars or euros somewhat undermines its members&#39; claim to be trying to reduce the power of the greenback. A rule ensures that the five original members retain 55% of voting rights, belying their criticisms of uneven decision-making power at the World Bank and the <small>IMF</small> . “That does not suggest a truly progressive global-south bank,” says Mr Bradlow.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Politically, too, they are an eclectic bunch. Russia and China are autocracies that disdain liberal freedoms. Brazil, India and South Africa are by contrast raucous, if flawed, democracies. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The trio have more reason to be wary of public opinion as a result. A poll published on July 27th by the Pew Research Centre, a think-tank based in Washington, <small>DC</small> , found that negative views towards China have become more common since 2019—and not just in the West. In South Africa 40% of respondents had an unfavourable view of China, up from 35% four years ago. In Brazil and India unfavourable sentiment reached the highest levels since polling began in 2010 and 2013 respectively. In Brazil the share rose from 27% to 48%; in India from 46% to 67% (see chart 2).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The democracies are also keener than the autocracies on genuinely “non-aligned” foreign policies—they want to stay swingers. Take South Africa. It has angered the West by, among other things, hosting a naval exercise with China and Russia on the first anniversary of the war in Ukraine. It has government ministers who get dewy-eyed at the very mention of the Soviet Union.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Mr Ramaphosa is wary of pushing the West too far. Several of South Africa&#39;s main sources of foreign direct investment ( <small>FDI</small> ) are Western powers, and it hosts drills with <small>NATO</small> countries, too. He wants to keep South Africa&#39;s preferential trade terms with America, which some in Congress have said should be rescinded in light of his government&#39;s drift towards Russia.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Lula also has a more subtle approach than his peers in Beijing and Moscow. He would like to reduce what he sees as America&#39;s hegemonic role in the world; hence his enthusiasm for the <small>BRICS</small> , which he helped establish during his first period in office in the 2000s. At the same time he understands the need for good relations with the West, which is its main source of <small>FDI</small> and arms. And although India continues to buy arms from Russia, it is diversifying its military ties and buying more from America and France.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine has entrenched diplomatic faultlines in other ways. The bloc&#39;s strong emphasis on sovereignty—originally a way to draw an implicit contrast with an interventionist West—looks hollow when Russia invades its neighbour. Neither China nor Russia supports the others&#39; proposed reforms of the <small>UN</small> Security Council, of which they are both permanent members. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="An illustration of five mostly empty cocktail glasses with flags respresenting South Africa, China, Brazil, India and Russia scattered around and confetti on the floor.

Though Lula is more sympathetic to the idea of welcoming like-minded Latin American leaders to the club, such as Argentina&#39;s Alberto Fernández (with whom he is personally close), diplomatic types are more sceptical. Mauro Vieira, Brazil&#39;s foreign minister and a career diplomat, has spoken of the need to protect the <small>BRICS</small> “brand”. South Africa likes being the only African representative in the bloc. China would be emboldened by a bigger <small>BRICS;</small> others would feel enfeebled.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All these differences are coming to the fore because of expansion talk. “We do not want to dilute control of the <small>BRICS</small> from the original five,” says a South African official. South Africa instead hopes for a compromise whereby joiners are given second-class status, mere <small>B</small> -listers at the party. The details need to be worked out—something which may happen at the summit.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Warring parties</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The critical dissenting voice is likely to be India&#39;s, given its growing economic and geopolitical importance. In the early days of the bloc “India thought that with the help of Russia it could manage China better,” says Harsh Pant of the Observer Research Foundation, a think-tank in Delhi. That is harder now Russia is beholden to China. And India frets about some of the wannabes, such as Cuba and Belarus. India fears these would be mini-Russias, repeating China&#39;s talking points.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> India sees itself as a rival to China for leadership of the global south. It has used its presidency of the <small>G20</small> this year to amplify the concerns of developing countries regarding climate finance and international institutions. It would not want to play second fiddle to a Chinese effort to woo this same group.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The tricky thing for India is that it doesn&#39;t want to be a party-pooper either. Nor is it keen to attract the blame for blocking other emerging countries&#39; aspirations. And it aims to preserve decent relations with China, with which it has deep economic links and a long border. So India is proceeding with caution. It wants to discuss joining criteria for new members in the coming weeks, rather than simply handing out welcome drinks.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Johannesburg summit will be a defining moment for the <small>BRICS.</small> Enlargement would indicate the scale of China&#39;s sway on the scene. But if China is blocked it would underline the group&#39;s deep divisions. Either way, the global south is showing that it is as transactional as the Western countries it claims moral superiority over. And much more fractured. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 17 Aug 2023 13:33:27 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/g3hmdnml8f7f4j9i2v6sb2fu377bjsko</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/08/17/the-brics-are-getting-together-in-south-africa </item><item><title><![CDATA[What Ukraine’s bloody battlefield is teaching medics]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>A</span> MERICAN AND British intelligence agencies watched as Russia massed its troops on the border with Ukraine in the early weeks of 2022. They knew that Vladimir Putin had planned an invasion—they had stolen his plans. But would Mr Putin go through with it? One indicator that he would, says Major-General Tim Hodgetts, the surgeon-general of Britain&#39;s armed forces, was that field hospitals were moving to Russia&#39;s border with Ukraine.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That was telling, but not damning. Russia had deployed hospitals for exercises in the past. More worrying were the ongoing blood drives among the country&#39;s university students. Red blood cells last only six weeks if not frozen; donors can be bled only every three months. Even more troubling was what was happening inside the field hospitals. Russian surgeons were practising operations on large, anaesthetised animals. “Medical indicators and warnings are predictive of war,” concludes General Hodgetts. It is a vital lesson from Ukraine for future conflicts.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The war in Ukraine is the largest in Europe since 1945. Russia and Ukraine have fought at a scale and intensity that Western armies have not encountered since the Korean war. Military casualties have dwarfed those of recent American and European campaigns. America lost over 7,000 troops in Afghanistan and Iraq between 2001 and 2019. Ukraine has lost more than twice as many in a year, according to leaked American documents, Russia six to seven times more. The experience will change military medicine for good.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In Afghanistan and Iraq, America&#39;s army and its allies made astonishing progress in wartime medical care. Since the majority of deaths occur before soldiers arrive at a hospital, much was gained by evacuating wounded troops by helicopter and treating them within the “golden hour”, a period in which the chance of survival is far higher. Soldiers who once would have died pulled through. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The ratio of those wounded to killed, around three- or four-to-one in Vietnam, where care was poorer, shot up to as high as ten-to-one (see chart). In Ukraine the figure has plummeted back to Vietnam levels, say people familiar with the classified data. No more than 2% of American soldiers were killed or wounded in the post-2001 wars; the comparable figure is estimated at 5-10% for Ukraine. A study from 2022 by the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank, suggested that 40% of wounded Ukrainian personnel were suffering permanent injuries.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To a certain extent these figures reflect the limitations of medical care on both sides. Russia&#39;s army treats infantry as disposable. Wounded soldiers have been sent back to the front lines with serious shrapnel wounds and cardiac problems. Tanisha Fazal of the University of Minnesota, an expert on medical care in war, says her jaw dropped when she saw a video of a Russian officer using an obsolete rubber tourniquet. It was of the sort that America used in Afghanistan in the early 2000s.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For its part, Ukraine is in the midst of a transition away from Soviet-style care. Before 2017 it had no professional cadre of combat medics, says Maria Nazarova, an instructor in the country&#39;s armed forces. By 2022 it had trained 650 of them, a drop in the ocean for a notional million-man army. The training centre, short of instructors and facilities, now prepares fewer than 300 people per month for the battlefield, each of whom has had just those four weeks of instruction.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The current counter-offensive, which is forcing Ukrainian troops to cross minefields in the teeth of drone and artillery attacks, is intensifying the burden on medical care. “I have not seen such a spike in the demand for tourniquets since June last year,” says Evgen Vorobiov, a lawyer in Kyiv who works as a volunteer with six different brigades. He adds that chest seals and ultrasound devices are also needed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The shortages are compounded by structural problems. The supply of military equipment to front-line units remains inefficient and ad hoc, says Mr Vorobiov. Senior medics spend their time filling out paper forms to request supplies that arrive erratically and in small quantities. There is frequent tension between front-line units and the general staff&#39;s central medical command, which sees its job as running hospitals rather than supporting front-line care. It does not provide vital kit, such as portable ultrasound or intraosseous access devices, which are needed to get fluids into patients when veins can&#39;t be found—a common problem for soldiers in shock, says Ms Nazarova. Over 90% of medical supplies for combat medics are purchased by volunteers, she says.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This bureaucratic infighting has more serious consequences, too. America&#39;s army realised in the 2000s that transfusing wounded soldiers with “whole” blood, rather than components like plasma, was saving lives. Last summer Ukraine&#39;s health ministry legalised that practice. The medical command, in a fit of bureaucracy, then stepped in to ban it. But many “modern-thinking” Ukrainian brigades continue doing it regardless, says Ms Nazarova, using personal contacts with local blood-donation centres. The result is uneven levels of care throughout the armed forces.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Western armies would enjoy many advantages in a big war, including more skilled personnel and better equipment. But American and European military doctors acknowledge that a large conflict would prove a huge shock to medical care honed over decades of counterinsurgency campaigns against opponents lacking in artillery, missiles and drones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Take helicopters, which are critical for transporting the wounded. Just 70 American ones were downed by fire between 2001 and 2009 in Afghanistan and Iraq. Russia has lost 90 in 17 months. “This recognition that the next war will likely be very different in air superiority has changed lots of paradigms within the <small>US</small> and <small>NATO</small> militaries,” says John Holcomb, a professor at the University of Alabama who led the <small>US</small> Army&#39;s Institute of Surgical Research. There will be “prolonged field care” outside hospitals. “Clinical outcomes will be poor,” warns General Hodgetts.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Injury patterns will differ, too. Around 79% of America&#39;s casualties in the wars after the attacks of September 11th, 2001 were from improvised explosive devices. More than 70% of Ukrainian casualties are from artillery and rocket barrages, according to a recent paper published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons. These tend to affect a larger number of soldiers at once, causing “polytrauma”—damage to multiple body parts and organs.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Treating such injuries at scale will tax European armies. Consider blood. It is a “strategic commodity” for the alliance, writes Ronald Ti, a military-medical logistician at King&#39;s College London. A military health-care system that cannot provide it risks “systemic collapse of morale”, he warns. Dr Ti gives the example of Estonia: its main peacetime stock of blood could be exhausted in a single day of war (on <small>NATO</small> ’s standard assumptions about rates of use).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet stockpiling blood is not like storing ammo. Its shelf life when fresh is weeks (and, when frozen, months), not years. Thawing it from frozen takes time. Moreover, blood-donation levels in Britain routinely drop below a week&#39;s worth of reserves, notes General Hodgetts. The war is helping to resolve previously knotty legal issues in <small>NATO</small> around the interoperability of blood products and drugs. Britain is now investing to produce its own freeze-dried plasma, having previously depended on scarce French and German production that might be swamped in wartime.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another problem is how to shift tens of thousands of wounded soldiers. On July 11th <small>NATO</small> leaders approved the alliance&#39;s first comprehensive defence plans since the cold war. They included specific plans for mass-casualty transport across Europe, including how to distribute casualties among different allies, an issue neglected for years. <small>NATO</small> medical chiefs, sometimes joined by Ukraine&#39;s surgeon-general, have been meeting regularly to test how those procedures would fare in wartime. Up to 60% of Ukraine&#39;s military casualties have been moved by rail. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Medics once wanted hospitals to stand out in a war zone. The lesson from Ukraine, where Russia has struck facilities with large red crosses on the roof, is that it may be better to blend in. The World Health Organisation estimates that there have been almost 900 attacks on health facilities in the war (see map). Medical doctors are considering how to harden, camouflage or disperse their facilities. But light and agile field hospitals will inevitably provide more limited care. Another growing challenge is how to ensure that the electronic emissions of medical equipment do not serve as a beacon to enemy bombs.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Ready for action</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The war has also put nuclear weapons back on the agenda. In the autumn Western leaders grew concerned that Russia was preparing to use tactical nuclear weapons. America, Britain and France warned the Kremlin that it would face serious military consequences if it took that step; the danger subsided. In the cold war <small>NATO</small> planned to fight through a nuclear battlefield. Those plans faded away in the 1990s. Many officials now worry that America and its allies are medically unprepared for nuclear conflict. Vast numbers of burn kits would be needed, for example.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Finally, Ukraine illustrates how technology is changing military medicine. A study published in February 2021 by Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Maddry and his colleagues at the <small>US</small> Army&#39;s Institute of Surgical Research examined the records of 1,267 patients transported with traumatic injuries. Half did not receive any life-saving intervention en route and so might have been moved safely by drone.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine is testing that theory. It has already used large cargo drones, capable of carrying 180kg loads up to 70km, to evacuate wounded personnel, becoming the first country to conduct this sort of robotic medevac. “As technology advances,” write Lieutenant-Colonel Maddry and his co-authors, “robotics aboard [drones] could provide pain medications, blood products, oxygen, airway management, and even surgical procedures”—though the drones are subject to the same risks as helicopters, points out Dr Fazal.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The challenge is to learn from such experiments and Ukraine&#39;s broader experience. That requires turning anecdotes into hard data. America has offered to help Ukraine build a “trauma registry” of the sort that it used in Afghanistan and Iraq, a database which logs how patients are injured, how they have been treated and how they fare. Analysis will benefit not just allied armies, but also the wider public.

The resulting leap in grain prices, Mr Guterres warned, would leave many hungry. This week Russia landed blows of a more literal sort on Ukraine&#39;s grain exports, bombing the ports around Odessa from which they are shipped.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A volley of missiles against wharves near the city centre on the night of July 22nd was so indiscriminate it hit one of the city&#39;s cathedrals. On July 19th 60,000 tonnes of grain were destroyed in another bombardment. And on July 24th Russia targeted Reni, a port on the Danube river (not covered by the agreement) through which Ukraine had been exporting grain via Romania.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Before Russia&#39;s invasion Ukraine exported some 45m tonnes of grain a year, around 90% of it via Odessa and other ports on the Black Sea. In the year the grain deal was in operation almost 33m tonnes were exported through Odessa&#39;s ports. That has now stopped.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Exports by road, rail and river barge have been increasing but Hanna Shelest, an analyst from Odessa, says there is not enough capacity to replace maritime shipments. Anyway, she adds, these alternatives are “several times more expensive in terms of logistics, and slower”. Exports by land have also caused grain prices to slump in neighbouring countries, infuriating farmers in otherwise friendly places such as Poland.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Before the war agriculture accounted for more than 10% of Ukraine&#39;s <small>gdp</small> and nearly 15% of employment. Many farms are still operating. The wheat harvest is under way. Sunflowers will follow in early autumn and maize a few weeks later. Russian bombardment has destroyed much of Ukraine&#39;s storage capacity, so the need to find a new outlet for Ukraine&#39;s exports is pressing. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 10:27:56 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/lv5o9l26mqa351i6ura85ovr11ud41us</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/07/27/russia-is-attacking-ukraines-agricultural-exports </item><item><title><![CDATA[Is Ukraine’s offensive stalling?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1m2w0l00"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">Ukraine war</a></i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>U</span> <small>KRAINE&#39;S COUNTER-OFFENSIVE</small> will soon enter its eighth week. It has already liberated more territory than Russia captured during a months-long winter offensive, which took the eastern town of Bakhmut and little else. The majority of Ukraine&#39;s Western-equipped brigades remain intact and uncommitted. But progress has been slower and harder than expected, dashing hopes of an early breakthrough. The offensive has devolved into a protracted battle of attrition, which seems likely to stretch into the autumn.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine launched its first big attacks in the south on June 4th around Orikhiv in <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/16/zaporizhia-braces-itself-for-russian-nuclear-tricks">Zaporizhia province</a> and around Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk province, along with a separate push around Bakhmut (see map). Ukraine&#39;s allies had spent months conducting wargames and simulations to predict how an assault might unfold. They were cautiously optimistic. They thought there was an outside chance of an early breakthrough, resulting in rapid progress of the sort that Ukraine had achieved in Kharkiv province last year. But such an outcome depended both on Ukraine executing its mission flawlessly and on Russia crumbling. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In fact neither of those things has happened. Ukraine ran into trouble right away. Its new Western-equipped brigades became bogged down, sometimes in <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/09/sappers-risk-their-lives-to-win-ukraine-back-inch-by-inch">minefields</a> , and were targeted by Russian artillery, anti-tank missiles, attack helicopters and loitering munitions. Ukraine responded by changing tactics. It is now holding back armour and sending in smaller units of dismounted infantry, often no more than 20 soldiers, to proceed slowly and haltingly. The result is a grinding slog.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “The various wargames that were done ahead of time have predicted certain levels of advance,” conceded General Mark Milley, America&#39;s top officer, on July 18th. “And that has slowed down.” Ukraine says it has liberated 12 square kilometres of territory in the south in the week leading to July 24th, and 227 square kilometres in total since the start of the offensive. That is around 0.3% of the territory gained by Russia since the invasion last year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In part, the slow progress reflects the scale of Ukraine&#39;s task. Russian defences are 30km deep in places, bristling with earthworks and tank traps and spattered with mines. Most <small>NATO</small> armies would struggle to punch through comparable lines without complete dominance in the air, which Ukraine, unfortunately, does not enjoy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another problem is that Russia has mounted a <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/07/03/how-ukraines-enemy-is-also-learning-lessons-albeit-slowly">stronger defence</a> than expected, conducting mobile and rapid counter-attacks in response to Ukrainian advances, rather than remaining confined to trenches and fixed positions. Rob Lee, an expert on Russia&#39;s armed forces who recently visited the front lines, notes that Russia&#39;s army has not just executed its doctrine competently, but also innovated, for instance by stacking multiple anti-tank mines on top of one another to destroy mine-clearing vehicles.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine&#39;s inability to breach Russian lines is partly to do with equipment—it needs de-mining kit, air-defence systems and anti-tank missiles capable of blunting Russian counter-attacks from a greater distance. Air power would help a lot, but Western jets, although promised, are not arriving soon. Anyway, the handful that are expected would not themselves give Ukraine control of the skies.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine could, however, make better use of the equipment it does have. Mr Lee describes an occasion when a Ukrainian brigade&#39;s advance was delayed by a couple of hours, until dawn. That not only negated Ukraine&#39;s advantage in night-vision systems, but also meant that the accompanying artillery barrage lifted hours earlier than it should have done. Russian infantry and anti-tank squads, who should have been suppressed by well-timed shellfire, were free to attack. Many such assaults have been stopped even before they reach the main minefields.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This lack of proficiency in co-ordinating complex attacks involving multiple units using different sorts of weapons is hardly surprising. Ukraine&#39;s new brigades were put together in a hurry with unfamiliar equipment. Newly mobilised men were given a month of training in Germany. They have struggled with tasks like reconnaissance, says Mr Lee, with new units becoming disoriented at night time. Co-ordination has also been a problem, with confusion around where friendly units have placed mines. More experienced brigades would have planned for such eventualities, he suggests. It is impossible to tell how Ukrainian forces might have fared had their Western partners equipped and trained them better last summer, rather than waiting until January, or if Ukraine had launched the offensive in the spring, as many of its allies were urging.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine&#39;s partners are not panicking yet. “It is far from a failure, in my view,” said General Milley, when asked whether the offensive had stalled. “I think that it&#39;s way too early to make that kind of call.” Ukraine&#39;s progress was “not catastrophically behind schedule”, said Ben Wallace, Britain&#39;s defence minister, on July 11th. In some places Ukraine&#39;s army was less than 300 metres away from Russia&#39;s main line of defence, he added, with Russian-held towns increasingly coming within range of Ukrainian <small>HIMARS</small> rocket launchers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Optimists point to three factors in Ukraine&#39;s favour. One is that it need not fear a serious Russian counter-attack, despite minor Russian gains in northern Luhansk province in recent days. “There appears now to be little prospect of the Russian forces regaining momentum,” said Richard Moore, the chief of <small>MI6</small> , Britain&#39;s foreign-intelligence service, in a speech on July 19th. That may be one reason why Russia has torn up a <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/18/why-the-death-of-ukraines-grain-deal-is-not-moving-wheat-markets">grain deal</a> and resumed strikes on Ukraine&#39;s ports and grain stores.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Second, Russia&#39;s decision to defend forward, rather than falling back to prepared defences, has slowed down Ukraine&#39;s progress but also left Russia with little mobile reserve in the rear, a point underscored by Yevgeny Prigozhin&#39;s unhindered march to Moscow in June. “Russian reserves are running out,” noted Colonel Margo Grosberg, Estonia&#39;s military-intelligence chief, earlier this month, “as units cannot be rotated from the front.” If Ukraine were to break through into open country—perhaps by more circuitous routes, rather than a frontal attack in Zaporizhia—it could push ahead quickly, say some officials, though they privately acknowledge that Ukraine&#39;s chances of reaching the Sea of Azov are dimming.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The third factor is that Ukraine is chipping away at the basis of Russia&#39;s combat power. On July 11th a Ukrainian strike reportedly killed Oleg Tsokov, a Russian general, in the port city of Berdyansk, suggesting that Ukraine was successfully targeting command posts. In recent days Ukraine has also used British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles to strike air bases and ammunition depots, including in Crimea. One such strike is thought to have destroyed 2,500 tonnes of ammunition, said Mr Wallace. At the same time, Ukraine is increasingly hitting Moscow with drone strikes—the latest occurred on July 24th—with the intention of puncturing the Kremlin&#39;s authority and fanning opposition to the war.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is hard to tell what effect this campaign is having. Franz-Stefan Gady, an expert who visited the front lines with Mr Lee, is sceptical that Ukraine&#39;s attacks are truly dismantling Russia&#39;s command and control or starving it of munitions. In the south, he notes, Ukraine has an advantage in tube artillery (such as howitzers) but Russia is firing plenty of rockets. It also appears to have good intelligence coverage of the battlefield. But with the failure of Ukraine&#39;s initial attempts at breakthrough, the war has become dominated by attrition. Such wars are measured not in kilometres won or lost, but less visible factors such as relative rates of loss and the coherence of each army.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “The war is tactically balanced,” says a Western official closely involved in shaping strategy. Ukraine&#39;s army is highly motivated, he says, and, thanks to America&#39;s decision to provide cluster munitions, well-equipped to keep up the offensive for longer than was originally thought—certainly beyond the summer. Russia&#39;s army has been comfortable on the defence, he says, and will use the time to build new fortifications, but remains brittle. “They are certainly bleeding,” he says. “It could disintegrate.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some American and European military officials argue that Ukrainian commanders have been overly cautious in striking with their new brigades, a mistake that they think Ukraine committed last year in Kherson, when tens of thousands of Russian troops withdrew east over the Dnieper river with their equipment. Ukrainian commanders chafe at the idea that they should gamble their army in circumstances that <small>NATO</small> generals have never faced.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In that sense, the changing character of the offensive—from high-tempo assaults to a more patient approach—reflects both military reality and a deeper shift in identity. A fluid war of manoeuvre was always going to be a stretch for a force cobbled together in a few months. The Russian verb <i>peremalyvat</i> —to grind through—is invoked on both sides. But Ukraine&#39;s junior commanders, having watched their units gutted over the past 18 months, also refuse to send their new citizen army into a meat-grinder in the way that Russia did in Bakhmut. As Ukraine has become more European, suggested Mr Wallace, it has acquired “a Western European caution”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The upside of this aversion to casualties is that many Ukrainian units are in better shape than planners assumed. Brigades that assaulted Russian positions were expected to be left with only a third of their original strength. Thanks in part to well-armoured Western vehicles, they have taken a far lighter knock. If it is to avoid the costly frontal assaults of early June, Ukraine now has little choice but to wear down Russia&#39;s army as best it can using its advantages in long-range precision weapons, aided by copious Western intelligence. “This is going to be long, it&#39;s going to be hard, it&#39;s going to be bloody,” concluded General Milley. “And at the end of the day, we&#39;ll see where the Ukrainians end up.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 18:48:44 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/u63vccf764smnho3it51k4t7bllthmem</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/07/25/is-ukraines-offensive-stalling </item><item><title><![CDATA[What if China and India became friends?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/054%20International%20-%20China-India%20relations-5982909a6343af8347828fdf3bfe70b6.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>C</span> <small>hina&#39;s rulers</small> like to look down on India. They scorn its turbulent politics, its creaky infrastructure and its poverty. <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/04/26/why-indias-population-is-about-to-overtake-chinas">India</a> has looked across with a combination of fear and envy, hoping in vain to be treated <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/06/15/indias-foreign-minister-on-ties-with-america-china-and-russia">as an equal</a> . Now the tectonics of the trans-Himalayan relationship are shifting. Recent border bloodshed suggests mounting hostility. But blossoming economic ties tell a different story that could trouble America and its allies.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> When India&#39;s most revered poet toured China in April 1924, Chinese intellectuals were unimpressed. Rabindranath Tagore had been feted globally as the first non-European Nobel literature laureate. A fierce critic of British rule in India, he hoped to rebuild an ancient cultural bond between Asia&#39;s oldest civilisations.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For leading Chinese thinkers, however, his call for a revival of Eastern values and spirituality rang hollow. The Chinese, they argued, could only resist the West by learning from it—and rejecting their own traditional culture. China&#39;s youth should not become “Indianised”, wrote Chen Duxiu, a co-founder of the Chinese Communist Party. “Unless, that is, they want their coffins to lie one day in a land under the heel of a colonial power.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Almost a century later, a sense of disdain still infuses perceptions of India among Chinese officials and scholars. Just look at the data, they say. At its independence in 1947, India&#39;s <small>GDP</small> per head was higher than China&#39;s (on a purchasing-power basis). But by the early 1990s, China had moved ahead on that and many other measures. By 2022, their populations were roughly equal but China&#39;s economy was more than three times bigger.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China&#39;s generals tend to dismiss India, too. China&#39;s crushing victory in a border war in 1962 is recalled with pride. And they contrast China&#39;s current arsenal of home-grown modern weaponry with India&#39;s continuing reliance on Russian imports. “There&#39;s no way that India can catch up with China in the next 20-30 years,” says Senior Colonel Zhao Xiaozhuo of China&#39;s Academy of Military Science.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet the fundamentals of the China-India relationship—military and economic—are now changing in ways that are forcing the world&#39;s biggest democracy and its largest autocracy to reassess how they deal with each other, and with the rest of the world. The hope among American and allied officials is that India&#39;s continuing frontier friction with China is pushing it irreversibly into a democratic coalition determined to constrain Chinese power. The question is: what if they find a way to shelve the border dispute? </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Consider the military equation first. India has been drawing closer to America since they signed a civil nuclear co-operation pact in 2008. But their alignment has accelerated since a series of clashes on the Indian frontier with China, including one in 2020 that killed 20 Indian troops and at least four Chinese ones. That was the bloodiest skirmish there since 1967 and brought to an end a three-decade period of relative stability on the border.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> India&#39;s armed forces have since undergone a historic shift of focus away from Pakistan. They have transferred about 70,000 troops as well as fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles to the frontier with China. They have also expanded joint exercises with America and its allies, especially Australia and Japan. America has provided some intelligence and high-altitude training for Indian border forces too.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The war in Ukraine has provided another spur. Indian commanders fret about their dependence on Russian arms. India wants to buy advanced American weaponry and to make more in India. In Washington in June the prime minister, Narendra Modi, made progress, with deals to buy armed aerial drones and to jointly manufacture fighter-jet engines in India.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China&#39;s exact motivations on the border are murky. It may have been responding to recent Indian road-building, which enabled more extensive patrolling, or to frustration at a lack of progress in negotiations on a settlement. Or it may have wanted to penalise India for its earlier rapprochement with America, to expose the relative weakness of Indian forces and to show that they cannot rely on American help.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China sees itself as in another league from India, competing directly with America, says Deependra Singh Hooda, a former chief of the Indian Army&#39;s Northern Command, which oversees part of the Chinese border. China&#39;s message appears to be: “You&#39;re no match for the <small>PLA</small> (People&#39;s Liberation Army)…You&#39;re just a sideshow.”</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> A two-sided triangle</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For whatever reason, Xi Jinping, China&#39;s leader, seems to think the fallout manageable. India&#39;s redeployments mean it can impose greater costs on China if it tries another border incursion. But China will for years keep enough military superiority to deter India from trying to recoup any perceived losses (see chart 1). And though India can help America in some areas, notably the Indian Ocean, it balks at a formal alliance and is unlikely to join a conflict over Taiwan or the South China Sea. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nonetheless, Mr Xi has strong incentives to stabilise the border, as America steps up efforts to circumscribe Chinese power. So does Mr Modi. He seems keen to play down the frontier issue, knowing he has few military options. He is wary of drawing domestic attention to any perceived loss of territory. And compromise seems possible. After 18 rounds of talks between military commanders, troops have pulled back from five flashpoints, establishing “buffer zones” where neither side patrols. Two major flashpoints remain.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China is pushing for another round of talks and urging India not to let the border issue define the bilateral relationship. India&#39;s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, met his Chinese counterpart in Jakarta on July 14th and discussed the frontier. In recent weeks he has stressed that without a peaceful and stable border, normal business ties cannot be resumed. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A survey of the economic landscape, however, puts such Indian warnings in perspective. Commerce between China and India was negligible for most of their modern history. But by 2020 trade in goods had surged to $88bn, with China enjoying a surplus of $46bn and ranking as India&#39;s biggest trade partner (see chart 2). China had also become a big source of investment, notably in technology, property and infrastructure. Chinese brands are popular, too. Oppo and Xiaomi are among the bestselling mobile phones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The border skirmish in 2020 put that all at risk. India banned some 320 Chinese apps, launched tax raids on several Chinese companies and introduced new rules requiring the Indian government&#39;s approval for Chinese investments. Indian officials say they since have rejected 157 relevant applications. And yet bilateral goods trade grew by 43% in 2021 and 8.6% last year. Chinese investment is finding ways in too, sometimes via Singapore. Shein, a Chinese online fashion company whose app was among those banned by India in 2020, is relaunching there soon in partnership with Reliance Industries, India&#39;s biggest private company.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Indian officials want to rely less on Chinese imports and to woo more investment from elsewhere, notably big multinational manufacturers looking for an alternative to China. “We need to stop looking for a China fix,” Mr Jaishankar, the Indian foreign minister, said in May. “Indian growth cannot be built on Chinese efficiency.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Privately, though, many of India&#39;s business leaders predict that it will depend on Chinese imports for years to come if the Indian government is to achieve its goals in developing infrastructure and manufacturing. India&#39;s pharmaceutical industry, for instance, relies on China for roughly 70% of its active ingredients.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That does, in theory, make India vulnerable to the kind of economic coercion that China has inflicted on others. But China&#39;s leverage may be waning as it faces an economic slowdown, a shrinking population and an increasingly hostile West. Chinese companies now see India, whose population overtook China&#39;s this year, as an important source of growth, with Goldman Sachs predicting that Indian <small>GDP</small> will be second only to China&#39;s by 2075.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There are economic synergies in other areas too. India is the biggest borrower from the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which China set up in 2016 as an alternative to Western-led lending institutions. India is also a member of the Shanghai-based New Development Bank, formed by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (the <small>BRICS</small> ) in 2015.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Hearty economic exchanges are no guarantee against further border bloodshed—or even war. Both countries are led by men who feed off nationalism and historical grievances. Other tensions include China&#39;s growing influence in South Asia, its damming upstream of rivers vital to India, and the sanctuary that India affords the Dalai Lama, Tibet&#39;s spiritual leader.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Still, the burgeoning business ties will weigh ever heavier in both sides&#39; decision-making. And stabilising the border issue, as was achieved for three decades after Rajiv Gandhi visited China as Indian prime minister in 1988, would leave ample room for co-operation. Both countries want a bigger role in global governance, reject Western criticism on human rights and climate change and share concerns about Islamic extremism. Both refuse to condemn Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Also noteworthy is that before the recent frontier flare-up, Mr Modi seemed determined to build a close relationship with Mr Xi, taking the unusual step of hosting him in his home state of Gujarat in 2014. India and China shared similar aspirations, challenges and opportunities, Mr Modi said in Beijing the following year. “In the global uncertainties of our times, we can reinforce each other&#39;s progress.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such a prospect may not please Americans and others who see India as a counterweight to China. Nor is it what Tagore had in mind in 1924, when he urged China to reject Western materialism and “free the human soul from the dungeon of the machine”. But it may be the more realistic path towards a sustainable, mutually beneficial relationship between Asia&#39;s titans. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 19 Jul 2023 17:59:05 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/kc44bjfhd4f8j99lm2b44phuarvuu6cp</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/07/19/what-if-china-and-india-became-friends </item><item><title><![CDATA[What would Europe do if Trump won?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/054%20International%20-%20_Strategic%20autonomy_-aa071be2f72a411a2075e7d032a0d7b5.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>D</span> <small>ONALD TRUMP’S</small> cant about the war in Ukraine drifts over the battlefields, dark as the pall of Russian bombs. “I want everybody to stop dying. They&#39;re dying. Russians and Ukrainians,” he declared in May. If re-elected president next year, he would end the war “in 24 hours”. How? He did not say, but his words imply halting military aid to Ukraine and letting Russia keep the gains of its invasion.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> If so, the return of a “Trump unbound”—more resentful, more organised and less constrained than in his first term—could be a calamity for Ukraine. It might be a disaster for Europe in other ways. He might well enact a threat, dating from his first term, to leave <small>NATO.</small> He would face stern opposition in Congress. But alliances rely on trust. And merely suggesting he would not fight for allies could complete the destruction of the European order that Russia is attempting.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Under President Joe Biden, America has provided the lion&#39;s share of <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/02/21/military-and-financial-support-to-ukraine-hits-a-record-high">military aid</a> to Ukraine and the leadership to muster the West&#39;s response. If the war shows the value of American protection, Trumpian populism may prove how fast it can be lost.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> European governments are thus in the grip of three fears: of attack by Russia, of economic evisceration by China and of abandonment by America. France offers a clear answer to all three: European “strategic autonomy”. Speaking in Bratislava in May, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, posed the unspeakable question: “Will [the American] administration always be the same? Nobody can tell, and we cannot delegate our collective security and our stability to the choices of American voters.” Europeans, he argued, needed to be able to defend themselves, not just militarily but also economically. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_IRC811.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_IRC811.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_IRC811.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_IRC811.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_IRC811.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_IRC811.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_IRC811.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_IRC811.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_IRC811.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_IRC811.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_IRC811.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_IRC811.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_IRC811.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_IRC811.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_IRC811.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_IRC811.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_IRC811.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Critics regard such calls as an attempt to sever Europe&#39;s bonds with America. But what if America cuts Europe loose? French officials think a transatlantic separation is already under way, as America turns inward and its foreign policy focuses on China. Mr Trump is merely the most brutal expression of the trend. On trade, they note, Mr Biden is scarcely less <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/01/12/the-destructive-new-logic-that-threatens-globalisation">protectionist than Mr Trump</a> . Amid a European outcry, he told Mr Macron he “didn&#39;t know” the vast green subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act would threaten Europe&#39;s industry.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America&#39;s priority, their argument goes, is its <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/03/30/americas-commercial-sanctions-on-china-could-get-much-worse">contest with China</a> . Sooner or later, even Mr Biden will want to do less in Europe to focus on Asia. It could be sooner if a crisis erupts over Taiwan. The difference between future Democratic or Republican presidents may be only the speed and extent to which America pivots away from Europe. Most European governments do not fully share this analysis—America&#39;s military commitment to Europe is rising—yet few discount it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Can Europe fend for itself if abandoned? In theory, yes. European <small>nato</small> allies are industrialised and count nearly 600m people. They have nearly 2m people under arms and decades of experience operating together. Two of them, Britain and France, have nuclear weapons and permanent seats on the <small>UN</small> Security Council.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Granted, <small>nato</small> is backed by America&#39;s might, which accounts for two-thirds of total <small>NATO</small> military spending. Only ten of America&#39;s 30 allies will meet the defence-spending target of 2% of <small>GDP</small> this year. Even this ought to be enough to fend off Russia. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, a think-tank, reckons European allies collectively spent $333bn in 2022. This compares with perhaps $86bn by Russia. Doubling or tripling this sum to account for its greater purchasing power still leaves a large gap. But Europe does not act collectively. Its spending is scattered among dozens of often underpowered armies, air forces and navies. Much of it goes to coddled national industries.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Fundamentally, Europeans suffer from “vassalisation”, argues a recent paper for the European Council on Foreign Relations ( <small>ECFR</small> ), a think-tank. Europeans do not agree on priorities. Nor do they trust each other enough to decide on what greater autonomy should entail. Europe&#39;s two most important institutions— <small>nato</small> and the <small>EU</small> —do not fully mesh. Important allies such as Britain, Norway and Turkey are outside the <small>eu</small> . Collective defence is <small>NATO</small> ’s business, directed by America. Economic policy is handled mainly by the <small>EU</small> , which was created as the antithesis of a military alliance. France, in particular, has sought to use it as a counterweight to America.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Going it alone?</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Were America to forsake Ukraine, despite promises by a <small>nato</small> summit on July 11th to support it “for as long as it takes”, would Europeans keep up the war effort? Some diplomats say they would; many doubt it. Europe&#39;s arsenals are smaller and more depleted than America&#39;s. Its defence industry suffers similar ills to America&#39;s—just-in-time production at peacetime levels—compounded by a lack of scale. Paradoxically, the war in Ukraine is making things worse, says Nathalie Tocci of Istituto Affari Internazionali, an Italian think-tank, as countries rush to buy off-the-shelf kit from America, Israel, South Korea and others.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> France shuns the German-led Sky Shield project to develop air defences because it relies on non-European suppliers. German officials retort that France treats strategic autonomy as a way to use German money to support French firms. Still, there is some progress. The <small>EU</small> is offering incentives for co-operative arms projects, is using common funds to pay for military materiel and is pushing firms to supply Ukraine with 1m artillery rounds in a year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Were Mr Trump to pull America out of <small>NATO</small> altogether, Europeans would try to take over its machinery rather than turn the <small>EU</small> into a military alliance, says Camille Grand of the <small>ECFR</small> , a former assistant secretary-general of <small>nato</small> . Europeans would have to plug gaps filled by America&#39;s 85,000-odd troops in Europe, among them headquarters staff and 22 combat battalions (roughly as many as Britain has in total). They would also have to procure the expensive “enablers”—such as air transport and refuelling, space assets and <a href="https://www.economist.com/military-terms-a-to-z#command-control-communications-computers-intelligence-surveillance-and-reconnaissance"><small>ISR</small></a> (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance)—that America supplies in abundance. All this might take Europe a decade to build up, believes Mr Grand.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Leadership would be a problem. Multinational decision-making is difficult at the best of times, all the more so on military matters. The Europeans lack a leader to replace the American hegemon. Germany is steeped in pacifism despite its promise to boost its forces. Britain is semi-detached from European affairs, owing to Brexit. France aspires to lead a stronger Europe but is widely distrusted.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Then there is nuclear deterrence. Russia has nearly 6,000 nuclear warheads; Britain and France about 200-300 each. Mr Grand reckons that, without America, European nuclear powers will have to rethink their stockpiles, doctrine and collaboration with remaining allies.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As for the economic dimension of autonomy, the <small>eu</small> has made marked progress. In Brussels it is sometimes called “open strategic autonomy”, to signal openness to the world. Europeans are gradually pooling more economic policymaking within the <small>eu</small> . And they have good reason to do so, after a succession of shocks, from the shortage of vaccines during the pandemic to Russia&#39;s invasion.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The most striking success has been Europe&#39;s shift away from Russia&#39;s oil and gas. The transition has been helped by alternative supplies from America and elsewhere, and the <small>EU</small> ’s internal market for energy, which allows gas and electricity to be traded across borders. Much of the <small>EU</small> ’s new economic arsenal is directed at China. A forthcoming “anti-coercion” instrument allows trade retaliation to prevent a repeat of <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/01/22/what-chinas-bullying-of-lithuania-reveals-about-europe">China&#39;s bullying of Lithuania</a> after it tilted towards Taiwan. New rules tighten the screening of investments by foreigners. National and <small>EU</small> subsidies, like America&#39;s, seek to boost semiconductor production and green energy. Europeans are working with America to diversify supplies of critical minerals and restrict outbound investment in sensitive technology.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For Mr Macron such moves are the “building blocks” of strategic autonomy. “Today the ideological battle is won,” he believes. Yet two models vie for the soul of Europe, and of Mr Macron himself. The good version holds that Europe should fortify itself to become more capable of defending common values and interests with America. The bad one, which is in the French Gaullist tradition, seeks to pull Europe away from America and create a rival geopolitical pole.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In Bratislava Mr Macron&#39;s better angels prevailed as he argued for Europe to take up more of the defence burden. Making a <small>U</small> -turn, he backed Ukraine&#39;s membership of <small>NATO</small> and the <small>EU</small> ’s eastward enlargement. Yet a month earlier, after visiting Beijing, he displayed a worse nature. Europe, he said, must not become tangled in Sino-American rivalry and a crisis over Taiwan “that is not ours”. Mr Macron has back-pedalled since, and sent a warship through the Taiwan Strait. He nevertheless outraged many European leaders by weakening an undeclared pact: in return for America&#39;s help to repel Russia, Europe should support its ally to deter China.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The election of Mr Trump would be a “catastrophe foretold”, says Constanze Stelzenmüller of the Brookings Institution, an American think-tank. Few European leaders have a good answer to it. Many ignore it; others pray Mr Trump would prove less destructive than feared, perhaps restrained by Congress and the Pentagon. Some talk of wooing his more moderate acolytes. Sophia Besch of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, another think-tank, predicts many would scramble to “bilateralise” relations with him. They might resort to flattery, such as Poland&#39;s short-lived plan to rename a base “Fort Trump”, or buy more American weapons and other things to offer him a “good deal”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One question is the extent to which the election of Mr Trump might boost mini-Trumps on Europe&#39;s hard right. Opinion polls show that Alternative for Germany is level-pegging with the Social Democratic Party of Germany&#39;s chancellor, Olaf Scholz. In France, meanwhile, there are growing worries that Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Rally, could become president in 2027. Both parties are close to Russia and criticise Western support for Ukraine. Just as Mr Biden proved that American power can unite Europeans, Mr Trump might yet display its power to divide them.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>NATO</small> ’s purpose, it is often said, is “to keep the Soviet Union out, the Americans in, and the Germans down”. Perhaps strategic autonomy can do something similar. If it generates more military capabilities, it will let Europe take greater charge of its security as America turns to Asia—and provide a hedge should the great ally turn hostile. Indeed, it may be the best way to rebuff Trumpian charges of freeloading, and demonstrate Europe&#39;s worth to America. Done right, it might just help to keep Russia out, the Americans in, China away—and <small>NATO</small> together. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Stay on top of American politics with <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance">Checks and Balance</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.

For 42 years the alliance prepared for conventional and nuclear war with the Soviet Union and its allies. In 1991 the Warsaw Pact fell apart and the plans fell into abeyance. Now Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine highlights the need for new strategies.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> On July 11th and 12th leaders will gather in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, for <small>NATO</small> ’s annual summit. They are expected to approve the alliance&#39;s first comprehensive defence plans since the cold war. “It&#39;s the most dramatic change…since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” says Matthew Van Wagenen, an American general in the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe ( <small>SHAPE</small> ). The question is whether the allies can live up to their ambition.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is much to discuss in Vilnius. Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of <small>NATO</small> , has just had his <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/06/21/ben-wallace-says-he-is-out-of-the-race-for-natos-top-job">term extended</a> for another year (the allies could not agree on a candidate to replace him). Ukraine wants an invitation to <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2023/06/21/nato-is-agonising-over-whether-to-let-ukraine-join">join the alliance</a> after the war; in the meantime it expects detailed and substantial guarantees of long-term aid. A sticking-point will be Turkey&#39;s continued veto of Sweden&#39;s <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/05/12/what-does-it-take-to-join-nato">accession to <small>NATO</small></a> . Another will be the alliance&#39;s relationship with Asia. The allies agree that China is having an ever-larger impact on European security—not least through its <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/chinas-friendship-with-russia-has-boundaries-despite-what-their-leaders-say/21808197">deepening relationship with Russia</a> —but a row over whether to open a <small>NATO</small> office in Tokyo reveals splits over how to respond.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Despite all this, it is the planned overhaul of <small>NATO</small> ’s military machinery that is the most consequential item on the agenda. The architect of the defence reforms is Chris Cavoli, an American general who serves as Supreme Allied Commander Europe ( <small>SACEUR</small> ). His job was first held by Dwight Eisenhower—whose globe still sits in General Cavoli&#39;s office in the Belgian city of Mons. General Cavoli, a Russian speaker educated at Princeton and Yale, is widely considered to be one of the most impressive officers of his generation. His plans run to 4,000 (classified) pages.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The centrepiece is a trio of regional plans: one for the north, covering the Atlantic and <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/04/how-war-in-ukraine-is-changing-the-arctic">European Arctic</a> ; one for the centre, which addresses the Baltic and central Europe down to the Alps; and a southern plan for the Mediterranean and Black Sea. There are sub-plans for space, cyber operations and special forces. Russia, unsurprisingly, is the focus, but not exclusively so: the southern plan, on Turkey&#39;s insistence, splits its attention evenly between the threat from Russia and from terrorist groups.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The first and most important purpose of the documents is deterrence. “The key for <small>NATO</small> war plans has always been that Moscow knows there are <small>NATO</small> war plans,” says Tim Sayle, a historian of the alliance at the University of Toronto.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That said, the plans also provide clear guidance for every armed force in Europe and North America about how to act should conflict erupt. “As a young sub-lieutenant, I knew precisely where my artillery battery was going to go—which town,” says General Darryl Williams, commander of the <small>US</small> Army in Europe, reflecting on his deployment to West Germany in 1983. “We look forward to a time here, very quickly, where we&#39;ll be able to get that kind of clarity again.” Later this year, General Cavoli will allocate specific countries to specific roles or parts of the front. Battalions and brigades can get to know their patch in advance, whether that is a Norwegian island or a stretch of the Carpathians.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Mission accepted</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Knowing one&#39;s task is not the same as being able to carry it out, of course. Another hope is that the plans will prompt reform and increase accountability. During the cold war <small>SHAPE</small> had a large staff that could continually test how ready national forces were for combat. This team dwindled but is growing once more: “ <small>SACEUR</small> has now got a big stick to beat nations with,” says a European official. At last year&#39;s <small>NATO</small> summit in Madrid the allies agreed they would collectively keep over 100,000 troops ready to deploy in less than ten days, and another 200,000 on a month&#39;s readiness—a far larger number of high-readiness troops than before. Just as important is that allies will now “declare” to General Cavoli which units are available at any time.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In recent weeks America, Germany and Britain have all practised how they could quickly scale up their battalion-sized deployments in Poland, Lithuania and Estonia into brigade-sized formations. Italy will probably soon run a similar test in Bulgaria. The aim of this is to assure the Baltic states, and to demonstrate to Russia, that these armies are agile enough to reinforce <small>NATO</small> ’s eastern front more quickly than Russia can mobilise for an attack. This month Germany, whose armed forces have been in poor shape over the past decade, <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/06/15/germanys-new-national-security-strategy-is-strong-on-goals-less-so-on-means">went further</a> . It promised that it would eventually station a whole brigade on Lithuanian soil—an unprecedented commitment. <small>NATO</small> exercises are also becoming more demanding: they are “more or less rehearsals”, says one official. The largest in decades, Steadfast Jupiter, should take place later this year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>NATO</small> ’s new plans will not only keep armies on their toes, but also set priorities for procurement and investment. Collective defence of the continent requires heavy weaponry: jets, tanks and artillery. But for years following the attacks on September 11th, 2001 the allies were fighting guerrilla wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that demanded somewhat different kinds of kit: mine-resistant vehicles, transport helicopters and light infantry. <small>NATO</small> did not impose any discipline on what its members purchased: “We have had no requirements on the nations that have really been enforced over the last 30 years,” says General Van Wagenen. The aim is now to bring demand and supply into line again through a mechanism known as the “force structure requirement”—essentially, General Cavoli&#39;s list of what is needed if his military strategy is to work as it is intended to do.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A <small>NATO</small> bigwig points to five immediate priorities: combat-capable ground forces, particularly heavy armoured brigades; integrated air- and missile-defence systems capable of protecting units on the move; long-range firepower such as artillery and rocket launchers; digital networks that allow data to move around the battlefield and back to headquarters quickly and securely; and logistics to shunt large armies across Europe while keeping them adequately supplied.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This list largely reflects needs that have been identified while observing the war in Ukraine: old-fashioned artillery has inflicted the majority of casualties; manoeuvring without armour has proven extremely costly. The problem is that the majority of European armies fare woefully on most of these measures (notwithstanding pockets of excellence, such as Finland&#39;s artillery-rich army of conscripts).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A paper published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies ( <small>IISS</small> ), a think-tank in London, concludes that the number of combat battalions in some of <small>NATO</small> ’s largest armies barely changed between 2015 and 2023, despite the growing threat from Russia. France and Germany have each added one battalion&#39;s worth of forces, a piddling amount, and even Poland has added only two. Britain has lost five over that period. “Most…nations now can only field one full-strength brigade,” laments a senior <small>NATO</small> general—a number that would dismay any cold-war general transplanted to the present. The same is true of naval forces. Commodore Carsten Fjord-Larsen of the Danish navy laments that in 2002 his navy fielded 34 combat units. The figure is now down to five.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ammunition holdings are a serious problem. Britain “has probably not got a sufficient stockpile for a heavy armoured brigade to fight an intense war”, says Ben Barry, a retired brigadier now at the <small>IISS</small> and a co-author of the report. In private, British generals agree. Ukraine&#39;s offensive compounds the problem: every ten days that country is chewing through as many shells as America produces in a month. Countries are having to choose between keeping Ukraine solvent and maintaining their own reserves.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The right kit</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There are also other holes. <small>NATO</small> has around ten corps headquarters but most are lacking in artillery, air-defence and helicopter brigades to support the divisions under their command, says Mr Barry. “The corps commander hasn&#39;t got any troops he can use to shape the <a href="https://www.economist.com/military-terms-a-to-z#corps">deep battle</a> .”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such calculations highlight Europe&#39;s dependency on America. The Pentagon puts others to shame by positioning 22 battalion-equivalents in Europe, mostly under V Corps in Poland. That is up from six in 2015; it is roughly the same number that Britain has in total. Will it last? “The inconvenient truth for Europe is that what&#39;s currently in V Corps reflects a lot of reinforcement that took place last year,” says Mr Barry. “But the overall direction of travel of <small>US</small> deployments is away from Europe towards the Indo-Pacific.” If a crisis were to <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/03/09/america-and-china-are-preparing-for-a-war-over-taiwan">erupt in Taiwan</a> , Europe could find itself rather worryingly exposed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> And yet the new plans also draw America and Europe closer in important ways. “Not many people really get this,” says the <small>NATO</small> bigwig, “but America is coming back into the <small>NATO</small> planning system in a big way.” For the past 20 years, he says, the United States European Command ( <small>EUCOM</small> ) in Stuttgart in Germany—America&#39;s military command for the continent—largely kept to itself, scribbling defence plans at a time when European armed forces were doing little detailed planning of their own. <small>NATO</small> ’s new plans are aligned with American thinking. In many ways they are products of it (General Cavoli is commander of both <small>EUCOM</small> and <small>NATO</small> ). That suggests America is plugging back in—despite political jitters over the possible re-election of Donald Trump next year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Broader reforms being carried out on <small>NATO</small> ’s command structure exemplify similar dynamics. <small>SHAPE</small> ’s very headquarters is being transformed, says General Van Wagenen: the second floor has been “gutted” to put in a new operations centre. A new land command to handle <small>NATO</small> operations north of the Alps could have been hosted by Poland or Germany, both of which were interested in the job; instead the <small>US</small> Army is taking on that task itself. The new command will be in General Williams&#39; headquarters in Wiesbaden. Paradoxically, given fears of American abandonment, some Europeans fret that American generals are taking over. “Yes,” retorts the bigwig, “they&#39;re taking the lead because they intend to fight here: that&#39;s quite good news if you&#39;re European.”</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Of maps and machinery</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The new reforms are profoundly shaped by the way the alliance&#39;s membership has changed over the past 30 years. In 1989, before the fall of the Berlin Wall, <small>NATO</small> ’s border with the Warsaw Pact was essentially the inner-German border—1,380km in length, almost all of it heavily militarised—plus a small area in northern Norway. By 2004, when the Baltic states joined <small>NATO</small> , its border with Russia was only 800km long. But when Finland joined on April 4th this year, that more than doubled at a stroke (see map). General Cavoli&#39;s canvas stretches from the freezing cold of the Arctic to the baking heat of Anatolia. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM952.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM952.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM952.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM952.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM952.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM952.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM952.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM952.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM952.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM952.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM952.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM952.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM952.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM952.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM952.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM952.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_EPM952.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In 1989 “everybody had fixed positions”, says General Van Wagenen. Armies were larger, on both sides, and troops were packed densely along the front lines. Now smaller armies are stretched across a far larger front. “You have to have more agile forces,” says the general. “A new alert system aims to sharpen <small>NATO</small> ’s intelligence machinery, so that elements of its new plans can be activated swiftly in response to early signs of trouble, such as Russian troop movements.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Finland&#39;s accession brings new opportunities, too. Its highly professional and well-equipped army, which can mobilise huge numbers of conscripts quickly, is likely to drive up standards in the alliance, says one official. Its membership “tidies up that Nordic and Baltic geography very nicely,” says another, with Russia&#39;s route out of the Gulf of Finland and into the Baltic Sea increasingly constrained by <small>NATO</small> states (more so if Sweden joins, too). “It poses far more challenges to Russia than to <small>NATO</small> ,” adds the official. In March American reconnaissance aircraft began flying over Finland, something that would have been outlandish 18 months ago. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_IRC710.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_IRC710.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_IRC710.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_IRC710.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_IRC710.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_IRC710.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_IRC710.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_IRC710.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_IRC710.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_IRC710.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_IRC710.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_IRC710.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_IRC710.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_IRC710.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_IRC710.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_IRC710.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230708_IRC710.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> If <small>NATO</small> has an ambitious agenda, the biggest question is how to afford it. “We are champions in announcing things,” says a German <small>NATO</small> commander, “not in implementing.” At a summit in Wales in 2014, following Russia&#39;s first invasion of Ukraine, allies promised to “move towards” the <small>NATO</small> target of spending 2% of <small>GDP</small> by 2024. Only three allies met the target then. Now seven do (see chart). Germany will get there next year, France in 2025. But most lag far behind. In Vilnius the allies are expected to set a new defence-investment pledge. The 2% target may become a floor, rather than a target. Eastern allies—such as Poland, which may spend a whopping 4% of its <small>GDP</small> on defence this year, and Estonia, which says it will get to 3%—are keen on this. But raising the target would only highlight the chasm that already exists between hopes and reality.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ben Wallace, Britain&#39;s defence secretary, says that some countries “really don&#39;t want to do 2%”—Canada is the largest example—and that others will peak at 2% without being able to sustain it. “There is some backsliding going on,” he warns. “In real terms we [Europe] invest less in defence now than we did in 2021,” complains Kusti Salm, the top civil servant in Estonia&#39;s defence ministry. <small>NATO</small> ’s new plans will give national army chiefs and defence ministers more leverage with finance ministers: failure to meet the spending target will no longer be just a source of embarrassment at each annual summit, liable to provoke a gentle dressing-down from Mr Stoltenberg, but may also leave a tangible hole in the continent&#39;s war plans. “It changes the entire discussion around defence spending,” says Mr Sayle, “or at least it did in the cold war.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One catch is that Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine, while catalysing reforms, has also cast doubt on whether the threat it poses to <small>NATO</small> members is as great as was previously thought. Russia&#39;s armed forces have proved less capable than most experts and officials had expected. Its army has had perhaps 60,000 men killed, including many of the most professional men and officers. Huge amounts of equipment have been destroyed, including over 1,300 tanks. Some European generals reckon this takes the pressure off: they think it will take Russia a decade to reconstitute.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The bear and its wounds</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> General Cavoli frequently rebuts this idea. In April he told America&#39;s Congress that the Russian army, though “degenerated somewhat”, was larger than at the outset of war. Russia&#39;s air force was largely intact, he said, with over 1,000 fighters and bombers, as was the navy. Russia&#39;s submarine force remains a particular concern. This is not simply an American view. Russia is developing “frightening underwater capabilities”, warns a German naval officer, pointing to threats to undersea infrastructure such as pipelines and cables. “They are way ahead of <small>NATO</small> in this.” An Estonian field commander notes that, at every level of command, “Russian officers are gaining experience we don&#39;t have.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>NATO</small> ’s own assessments suggest that Russia could rebuild its forces in as little as three to seven years. That is less time than it will take to recapitalise and re-equip Europe&#39;s hollowed-out armed forces; to rebuild defence industries capable of meeting wartime demand for shells and weapons; and to revive cold-war military skills such as river crossings and division-level command. Eastern allies are not inclined to assume that Russia will dally. And Ukraine&#39;s future is far from assured; its counter-offensive has so far proceeded more slowly than planned. “This month in 2023”, says Mr Salm, “is the most decisive moment for our generation.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Stay on top of our defence and international security coverage with <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-war-room">The War Room</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 02 Jul 2023 17:28:07 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/st2rjm3qln4crfirlup1rt33thlvsoel</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/07/02/nato-is-drafting-new-plans-to-defend-europe</item></channel></rss>
