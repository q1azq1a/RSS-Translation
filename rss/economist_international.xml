class="article__body-text">印度出生的移民遍布世界各地（见图 2），其中 270 万人生活在<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/06/15/joe-biden-and-narendra-modi-are-drawing-their-countries-closer">美国</a>，超过 835,000 人生活在英国，720,000 人生活在加拿大，579,000 人生活在澳大利亚。年轻的印度人涌向中东，那里的低技能建筑和酒店业工作报酬更高。阿拉伯联合酋长国有 350 万印度移民，沙特阿拉伯有 250 万印度移民（<small>联合国</small>将印度公民视为印度出生人口的代表）。更多人居住在非洲以及亚洲和加勒比地区的其他地区。</p><p class="article__body-text">印度拥有成为主要人才出口国的基本要素：大量的年轻人和一流的高等教育。印度人精通英语，这是英国殖民统治的遗产，可能也有帮助。根据美国智库移民政策研究所 ( <small>mpi</small> ) 的数据，在美国五岁以上的印度移民中，只有 22% 的人说他们的英语水平有限，而中国移民的这一比例为 57%。</p></div><h2>事情本来的样子</h2><p class="article__body-text">自 1947 年印度独立以来，出现了几波向富裕国家的移民浪潮，使侨民的数量和实力不断增长。第一次是在第二次世界大战后的几年里，涉及主要来自古吉拉特邦和旁遮普邦的低技能工人。许多人去了面临严重劳动力短缺的英国。他们在艰苦的地方工作，例如纺织厂和其他工业机构。许多在殖民时期作为契约劳工举家迁往东非的印度人后来也去了西部。 1965 年，美国通过全面改革移民法，设法吸引了大量人才。禁止印度国民的配额被取消，有利于高技能移民的新规定开始实施。澳大利亚和加拿大随后也纷纷效仿，制定了一批类似的规定。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">随着印度侨民的发展，它也变得更加多样化。越来越多来自贫困和边缘化背景的印度人移居国外。在华盛顿智库卡内基国际和平基金会发布的 2020 年调查中，在认同某个种姓群体的印裔美国人中<small>，</small>有 17% 的人称自己属于低种姓群体。移民不再主要来自古吉拉特邦和旁遮普邦。南印度人正在成群结队地移民。美国驻南部城市海得拉巴的领事馆是美国在南亚最大的前哨基地。与此同时，在美国发展最快的语言是泰卢固语，几乎只在印度南部使用。</p><h2>移动中的大脑</h2><p class="article__body-text">随着印度人口在未来几十年不断扩大，其人民将继续移居海外以寻找有利可图的工作并逃离酷热。富裕国家的移民规则筛选出可以从事需要更多雇员的专业的毕业生，例如医学和信息技术。 2022 年，73% 的美国<small>H-1B</small>签证（发给计算机科学家等“专业职业”的技术工人）是由在印度出生的人获得的。 </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G5I_lOWb_Bk?enablejsapi=1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text">许多印度最优秀和最聪明的人似乎都在为移民做好准备。印度政府前经济顾问阿文德·苏布拉曼尼安 (Arvind Subramanian) 表示，用经济学术语来说，他们是“经过高度积极选择的移民”。考虑一下哈佛商学院的 Prithwiraj Choudhury、马萨诸塞大学阿默斯特分校的 Ina Ganguli 和布里斯托大学的 Patrick Gaule 即将发表在<i>《发展经济学杂志》</i>上的一篇论文的发现。它分析了 2010 年参加印度理工学院（该国精英工程学校）竞争激烈的入学考试的学生的成绩。八年后，研究人员发现 1000 名表现最好的学生中有 36% 移居国外，上升到62% 在前 100 名中。大多数去了美国。</p><p class="article__body-text">另一项研究调查了人工智能领域前 20% 的研究人员（定义为那些在 2019 年的竞争性会议上发表论文的人）。调查发现，8% 的人在印度完成了他们的第一个学位。但现在只有极少数研究人员在那里工作。</p><p class="article__body-text">根据<small>mpi 的珍妮·巴塔洛娃 (Jeanne Batalova) 的数据统计，在美国，近 80% 的学龄以上印度出生人口至少拥有本科学位。</small>只有 50% 的中国出生人口和 30% 的总人口可以这么说。澳大利亚的情况与此类似，几乎三分之二的学龄以上印度出生人口、一半的中国出生人口和总人口的三分之一拥有学士或更高学位。其他富裕国家不收集可比较的数据。但看看可用的数据，几乎所有地方似乎都存在相同的模式。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">三十多年前创造了“软实力”一词的哈佛大学教授约瑟夫·奈 (Joseph Nye) 指出，这种实力并不是仅仅因为侨民的存在而自动产生的。 “但是，如果侨民中有成功的人并为他们来自的国家树立了正面形象，那将有助于他们的祖国。”而且，正如他补充的那样，“印度有很多非常贫穷的人，但他们不是来美国的人。”根据咨询公司 Henley and Partners 的数据，去年从印度移民的百万富翁（约 7,500 人）比从中国和俄罗斯以外的任何地方移民的都多。</p><p class="article__body-text">事实上，即使在他们移居的国家，印度移民也相对富裕。印第安人是美国收入最高的移民群体，家庭年收入中位数接近 15 万美元。这是全国平均水平的两倍，远远高于中国移民，家庭收入中位数超过 95,000 美元。在澳大利亚，印度移民的家庭收入中位数接近每年 87,000 美元，而所有家庭的平均年收入约为 62,000 美元，中国出生的家庭收入约为 58,000 美元。</p><aside class="article__body-aside"><p class="article__body-text">阅读更多关于印度的包裹：</p><ul><li> <a

class="article__body-text">印度侨民的力量越来越多地出现在商界和政府的最高层。约翰霍普金斯大学的德维什·卡普尔 (Devesh Kapur) 和阿迪蒂·马赫什 (Aditi Mahesh) 汇总了拥有印度血统的高层职位的人数，包括那些出生在印度的人和那些他们的祖先都是印度人的人。他们确定了 25 名<small>标准普尔 500 强</small>公司的印度裔首席执行官，高于十年前的 11 名。鉴于这些公司的其他高级职位中有大量印度裔高管，这一数字几乎肯定会进一步上升。</p><h2>在顶部</h2><p class="article__body-text">直到最近，海外的印度人才开始获得如此有声望的职位。梅格纳德·德赛 (Meghnad Desai) 于 1960 年获得宾夕法尼亚大学 (University of Pennsylvania) 的奖学金，当时他是美国大学里为数不多的印度人之一。他指出，当时的侨民并不富有或有权势。 “我记得有人说：&#39;美国人永远不会让印度人担任最高职位&#39;，”他回忆道。</p><p class="article__body-text">在科技行业，计算机制造商 Sun Microsystems 的联合创始人 Vinod Khosla 解释说，在 20 世纪 80 年代的美国，印度企业家很难筹集到资金。 “你们是有着有趣口音和难以发音的名字的人，你必须通过更高的标准，”他说。现在 Adob​​e、Alphabet、谷歌的母公司、 <small>IBM</small>和微软都由印度裔人领导。包括哈佛商学院在内的五所领先商学院中的三所的院长也是如此。</p><p class="article__body-text">印度侨民也在政治和政策领域蓬勃发展。约翰霍普金斯大学的研究人员统计了英国下议院的 19 名印度裔人士，其中包括首相 Rishi Sunak。他们在澳大利亚议会中确定了六个，在美国国会中确定了五个。美国副总统卡马拉·哈里斯 (Kamala Harris) 由她的泰米尔印度裔母亲抚养长大。出生于印度西部浦那的 Ajay Banga 在管理万事达卡十多年后，上个月被选为世界银行的负责人。</p><p class="article__body-text">华人侨民是世界上唯一具有可比影响力的其他群体。 <i>《经济学人》</i>在 covid-19 大流行开始时进行的一项分析估计，在东南亚 3690 亿美元的亿万富翁财富总额中，超过四分之三由<i>华侨</i>控制，华侨是其他国家公民的华侨华人国家。</p><p class="article__body-text">在欧洲和整个北美，情况有所不同。管理<small>标准普尔 500 强</small>公司的华裔老板比印度裔老板少。这可能是因为许多最成功的企业类型选择留在中国，为中国基金工作并投资于快速增长的中国企业，例如智能手机制造商小米、互联网搜索巨头百度和字节跳动， TikTok 的母公司位于北京，TikTok 是一款充斥着视频的社交媒体应用。</p><h2>印度规则</h2><p class="article__body-text">此外，随着美国走向与中国的新冷战，西方人越来越将中国视为敌人。始于中国武汉市的 covid-19 大流行可能使情况变得更糟。最近的恐慌——1 月下旬中国间谍气球出现在美国上空，以及本月有关中国与古巴政府达成协议在岛上建立电子窃听站的报道——进一步强化了中国的形象作为敌对的对手。民意测验机构盖洛普最近对美国人的态度进行的一项调查显示，84%的受访者表示他们对中国的看法大多或非常不利。对于印度，只有 27% 的受访者表示他们持有同样的负面看法。</p><p class="article__body-text">这种对中国的不信任渗透到政策中。华为是一家中国电信设备制造商，过去曾被怀疑违反禁运并成为中国政府间谍活动的渠道，但已在美国被禁止。一些欧洲国家正在效仿。以国家安全为由对美国公司的外国投资进行严格审查公开针对硅谷的中国资金。被发现听命于中国的个人，包括一位前哈佛大学教授，都受到了惩罚。印度公司不会面临这种审查。 </p><figure><meta

class="article__body-text">相比之下，印度政府——至少在莫迪先生和他的印度民族主义者印度人民党 ( <small>BJP</small> ) 接任之前——充满了世界观至少部分受到西方教育影响的人。印度第一任总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁曾就读于剑桥大学。莫迪的前任曼莫汉·辛格 (Manmohan Singh) 曾就读于牛津大学和剑桥大学。当莫迪先生上任时，央行由前<small>国际货币基金组织</small>官员、芝加哥大学教授拉古拉姆·拉詹掌管。</p><p class="article__body-text">印度声称自己是一个沉浸在自由价值观中的民主国家，这有助于其侨民更容易融入西方。侨民反过来又将印度与西方联系在一起。一个惊人的例子出现在 2005 年，当时美国达成了一项协议，该协议实际上承认印度是一个核大国，尽管它拒绝签署《核不扩散条约》（以及巴基斯坦和以色列）。印度裔美国人的游说和筹款有助于推动该交易在国会获得通过。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB

名来自英国和美国的海外印度人飞往印度加入他的竞选活动。成群结队的其他人使用短信和社交媒体从远处<small>投票</small>。他们为竞选捐助了数额不详的资金。</p><p class="article__body-text">许多人感兴趣的是莫迪本人。当他在 5 月访问澳大利亚时，他此行的亮点是在一个拥有 21,000 个座位的体育场为摇滚明星举行的印度侨民集会。莫迪先生在演讲中称赞印度裔澳大利亚人是两国之间的“活桥梁”。在莫迪即将对美国进行国事访问期间，拉拢侨民很可能再次成为他的首要议程。他之前的印度裔美国人观众包括 2014 年在纽约麦迪逊广场花园举行的 18,000 人集会和 2019 年在休斯敦举行的 50,000 人“你好莫迪”集会。</p><p class="article__body-text"> 6 月 22 日，乔·拜登将远离人群，主持与莫迪的会谈。两人将讨论两国“对自由、开放、繁荣和安全的印太地区的承诺”，以及其他几个话题。 <a

href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/06/15/indias-foreign-minister-on-ties-with-america-china-and-russia">俄罗斯</a>入侵乌克兰，并囤积了廉价的俄罗斯石油和化肥。印度作为今年<small>G20</small>论坛的主席国，大声疾呼要促进发展中国家的利益。它也是<small>金砖国家</small>集团中的重要声音，该论坛包括巴西、俄罗斯、中国和南非以及印度。俱乐部正在考虑是否让沙特阿拉伯和伊朗加入。</p><h2>相互保证的吸引力</h2><p class="article__body-text">在国内，官员们大肆宣扬民族主义言论，取悦右翼印度教鲁莽分子。自由主义的自由受到了攻击。 3 月，反对党国大党领袖拉胡尔·甘地 (Rahul Gandhi) 在印度法院判定他犯有刑事诽谤罪后，因虚假诽谤指控被取消议会资格。与此同时，记者受到骚扰，他们的办公室遭到当局的搜查。</p><p class="article__body-text">哈佛大学的奈先生警告说，莫迪先生在印度推行的印度教民族主义沙文主义品牌危及该国的声誉。明年的选举可能会导致宗教紧张局势加剧，民主规范进一步受到侵蚀。 “印度喜欢吹嘘自己是世界上最大的民主国家，”奈先生说。 “如果达不到这一点，就会损害印度的软实力。”</p><p class="article__body-text">但海外印度人帮助限制了损失，并确保印度和西方都不会放弃对方。莫迪先生知道他承受不起失去他们的支持，而且强迫连字符的印度人选边站是不可能的。在中国及其朋友想要打破由其竞争对手设定的世界秩序之际，西方让印度站在一边至关重要。尽管它在倒退，但它仍然是无价的——就像它的移民一样。 <span

class="article__body-text">在许多富裕国家，传统的私立学校正在走下坡路。在<small>经合组织</small>（一个主要由富裕国家组成的俱乐部）的 30 多个成员中，从政府获得不到一半资助的学校儿童比例从 2000 年的约 8% 下降到 2018 年的约 5%。英国和英国的私立学校美国的情况要好一些，关于它们的辩论在这两个国家仍然特别具有政治色彩。</p><p class="article__body-text">最近的证据表明，对于大多数在英国接受私立学校教育的孩子和在美国就读于精英私立机构的孩子来说，昂贵教育的优势依然强大。美国的好处可能比英国大，至少对于坐在最豪华的私人教室里的学生来说是这样。那是因为他们的校友继续以在旧国家引起愤怒的速度进入最好的大学。这可能会让任何认为美国社会不像英国社会那样受阶级支配的人感到惊讶。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">英国的私立学校为大约 6.5% 的孩子提供服务，与 1960 年代的比例大致相同。 （曲棍球棒和大米布丁对各个年龄段的人都有吸引力。）在美国，大约 9% 的儿童受教育于此，这一比例在 covid-19 大流行期间已经稳定了十年。在美国，大约 75% 的私立学校学生就读于有宗教信仰的机构（其中很大一部分的学费与公立学校的每名学生资助金额相似或更低）。但那个国家也有一个特殊的学校子集，通常被称为“独立”学校，它们最接近于英国的收费学校。这些学校只教育了不到 2% 的美国年轻人。</p><p class="article__body-text">英国的成本是世界上最高的。那里的一个家庭预计每年要掏出超过 16,000 英镑（20,000 美元）让一个孩子上私立走读学校。这是他们在 1980 年代支付的费用的三倍；它大约是英国家庭收入中位数的一半，而曾经是五分之一。根据最新的良好政府数据，美国的费用平均较低，但在本世纪头十年也飙升了 60%。最傲慢的学校平均每年为走读生向家长收取 28,000 美元的费用。</p><p class="article__body-text">衡量这些支出带来的收益对于私立学校的批评者（他们指责豪华学校使精英永存）和为此付费的人来说都很重要。乍一看，回报是显而易见的：在富裕国家，接受私立教育的学生考试成绩更好，可以进入更好的大学，并最终找到薪水更高的工作。但其中一些成功源自课堂之外的优势，例如拥有富有、鼓舞人心或聪明的父母。要了解私立教育带来的推动力，需要将学生的命运与公立学校其他方面相似的同龄人进行比较。这种好的研究在英国最容易找到。</p><h2>把算盘拿出来</h2><p class="article__body-text">根据 2015 年的一项研究，到 25 岁时，受过私立教育的英国人的收入比来自类似家庭的其他工人高 17%。根据早期研究，到 42 岁时，薪酬溢价扩大到女性约 21% 和男性为 35%。这在一定程度上是因为受过私立学校教育的人更有可能进入金融等高收入行业。校友网络可能在这方面有所帮助，但同伴压力和父母的期望也可能发挥重要作用。</p><p class="article__body-text">收入更高的一个更大原因是私立学校的学生获得了更多更好的学历。伦敦大学学院的弗朗西斯·格林 (Francis Green) 认为，与来自类似家庭的在政府学校就读的孩子相比，他们的考试成绩“适度”提高。他们在私立学校学习的时间每多一年，这种优势就会累积。一项研究发现，他们在 18 岁时所享有的优势大致相当于从<small>AAB</small>成绩升至<small>AAA</small> （英格兰学术轨道上的离校生通常会参加三门国家标准化考试）。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">关键点在于，即使是适度的业绩增长也会对额外收益的规模产生重大影响。这是因为更好的成绩可能会确保学生进入一所更负盛名的大学，而不是他们本来会去的大学，或者根本无法进入大学。 2021 年，在英国开始攻读学位的私立教育学生中，有一半以上就读于 24 所“罗素集团”大学之一（该俱乐部包括大多数最好的大学）。这些学生更有可能在学校的最后几年学习那些非常有选择性的大学最希望在申请中看到的艰难的传统科目。他们也更有可能获得额外帮助，以便在面试和入学考试中取得优异成绩。</p><p class="article__body-text">私立学校的学生不再像以前那样在顶尖大学名额中获得如此不公平的份额。他们约占英格兰所有 16-19 岁学生的 18%，以及所有在离校考试中取得高分的学生的约 25%。去年，他们占罗素集团大学新生的 20%。 </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url"

class="article__body-text">很难区分美国私立教育的好处，因为它的学校比英国的更杂乱无章。由于公立学校禁止宗教信仰，许多虔诚的父母选择私人班级是出于学业成绩以外的其他原因。总的来说，表明美国的私立学校学生比去公立学校学得更多的证据并不像英国那样安全。</p><p class="article__body-text">弗吉尼亚大学的两位学者罗伯特·皮安塔 (Robert Pianta) 和艾莉亚·安萨里 (Arya Ansari) 于 2018 年发表的一项研究分析了 1000 名 1990 年代出生的儿童的考试成绩。研究发现，在调整背景后，到 15 岁时，就读于美国私立学校的学生成绩并没有提高。然而，并没有太多好的研究将富裕的孩子从参加美国“独立”学校的子集中获得的额外好处挑出来。但有理由认为，他们至少与他们的英国表亲一样，能提升孩子的前途。

所排名最高的大学和文理学院收集了数据。他发现平均约有 34% 的新本科生在私立高中接受教育（见图表）。考虑到私营部门仅教育 8.5% 的美国高中生，这令人震惊。来自“独立”学校的学生表现出色。最近公布的数据表明，他们约占达特茅斯新生的三分之一，占普林斯顿新生的四分之一以上。 “传统”偏好，即校友的亲属在录取中获得优势，或许可以解释其中的一些原因。英国大学没有发生如此公然的不公平行为。</p></div><h2>绿色草坪和美元</h2><p class="article__body-text">金钱也有帮助。英国大学向每位国内学生收取相同的学费（尽管国外学生支付的费用更高），而美国最好的大学则根据经济状况改变费用。这使得来自贫困背景的优秀学生可以很少或根本不用学习。但这也让大学有充分的理由与可靠的“补充”学校保持联系，这些学校充满了聪明的学生和丰富的财富。</p><p class="article__body-text">因此，英国的私立学校将更多的毕业生引向海外。去年约有 6% 的上大学的人选择出国留学，高于 2016 年的 4%。美国是最受欢迎的目的地。代表英国私立学校的独立学校委员会的 Barnaby Lenon 说，英国的大学要求学生成绩最好。但他补充说，他们也看重非学术成就，例如通过私立学校努力提供的课外活动获得的成就。 </p><div

class="article__body-text">私立学校学生享有的优势在美国比在英国受到的讨论要少得多，部分原因是种族问题而不是阶级问题往往成为大学录取辩论的中心议题。围绕种族、性别和历史教学展开的政治斗争正在使私立学校受益，部分原因是各州选择将资金投入私立“择校”项目。这些涉及地方政府支付一些私立学校的名额（通常只针对贫困儿童，而且通常是在最便宜的私立机构中）。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，美国可能正处于变革的边缘。最高法院即将做出的裁决可能会禁止在大学录取中使用平权措施。如果学院和大学不能再增加来自代表性不足的少数群体的申请者，那么优秀学生享有的优势可能会受到更严格的审查。英国的私立学校也面临着坎坷。看起来有可能在未来 18 个月到期的选举中赢得权力的工党正在谈论废除私立学校的慈善地位并剥夺它们的税收减免。这可能会导致学费上涨。与此同时，通往牛津和剑桥的道路将不断收窄。预计越来越多的英国人将横渡大西洋。 <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 08 Jun 2023 13:48:58

class="article__body-text">大多数此类管理工作都没有争议：最大的网络 Facebook 去年删除的帖子中有 90% 只是垃圾邮件。但是许多审核决定很难（见图表）。在最近一个季度，Facebook 删除或屏蔽了 1070 万条它认为是仇恨言论的帖子和 690 万条它认为是欺凌行为的帖子，这两个概念都存在分歧空间。就最近的一个困境而言，Meta 最近下令审查它是否对阿拉伯语单词<i>shaheed</i>的监管过于热心，该词通常被翻译为“烈士”，但其含义在不同的上下文中可能会发生变化。这些平台大多被留给自己解决这些困境。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，现在政客们正在介入。在美国，民主党人和共和党人都认为社交网络在节制方面做得很糟糕，现在是时候修改《通信规范法》第 230

NetChoice 将这一决定描述为“互联网言论自由的巨大胜利”。第 230 条目前看来是安全的。</p></div><p class="article__body-text">由于联邦层面运气不佳，左翼和右翼的改革者都将注意力集中在各州。去年加州通过了一项法律，强制科技公司收集较少的儿童用户信息等。 Several states have passed or proposed laws requiring those under 18 to get parental permission before using social media. On May 17th Montana banned TikTok altogether, over its Chinese ownership (TikTok is suing and is expected to win).</p><h2> States of denial</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Most controversially, in 2021 Florida and Texas, both Republican-controlled, passed laws restricting social networks&#39; ability to moderate political speech. Courts have upheld Texas&#39;s law and struck down Florida&#39;s, paving the way for a return to the Supreme Court, which is expected to take up the cases later this year. “If the court opens up the door to regulation in this space, many [states] will jump at the opportunity,” says Evelyn Douek of Stanford University.</p><p class="article__body-text"> They will have two transatlantic models to follow. Passed in July 2022, the <small>EU</small> ’s <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2022/04/30/free-speech-idealism-will-clash-with-laws-and-reality">Digital Services Act</a> ( <small>DSA</small> ) will kick in next year. Britain&#39;s <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/05/25/britains-online-safety-bill-could-change-the-face-of-the-internet">Online Safety Bill</a> , four years in the making, is expected to be enacted later this year. Both take a different approach from America&#39;s. Rather than altering who has liability for online content (the issue at the heart of the Section 230 debate), they force platforms to do a kind of due diligence, to keep bad content to a minimum. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Europe&#39;s <small>DSA</small> requires online platforms to set up complaint-handling processes and demands that they tell users how their algorithms work, allowing them to change the recommendations they receive. Smaller platforms, defined as those with fewer than 45m users in the <small>eu</small> , will be let off some of these obligations to stop them from drowning in red tape (some larger rivals warn that this could make them a haven for harmful material). For those big enough to qualify for full oversight, the <small>DSA</small> represents “a significant financial burden”, says Florian Reiling of Clifford Chance, a law firm. There is grumbling in Washington that of the 19 platforms so far earmarked by the <small>EU</small> for the most intensive scrutiny, only one—Zalando, a German e-commerce site—is European.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Twitter, which has cut its staff by about 80% since Mr Musk took over in October, may be one of those that struggles to meet the <small>DSA</small> ’s requirements. Mr Musk seems to have taken over from Mark Zuckerberg, Meta&#39;s boss, as social media&#39;s greatest villain in the eyes of some. On May 26th Thierry Breton, a European commissioner, tweeted that Twitter had left the <small>EU</small> ’s voluntary code of practice against disinformation, adding what sounded like a threat: “You can run but you can&#39;t hide.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Britain&#39;s parallel legislative effort is shaping up to be more far-reaching. The Online Safety Bill was conceived in 2019 after the suicide of a 14-year-old who had binged on algorithmically recommended depressive material. Four prime ministers later, the text of the bill has almost doubled in length. An American tech firm dubs it “one of the most complex bills we face anywhere in the world”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> It goes further than the <small>EU</small> in its loosely worded requirement for platforms to proactively screen material. The larger social networks already check videos for matches with known child-abuse content. But subtler crimes, such as incitement to violence, are harder to detect automatically. The scale of some platforms—YouTube uploads 500 hours of video per minute—means that a strict requirement to pre-screen content could throttle the amount of new material uploaded.</p><p class="article__body-text"> As in America, British conservatives worry about the over-moderation of right-wing views. The bill therefore imposes a duty to ensure that moderation “[applies] in the same way to a wide diversity of political opinion”. Similarly, the <small>EU</small> has promised that it will provide “protection for media against unjustified online content removal” as part of its forthcoming European Media Freedom Act, a response to crackdowns on the press in members states such as Hungary and Poland.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The most controversial part of Britain&#39;s bill, which required platforms to identify content that is “legal but harmful” (eg, material that encourages eating disorders), has been dropped where adults are concerned. But there remains a duty to limit its availability to children, which in turn implies the need for widespread age checks. Tech firms say they can guess users&#39; ages from their search history and mouse movements, but that a strict duty to verify users&#39; ages would threaten anonymity.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some suspect that their real objection is the price. “I don&#39;t think &#39;It costs money and is hard&#39; is an excuse,” says Keily Blair, chief operations officer of OnlyFans, a porn-centric platform which checks the age of its users and doesn&#39;t see why others shouldn&#39;t do the same. Yet some platforms are adamant: the Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, says it has no intention of verifying users&#39; ages. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The stricter the rules in jurisdictions such as Britain or the <small>eu</small> , the likelier tech companies will be to opt to offer different services there, rather than to apply the same rules worldwide. Some may even quit. WhatsApp, a Meta-owned messaging app, says it is unwilling to break its end-to-end encryption to meet a requirement in Britain&#39;s bill that companies must scan private messages for child abuse. It may not come to that: the bill would let Ofcom demand the data only in cases where it determined that such a measure was proportionate. Still, threats to up sticks are becoming more common. On May 24th Sam Altman, the head of Open <small>AI</small> , said he would consider leaving the <small>eu</small> if its regulation of artificial intelligence went too far. (He later rowed back his remarks.)</p><h2> Network effects</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Whether or not Britain or the <small>eu</small> use the full extent of their new powers, they set a handy precedent for countries that might use them oppressively. Britain&#39;s bill, which proposes prison for executives of companies that break the rules, is “a blueprint for repression around the world”, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil-liberties group. One American executive snipes that Britain&#39;s claim to be “world-leading” in tech is true only in the sense that it is blazing a trail for non-democracies to pass repressive laws of their own.</p><p class="article__body-text"> They need little encouragement. Turkey ordered Twitter to censor information during its recent election; that free-speech enthusiast, Mr Musk, complied. Brazil has proposed a “fake news law” that would penalise social networks for failing to identify misinformation. Modelled on the European legislation, it has been dubbed the “ <small>DSA</small> of the tropics”. India is to publish an internet-regulation bill in June which will reportedly make platforms liable for users&#39; content if they do not agree to identify and trace those users when directed.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The international impact of the British and <small>eu</small> proposals is influencing the debate in America. “No matter how much you think that social networks have been corrupting to American politics,” says Matthew Prince, head of Cloudflare, an American networking firm, “they&#39;ve been incredibly destabilising to other regimes that are against the United States&#39; interests.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 29 May 2023 17:48:03 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/i3alak4erigqrg6rgf6jpsqsvhgq4qe5</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/05/29/the-speech-police-are-coming-for-social-media </item><item><title><![CDATA[The cost of the global arms race]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="TOURNAI, BELGIUM - FEBRUARY 02: German-made Leopard 1 tanks, which were removed from the Belgian army's inventory years ago and sold to a defense industry company are seen at a warehouse in Tournai, Belgium on February 02, 2023.

Global defence outlays would rise by close to $700bn a year. </p></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230527_IRC296.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230527_IRC296.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230527_IRC296.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230527_IRC296.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230527_IRC296.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230527_IRC296.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230527_IRC296.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230527_IRC296.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230527_IRC296.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230527_IRC296.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine “risks wiping out the peace dividend we have enjoyed for the past three decades”, declared Kristalina Georgieva, the head of the <small>imf</small> , in a speech in April. The West is sending ever more weapons, of ever growing sophistication, in order to help Ukraine launch a counter-offensive against Russia. It has equipped the best part of nine new armoured brigades with modern battle tanks and more besides. Soon it will start training Ukrainian pilots to fly American-made <small>F-16</small> fighter jets.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The number of <small>nato</small> countries hitting the 2% target rose from three in 2014 to seven last year. The club now says this should be “a floor, not a ceiling”, a notion that is likely to be enshrined at its summit in Lithuania in July. Some countries are moving well beyond. Poland aims to reach 4% this year, and eventually to double the size of its army. France speaks of shifting to a “war economy”. </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y75_MYXlz9U?enablejsapi=1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text"> An arms race is intensifying on the other side of the globe, too. Taiwan is extending military service from four months to a year. Under the <small>aukus</small> deal, America and Britain will help supply Australia with nuclear-powered submarines; they will also aim to develop other weapons, including hypersonic missiles. In the past decade India&#39;s defence budget has grown by about 50% in real terms, as has Pakistan&#39;s. In the Middle East, Gulf states are again shopping heavily in the arms bazaar. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> China&#39;s defence budget has grown by about 75% in real terms in the past ten years. It wants to “basically complete modernisation” of its forces by 2035, and become a “world class” military power by 2049. America thinks China wants the capability to invade Taiwan as early as 2027.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some in America question whether its approach is adequate in a world riven by rivalry. Despite some recent increases, America&#39;s defence budget has shrunk by about 5% since 2012. Squeezes on spending emerged in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007-09. Yet even before the acute tension of current times, Congress gave authority to a commission to consider American defence spending. In 2018 the body recommended raising it by 3% to 5% in real terms every year for at least five years. Overall America&#39;s advantage over its rivals has eroded in the past century, reckons Andrew Krepinevich, an American strategist. During the first, second and cold wars America&#39;s adversaries had much smaller economies than America did. No longer. Today China&#39;s <small>GDP</small> alone is nearly 80% of America&#39;s.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In the decades after the cold war, the thinking was that to spend less on armies meant to spend more on infrastructure and public services and to lower debt or taxes. Since the 1960s the world has “released” about $4trn a year of spending at current prices in this way, equivalent to the global government budget for education. Now the peace dividend is turning into a “war tax”. How heavy will it be?</p><p class="article__body-text"> Working out accurately who is spending what can be difficult. For international comparison, defence spending is usually reckoned as a share of <small>gdp</small> , at market exchange rates. By this measure global military expenditures appear close to a post-cold-war low, at around 2.5%. But market exchange rates greatly underestimate the true size of defence establishments in countries such as China and Russia, where a given dollar of military spending can pay for a lot more weapons and soldiers. The proportion will also increase in the coming years if great-power rivalry grows as expected. In a more insecure world, countries will arm themselves because their neighbours are doing so or because their allies encourage them to.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Splurging more on weapons raises several questions. What will countries buy, might money be squandered and could the global economy be damaged?</p><p class="article__body-text"> America, by far the world&#39;s largest defence spender, is devoting growing sums to research and development of future weapons. This includes hypersonic missiles, to catch up with China and Russia; “directed energy” such as powerful lasers to shoot down drones and missiles; and artificial intelligence and robotics. It is also buying as many munitions as its factories can produce—from 155mm artillery shells to anti-ship missiles. The war in Ukraine has exposed the extraordinary quantities of munitions needed in a conflict, as well as the inability of peacetime production lines to meet such demand.</p><p class="article__body-text"> China is investing on all fronts and expenditures grew by 4.2% in real terms last year. The breakdown of its budget is opaque, not least because of “civil-military fusion” in technological development. It has developed a thicket of anti-access/area denial ( <small>A2/AD</small> ) weapons, with ground-attack and anti-ship missiles able to reach deep into the Pacific. It also has a lead in some types of hypersonic missiles (which are harder to intercept than ballistic ones). Its navy is already larger than America&#39;s. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> America, Russia and China are investing in their nuclear arsenals, too. America is upgrading all legs of its “triad” of ground-, air- and submarine-launched nukes. Russia is working on esoteric weapons, such as the long-distance, nuclear-powered Poseidon torpedo designed to set off an underwater nuclear explosion that, propagandists boast, can cause destructive tidal waves. China is quickly expanding its arsenal, from several hundred warheads to 1,500 by 2035, according to the Pentagon.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Equipment is also at the top of the shopping list for many smaller countries. Germany is buying stealthy new <small>F-35</small> jets as well as command-and-control systems. Poland is spending heavily on land forces—buying tanks, howitzers, precision rockets and more from America and South Korea—as well as combat aircraft. Japan is seeking, among many other things, long-range “counter-strike” missiles to hit back at China and North Korea.</p><p class="article__body-text"> This shopping spree comes with several risks. Given the bottlenecks, one danger is escalating costs, in an industry where prices can be hard to control because of long development processes, changing requirements and because defence firms operate at the technological edge, with all the associated overheads.</p><p class="article__body-text"> American defence budgets can be subject to the whims of politicians seeking benefits for their districts. Congress has persistently refused to let the air force retire obsolescent aircraft, for instance. European countries, for their part, are poor at co-ordinating procurement at scale. McKinsey, a consultancy, notes that they operate many more models of weapons than America does: 15 types of main battle tanks compared with one in America; 20 fighter jets versus seven, and so on.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Worse, the defence industry is especially prone to graft, notes Josie Stewart of Transparency International, an anti-corruption group. That is because of the secrecy that surrounds many of its dealings, its importance to national security and the “revolving door” of experts versed in its technicalities. An onrush of money could make everything worse.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There are wider concerns that big defence establishments, and the industries supplying them, will weigh down the global economy by stoking inflation or slowing growth, or both. Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard has noted that “the need to front-load massive temporary expenditures can easily push up borrowing costs”.</p><h2> Expectations for inflation?</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Certain fears may be misplaced. Take defence inflation in America—the increase in prices facing buyers of military equipment. It is running at about 5% year on year, the highest rate in decades. During previous military build-ups this sort of defence inflation has sharply increased. In the early 1980s, a period in which Ronald Reagan built up America&#39;s military capabilities, it easily outpaced economy-wide price rises. In the Vietnam war it briefly hit 48% on an annual basis.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Even so, there is little reason to believe that the new cold war will be sharply inflationary. Not even the fiercest hawks are calling for defence spending, as a share of <small>gdp</small> , to return to the levels of the 1960s or 1970s. Barring a hot war between big powers, global defence spending is unlikely to grow above the low single digits of global <small>gdp</small> —meaning that its impact on global aggregate demand, and thus inflation, will be similarly small.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Spending can remain historically low, in large part, because defence is more efficient than it used to be. Modern armies require ever fewer people—allowing military planners to cut headcounts (though service members can become more expensive). Brazil spends 78% of its budget on people compared with less than 50% in the West. In place of people you have better machines. Many planners bemoan the growing cost of each platform, but they improve with each iteration. “These days you can hit dozens of targets with a single bomber, rather than vice versa, which used to be the case,” argues James Geurts, a retired air-force colonel who advises Lux Capital, a venture-capital firm.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Official data from America suggest that once you adjust for improvements in quality, the price of a missile has fallen in nominal terms by about 30% since the late 1970s. The price of military aircraft is about flat. Today a country can spend relatively modestly to acquire fearsome capabilities. As such, defence spending tends to fall relative to <small>gdp</small> , particularly in peacetime.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Defence could continue to get better and cheaper in relative terms because of the changing nature of what Dwight Eisenhower, a general-turned-president, called the “military-industrial complex”. In the past defence departments exported technology to civilians—think of the global-positioning system and the internet. Increasingly, the opposite is happening, with military industries importing technology from outside.</p><h2> Technological trajectories</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Cyber-security, drones and satellite technology straddle both the civilian and military worlds. SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, has launched American military satellites. Ukrainian warriors make extensive use of his Starlink constellation of satellites. America&#39;s defence department has identified 14 critical technologies deemed vital to national security. Perhaps ten or 11 of these areas are being led commercially. Tech firms such as Google and Microsoft help out with cyber-security, data-processing and artificial intelligence. Several firms provide cloud computing.</p><p class="article__body-text"> It all amounts to a change of cultural mindset from tech firms that once shunned defence as morally tainted. A defence-tech ecosystem has sprung up in America, with lots of engineering expertise in Colorado; regulation wonks in Washington, <small>DC</small> ; aerospace types in Los Angeles; and investors in San Francisco. But it is not just an American phenomenon. About half of the biggest defence-and-aerospace firms founded within the past decade are headquartered in other parts of the world. “Founders no longer want to do the next social-media startup,” says Paul Kwan of General Catalyst, an American investment firm. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Big investors in Silicon Valley, including General Catalyst and the venture-capital outfit Andreessen Horowitz, are increasingly interested in national security, broadly defined. Tech firms smell opportunity. Palantir, which specialises in big-data analytics, recently released a new defence platform powered by <small>AI</small> to speed up decision-making. Defence was one of the few sectors where there were more venture-capital deals in 2022 than in 2021.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There is also a growing effort to inject defence firms themselves with tech&#39;s dynamism. A recent parliamentary report in Britain noted that “old &#39;legacy&#39; systems complicate tasks as routine as ordering a pair of boots”. It can take ten to 20 years to produce a new plane. But rather than develop new planes every decade or so, says Jim Taiclet, the boss of Lockheed Martin, the world&#39;s largest defence contractor, his firm aims to mimic Silicon Valley by offering software upgrades to improve performance every six to 12 months.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The fiscal consequences of the new defence boom may be modest if the industry becomes more efficient. The defence-versus-everything-else trade-off was acute in decades past: in 1944 America spent 53% of its <small>GDP</small> on military forces. But it is less so today. If the world doubled its military spending overnight (assuming no increases in taxes or debt) public spending would need to be cut by about 5% to balance the books. Not easy, but not that hard.</p><p class="article__body-text"> What of the impact on growth? Many historians argue that defence spending is a drain on the rest of the economy. Keeping a country secure has great economic value. But once you buy a missile, say, it tends to sit in storage rather than being put to productive use. During the second world war productivity growth slowed in America, as people were pulled from the fields into munitions factories and military units. Forced limits on military spending in postwar Japan and West Germany, by contrast, coincided with huge productivity improvements in both countries.</p><p class="article__body-text"> This is only a partial story, however. Countries such as Israel and South Korea combine vibrant economies with big defence sectors. We analysed World Bank data from the 1960s to 2021, exploring the relationship between military spending and <small>GDP</small> growth. Both within a single country over many years, and between countries in a single year, we find practically no correlation between the two. Put simply, more guns need not mean less butter.</p><p class="article__body-text"> More defence-related <small>R&amp;D</small> could boost wider innovation. And more investment in defence capabilities could also have positive spillover effects on the rest of the economy. A recent paper by Enrico Moretti of the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues finds that “government-funded <small>R&amp;D</small> in general—and defence <small>R&amp;D</small> in particular—[is] effective at raising a country&#39;s total expenditures on innovation in a given industry.”</p><h2> Of taxes and tanks</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Governments have plenty of competing demands for their cash: among them caring for ageing populations, fighting climate change and paying higher interest on their debts. Some fear that higher taxes are inevitable, or that the cost will be passed to future generations as borrowing. Many governments will face pressure to backpedal on commitments to higher military expenditures. According to a recently leaked intelligence report, Justin Trudeau, Canada&#39;s prime minister, told <small>NATO</small> leaders that his country would never reach the 2% target. It is not yet clear how Japan or Poland will pay for their big rises in defence.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Goings-on in Washington, above all, will determine the size and duration of the boom. The mainstream still wants America to maintain primacy and fend off both Russia and China. But many on the “America First” populist wing want to cut support for Ukraine and, in some cases, even for the Pentagon. A third group favours redirecting military spending away from Europe and the Middle East to concentrate on China. And a fourth contains figures from the left who want less spending on defence and more on social matters. The first category, the internationalist hawks, seem to have the upper hand. Confronting America&#39;s rival is one of the few issues where there is bipartisan support.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Several things might push up spending. A crisis might escalate—or even draw America into direct fighting—forcing a military surge. Harry Truman, for instance, oversaw one as president during the Korean war. Short of conflict, a future president may opt for a military build-up. Many credit Reagan&#39;s decision to boost defence outlays as crucial to bankrupting the Soviet Union and winning the cold war.</p><p class="article__body-text"> One way or another, a new era of rearmament beckons. As General Mark Milley, chairman of America&#39;s joint chiefs of staff, told the Senate recently: “Preventing great-power war through readiness and deterrence is very expensive, but not as expensive as fighting a war.” And the only thing more costly than that, as he explained, is losing one. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i>Correction (May 24th): A previous version of this article misstated Japan&#39;s defence-spending plans, and the number of NATO countries that spend 2% of GDP on defence.对不起。</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 23 May 2023 20:00:32 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/5seiop5pvhk0hlltsqk1ui9qc4kk2u64</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/05/23/the-cost-of-the-global-arms-race </item><item><title><![CDATA[Europe can’t decide how to unplug from China]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_IRD001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_IRD001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_IRD001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_IRD001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_IRD001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_IRD001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_IRD001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_IRD001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_IRD001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230520_IRD001.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 48en16">.css-48en16{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}</style><!-- --> <span class="css-48en16 e16qazw91">image: Alberto Miranda</span> </figcaption></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">H</span> <small>ow should</small> Europe handle China?

But it is far from clear what that strategy might be, or whether Europe would remain so closely aligned with America in the event of a war over Taiwan.</p><p class="article__body-text"> An awkward procession of Europe&#39;s leaders to Beijing in the past few months points to the lack of a plan. Germany&#39;s <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2022/11/02/olaf-scholz-leads-a-blue-chip-business-delegation-to-china">Olaf Scholz</a> paid a visit accompanied by business leaders in November; his foreign minister, who is from a different political party, went last month and struck a tough tone. Spain&#39;s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, went to open doors to his country&#39;s trade. <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/04/04/will-xi-jinping-outsmart-emmanuel-macron">Emmanuel Macron</a> ostentatiously sought to strike a partnership with Xi Jinping. The French president took 53 corporate bosses with him, and insisted that Europe distance itself from Sino-American tensions and from a conflict over Taiwan. His clumsy comments caused an uproar in Europe and America. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The war in Ukraine has complicated matters further as the mood has turned against autocracies. Most countries on the <small>eu</small> ’s eastern flank—which once opened their arms to Chinese investors—have become hawkish. “Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine had a sorting effect in Europe when it comes to China,” says Janka Oertel of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank. It seems that those in the east are as leery of the “no-limits” friendship between Moscow and Beijing as they are of Mr Macron&#39;s talk of “strategic autonomy” from America. Meanwhile, everyone knows that China remains keen to exploit transatlantic differences.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Finding common cause is onerous because it is hard to tell what America wants. Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden&#39;s national security adviser, and Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, have each recently distanced the Biden administration from hard talk of “decoupling”, in favour of “de-risking”—a term also used in the past few months by Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission. (She had intended to distinguish Europe&#39;s policy of managing risk from what seemed to be a tougher American approach akin to economic divorce.) Yet it is not long since the <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/02/09/tensions-will-linger-over-a-chinese-balloon-downed-by-america">spy-balloon episode</a> , when <small>us</small> -China relations hit a 30-year low. Congress and public opinion in America are hostile to China. Tensions may rise during the election campaign in 2024, and a pugnacious Republican, perhaps Donald Trump, may win.</p><h2> Attachment styles</h2><p class="article__body-text"> All this makes it urgent for Europe to devise a coherent China policy. Its leaders need to work out how far they want to reduce its dependency on China, and in so doing also respond to the hundreds of billions of dollars in green-industry subsidies unveiled last year in America&#39;s Inflation Reduction Act. They also need to decide what they would do if America became more demanding. In an extreme case, in the event of a war over Taiwan, Europe might be expected to impose sanctions on China like those it has slapped on Russia, and to back a military campaign. Some hope that the new doctrine of de-risking is a compromise that solves the dilemma. Others fear that it will prove meagre and inflexible in the face of changing technological and geopolitical realities. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Europe is more economically exposed to China than America is. Some 8% of publicly listed European firms&#39; revenues are from China, compared with 4% for American ones, according to Morgan Stanley, an American bank. Europe and America send a similar share of goods exports to China (7-9%), but because Europe is a more trade-intensive economy its sensitivity is higher. Multinational investments in China are worth 2% of Europe&#39;s <small>gdp</small> compared with 1% for America. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1172/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC170.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1172/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC170.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/386/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC170.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/578/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC170.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/771/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC170.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/1157/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC170.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1234/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC170.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1542/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC170.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1928/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC170.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2467/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC170.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> To form a holistic view we have come up with a yardstick of “total China exposure” (see chart 1). This has three elements: exports of goods, exports of services and the sales of Western-owned subsidiaries in China. These figures are for 2020, the last year for which data are available. The services and subsidiaries data include Hong Kong. We define Europe as its six largest economies, including Britain. We measure each country&#39;s exposure as a share of its own economy.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The European big six&#39;s total China exposure has hit 5.6% of their combined <small>gdp</small> , up from 3.9% in 2011. That is higher than America&#39;s at 4.2%. There is a big range: Italy and Spain are at just 1-2%, France and Britain are at 4-5%. Germany is a huge outlier at 9.9%. Two-thirds of the European big six&#39;s exposure is from the sales of subsidiaries in China rather than from exports from Europe. Often these are the Chinese arms of industrial giants such as Volkswagen and <small>basf</small> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> In the event of a “rigid” fragmentation of supply chains, the eurozone&#39;s gross national expenditure would drop by over 2%; roughly double the amount America&#39;s would, according to the European Central Bank. Germany&#39;s fall would presumably be higher. Similarly, an <small>imf</small> study in April found that in the event of an investment split between the West and China, European <small>gdp</small> would fall by 2%, more than twice the hit to America. In addition, a separation would cause a crisis at some leading European firms that rely on China, including Germany&#39;s carmakers, France&#39;s luxury empires and two British banks.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The emerging policy of de-risking refers to a calibrated reduction in links with China, rather than a wholesale economic decoupling. Even this is a big departure from how things were a decade ago. Back then European businesses were still stuffing their order books with Chinese contracts, suppressing their doubts about rising industrial competition. Overall trade between China and the <small>eu</small> grew 428% between 2002 and 2019.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> An <small>eu</small> strategic paper four years ago marked the first stage of the pivot. It argued that China was not just a partner and an economic competitor, but a systemic rival. The effects were swift. Capitals across Europe, which flogged ports and other infrastructure to Chinese investors, started to have second thoughts. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> To America&#39;s delight, many countries in Europe began to <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2018/12/15/can-huawei-survive-an-onslaught-of-bans-and-restrictions-abroad">prise Huawei</a> from their <small>5g</small> networks (though Germany still let the Chinese telecoms firm in). Remonstrations over human-rights abuses, particularly of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, grew louder. Supply-chain glitches during the pandemic showed the perils of relying too much on Chinese industry. The Sino- <small>eu</small> “Comprehensive Agreement on Investment”, struck in December 2020, was put to one side by Europe. And China&#39;s declaration of a “no-limits” friendship with Russia just weeks before the invasion of Ukraine soured the mood further.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mrs von der Leyen thinks that de-risking is the next step, and one that Europeans can agree on. But what it means in practice has yet to be clearly defined. It does not mean shutting the door to China altogether. It is partly about diversification, bolstering economic security and eradicating forced labour from supply chains. It is also focused on security concerns: hampering China&#39;s ability to get its hands on security-relevant technology such as quantum computing, which threatens encryption, or semiconductors for military purposes.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Like America, Europe is most strategically vulnerable when it comes to its critical dependence on China for certain supplies. In 2022 China mined nearly three-fifths of global <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2019/06/15/rare-earths-give-china-leverage-in-the-trade-war-at-a-cost">rare-earth elements</a> , used as components in electronic equipment. It also refined 60% of the world&#39;s lithium and 80% of its cobalt, two core inputs for the production of high-capacity electric batteries. Europe imports 98% of its rare earths from China, even more than America, which imports 80% from the Asian power. According to a study by <small>merics</small> , a German think-tank, the <small>eu</small> relies on China for 97% of its chloramphenicol, used to manufacture antibiotics. For America, the figure is 93%.</p><h2> Just friends</h2><p class="article__body-text"> European firms have already been diversifying suppliers since the pandemic, “friend-shoring” to allies, and “near-shoring” closer to home. America&#39;s energy secretary also declared in March that the Biden administration wanted supply chains in countries “whose values we share.” “All of us learned from covid-19 that we have to double- and triple-source, and not only from China,” says a French corporate titan. Firms are looking to India, Mexico, Morocco, Norway and Turkey, among others. Policymakers are pushing in the same direction. The <small>eu</small> has unveiled a Critical Raw Materials Act, designed to ensure that no more than 65% of annual consumption of any listed material should be sourced from any single country by 2030. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1137/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC172.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1137/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC172.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/374/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC172.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/561/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC172.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/748/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC172.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/1122/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC172.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1197/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC172.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1496/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC172.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1870/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC172.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2394/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC172.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> In the realm of technology European firms that are embedded into America&#39;s technology industry are mirroring American export controls. <small>asml</small> , a Dutch firm which makes equipment used to build semiconductors, has limited the sale of its cutting-edge machines to China. Europe&#39;s multinational companies are adjusting how they operate in China, too. In some cases they are divesting. In others they are making subsidiaries in China more self-sufficient, with a higher share of inputs and sales made locally. One measure of this is the share of investment by subsidiaries in China financed from their own profits, rather than from capital sent from Europe. For German subsidiaries in China this has risen from 2% in 2002 and 52% in 2012 to a new high of 85% in 2022 (see chart 2).</p><p class="article__body-text"> If these Chinese subsidiaries were perfectly self-sufficient they could in an extreme scenario be separated from the European parent, with both arms able to continue to operate: think of <small>vw</small> Germany and <small>vw</small> China. The result would be huge wealth destruction for shareholders in big European firms (many of whom are not actually European) but less damage to Europe&#39;s economy. In practice this shift to “one company, two systems” is only just beginning and for many large firms decoupling would be severely disruptive.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A final element of de-risking is stricter screening of Chinese investment coming into Europe. Strategic infrastructure is increasingly off-limits for Chinese investors, as inward investment in Europe is screened for security risks. Overall Chinese investment in Europe last year fell to its lowest point since 2013, according to a study by <small>merics</small> and Rhodium Group, a consultancy based in New York. China&#39;s foreign direct investment peaked in Europe back in 2016, Rhodium estimates.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The emergence of de-risking is understandable, but Europe&#39;s middle way is riddled with potholes. Big companies, still keen on the China dream, may refuse to go along for the ride. “There are certain no-go areas on tech in China,” says one senior European industrialist, “but on the rest we are not decoupling; it is business as usual, and the more the better.” When Mr Macron was in Beijing, Airbus, a European aircraft manufacturer, agreed to expand an assembly line in Tianjin, and confirmed an order to sell China 160 planes. </p></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1081/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC164.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1081/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC164.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/356/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC164.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/533/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC164.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/711/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC164.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/1067/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC164.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1138/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC164.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1422/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC164.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1778/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC164.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2276/90/media-assets/image/20230520_IRC164.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> De-risking may also struggle to adapt to technological change and its commercial effects, which can create new links even as old ones are dismantled. Cars are a good example. The <small>eu</small> exports almost no electric vehicles to China. Yet almost all of China&#39;s car exports to the <small>eu</small> , many of which are made for European brands, are battery-powered (see chart 3). Exports have shot up from less than €100m ($112m) a month before the pandemic to around €1bn a month now. As Europe&#39;s motorists seek greener transport, China is both eager and well positioned to flood the continent with cheaper electric models.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The greatest weakness of de-risking in its current guise is that it little prepares Europe for the shock that would follow an attempt by China to seize Taiwan. Europe&#39;s armed forces and its defence industry are already stretched, and the continent would struggle to find the capacity to provide much military support to America and Taiwan. Its leaders have little appetite for involvement in another war. But America would probably expect Europe to enforce the kind of embargo put in place on Russia. That would hurt American firms: despite Apple&#39;s efforts to diversify its production to India, the tech giant still relies on China. But it would harm Europe more, causing a bigger economic hit and destabilising more companies.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Macron&#39;s recent suggestion that Europe should not follow America&#39;s lead on Taiwan, in case it is dragged “into crises that are not [its] own”, delighted Beijing and <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/04/12/emmanuel-macrons-blunder-over-taiwan">dismayed European capitals</a> . Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania&#39;s foreign minister, retorted tartly that, at a time when Europeans depend on America&#39;s backing of Ukraine, they should be trying to preserve transatlantic unity rather than “begging for dictators to help secure peace in Europe”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Officials in Paris note, as Mr Macron eventually did, that it is official French policy to support the status quo over Taiwan. With naval bases and territories in the Indo-Pacific, France has direct interests in the region. “The problem isn&#39;t French policy but the disconnect between what we do and what Macron says, which creates unnecessary doubts among our partners,” notes Antoine Bondaz, at the Foundation for Strategic Research, a French think-tank. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> One virtue of Mr Macron&#39;s comments, notes a Scandinavian minister, is that they have prompted Europeans to talk more about China. Many on the continent fret about escalatory American rhetoric. On May 12th the <small>eu</small> ’s foreign ministers managed to agree to a set of principles for future dealings with the country. It will be discussed at the <small>eu</small> ’s next summit in June.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The bloc&#39;s deliberations in the coming months will depend heavily on France and Germany, which are its two biggest economies, and among the most exposed to China, and some of the least keen on cutting commercial ties. Mr Macron has long pushed Europe to become more self-reliant. Mr Scholz, faced with divergent views in his coalition government and a strong industry lobby, is still working on a national strategy that will shape Germany&#39;s approach to China (which keeps on being delayed). He is expected to host a bilateral summit with the country next month.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Much of eastern Europe seems wary of Chinese influence. The country&#39;s <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/01/22/what-chinas-bullying-of-lithuania-reveals-about-europe">bullying of Lithuania</a> in recent years over a Taiwanese diplomatic office in the country disgusted many. That is in spite of the fact that central and eastern Europe received some €3.8bn through China&#39;s clubby “16+1” initiative between 2000 and 2017. Comments made last month by Lu Shaye, the Chinese ambassador to France, helped focus minds. He appeared to dispute the legal status of all former Soviet countries (even if China later corrected his remarks).</p><h2> The end of the affair?</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Europe needs a measured debate about what to do next. France and Germany both have reservations about Mrs von der Leyen&#39;s de-risking measures, but they back the principle. Outward investment screening is under discussion, though will be difficult to put into practice. Inward investment screening is up and running, although Europeans disagree on how much to tighten the rules.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Beyond de-risking, collective <small>eu</small> policy has not been thought through. That is in spite of the fact that de-risking doesn&#39;t provide an answer to a scenario in which relations between America and China were to rupture. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, the transatlantic alliance has stood remarkably firm. A Chinese move on Taiwan would prove an even more dangerous, and far more difficult, test. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 15 May 2023 19:59:43 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/3ot5roakj7ad6okvm2jegeip06cjm00d</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/05/15/europe-cant-decide-how-to-unplug-from-china </item><item><title><![CDATA[After 12 years of blood, Assad’s Syria rejoins the Arab League]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Syrian President Bashar al-Assad President al-Assad performs Eid al-Fitr prayers at President Hafez al-Assad mosque Syrian President Bashar al-Assad President al-Assad performs Eid al-Fitr prayers at President Hafez al-Assad mosque in Damascuss, on April 21, 2023.

Syria has been suspended from the league since 2011, when Mr Assad began a brutal crackdown on anti-government protests that plunged the country into civil war (see map). On May 7th, however, the body agreed to readmit Syria and said it would invite Mr Assad to a summit in Saudi Arabia on May 19th.</p><p class="article__body-text"> An invitation from a dull talking shop crammed with dictators may seem hollow. For Mr Assad, though, it is the culmination of a long effort to end his Arab isolation—and, he may hope, another step towards <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/05/11/the-rehabilitation-of-syrias-dictator-raises-awkward-questions-for-the-west">acceptance in the West</a> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> His regime has done nothing so far to merit a renewed embrace: neither making concessions towards political reform nor taking accountability for war crimes, nor trying to bring home Syria&#39;s 6m refugees, most of them in neighbouring countries. Before the war the country had some 22m people; roughly half of them had to flee either abroad or elsewhere in Syria because of it. He rules a kleptocracy that floods the Gulf with illicit drugs and maintains close ties with Iran, an arch-rival to some Arab states. Poverty is widespread. Yet even the bloodiest dictator, it seems, can find a road to diplomatic redemption—if he simply causes enough problems for others.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That is one lesson from his return to the world stage. Another is that the autocrats and warlords who court Russian support are likely to end up disappointed. Mr Assad needs the Arab world—and the wealthy Gulf states in particular—because Russia cannot rebuild his ruined country. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Better still, for him, would be a rapprochement with the West, which has placed his regime under sanctions meant to deter reconstruction. Those on the energy sector, for example, bar firms from building new power plants or supplying equipment. Would-be investors in the Gulf are even jittery about small-scale solar-energy projects, fearing they might run afoul of the measures. So a rapprochement seems unlikely. But talk of one raises an unsavoury question, one that has echoes from Venezuela to Zimbabwe: if a regime endures and sanctions fail to force change, should they be maintained despite their toll on civilians?</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Assad was never entirely a pariah in his own region. Algeria declined to cut ties with his regime. Egypt briefly did, under its short-lived democratic government, but restored them after a military coup in 2013. Still, the past decade was lonely. When Mr Assad arrived in the United Arab Emirates ( <small>uae</small> ) for an official visit last year, it was his first trip to an Arab country in 11 years.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The <small>uae</small> was among the first to break his isolation when it reopened its embassy in Damascus in 2018 and urged allies to do the same. The massive earthquakes that struck Syria (and Turkey) in February gave a larger jolt to <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/02/16/bashar-al-assad-does-not-want-to-let-a-calamity-go-to-waste">Syria&#39;s diplomatic standing</a> . Many Arab leaders had wanted to reach out to Mr Assad; the disaster gave them an excuse, as they called to offer condolences and co-ordinate aid.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There are several reasons why they sought normalisation. One is a broader spirit of detente. The Saudis struck a deal in March with Iran to restore diplomatic ties and reopen embassies. After years of proxy wars in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere, both sides were keen to lower tensions and shore up their positions at home. Turkey and Egypt, mired in mutual economic crises, are trying to end a decade of animosity. Gulf states have ended their embargo of Qatar, their tiny, wayward neighbour on the Arabian peninsula, which accomplished little. Old foes across the region are keen to pretend they are friends. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> When it comes to Syria, however, they want something bigger in return. Its neighbours hope to get rid of millions of Syrian refugees. The <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/04/lebanons-government-is-squeezing-out-syrian-refugees">2m or so in Lebanon</a> , with a population of just 5m, are seen as a burden, blamed unfairly for the country&#39;s economic collapse. In Turkey the mood has also turned hostile. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the main opposition candidate in the election on May 14th, vows to <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/03/02/syrian-earthquake-survivors-in-turkey-have-nowhere-to-go">send Syrians packing</a> within two years if elected.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some also wager that closer ties with Mr Assad could peel him away from Iran. After relying for years on Iranian military support, his country is now a base for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hizbullah and other armed groups linked to Iran. Their presence is unsettling for countries including Saudi Arabia and Jordan, which see Iran as a menace.</p><p class="article__body-text"> No one should be too hopeful. Some in the sprawling Syrian diaspora have built decent lives in their adopted countries, although others are consigned to squalor, living in tents and surviving on handouts. Few, however, wish to return to Syria. They are unlikely to—at least not by choice—unless the regime makes both political reforms and progress on reconstruction.</p><p class="article__body-text"> As for Iran, it is hard to imagine Mr Assad booting out the forces that kept him in power. When Ebrahim Raisi, the arch-conservative Iranian president, visited Damascus this month, he was treated to a musical number extolling Iran. Many Syrians doubt that their president, whose capital is ringed by Iranian militias, would even have the power to push them out.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Still, Syria may make a few gestures. It has become the world&#39;s leading producer of Captagon, an amphetamine that is a popular recreational drug in the Gulf. Authorities in the <small>uae</small> seized almost 36m tablets in 2020, hidden inside a shipment of electric cables. The following year Saudi customs officials found 20m pills in a cargo of grapefruit. Jordan says it intercepted 17m pills in the first four months of 2022, up from 15m in all of 2021 and just 1.4m in 2020. Border guards have been killed in shoot-outs with armed smugglers.</p><p class="article__body-text"> For every high-profile bust, many shipments go undetected. The <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/07/19/syria-has-become-a-narco-state">scale of the Captagon trade</a> is often exaggerated. The British government put its annual value at $57bn, a patently absurd figure, larger than the <small>gdp</small> of Jordan or the combined annual revenue of Mexico&#39;s drug cartels. The real figure is probably an order of magnitude smaller—but that is still large enough to make it Syria&#39;s top export. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> The past 12 years have been good for the small clique of drug dealers and war profiteers around the president. For everyone else in Syria, they have been miserable. The Syrian pound, stable at around 50 to the dollar before the war, now trades at around 6,500 according to an official rate published by the country&#39;s central bank (see chart) and at 8,700 on the black market. Official statistics are unreliable, but annual inflation is probably above 100%. Syria exports just $1bn-worth of licit goods a year, down from $11bn before the war. The government is able to provide only a few hours of electricity a day.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Assad owes his survival partly to Russia, which in 2015 sent thousands of troops and dozens of warplanes to back his regime. What it helped destroy, though, it has done little to rebuild. In 2019 and 2020, with much fanfare, Russian officials announced projects worth billions of dollars for Syria: a modernised electricity network, a grain hub at the port of Tartus, a cross-country railway. Years later the country still endures blackouts and wheat shortages; its trains sit idle.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Lately Russia has stopped making even empty promises. Bogged down in Ukraine, mired in its own sanctions, it has little to offer. Vladimir Putin has secured his own narrow interests in Syria: a naval base at Tartus and some phosphate-mining concerns, among other things. Those interests do not extend to providing homes and jobs for impoverished Syrians.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Other aspiring presidents-for-life should take note. The Wagner Group, a mercenary outfit that fought in Syria, also has a presence in Sudan, where it oversees a gold-mining operation. It works closely with <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/11/what-the-west-gets-wrong-about-peacemaking-in-sudan" data-tegid="r2qgo30vrm2vvubej1e0i7mrifjskmp6">Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo</a> (known as Hemedti), a warlord whose paramilitary Rapid Support Forces are now fighting the Sudanese army for control of the country. Russia has been happy to send men and munitions to support his fighters; it is unlikely to kick in much for reconstruction. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> If Syria is to be rebuilt, the money will have to come from elsewhere. Western governments, understandably, are loth to foot the bill. The Gulf states might be more willing—if it wins them either political influence or economic returns.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Officially, America opposes this: it wants Mr Assad to remain a pariah. Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, called his Jordanian counterpart on May 4th and reiterated that America would not recognise the regime and “does not support others normalising”. The <small>eu</small> has also maintained a tough line, even though some countries in central and southern Europe would prefer to restore ties (in the hope of getting rid of their Syrian-refugee populations). In private, though, Arab diplomats say the Americans gave them a “yellow light” to reach out to the Assad regime. Try it, they were told—but make sure you get something out of it.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The Captagon crisis shows why this is a fraught endeavour. Western officials make a straightforward argument: since Mr Assad created the problem, restoring ties with his regime would reward him for flooding the region with drugs. Arab leaders think the diagnosis is correct but the prescription is not. If Mr Assad is using drugs as leverage, they say, the only solution is to work with him. They risk endless blackmail. Perhaps Mr Assad will stem the flow—but he can easily turn it back on when he wants further concessions.</p><p class="article__body-text"> At the same time, though, Western policy is fanciful. America wants Mr Assad to abide by <small>un</small> Security Council resolution 2254, which calls for a ceasefire, a new constitution and free elections in Syria. A less odious Syrian government would probably not want the country to be a narco-state. Unsurprisingly, though, Mr Assad has shown no interest in such reforms in what has been a hereditary dictatorship since 1971. Arab states are probably too optimistic about what their outreach can achieve—but shunning him has already failed. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 09 May 2023 18:53:32 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/p74kr1mrd9ro58nqm3l8lbg62a7vmovt</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/05/09/after-12-years-of-blood-assads-syria-rejoins-the-arab-league </item><item><title><![CDATA[The 2023 crony-capitalism index]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">O</span> <small>ver the</small> past 20 years, Britain&#39;s capital was so welcoming to oligarchs that it became known as <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/03/05/the-rise-and-fall-of-londongrad">“Londongrad”</a> .

The immense wealth of many of Vladimir Putin&#39;s associates highlights the problem of crony capitalism and why more should be done to combat it. </p><style data-emotion="css 1lm38nn">.css-1lm38nn{margin:1.3125rem 0 2.1875rem;}.css-1lm38nn figure{margin:0;min-width:100%;}.css-1lm38nn figure figcaption{display:inline;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-0);font-weight:500;}.css-1lm38nn audio{display:block;margin-top:0.75rem;width:100%;}.css-1lm38nn +figure,.css-1lm38nn +.g-fallback+figure{margin-top:0;}</style><div class="css-1lm38nn e1lug06p0"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。 </figcaption><style data-emotion="css 1fs0t47">.css-1fs0t47{display:inline;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-0);font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-border-link);}.css-1fs0t47 a{color:var(--ds-color-london-5);-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-underline-offset:0.125rem;-webkit-transition:color var(--ds-interactions-transition),color var(--ds-interactions-transition);transition:color var(--ds-interactions-transition),color var(--ds-interactions-transition);}.css-1fs0t47 a:hover{color:var(--ds-color-chicago-30);}.css-1fs0t47 a:focus{text-decoration-color:transparent;box-shadow:0 0 0 0.125rem var(--ds-color-hong-kong-55);outline:solid transparent;}.css-1fs0t47 a:active{text-decoration-color:var(--ds-color-hong-kong-55);box-shadow:none;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}</style><span class="css-1fs0t47 emsvzne0">享受更多音频和播客</span><!-- --><span class="css-1fs0t47 emsvzne0"><a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">iOS</a></span><!-- --><span class="css-1fs0t47 emsvzne0">或者</span><!-- --><span class="css-1fs0t47 emsvzne0"><a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">安卓</a>。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " controls="" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/055%20International%20-%20Our%20crony-capitalism%20index%202023-3fa061b015b1973b684ec2483b25d70e.mp3" title="The 2023 crony-capitalism index" controlslist="nodownload"><p>您的浏览器不支持 &lt;audio>; 元素。 </p></audio><style data-emotion="css 1h1me4y">.css-1h1me4y{text-align:center;height:0;}.css-1h1me4y>div{top:-0.625rem;}</style><div class="css-1h1me4y e1lug06p1"><style data-emotion="css vu6x35">.css-vu6x35{position:relative;display:inline-block;text-align:left;}</style><div class="css-vu6x35 e5tfikp0"></div></div></figure></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC014.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC014.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/243/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC014.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/365/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC014.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/486/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC014.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/729/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC014.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/778/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC014.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/972/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC014.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1215/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC014.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1556/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC014.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> According to the latest instalment of our crony-capitalism index, which first estimated how much plutocrats profit from rent-seeking industries almost a decade ago, crony capitalists&#39; wealth has risen from $315bn, or 1% of global <small>gdp,</small> 25 years ago to $3trn or nearly 3% of global <small>gdp</small> now<!-- --> (see chart 1). Some 65% of the increase has come from America, China, India and Russia. Overall 40% of crony-capitalist wealth derives from autocratic countries and amounts to 9% of their <small>gdp</small> . There are hundreds of billionaires around the world whose riches are largely believed to derive from sectors which often feature chummy dealings with the state.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The way we estimate all this is to start with data from <i>Forbes.</i> The magazine has published an annual stock-take of the world&#39;s wealthy for nearly four decades. In 1998 it reckoned that there were 209 billionaires with a total worth of $1trn, equivalent to 3% of global <small>gdp</small> . This year the publication details 2,640 billionaires worth $12trn or 12% of <small>gdp</small> . Most of those listed do not operate in rent-seeking sectors. Adjusting for rising prices—$1bn in 1998 is now equivalent to $3.3bn—there are 877 billionaires (at 1998 prices) with a collective worth of $9trn.</p><p class="article__body-text"> We classify the source of wealth into rent-seeking and non-rent-seeking sectors. An economic rent is the surplus remaining once capital and labour have been paid which, with perfect competition, tends towards zero. Rent-seeking is common in sectors close to the state, including banking, construction, property and natural resources. It can sometimes be possible for rent-seekers to inflate their earnings by gaining favourable access to land, licences and resources. They may form cartels to limit competition or lobby the government for cosy regulations. They may bend rules, but do not typically break them. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/967/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/967/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/318/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/477/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/636/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/954/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1018/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1272/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1590/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2036/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Russia is, once again, the most crony-capitalist country in our index (see chart 2). Billionaire wealth from crony sectors amounts to 19% of <small>gdp</small> . The effects of the Ukrainian war are clear, however. Crony wealth declined from $456bn in 2021 to $387bn this year. Only one-fifth of Russian billionaires&#39; wealth is derived from non-crony sectors, which shows just how distorted the economy is.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In March last year, the <small>g7</small> , the <small>eu</small> and Australia launched the Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs ( <small>repo</small> ) Task Force to “isolate and exert unprecedented pressure on sanctioned Russian individuals”. A year later it announced that it had blocked or frozen $58bn of assets. But <small>repo</small> admits that in some cases oligarchs have found it easy to evade sanctions by using shell companies, passing assets to family members or investing in property. Wealth is increasingly stored in manicured lawns and marble columns.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Pressure on the oligarchs comes from Russia, too. In March Mr Putin chastised them for becoming “dependent on foreign authorities” by hiding their assets offshore. Mr Putin is a hypocrite. By one estimate he has stolen more than $100bn from Russia—which has helped pay for a compound on the Black Sea estimated to cost $1.4bn and a $700m yacht impounded by the Italian authorities last year. But he is not on the <i>Forbes</i> billionaires&#39; list.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Our index illuminates other trends among the mega-wealthy. Many of America&#39;s 735 billionaires have been hit by the crash in tech stocks last year; three-fifths of global tech-billionaire wealth originates there. The country&#39;s <small>nasdaq</small> composite, a tech-tilted index, lost about a third of its value between November 2021 and December 2022. We reckon American tech billionaires saw their riches decline by 18%. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Overall crony-sector wealth amounts to around 2% of <small>gdp</small> in America, whereas non-crony-sector wealth is 15%. But tech exhibits some crony characteristics. America&#39;s 20 biggest tech companies raked in half of all the industry&#39;s sales in 2017, making it the country&#39;s most concentrated sector. Tech firms are among the biggest lobbyists in Washington, with eight firms collectively spending $100m last year. Reclassify tech as a crony industry in our index and America&#39;s crony wealth increases to 6% of <small>gdp</small> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> Meanwhile, Chinese billionaires continue to struggle with the vagaries of their government. Since Xi Jinping launched a crackdown on private capital, crony wealth has fallen sharply, from a peak of 4.4% of <small>gdp</small> in 2018 to 2.5% now. Tycoons of all stripes operate only with the consent of the state. In 1998 there were just eight billionaires in the country (including Hong Kong and Macau), with a total worth of $50bn. Now its 562 billionaires command $2trn.</p><p class="article__body-text"> By our measure crony capitalists account for about one-quarter of that total. A recent working paper published by the Stone Centre on Socio-Economic Inequality, part of the City University of New York, finds that between 83% and 91% of corrupt senior officials were in the top 1% of the urban income distribution because of their illegal incomes. Without that money, just 6% would be in that bracket.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Since Mr Xi came to power in 2012 over 1.5m people have been punished in an ongoing anti-corruption drive. High-profile tycoons also face more scrutiny. When Jack Ma, a co-founder of the tech giant Alibaba, disappeared in late 2020 after criticising the authorities, he was worth nearly $50bn. He recently re-emerged worth half of what he had been. Bao Fan, a billionaire banker, was whisked away in February to help with an investigation. He has not been seen since.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Official talk of “common prosperity” has created a cottage industry for getting money out of China. Singapore is a prime destination for it. In 2019 the country had just 33 Chinese family offices—firms which manage a family&#39;s assets. There were perhaps 750 by the end of 2022.</p><p class="article__body-text"> India&#39;s leader, Narendra Modi, has favourites among the country&#39;s corporate captains. Over the past decade, wealth from crony-capitalist sectors has risen from 5% to nearly 8% of its <small>gdp</small> . Gautam Adani, the owner of the conglomerate of the same name, was briefly the world&#39;s third-richest person in September. But in January his company was accused of fraud and stockmarket manipulation by Hindenburg Research, an American short-seller. It denies all accusations. His wealth has fallen from $90bn to $47bn.</p><h2> Don&#39;t take a slice of my pie</h2><p class="article__body-text"> What happens when cronyism gets completely out of control? If elites so enrich themselves that they impoverish a country, a “kleptocracy” forms, declared Stanislav Andreski, a Polish sociologist. He warned against such regimes and their effects in the late 1960s. It has taken more than 50 years for Western countries to heed him.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Identifying kleptocracy is more art than science. Our findings correlate only somewhat to indices of democracy and corruption. And in any case, at what level does corruption destroy the functions of the state? <small>usaid,</small> America&#39;s agency for international development, issued an 84-page “dekleptification” guide last year. After studying 13 countries including Brazil, Malaysia and Ukraine, it recommends breaking up corrupt monopolies and digitising ownership registries, among other important measures. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> America is also trying to whip up international fervour for a crackdown. In March it hosted its second “summit for democracy”. Seventy-four countries representing two-thirds of global <small>gdp</small> declared that, among other things, they would work to “prevent and combat corruption”. Russia and China were understandably missing. Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa were among those less understandably so.</p><p class="article__body-text"> At the summit Janet Yellen, America&#39;s treasury secretary, pointed out that “kleptocrats launder kickbacks through anonymous purchases of foreign real estate”. So starting next year America will require firms formed or operating in the country to reveal their real, or “beneficial”, owners. Another 36 countries have signed up to America&#39;s declaration to make concealing identity more difficult. But transparency is not a silver bullet. Last year a new law in Britain required foreign businesses that own property assets to register themselves and disclose their true owners. A report in February by an anti-corruption watchdog found that the owners of 52,000 of the 92,000 properties subject to the new rule remained undisclosed. Shady owners skirt rules and registries often lack the resources to police them.</p><p class="article__body-text"> America also frets about “golden” visas, which sell citizenship for a chunk of cash. Five Caribbean tax havens sell passports which provide visa-free travel to around 150 countries for $100,000-150,000 each. Britain&#39;s tier-one visa scheme, launched in 2008, gave permanent residency within five years to foreigners who could prove they had £1m ($1.25m) to invest in British bonds or shares. It closed a week before the war in Ukraine started because of fears about Russian money (talk about closing the stable door once the thoroughbred has bolted). Of the 13,777 visas issued, a fifth went to Russians (including ten to oligarchs now under sanctions), a third to Chinese.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Back in London, a warning lies in Highgate cemetery. There you can find the grave of Alexander Litvinenko, not far from oligarch mansions (and also Karl Marx&#39;s tomb). He was murdered in 2006 by Russian agents with a dose of polonium-210 after making lurid allegations about Mr Putin&#39;s circle. Litvinenko is buried in a specially sealed lead-lined casket to prevent radiation leaking out. Now Western authorities need to prevent hazardous assets seeping into their countries. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 02 May 2023 20:15:51 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/1s4o191p8p5afdmfjvr07lkppo064kml</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/05/02/the-2023-crony-capitalism-index </item><item><title><![CDATA[How the war split the mafia]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230429_IRD001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230429_IRD001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230429_IRD001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230429_IRD001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230429_IRD001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230429_IRD001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230429_IRD001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230429_IRD001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230429_IRD001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230429_IRD001.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p class="article__body-text"> <i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-war">Ukraine war</a></i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 24 Apr 2023 18:31:13 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/n1e3pr79tdd2bp67pd0c9bhkg56bjb6m</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/04/24/how-the-war-split-the-mafia </item><item><title><![CDATA[The world’s deadliest war last year wasn’t in Ukraine]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="KHARTOUM, SUDAN - APRIL 18: A view of vehicles of RSF, damaged after clashes between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Khartoum, Sudan on April 18, 2023.

The army&#39;s head is battling a militia boss for control of Africa&#39;s third-largest country. General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudan&#39;s de facto ruler, runs a military junta that keeps delaying a promised handover of power to civilians. Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo (better known as “Hemedti”), leads paramilitaries called the Rapid Support Forces, which in an earlier guise committed genocide in Darfur.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Both sides have the kind of ambition that often leads to bloodshed in countries with few checks and balances. They crave unaccountable power and the perks that come with it. The army already has a vast, shady business empire; Hemedti has reportedly made a fortune from gold mines and selling military services abroad. Neither man seems willing to share power.

The country has been tormented by civil war for most of the time since independence in 1956. It is an example of a global problem: the increasing persistence of conflict.</p><p class="article__body-text"> As attention is focused on great-power rivalry between America, Russia and China, conflicts in the rest of the world are getting worse. The number of people who have been forced to flee their homes has doubled in the past decade, to roughly 100m. Even as global poverty has retreated, the number of desperate people needing emergency aid has doubled since 2020, to 340m. Some 80% of this is driven by conflict, estimates the International Rescue Committee ( <small>irc</small> ), an <small>ngo</small> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> Since 1945, conflicts have come in three overlapping waves. First, people in European colonies struggled for independence. Then, rival groups fought for control of these newly independent states. The cold war raised the stakes: the West backed insurgencies against governments that professed to be Marxist, from Angola to Nicaragua. The Soviet Union supported anti-capitalist guerrillas and revolutionary regimes on every continent.</p><p class="article__body-text"> After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the number of wars fell sharply. So, too, did the estimated number of deaths in battle. But after 2011 came a third wave. Both the number of wars and their deadliness increased, as the Arab spring led to conflagrations in the Middle East, a new form of jihadism spread across the Muslim world and Vladimir Putin resurrected old-fashioned Russian imperialism. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Putin&#39;s invasion of Ukraine is unusual: a straightforward attempt by one state to conquer another and steal its territory. Most modern armed conflicts are harder to understand. They are usually civil wars, though many involve foreign meddling. They are largely in poor countries, especially hot ones like Sudan. (Indeed, they form a belt of pain around the equator—see map) They cause millions of deaths, but exactly how many is hard to estimate. Far more perish from war-induced hunger or disease than from bullets or shrapnel. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Fighting makes poor places rapidly poorer. A typical five-year civil war reduces income per head by a fifth, estimates Christopher Blattman of the University of Chicago in his book “Why We Fight”. So it is alarming that wars are lasting longer (see chart 1). The average ongoing conflict in the mid-1980s had been happening for about 13 years; by 2021 it was nearly 20 years.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There are several plausible reasons for this. First, global norms are eroding. When Russia, a permanent member of the <small>un</small> Security Council ( <small>unsc</small> ), brazenly violated the <small>un</small> ’s founding charter by invading Ukraine, murdering civilians and kidnapping children, it showed how much taboos have weakened. When China, another permanent member of the <small>unsc</small> , called Mr Putin a “dear friend” despite his indictment for war crimes, it confirmed that for some world powers, might makes right. This emboldens smaller bullies. </p></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> In Sudan, for example, hardly anyone has been held to account for mass slaughter during the country&#39;s various wars, nor for mass rape, nor the widespread enslavement of black Africans by the country&#39;s Arabic-speaking elite. General Burhan and Hemedti pretended to listen to popular demands for justice after the overthrow of a former dictator, Omar al-Bashir, who has since been convicted of corruption. But it seems unlikely that they ever planned to hand over the reins to civilians, as they were supposed to do last week.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Impunity is not the whole story, however. Other factors are causing conflicts to burn for longer. Climate change is fuelling fights over water and land. Religious extremism is spreading. Organised criminals are making the world&#39;s most unstable states even more so. And conflicts are growing more complex.</p></div><h2> The stuttering rifles&#39; rapid rattle </h2><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Between 2001 and 2010 around five countries each year suffered more than one simultaneous war or insurgency. Now 15 do (see chart 2). Sudan has conflicts in the east, west and south. Complex wars are in general harder to end. It is not enough to find a compromise that satisfies two parties; a deal may need to please dozens of groups, any one of which may cock its Kalashnikovs again if unsatisfied.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Civil wars are also becoming more international. In 1991 only 4% of them involved significant foreign forces. By 2021 that had risen 12-fold to 48%, reckons the Uppsala Conflict Data Programme, a research project. In the past decade this process has been driven partly by America&#39;s retreat from its role as global policeman, and mid-sized powers filling the vacuum. Russia and Turkey spar over Libya and Syria; Saudi Arabia and Iran have fought a proxy war in <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/04/20/a-prisoner-swap-is-a-symbolic-step-towards-ending-the-saudi-led-war-in-yemen" data-tegid="oe3vok961gt6t55s94312flc6g08p7ev">Yemen</a> . In Sudan, Egypt supports General Burhan while Hemedti is pals with Russia.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Foreign meddling can be benign, as <small>un</small> peacekeeping operations generally are, even if they often blunder. But interventions by external powers with selfish agendas tend to make civil wars last longer and cost more lives, finds David Cunningham of the University of Maryland. The costs for external actors are lower—their own cities are not being destroyed—so they have less incentive to make peace.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Climate change is aggravating the mayhem. It does not directly cause conflict, but when pastures dry up, herders drive their hungry cattle farther afield, often encroaching on land claimed by rival ethnic groups. A review of 55 studies by Marshall Burke of Stanford University and others found that a one-standard-deviation increase in local temperature raises the chance of intergroup conflict by 11% compared with what it would have been at a more normal temperature.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> Globally, some 24m people were displaced by extreme weather in 2021, and the <small>un</small> expects that figure to soar. In Sudan, some 3m people were displaced by conflict and natural disasters even before the current round of fighting began. </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VqR021m9OTs?enablejsapi=1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text"> The bloodiest war in the world last year was not in Ukraine but in Ethiopia, notes Comfort Ero, the head of Crisis Group, a think-tank. Olusegun Obasanjo, a former president of Nigeria who helped broker a peace deal in November between the government and the Tigray region, has put deaths at 600,000 between 2020 and 2022. No estimate for Ukraine is as high.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mohammed Kamal, an Ethiopian farmer, was ploughing his fields when he heard shooting. Returning to his village, he found that gunmen had murdered 400 people, mostly women and children. “Only a small number survived,” he says. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Even if the peace deal holds, which is uncertain, it will not help Mohammed. For the massacre he witnessed was part of an entirely separate conflict, which is still blazing. While government troops were distracted by the war in Tigray, members of Ethiopia&#39;s largest ethnic group, the Oromo, revived an old insurgency, and are trying to drive other ethnic groups out of their home region. Mohammed says the gunmen who killed his neighbours were from the Oromo Liberation Army ( <small>ola</small> ), a rebel group; their victims were from the Amhara ethnic group. (The <small>ola</small> denies involvement.)</p><p class="article__body-text"> If that sounds complicated, it is actually much more so. Ethiopia has more than 90 ethnic groups, many of whose leaders are tempted to stir up hatred to win control of one of the country&#39;s 11 ethnically based regions. It hosts hundreds of thousands of refugees from four turbulent neighbours (Eritrea, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan). The dictatorship next door (Eritrea) has sent armies to fight against a previous Ethiopian government, and arm-in-arm with the current one.</p><p class="article__body-text"> War creates a vicious circle. As droughts and floods have devastated rural areas, young men with no prospects feel more tempted to pick up a gun and grab land or loot. Rebel recruiters understand this only too well. Facebook accounts linked to <small>OLA</small> show videos of young fighters celebrating with stacks of cash they have liberated from banks. With so many fighters lurking in the bush, kidnapping shopkeepers and murdering officials, businesses flee the area and public services get even worse. Locals then grow even more frustrated and angry, especially when the state responds with repression, which it often does.</p><h2> The holy glimmers of goodbyes</h2><p class="article__body-text"> To countries destabilised by bad governments and climate change, extremism adds gelignite. Consider the Sahel, a vast arid area below the Sahara desert. Five countries—Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Niger and (northern) Nigeria—suffered droughts in 2022 and the most severe food crisis in 20 years. Nearly 6m people were also hit by floods. Some 24m in these five countries are “food insecure” (meaning they struggle to feed themselves). In just one sub-region of Mali, the <small>irc</small> found no fewer than 70 conflicts in late 2021. Half were about land; a third were about water. A seventh resulted in lots of people being driven from their homes.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Into this desperate environment have stepped jihadist groups. Since the Arab spring affiliates of al-Qaeda and (later) Islamic State have spread across the Middle East, Africa and beyond. They promise justice—such as the restoration of stolen grazing land—in countries where formal courts barely function. Once they have gained a foothold, they accelerate the collapse of state authority. Between 2020 and 2022 in the five countries mentioned above, the number of schools that were closed due to violence trebled, to 9,000. Half the region&#39;s children do not feel safe in school.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In Burkina Faso rival jihadist groups have made much of the country ungovernable. Towns are besieged. The government&#39;s efforts to vanquish the jihadists often make matters worse. Trucks carrying goods to jihadist-controlled areas must have a military escort, which may or may not be available. Jihadists block roads and plant bombs on bridges. All this gums up trade and makes remote areas even poorer. The government&#39;s inability to beat the jihadists infuriates nearly everyone: the country suffered two coups in 2022.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A similar dynamic afflicts the whole of the Sahel. Instability is infectious. Farmers displaced by climate change cross unmarked borders and spark clashes. Jihadists seek havens in neighbouring countries. Their ideas spread rapidly online and in radical madrassas.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Western powers have tried to help, but failed. In November 2022 France gave up on Operation Barkhane, a military intervention to help the governments of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger suppress jihadists. Earlier that year Mali&#39;s new military regime ordered French troops out and welcomed help from Russia&#39;s Wagner mercenary group, which has already been accused of massacring civilians.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Sebastian von Einsiedel of the United Nations University in Tokyo argues that the spread of jihadist groups makes it harder to end wars. Their demands are often impossible to meet, their footsoldiers are fanatical, and external mediators hate dealing with terrorists.</p><p class="article__body-text"><br><br></p><p class="article__body-text"> For rebel groups with no religious inspiration, mammon provides motive enough to take up arms. A study by James Fearon of Stanford University finds that civil wars in which a major rebel force earns money from illicit drugs or minerals tend to last longer. And the globalisation of crime has made it “easier than ever before” for such groups to get their hands on guns and cash, notes Mr von Einsiedel.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Government forces are often greedy, too. Among the reasons why Congo&#39;s war is “self-perpetuating”, argues Jason Stearns in his book “The War That Doesn&#39;t Say Its Name”, is that officers are paid a pittance but can make fortunes from embezzlement and extortion when deployed to combat zones. Locals complain about the “pompier-pyromane” (firefighter-pyromaniac) problem: regional strongmen who start a fire so the central government has to negotiate with them to put it out.</p><p class="article__body-text"> An extreme example of the links between crime and conflict is Haiti. In 2021 its president, Jovenel Moïse, was assassinated. No one knows who ordered the hit, but many suspect a link to the drug trade. The country has been in chaos since. Gangs that once dominated only slums now control much of the capital, Port-au-Prince. They have seized roads, market places and anywhere convenient for extorting money from terrified civilians. Joe, a school director who prefers to stay anonymous, describes how his school received a bullet in an envelope, with a demand for $50,000 protection money to keep classes open. “On the spot, we had to close the school until further notice,” he sighs. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Haiti&#39;s prime minister, Ariel Henry, is begging for a foreign military intervention to help the police restore order. Many locals would welcome it. Ralph Senecal, the boss of a private ambulance firm, who was kidnapped in October, says that only American troops can restore order. However, opposition groups fear that such an intervention would only prop up Mr Henry, who seized power after Moïse&#39;s death and is widely regarded as illegitimate.</p><p class="article__body-text"> One country in Asia illustrates all the ills that make civil wars endure. In an old wooden farm house near the Thai-Myanmar border, Ko Khaht is boiling chicken and rice. When it is cooked, he liquidises it, sucks it up with a syringe and feeds it to his injured comrade, who is missing part of his skull and cannot move or speak.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Myanmar is home to some of the world&#39;s oldest insurgencies, and some of the newest. Ko Khaht belongs to the People&#39;s Defence Force ( <small>pdf</small> ), which was set up after a military junta seized power in 2021. It is the armed wing of the National Unity Government, a parallel state of activists, politicians and ethnic leaders that aims to restore democracy. He joined it after he saw soldiers murder a man in front of his home. He packed a small bag and fled to the Thai border, where he worked in a bomb-disposal unit. He has lost his right hand, and his skin is pockmarked by shrapnel.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Myanmar&#39;s strife is staggeringly complex. Perhaps 200 armed groups control slices of territory or are fighting to overthrow the government. Some are armies seeking autonomy for large ethnic groups; others are local militias trying to defend a single village. The country has not had a conflict-free year since independence in 1948. Even compared with this violent past, though, norms have atrophied in the past two years. “There&#39;s a new level of brutality, with the tone set at the top,” says Richard Horsey of Crisis Group.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In March a company calling itself the “Ogre column” was dropped into Sagaing, central Myanmar. They went on a killing, raping and torturing spree. But rebels say such atrocities only serve to strengthen their resolve.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Climate change is at work: the insurgency has gained strength in the central dry zone, which has been made poorer by drought. Crime, too, gives many fighters a reason to keep fighting. The army is deeply enmeshed in heroin and jade smuggling, as are some ethnic militias. Mr Horsey expects the war “to grind on for a generation to come”.</p><h2> No prayers nor bells</h2><p class="article__body-text"> The world is not short of ideas for how to end wars. Find a respected mediator. Start unofficial talks long before the belligerents are prepared to meet publicly. Include more women and civil-society groups in the peace process. Accept that any peace deal is likely to be ugly. “Excluding people you don&#39;t like from politics doesn&#39;t work,” notes David Miliband, the head of the <small>irc</small> . Purging the Iraqi army of all supporters of Saddam Hussein&#39;s regime was a mistake, as was trying to build a system in Afghanistan without the Taliban. But the most important measures (build functional states in war-torn countries, curb climate change) could take decades to implement.</p><p class="article__body-text"> And global efforts to promote peace are hobbled by the fact that two veto-wielding members of the <small>unsc</small> are serial human-rights abusers that object to interference in the internal affairs of blood-spattered regimes. Russia has used its <small>unsc</small> veto 23 times in the past decade, scotching resolutions to allow more aid into Syria, investigate war crimes in the Balkans and (of course) to uphold Ukraine&#39;s sovereignty. China has issued nine. America has issued three, mostly to protect Israel; France and Britain, none at all. In 2001-10, when Mr Putin&#39;s imperial ambitions were more limited and Xi Jinping was not yet in power, Russia issued only four vetoes; China, two.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A French proposal to suspend the veto when mass atrocities are occurring passed the <small>un</small> ’s general assembly last year, but has no way past Mr Putin&#39;s veto pen. The world is entering what Mr Miliband calls “an age of impunity”. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i><b>Correction</b> : an earlier version of this article mis-stated the affiliation of Solomon Hsiang and Edward Miguel.对不起。</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 17 Apr 2023 18:30:15 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/0qaucg442lot20b0irhk73s48vr7nddv</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/04/17/the-worlds-deadliest-war-last-year-wasnt-in-ukraine </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to survive a superpower split]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230415_IRD001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230415_IRD001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230415_IRD001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230415_IRD001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230415_IRD001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230415_IRD001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230415_IRD001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230415_IRD001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230415_IRD001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230415_IRD001.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 48en16">.css-48en16{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}</style><!-- --> <span class="css-48en16 e16qazw91">image: Mel Haasch</span> </figcaption></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">C</span> <small>aught between</small> America, China and <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2023/03/14/russias-friends-are-a-motley-and-shrinking-crew">Russia</a> , many countries are determined not to pick sides.

Our sister organisation, <small>eiu</small> , has analysed countries based on their economic and military ties to Moscow, their diplomatic stances including votes at the <small>un</small> and whether they support and implement sanctions. Although 52 countries comprising 15% of the global population—the West and its friends—lambast and punish Russia&#39;s actions, and just 12 countries laud Russia, some 127 states are categorised as not being clearly in either camp (see map). </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> To get a handle on what non-alignment really means <i>The Economist</i> has also looked at a narrower panel of the 25 biggest economies that have sat on the fence on the Ukraine war, or wish to remain non-aligned in the Sino-American confrontation, or both. The members of this group—call them the transactional 25 ( <small>t25</small> )—are hugely varied in terms of wealth and political systems, and include giant India and tiny Qatar. Yet they have some common ground. They are brutally pragmatic and have collectively become more powerful. Today they represent 45% of the world&#39;s population and their share of global <small>gdp</small> has risen from 11% in 1992 to 18% in 2023, more than the <small>eu&#39;</small> s <small>.</small> Their strategy of neutrality involves big risks and opportunities. Whether they succeed will influence the world order for decades. And needless to say, both America and China will work to win them over.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In the 20th century non-alignment meant different things to different countries at different times. At conferences in Bandung, Indonesia in 1955 and Belgrade, Yugoslavia in 1961, leaders presented a “third world” apart from the West and the Soviet bloc. From the late 1960s these countries increasingly focused on economic inequality between the “global south” (a less loaded term for the third world) and the industrial north. A formal institution, the Non-Aligned Movement, was joined by nearly every African, Asian and Latin American state. With the end of the cold war it became, in the words of an Indian academic, “a moribund organisation in need of a decent burial”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Today, non-aligned countries are not defined by their membership of an institution, but rather by their characteristics and behaviour. These middle powers are pragmatic and opportunistic. In a recent book Jorge Heine, a former Chilean diplomat, contends that in the 20th century countries often passively drifted into one or other of the superpowers&#39; orbits. Today there is more “active” evaluation of the best means to achieve particular ends, he says. Some call it “minilateralism” (as opposed to multilateralism)—the targeted use of discrete alliances or groupings, rather than lumping your lot in with one bloc.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Non-aligned countries also usually think Western leaders are hypocrites. Some $170bn in aid was pledged to Ukraine in the first year of the war—equivalent to about 90% of spending on all global aid in 2021 by the <small>oecd</small> ’s Development Assistance Committee, a group of 31 Western donors. To the West, such generosity shows solidarity with a fellow democracy; to others it shows that rich countries cough up if it serves their interests. “Europe has to grow out of the mindset that Europe&#39;s problems are the world&#39;s problems, but the world&#39;s problems are not Europe&#39;s problems,” declared Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India&#39;s foreign minister, last year. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Such stances are broadly in line with public opinion. A report by Cambridge University last year found that in liberal democracies 75% hold a negative view of China, and 87% do of Russia. But the picture is almost the reverse among the 6bn people who live elsewhere. A gap is opening up between how the West sees the world and how the rest sees it. In a poll published earlier this year by the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank, a plurality of Indians (48%) and most Turks (51%) said the future world order will be defined by multipolarity or non-Western dominance. Just 37% of Americans, 31% of people in <small>eu</small> states and 29% of Britons agreed. The West thinks it is watching a sequel of the cold war; the rest of the world sees an entirely new film.</p><h2> Wheeling and dealing</h2><p class="article__body-text"> So who makes up the <small>t25</small> ? The diverse group encompasses some of the world&#39;s most populous countries and two of its largest democracies, India and Indonesia, alongside Vietnam, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which are all run by autocrats of various flavours. Large wealth disparities exist, too. In Saudi Arabia <small>gdp</small> per person is more than $27,000, on a par with some European countries, while in Pakistan it still lingers around just $1,600. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1460/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1460/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/480/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/720/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/961/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/1441/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1537/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1921/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/2401/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/3074/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> As globalisation has spread, the trade pattern of the <small>t25</small> has become multipolar. Some 43% of merchandise trade is with the Western bloc, 19% with the China-Russia bloc and 30% with countries in neither of those camps (see chart). Perhaps unsurprisingly given its location, 77% of Mexico&#39;s total trade occurs with the West; over 60% of Israel&#39;s and Algeria&#39;s trade also does. More than a third of Chile&#39;s is with China, a higher share than any other <small>t25</small> country (but 40% of its trade involves the West). More than half of Argentina&#39;s trade, and almost half of India&#39;s, is with other non-aligned countries.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Arms imports also show a complex mesh of loyalties. India hedges its bets. Between 2018 and 2022 its main supplier was Russia, which provided 45% of its arms, but it got another 29% from Europe and is likely to seek more self-reliance, with help from America. India&#39;s rival China, which supplies its arch-enemy, Pakistan, is out of the question. Israel, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and South Africa look instead to America for the vast majority of their arms imports.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There is no coherent governing body that represents non-aligned countries and their interests. None is expected to emerge. Instead a variety of disparate organisations, such as the <small>g20</small> , provide platforms of varying effectiveness for the major non-aligned countries <small>.</small> The <small>brics</small> group of countries—Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa—is a forum for middle powers that wants to expand: it is discussing whether to let Iran and Saudi Arabia join.

For two decades many were able to simultaneously build relations with the West, China and Russia. No longer.

Sanctions on Russia saw energy and food prices soar globally, prompting a backlash across the non-Western world. More recently Janet Yellen, America&#39;s treasury secretary, has encouraged American companies to move their supply chains into friendly states. Investment shifts are under way (see chart). Beijing and Moscow, meanwhile, are drawing closer together. New research by the <small>imf</small> notes that since 2018 geopolitical alignment, measured by similarity in <small>un</small> voting patterns, has become ever more important in determining the location of foreign direct investment. Under the <small>imf</small> ’s scenarios for fractured trade, the impact in emerging markets could be more than twice as bad as in advanced ones.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But many in the non-aligned world bet that they can win from economic decoupling and political fragmentation, by hedging their relations between the big powers and by influencing other countries themselves. To understand this transactional strategy, look at the approach of some of the big countries caught in the middle. Brazil is a good case study. It opposes what Mauro Vieira, foreign minister, calls “automatic alignments”. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who began his second stint as Brazil&#39;s president in January, sees President Joe Biden as an ally on climate change; at their meeting in Washington, <small>dc</small> , in February they re-established joint environmental institutions abandoned under Jair Bolsonaro, Lula&#39;s predecessor. America classes Brazil as a “major non- <small>nato</small> ally”, a legal status that entitles enhanced co-operation with America&#39;s armed forces.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet Brazil is also hedging between the superpowers. Like others in its region, it has declined Western proposals to give old Russian-made equipment to Ukraine in exchange for new arms. <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/04/10/brazils-foreign-policy-is-hyperactive-ambitious-and-naive" data-tegid="tqfsuih1vhvl930gdrp2bbnhk7rhvokv">Lula&#39;s arrival in Beijing</a> on April 14th will underscore China&#39;s economic importance. Trade between Brazil and China was nearly $153bn in 2022, a 37-fold increase in two decades. Partly this reflects how Brazil took advantage of tit-for-tat <small>us</small> -China tariffs to increase agricultural exports to China at America&#39;s expense.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Brazil is also making forays of its own. Lula will soon visit Africa to revive Brazil&#39;s influence there. During his first stint in office, trade with Africa rose from $6bn in 2003 to $25.6bn in 2012, and South Africa was welcomed into the <small>brics</small> bloc. Then Lula&#39;s predecessor made no visits to Africa. Lula evidently thinks it worthwhile to renew the effort.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> India&#39;s fear of China has pushed it closer to the West in some respects. In March the prime minister of Japan, which like India, America and Australia, belongs to the “Quad”, an Indo-Pacific security forum, visited Delhi in a landmark visit. In the 2021-22 financial year India&#39;s trade with America overtook that with China. Yet India still purchases weapons and cheap oil from Russia and is unlikely to break its longstanding ties unless Vladimir Putin&#39;s regime were to use nuclear weapons.</p><h2> Practical, not partisan</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Like Brazil, India is asserting itself more abroad: only China imports and exports more with sub-Saharan Africa. The average annual stock of <small>fdi</small> from India was $0.8bn in 2004 to 2008 (less than half of Sweden&#39;s) but $31bn a decade later (more than Germany&#39;s and Japan&#39;s combined). Last month India hosted representatives from 31 African countries for war games. India promises to use its chair of the <small>g20</small> this year to be the “voice of the global south”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Turkey also wants more clout across the global south. It has security agreements with 30 African states and its defence exports to Africa rose more than five-fold from 2020 to 2021. Advisers to Turkey&#39;s president say the “New Turkey” can select its partners. That may explain its ostensible neutrality over the war in Ukraine, which Turkey has used to leverage its ties to Russia. Turkish exports to Russia reached $7.6bn in 2022, a 45% increase on the previous year. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Saudi Arabia is reducing its reliance on its historical ally, America, by tilting towards China, which is now the kingdom&#39;s largest trading partner. Consider decisions this month and in October by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which Saudi Arabia dominates, to slash oil production. Last month Saudi Arabia signed a Chinese-brokered deal with Iran and joined the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, a Eurasian talking shop. China says it wants to establish a free-trade deal with the Gulf “as soon as possible”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Gulf countries&#39; relations with Africa were once confined to energy, agriculture and the politics of the Horn of Africa. Today Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates hunt for minerals deals; <small>dp</small> World, a Dubai-based ports operator, is emerging as a critical logistics firm on the continent; and Qatar is playing novel diplomatic roles. Last month it was involved in brokering the release of Paul Rusesabagina, a jailed Rwandan dissident (and the inspiration for the film “Hotel Rwanda”).</p><p class="article__body-text"> African countries have long looked to both superpowers. The West has generally been their preferred source of “software”: support for schooling, health and, should a government want it, human rights. China offers “hardware”: bridges, roads, ports—and the loans to build them. Between 2007 and 2020 America&#39;s main development agency lent less than a tenth of the total of China&#39;s two major development banks ($1.9bn v $23bn) for sub-Saharan African infrastructure projects.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In some parts of Africa the West&#39;s promises to ensure security have rarely seemed as hollow. “Americans need somewhere for their troops and agents to sleep. But the security relationship does nothing for development,” explains a former adviser to an African president. “That&#39;s why we need China.” In August the last French troops left Mali after a nine-year deployment; the Wagner Group, comprising Russian mercenaries, now helps prop up the ruling junta.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The non-aligned countries want to avoid taking sides. But the big powers, America and China, are keen to draw them into their orbit. Beijing sees asserting leadership of the global south as a way of bolstering its resistance to American pressure. It positions itself as a model for others within a broad family of developing countries. It draws a contrast with the West, which it says prefers smaller clubs (like the <small>g7)</small> . “China shows up where and when the West will not,” says Yemi Osinbajo, Nigeria&#39;s outgoing vice-president.</p><h2> Eastern friends, western pals</h2><p class="article__body-text"> China is the main trading partner of around 120 countries and the lender of first and last resort for many. Between 2007 and 2020 it provided more infrastructure financing in sub-Saharan Africa than the next eight lenders combined. It will be pivotal to resolving sovereign-debt crises. Analysis of 73 developing countries by the <small>imf</small> notes that in 2006 China held just 2% of this group&#39;s external debts, with the mostly Western “Paris club” group of creditors accounting for 28%. By 2020 the respective shares were 18% and 10%.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Those in the West have reason to roll their eyes. China&#39;s “win-win” rhetoric masks its ruthlessness. “Banking on Beijing” (2022), by Bradley Parks of AidData, a research outfit, and co-authors, shows how China uses its economic tools for political ends. It often skews its funding towards incumbent leaders&#39; home districts—and is more likely than the West to lend to corrupt and autocratic countries. AidData also finds that a 10% increase in voting similarity with Beijing at the <small>un</small> is associated with an increase in Chinese projects in that country. Chinese loans come with unusually strict clauses on confidentiality and collateral. But Chinese development projects are associated with boosts to <small>gdp</small> per person, notes Mr Parks.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In the face of China&#39;s efforts, America and its allies are trying to recalibrate their message to the non-aligned world. America understands that other countries&#39; consent bestows legitimacy on the international order it leads. “Countries don&#39;t want to choose, and we don&#39;t want them to,” Jake Sullivan, Mr Biden&#39;s national security adviser, told the <i>Washington Post</i> earlier this year. America is pursuing diplomacy in places it has neglected. Kamala Harris, America&#39;s vice-president, Ms Yellen and Antony Blinken, its secretary of state, have all visited Africa in 2023. Mr Biden will soon follow.</p><p class="article__body-text"> America has also bolstered security partnerships with influential non-aligned countries. In November Lloyd Austin, its defence secretary, met his Indonesian counterpart for the fourth time; in January American and Indian officials agreed to deepen co-operation on cutting-edge defence technologies. In total America maintains 88 defence “partnerships” (excluding formal alliances such as its one with <small>nato</small> ), though some are limited in scope.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Though America and the <small>eu</small> have in recent years launched rival schemes to the <small>bri</small> , the perception remains that, if you want infrastructure that can help transform your economy, your first call is to Beijing. After Ms Harris released a soundtrack featuring African artists to accompany her recent visit to the continent, one senior African official noted, dryly, that Chinese visitors bring loans and engineers while Americans bring playlists.</p><h2> A political paradox</h2><p class="article__body-text"> The Biden administration is widely seen as embracing a two-tier foreign policy: first come relations with its core democratic allies in Europe and Asia (which it hopes might one day include India)—and then those with creaking global institutions. These mediate meet the needs of a broader group of countries, including most non-aligned ones, whether on development, debt relief, security or finance.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That presents three challenges. First, Western unity must hold. Yet that is not a given. During his recent visit to China Emmanuel Macron, France&#39;s president, said that Europe&#39;s states should not become “followers” of American policy on Taiwan, nor “adapt to the American rhythm”. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The second is that China can undermine global institutions by, for instance, opting for bilateral debt relief rather than fully participating in co-ordinated efforts. Chinese creditors&#39; obstinacy at the <small>imf</small> is hampering what flexibility it can offer to countries struggling with debt.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The final challenge concerns the mistrust of the West that is fed by its broken promises. Take climate finance, for example. In 2009 rich countries said they would channel $100bn to poorer ones per year by 2020; the annual total has never been higher than $85bn.</p><p class="article__body-text"> By drawing on their liberal values and shared history, America and its allies were able to rally behind Ukraine after Russia&#39;s invasion. They have shown newfound resolve against authoritarian China, too. The risk is that this coming together deepens the estrangement of the global south from the international order. It would be a tragic result if, in uniting the West, America alienates the rest. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i><b>Correction (April 12th)</b> : The map in this piece was changed to sort an error in the categorisation of some countries.</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 11 Apr 2023 20:45:15 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/d94s2un3ibdoij5fo94f5hiititutgf4</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/04/11/how-to-survive-a-superpower-split </item><item><title><![CDATA[Was your degree really worth it?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Male students at the University of Greenwich posing for pictures on graduation day in the grounds of the Old Royal Naval College in London.

In most places, for most learners, the financial returns to higher education remain extremely healthy. Yet undertaking a degree has become riskier. The rewards for the best performers are increasing, but a troublingly high share of students see negative returns from their studies.</p><p class="article__body-text"> New data sets, such as tax records, are illuminating this dispersion like never before. They can track how much students taking specific courses, at specific institutions, earn in later life. In time that detail will help students avoid the worst pay-offs and seize the best. Choice of subject and timely graduation matter hugely; choice of institution somewhat less so. It could also be useful to governments tempted to crack down on “low-value degrees”. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> A boom in graduate earnings began in the 1980s in the rich world. Back then the difference between the salaries of people who gain at least a bachelor&#39;s degree and those who do not—commonly called the “college-wage premium”—began to soar. In the 1970s an American with a university education was earning on average 35% more than a high-school graduate.

And in places that actually charge students for their degrees, costs have gone up (see chart 1). Tuition in England has soared from nothing in the late 1990s to £9,250 ($11,000) a year, the highest in the rich world. In America, the out-of-pocket fee paid by an average bachelor&#39;s-degree student increased from $2,300 a year in the 1970s to some $8,000 in 2018, in real terms, according to Jaison Abel and Richard Deitz at the New York Federal Reserve. (Students at public universities often pay much less; those at private non-profits can pay a lot more.)</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet the average degree remains valuable. In 2019 Mr Abel and Mr Deitz roughly estimated the annual financial return on the money that a typical American invests in a bachelor&#39;s degree. They conclude that the typical rate of return for a bachelor&#39;s degree is around 14%. That has dropped from a peak of 16% in the early 2000s. But it is still a princely sum. And it is well above the 8-9% that American graduates were recouping in the 1970s, before graduate wages, and tuition fees, began to soar. These calculations include not only fees but also the money individuals might expect to earn if they were working full-time instead.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The average hides a very wide range of outcomes, however. Until recently economists seeking to identify the winners and losers were mostly limited to surveys. The trend now is for governments, such as those of Britain and Norway, to proffer hefty, anonymised databases showing actual earnings for millions of university-goers. That makes it much easier to compare people like-for-like. The disaggregated data reveal that a high share of students graduate with degrees that are not worth their cost.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In England 25% of male graduates and 15% of female ones will take home less money over their careers than peers who do not get a degree, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies ( <small>IFS</small> ), a research outfit. America has less comprehensive data but has begun publishing the share of students at thousands of institutions who do not manage to earn more than the average high-school graduate early on. Six years after enrolment, 27% of students at a typical four-year university fail to do so, calculate researchers at Georgetown University in Washington, <small>dc</small> . In the long tail, comprising the worst 30% of America&#39;s two- and four-year institutions, more than half of people who enroll lag this benchmark. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Dropping out without any qualification is an obvious way to make a big loss. Taking longer than usual to graduate also destroys value (because it eats up years that might otherwise have been spent earning full-time). Both these outcomes are common. Across the rich world less than 40% of people studying for undergraduate degrees complete their courses in the expected number of years. About one-quarter still have no qualifications three years after that. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/701/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/701/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/231/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/346/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/461/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/692/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/738/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/922/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1153/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1476/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Choosing the right subject is crucial to boosting earning power. Negative returns are likeliest for Britons who study creative arts (less than 10% of men make a positive return), social care and agriculture (see chart 2). By far the best-earning degrees in America are in engineering, computer science and business. Negative returns seem especially likely for music and the visual arts. Using America&#39;s available data to guess lifetime earnings by programme is a stretch. But Preston Cooper at <small>freopp</small> , a think-tank, ventures that more than a quarter of bachelor&#39;s-degree programmes in America will lead to negative returns for most enrolled students.</p><p class="article__body-text"> What you study generally matters more than where you do it. That comes with caveats: the worst colleges and universities provide students with little value, whatever they teach. But on average people who enroll in America&#39;s public universities get a better return over their lifetimes than students who go to its more prestigious private non-profit ones, reckon the Georgetown researchers. High fees at the non-profits is one of the reasons why.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Earnings data in Britain call into question the assumption that bright youngsters will necessarily benefit from being pushed towards very selective institutions, says Jack Britton of the <small>ifs</small> . In order to beat fierce competition for places, some youngsters apply for whatever subject seems easiest, even if it is not one that usually brings a high return. Parents fixated on getting their offspring into Oxford or Cambridge, regardless of subject, should take note. But there is also evidence that tackling a high-earning course for the sake of it can backfire. Norwegian research finds that students whose true desire is to study humanities, but who end up studying science, earn less after ten years than they probably otherwise would have.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Men have more reason than women to worry that their investments in higher education will be a bust. That is because they have a higher chance of earning well without a degree. University is a risk for those with mediocre school grades as they often earn less after graduation than better-prepared peers who hold the same degrees.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> In Britain the return from a degree is generally higher for South Asian students than for white ones, as they tend to study subjects such as business, and generally lower for black students (compared with what people of the same race typically earn if they do not go to university). In America, Asian students seem to have the least trouble paying off their student debts, compared with white and black students.</p><h2> Marks and markets</h2><p class="article__body-text"> What are the implications of all this analysis? Already there are signs that the higher-education market is evolving. People are already searching out better returns of their own accord at different educational stages. In America the number of degrees conferred annually in English and in history fell by around one-third between 2011 and 2021. The number of degrees in computer science more than doubled in that time (see chart 3). Others are skipping college altogether. The number of people enrolling has fallen every year since 2011. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Institutions are also shifting by culling humanities. In February the trustees of Marymount University in Virginia voted to abolish majors in nine subjects including English, history, philosophy and theology. Calvin University in Michigan and Howard University in Washington, <small>dc</small> are among those which have abandoned classics. And archaeology&#39;s future at the University of Sheffield in Britain looks precarious.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Employers are adapting, too. Firms are becoming a bit less likely to demand that job applicants have degrees, according to analysis by Joseph Fuller of Harvard Business School, and others. Tight labour markets and a desire for more diverse workers help explain why. A few years ago some 80% of the jobs that <small>ibm</small> , a tech giant, advertised in America required a degree, says Kelli Jordan, one of its vice-presidents. Now it is about half. “A degree does not have to be the only indicator of skills that someone may have,” explains Ms Jordan.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Should governments amplify these trends? In Estonia one-fifth of an institution&#39;s funding depends on meeting a variety of targets; one relates to the share of students graduating on time. Similar systems exist in Finland, Israel, Lithuania and Sweden. Australia&#39;s government is trying to encourage learners to make socially useful choices. In 2021 it doubled what undergraduates pay to study social sciences, political science or communications and halved the fee for nursing and teaching. Students do not appear much moved yet, possibly because of the generosity of Australia&#39;s student-debt repayment terms. Britain&#39;s government reckons it can alter behaviour by giving everyone in England an online account listing a maximum cash sum that they are entitled to borrow from the state for studies over their lifetime. The idea is to make school-leavers more parsimonious.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Others still splurge. President Joe Biden hopes that the Supreme Court will soon approve a plan, announced last year, to write off a big chunk of America&#39;s student loans. He also wants a more lenient repayment system. The associated costs could mount to hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade. Mr Biden also promises an official list of “low-financial value” courses. More compelling is talk of preventing feeble programmes from benefitting from federal student loans. But without an act of Congress this would mainly affect for-profit colleges (which enroll only a fraction of America&#39;s learners).</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> To many, a growing focus on the financial returns to higher education is crude. Graduates in public service are bound to earn less than those on Wall Street. Many disciplines are worth studying for their own sake. Yet students frequently tell pollsters that improving their earning power is a priority. Good returns are vital to the poorest learners, for whom the financial burden of degrees is highest. Today bad degrees are surprisingly common.更好的信息、市场力量和更明智的政策相结合可以减少它们的流行。 <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 03 Apr 2023 19:35:32 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /内容/secl4nn7ck4s11bq7n29mjh0mbb312s1</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/04/03/was-your-degree-really-worth-it</item></channel></rss>
