e190yofl0">乌克兰外交部长米特罗·库莱巴 ( <span>D</span> <small>MYTRO KULEBA)</small>是一位圆滑、和蔼可亲的外交官，对最棘手的问题泰然自若。但8月31日，他的耐心崩溃了。他对记者说：“批评反攻步伐缓慢就等于……向每天牺牲生命的乌克兰士兵脸上吐口水。” “我建议所有批评者闭嘴，到乌克兰来，尝试自己解放一平方厘米。”这次爆发是由美国媒体连续几周的报道引发的，其中匿名官员对乌克兰在战场上进展缓慢提出了质疑，并质疑其军事策略。排的很不体面。但乌克兰的做法有效吗？</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">同盟国关于战略的争论并不罕见。在乌克兰于六月发动反攻之前的几个月里，美国和英国官员与乌克兰密切合作。他们提供情报和建议，进行详细的兵棋推演以模拟不同的攻击可能如何发挥作用，并帮助设计和训练获得大部分西方装备的旅。即便如此，乌克兰——因四月份发现的美国情报文件大泄露而感到刺痛——仍然保留了自己的立场。它推迟了进攻的开始，并将计划牢牢地藏在心里。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">争论的一大焦点是乌克兰在今年上半年做出的继续争夺巴赫穆特的决定，巴赫穆特是顿巴斯东部地区的一个城镇，战略意义有限，但却成为抵抗的有力象征。跟踪战争的罗尚咨询公司的康拉德·穆齐卡认为，乌克兰不惜一切代价保卫该镇的决定对随后的反攻产生了“重大影响”。乌克兰烧毁了其储存的炮弹，只有韩国决定通过美国提供更多炮弹才缓解了这个问题，而俄罗斯则赢得了时间在南部建立强大的防御工事——所谓的苏罗维金防线，以一名现已被解雇的俄罗斯人的名字命名。一般的。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">即使反攻开始后，争吵仍然持续。美国官员鼓励乌克兰将兵力集中在南部攻击的主轴上，即亚速海。相反，乌克兰将其兵力分散，目的是将俄罗斯人拉向更长的战线。最有经验的旅，大部分装备较旧的装备，被留在巴赫穆特，他们正在该镇的侧翼取得适度进展。一位消息人士称，政治在军事战略中发挥着无益的作用，巴赫穆特周围人脉广泛的旅获得的稀缺弹药份额比单纯的军事考虑所保证的要多。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">与此同时，乌克兰在更重要的南轴部署了经验不足的旅，装备了较新的装备。他们很快陷入了俄罗斯大炮、无人机和直升机覆盖的密集雷区。未经考验的指挥官犯了一系列错误，例如撞上友军地雷和错误地发动攻击。俄罗斯武装部队专家迈克尔·科夫曼（Michael Kofman）和罗布·李（Rob Lee）在《岩石战争》上发表的一篇文章中写道：“如果经验丰富的乌克兰旅配备了新装备，他们可能就不会犯新旅所犯的许多错误。”一本在线日记。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">早期失误的部分责任应归咎于那些帮助策划反攻的人。伦敦智库皇家联合服务研究所 ( <small>RUSI</small> ) 的杰克·沃特林 (Jack Watling) 和尼克·雷诺兹 (Nick Reynolds) 在最近发表的一篇论文中认为，这次攻击在一定程度上依赖于过时的假设，这些假设没有考虑到新型传感器和传感器带来的威胁。无人机。他们的结论是：“支持乌克兰国际合作伙伴试图训练乌克兰军队采用的战术的大部分数据都是基于 20 世纪的作战分析，而这些分析与乌克兰使用的一系列技术并不相抗衡。”俄罗斯的防御工事也比西方规划者想象的要坚固得多。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">无论哪里出了问题，很明显哪里出了问题。 “基辅似乎没有可以在袭击停止的情况下迅速实施的应急计划，”穆兹卡先生指出。最终，乌克兰指挥官决定保留重型装甲，转而采用更简单的方法。成群的工兵通常用肚子爬行，现在用手清理雷区。排和连，而不是旅，在林线之间作战，徒步前进，以达到较小的目标。 <small>RUSI</small>论文指出，这有助于限制人员和装备的损失，但每五天只能前进 700 至 1,200 米，让俄罗斯军队有时间“重置”他们的防御（这一速度最近可能有所回升） 。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这引发了两场争论。一是乌克兰指挥官是否过于规避风险。一些西方官员认为，如果乌克兰按照计划进行更大胆、更大规模的袭击，他们一开始的伤亡会更大，但突破俄罗斯防线的运气会更好，从而缩短攻势并减少总体伤亡。乌克兰官员反驳说，这只会导致更多流血，军官们不能指望一支严重耗尽的公民军队会模仿俄罗斯的人海袭击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">第二个争论是乌克兰应该效仿西方的战争方式还是开辟自己的道路。西方武装部队推崇联合兵种机动的理念，即装甲部队的行动与步兵、炮兵、防空以及（越来越多的）电子和网络攻击同步。乌克兰军队在德国接受的五周进攻前训练还不足以让他们精通此类战争。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “乌克兰人仍然受苏联教义的束缚，”一位美国官员抱怨道。重型炮火取代了更明智和精确的攻击，是紧张局势的根源之一，尤其是因为美国在为乌克兰枪支采购弹药方面发挥着主导作用。这位官员表示：“他们的心态……和策略需要时间来改变。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><small>美国海军陆战队</small>退役炮兵军官、军事战术书籍作者 BA Friedman 表示，事实上，乌克兰的做法是符合目的的。 1918 年春，经过第一次世界大战西线多年的僵局，德国军队意识到大型部队太容易受到炮火的攻击。他们的解决方案是规模更小、更灵活、训练有素的“冲锋队”，他们可以越过敌方防线并夺取领土，重型部队随后上前。弗里德曼表示：“由于乌克兰没有能力在任何相关规模上使用空中力量，因此按照空中力量成熟之前的方式解决问题是完全有意义的。”许多欧洲军官承认，他们自己训练有素、装备精良的军队很难突破苏罗维金防线。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">关于战斗的战斗</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">弗里德曼表示，美国官员没有能力提供有关战术最佳实践的经验教训。他们最近的大部分战斗经验都是在山区或沙漠地区进行的，这些地区的小部队无法利用掩护以这种方式前进。他指出，美国地面部队的两个主要训练中心，即位于欧文堡的陆军训练中心和位于二十九棕榈村的海军陆战队训练中心，都位于加利福尼亚州的沙漠环境中。 “无论是在战斗中还是在训练中，<small>美军</small>在面对乌克兰所面临的情况时都缺乏经验。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">问题是：乌克兰也没有。沃特林和雷诺兹认为，过去 18 个月里军官的减员和乌克兰军队的急剧扩张意味着乌克兰缺乏足够的具有进攻行动专业知识的初级领导人。他们说，结果是决定被交给了更高级的军官，这让已经有很多事情要做的旅指挥部不堪重负。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px"

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">他们举了今年夏天早些时候乌克兰袭击顿涅茨克省里夫诺波尔村的例子。攻击者应该释放烟雾来掩盖他们的行动并迷惑敌人。但乌克兰的炮击任务中只有 3% 涉及烟雾，部分原因是高级指挥官不想让盘旋的无人机遮蔽他们对战斗的看法。教训是，乌克兰需要更多值得信赖的下级军官，即使他们的老板无法从远处观看，他们也能采取主动。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">培训质量也很重要。沃特林和雷诺兹认为，西方训练设施受到“<small>北约</small>安全文化”的阻碍。无人机是乌克兰战术的核心，它可以让炮兵部队发现目标，让步兵进行侦察。然而，大多数<small>北约</small>训练区对无人机的飞行时间和方式实行严格限制，担心它们会偏离航线。安全规则还意味着炮兵技能通常是在课程后期教授的。但在乌克兰，“没有准备好应对火炮的部队就没有做好战斗的准备，” <small>RUSI</small>分析师写道。欧洲的健康和安全规则不太适合国家生存之战。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这些问题大部分不会在当前的反攻中得到解决。如果乌克兰想要取得任何突破，最终将需要重新引入机械化和装甲部队。这可能会变得更容易：第一道防线之外的雷区密度较小。人们认为它有足够的弹药来度过整个秋天。但9月10日，美国最高将领马克·米利表示，乌克兰可能还剩下30到45天的战斗时间，之后雨水和泥浆将使车辆难以前进。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最近几周，乌克兰在南部取得了更快的进展，突破了俄罗斯在扎波罗热的Robotyne村周围三道防线中的第一道，通过向东推进到Verbove，然后向Novoprokopivka村进攻，扩大了由此产生的突出部（见地图）。俄罗斯被迫从其第 76 空中突击师投入重要后备力量；但它之所以能够承诺这些承诺，是因为乌克兰在八月份也投入了自己的承诺。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">目前尚不清楚双方还剩下多少新鲜人力。消耗率似乎有利于乌克兰而不是俄罗斯，但消息人士表示，俄罗斯可能仍然可以筹集足够的储备来填补漏洞。穆兹卡总结道：“除非俄罗斯防线崩溃，否则我们在过去三个月中看到的战斗很可能会在未来几个月继续出现。”他认为，只有部署更大规模的部队，超出乌克兰的能力，会加快速度。 <i>《经济学人》</i>咨询的数十名西方官员也对冬季之前能否取得重大突破表示怀疑。 “我们必须延长我们的时间表，”其中一位说道。 “这可能是一场非常漫长的斗争。” <span class="ufinish">■</span> </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt

e190yofl0">世界上没有哪个地方比旧金山湾区更能体现无法建造足够住房的问题。最主要的原因可以归结为“宁比主义”，即“不在我的后院”，即当地人抵制新开发的倾向。越来越多的运动正在试图解决这个问题。在索拉诺县建造一座新城市的秘密计划只是因比主义中比较古怪的部分之一，这是一场不断发展的运动，对发展说“是”，而不是“不”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><small>因比</small>认为，住房短缺主要是由控制谁可以建造什么以及在哪里建造的法律造成的。他们说，分区和规划法非常严格，以至于在许多地方建造新住房是完全非法的，而且几乎所有的建造过程都很缓慢、困难且昂贵。在过去十年左右的时间里，因比主义已经从少数经济学家和少数热心活动家的追求发展成为一场看似合理的政治运动，拥有数千名成员和分会，遍布美国、澳大利亚、英国和新西兰等国家。</p><p

41 套增加到 42 套，澳大利亚从 40 套增加到 41 套。在新西兰，人口增长超过了建设速度，房屋数量也增加了。每 100 名居民拥有的住房略有下降，降至 38 套。相比之下，在法国，这一数字在 2000 年已经达到 50 套，到 2020 年已上升至 55 套；德国从 47 增至 52，日本从 42 增至 49（见图 1）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs

e190yofl0">由于就业机会转移，全国范围内稳定的住房与人口比例可以掩盖最热门的当地经济体日益严重的住房短缺问题。在加利福尼亚和伦敦等地，工资远高于美国和英国其他地方，并且在过去十年中增长更快。但对于没有财产的工人来说，收益会被更高的租金吞噬（见图2）。美国国家经济研究局一月份公布的调查结果显示，对于拥有学位的工人来说，虽然生活在美国沿海大城市的工资溢价很高，但较高的生活成本意味着他们总体上的生活水平与他们的生活水平差不多。住在一个比较贫穷的城市。低技能工人的处境要糟糕得多，这意味着他们要搬出去腾出空间。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">加州的<small>Yimby</small>指出系统存在问题。尽管加州创造了大量高薪工作，但该州的人口仍在萎缩。考虑一下旧金山市一居室公寓的月租金中位数为 3,007 美元，即美国全职工作成年人税前收入中位数的 63%。然而，今年到目前为止，湾区只发放了建造 4,500 套新住房的许可证——相对于其人口而言，这个数字几乎不比中西部前重镇底特律多。德克萨斯州奥斯汀地区大约拥有湾区一半的人口，已发放了约 20,000 张。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">至少从 20 世纪 70 年代起，加州就一直试图控制开发。代表旧金山的州参议员斯科特·维纳 (Scott Wiener) 表示，该州的住房问题“规则是随着你的进展而制定的”。这个过程“需要数年时间，而且非常混乱，最终导致整个项目被毁坏或毁掉”。维纳先生是因比最早<small>的</small>政治家之一，他制定了新的州法律<small>SB35</small> ，该法律在他 2017 年上任后不久就获得通过。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>SB35</small>通过迫使不情愿的城市政府遵守国家主导的目标来鼓励更多的发展。这些设施已经存在了几十年，以促进新住房的建设。对于旧金山（这座城市，而不是整个都市区）来说，法定目标是到 2031 年建造 82,000 套住房。迄今为止实际建成的住房数量意味着该目标看起来遥不可及。维纳先生及其盟友通过的其他法律扩大了房主建造“附属住宅单元”或祖母房的权利，并限制了开发商在新建筑中提供大量免费停车位的规定。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">至少在政治的更高层面，因比主义现在实际上已成为加州的主流。 “有利于住房的政策就是有利于就业的政策，”旧金山市长伦敦·布里德 (London Breed) 7 月份在推特上写道。该州州长加文·纽瑟姆 (Gavin Newsom) 在竞选演讲中承诺建造 350 万套住房。在全州范围内，这些政客正在与当地政客（例如市议会成员和郊区领导人）进行越来越激烈的立法斗争，而后者通常决心不再建造更多建筑。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">因比主义在其他地方也很普遍。今年，纽约州州长凯西·霍楚尔（Kathy Hochul）提出了一项激进的“升级分区”计划（未成功），批准在特定地区提高住房密度。她认为，该法案将允许在十年内再建造 800,000 套房屋，主要是在纽约市郊区的火车站周围建造更多公寓。在加拿大，反对党保守党领袖皮埃尔·普利耶夫希望联邦政府能够迫使市政当局允许更多的住房建设。英国两大主要政党均表示，他们希望建造更多房屋，无疑是考虑到明年的选举。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而建造住房仍然极其棘手。支持住房的压力团体加州<small>Yimby</small>的联合创始人布莱恩·汉隆 (Brian Hanlon) 表示，问题在于“我们都是英国城镇规划体系的继承者，这是灾难性的”。在英国，1909 年的《城市规划法》首次对土地所有者在其财产上进行建设的权利进行了广泛的监管，随后又于 1947 年通过《城乡规划法》大幅扩展。在美国，20 世纪 20 年代和 1930 年代，大多数城市地区都通过了“分区”法。 “当爱尔兰获得独立时，我们几乎复制了英国所做的一切，”都柏林的住房经济学家罗伯特·托兰说。其中包括爱尔兰 1963 年制定的规划法案。新西兰于 1953 年制定了城镇和乡村规划法案，以英国的规划法案命名。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在许多英语国家，受到维多利亚时代对“贫民窟”担忧的启发，规划法倾向于优先考虑独立式住宅。对于埃比尼泽霍华德等城市规划者来说，密度被视为类似于拥挤。在拥挤的工业热点地区，“低区划”和贫民窟清理被用来夷平城市并强行分散。作家乔治·奥威尔对这一进程持怀疑态度：“如果人们要生活在大城市，他们就必须学会互相生活，”他宣称。但他认为英国的许多工人并不“喜欢公寓”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如今，住在公寓里的英语国家公民比其他地方少得多。在英格兰，现在 80% 的人居住在独立屋中，只有 6% 的人居住在三层以上的公寓中。在法国，44% 的人住在公寓里，而不是独立屋。在都柏林、洛杉矶和悉尼等城市，道路的扩张已经耗尽。在法律允许的密度下，市中心合理通勤范围内的几乎所有土地都已经“建成”。相反，新的小区建在不同的城镇，距离核心区可能有 50 或 60 英里，居民通常面临着驾车上班的痛苦。 （在英国，这些工人通常会跳过城市周围的“绿化带”，而城市内的建筑大多是非法的。）</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">去年夏天，旧金山的平均建筑成本约为每平方英尺 440 美元（这个数字远远高于美国其他地方）。但房屋售价大约是这个数字的两倍。在英格兰南部，一英亩农田的价格可能高达 15,000 英镑（19,000 美元）。获得规划许可的一英亩土地的价值至少是这个数字的 60 倍。这意味着，给予开发商建造许可，大笔一挥就能创造巨大的价值。然而这种情况并没有发生，主要是因为通过规划系统，当地居民和政治团体通常能够阻止任何开发。旨在规范开发的规则，例如环境审查、设计咨询、停车要求等，实际上是为了阻止开发。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">砖房</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">邻比主义有很多起源。最明显的是，房主希望保护其财产的价值。只允许在大片土地上建造独立式住宅（一种分区）是阻止穷人搬进富裕社区的有效方法。在美国，20 世纪 60 年代和 1970 年代采用分区以及收紧分区的背后都存在种族主义动机。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如今，人们更有可能担心新住房会使交通恶化，或者他们的观点会被破坏，或者新邻居会令人讨厌，或者公共服务不会扩大以满足额外的需求。这一切都强烈激励现有居民组织起来反对新的开发项目。相比之下，那些住在尚未建成的房屋中的人没有发言权。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">即使大多数<small>Yimby</small>也不认为开发商应该拥有不受限制的权利，可以在任何地方建造任何东西。第二次世界大战后的几十年里，许多国家的过度热心的规划者摧毁了整个社区。但自那以后，钟摆已经向另一个方向摆动得太远了。 2021 年，在伦敦东部的贝斯纳尔格林，高等法院封锁了 291 栋房屋，部分原因是为了拯救一棵桑树。在华盛顿<small>特区</small>，<small> </small>今年早些时候，一个建于 20 世纪 60 年代的地面停车场被裁定为一家历史悠久的银行的组成部分，因此任何在此基础上进行建设的计划都将受到严格的额外审查。 1月份，在爱尔兰都柏林，高等法院因各种原因阻止了近1,600套住宅的开发。但值得注意的是，此举保护了一对“引人注目的砖拱门”免遭拆除。

Broockman）碰巧是伯克利分校的政治学家，他认为，尽管建筑带来了巨大好处，但宁比主义常常获胜。这是因为项目的相关方在如何分享允许该项目所创造的价值方面存在争论。一些人希望将其用于补贴经济适用房；有些人想要环境保护；有些人想要保护环境；有些人想要更漂亮的建筑；有些人想要缴税。 “每个群体的要求都太多了，”布鲁克曼先生说。他总结道，最终的结果是什么都没有做，每个人的境况都变得更糟。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yimbyism 能够提供帮助吗？近年来，加州的住房建设有所增加：去年该州建造的房屋数量超过了 2008 年以来的任何一年。这在一定程度上要归功于因比<small>(Yimby)</small>的适度改革。在洛杉矶地区，附属住宅单元的建设蓬勃发展。通常，这些建筑建在现有房屋的花园中。自 2017 年以来，全州范围内已批准建造约 60,000 套房屋，到 2022 年，它们将占所有已建造房屋的七分之一；其中大部分已在洛杉矶地区设立。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，总体建设水平仍然太低，无法让加州再次真正负担得起。最大的问题是最近的改革是否能带来更多。今年 5 月，这位社会主义骑自行车市长的家乡埃默里维尔被加利福尼亚州指定为 482 个正式“支持住房”城市中仅有的 22 个城市之一，这意味着该市计划大幅超出规定的建设目标。这座城市夹在伯克利和奥克兰之间，距旧金山市中心约半小时车程，计划在未来八年内建造 3,687 套新住宅。这大约相当于每两个现有单元对应一个新单元。但许多其他地方正在违反法律要求来规划更多的住房。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">显而易见的是，允许建设确实会降低租金。活动人士指出，在一个地方，它已经产生了可衡量的巨大影响。 2016年，新西兰议会通过了奥克兰市的全面升级分区计划。奥克兰大学经济学家瑞安·格林纳威-麦克格雷维（Ryan Greenaway-McGrevy）分析了这些数据，他表示，结果是建筑数量大幅增加。 2010 年至 2021 年间，获准建造的新房数量从 2,500 套增加到 15,000 套。当然，与许多其他国家一样，新西兰早在 2010 年就正在应对全球金融危机的影响。在城市中，可以容纳许多居民的智能公寓楼很快取代了 20 世纪 60 年代日渐衰落的独立式住宅。房主们发现他们的土地价值不断上涨，因为现在可以重新开发土地。但与新西兰其他地区不同，租一套房子的成本已经下降。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">要消除数十年的供应不足需要付出很大的努力。在英国，智库城市中心今年发表的一项研究估计，与其他欧洲国家建造的房屋数量相比，该国缺少 430 万套住房。美国2015年的一项研究表明，美国最大城市每年因限制发展而付出的成本占<small>GDP</small>的9%以上。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但随着成本的上升，建筑的潜在好处也在增加。硅谷最富有的科技投资者能否利用这一点还有待观察。索拉诺县的现有居民已经准备好抵制“永远的加州”。更多的政治家应该关注埃默里维尔的鲍特斯先生并效仿他的榜样。就鲍特斯先生而言，他只是希望每个人都花更少的时间说话，花更多的时间建设。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div>

份。但现在不再了。弹头数量半年更新一次也已停止。自2020年3月以来，未再进行过现场检查。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">目前，俄罗斯和美国仍然遵守该条约对弹头数量的限制。他们还根据之前的协议交换即将发射弹道导弹的通知（近几个月他们只交换了一些此类信息）。他们仍然通过单独的多边渠道相互听取意见，这些渠道用于十几个需要通过<small>NRRC</small>进行通知的协议。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs

e190yofl0">人类避免了毁灭在很大程度上要归功于美国和苏联（现在的俄罗斯）之间的许多协议，这些协议限制核武器并建立信任，尽管双方都保留了摧毁对方的手段。他们将全球核库存从 1986 年的 70,400 枚弹头减少到今天的 12,500 枚（见图表）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">那个时代正在结束，原因有四个：美国放弃协议、俄罗斯入侵乌克兰、中国的核建设和颠覆性技术。从美国开始。 2002 年，乔治·W·布什总统因朝鲜和伊朗的威胁而退出了《反弹道导弹条约》（该条约限制了反导防御）。 2019 年，另一位共和党总统唐纳德·特朗普以俄罗斯的欺骗和中国的崛起为由，退出了《 <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/02/01/america-withdraws-from-the-intermediate-range-nuclear-forces-treaty">中程核力量条约》</a> （该条约取消了此类导弹）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">民主党总统对军备控制更加热衷。 <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/01/30/the-world-is-facing-an-upsurge-of-nuclear-proliferation">新的<small>开始</small></a>是由巴拉克·奥巴马(Barack Obama)谈判达成的，然后由乔·拜登(Joe拜登)在2021年续签五年。它将双方的“战略”核武器(具有高破坏力的远程武器)限制在1,550枚部署的弹头和700枚部署的洲际弹道导弹<small>(ICBM)</small> s)、轰炸机和潜射弹道导弹。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但新<small>起点</small>不控制“非战略”或“战术”武器，通常是用于战场的较小武器。俄罗斯被认为拥有 1,800 枚，而美国只有 200 枚。它也没有记录俄罗斯在核推进巡航导弹和鱼雷等方面的工作。反过来，俄罗斯抱怨英国和法国这两个美国盟友的核武库被排除在外，两国各自拥有超过 200 枚弹头。新<small>合同</small>将于 2026 年 2 月到期，后续交易的可能性很小。在不到三年的时间里，对世界核储备的最后一个主要限制很可能被取消。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这要归咎于俄罗斯入侵乌克兰以及<a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2022/09/29/could-the-war-in-ukraine-go-nuclear">一再威胁</a>使用核武器。西方国家武装了乌克兰，但没有派遣自己的军队，部分原因是担心“第三次世界大战”。俄罗斯二月份表示将“暂停”新的<small>启动</small>，停止通知。美国在三月和六月<a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/03/30/perils-grow-as-america-and-russia-stop-sharing-data-on-nukes">做出了同样的回应</a>。此后，双方对对方的姿态都变得越来越不确定，从而放大了核边缘政策的风险——尤其是在克里姆林宫处于战争状态的时候。波兰称俄罗斯已开始向白俄罗斯运送战术武器。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然后是中国，它已经在竞相建设<a href="https://www.economist.com/china/china-seeks-to-join-the-nuclear-big-league/21806104">核力量</a>。它不受条约约束，长期以来一直奉行拥有数百枚弹头的“最低威慑”政策。但五角大楼估计，到 2035 年，其库存可能会增加到 1,500 枚。这接近“新<small>起点”</small>的部署极限。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">核紧张局势可能会不可预测地进一步蔓延。印度与中国的边界争端尚未解决，因此可能会觉得有必要增加其弹头库存，目前估计有超过 160 枚弹头。这反过来可能会促使拥有类似数量的巴基斯坦进行建设。朝鲜大约拥有 30 枚弹头，正在密集测试<small>洲际弹道导弹</small>。而伊朗已经成为一个有核国家的门槛。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">新技术可能会使问题变得更加严重。高超音速导弹比弹道导弹更难被发现和击落。传感器和准确性的改进加剧了人们对突然袭击致残的担忧。人工智能（ <small>AI</small> ）的传播引发了这样的问题：核战争可以由计算机打到什么程度。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">作为回应，美国一直亮出核武刀，尽管还没有完全惊动它。它的弹道导弹潜艇通常在长达数月的巡逻中不被发现，但最近已在世界各地浮出水面。 7月，<i>肯塔基号航空母舰</i>停泊在韩国釜山港，<i>田纳西号航空母舰</i>停靠在苏格兰的法斯兰。 5月，日本和韩国的海军指挥官在关岛附近登上了<i>缅因号航空母舰</i>。去年十月，<i>西弗吉尼亚号航空母舰</i>突然出现在阿拉伯海，这显然是向伊朗发出信号，欢迎美国中央司令部司令的访问。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “沉默的服务”不再沉默。美国印太潜艇部队司令、海军少将杰弗里·贾布隆对<i>《突破防御》</i>杂志表示：“如果不传达自己的能力，就无法形成可信的威慑力量。” “如果对手对具体威慑一无所知，那么它就不是威慑。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国希望向盟友保证，其“延伸威慑”——即使他们避免使用核武器，也能保护他们免受核攻击的承诺——依然强大。波兰和韩国的一些人希望美国在他们的国家储存<small>b</small> 61核重力炸弹。它已经反抗了。但展示“婴儿潮一代”潜艇可以作为对敌人的警告和对朋友的保证。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国正忙于通过新的地面、空中和海上系统对其核“三位一体”的所有三个支柱进行现代化改造。一个不言而喻的目标是加快核工业基础，以便在未来需要时能够生产更多武器。有些人想走得更远。劳伦斯·利弗莫尔实验室（Lawrence Livermore Laboratory）是一家由政府资助、主要设计核弹头的机构，三月份发表的一篇论文称，美国目前的核力量“仅勉强够用”。美国应该在新<small>起点</small>到期时通过“迅速上传”来扩大这一范围，部署目前储备的武器，例如<small>洲际</small>弹道导弹上的多弹头；在此之前，它应该展示这样做的能力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国的“上传能力”比俄罗斯更大。旨在尽量减少全球风险的美国科学家联合会计算出，根据目前部署的战略弹头总数约 1,670 枚（它使用与新<small>起点</small>不同的计数规则），美国可以在几年内部署 3,570 枚，而俄罗斯为 2,629。一些专家担心大国也可能恢复核武器试验，这一想法在特朗普时代就曾讨论过。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">拜登的国家安全顾问杰克·沙利文(Jake Sullivan)在谈到核平衡的“拐点”时宣称，美国准备“无条件”与俄罗斯和中国讨论军备控制问题。两人都不急于接受他的提议。鉴于在乌克兰遭受的惨重损失，俄罗斯要么过于愤慨，要么过于依赖核武器，以至于无法考虑达成新协议。就中国而言，它似乎对限制不感兴趣，可能直到它达到与美国平起平坐为止。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">事实上，对等一直是美俄之间军控的基础。但当涉及三种权力时，就很难达成一致。美国尤其担心俄罗斯和中国可能结盟反对它，因为两国已宣布建立“无限的友谊”并进行联合空中和海上巡逻。沙利文先生坚称，美国不需要“数量超过我们竞争对手的总和”来阻止他们。然而，美国智库卡内基国际和平基金会的詹姆斯·阿克顿表示，美国增加其人数的压力可能是不可抗拒的。只要美国的瞄准政策仍停留在“反制力量”上——将核武器瞄准对方的核设施以压制它们——对手手中拥有更多武器就意味着美国也需要更多武器。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">世界毁灭者</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">布什领导下的前五角大楼负责政策的副部长埃里克·埃德尔曼(Eric Edelman)提出了不同的说法，他回顾了冷战时期关于承受第一次打击的能力并仍然能够对敌人造成不可接受的伤害的计算：“如果你有两个对手各拥有 1,500 件武器，其中一人发起攻击，你安然度过，然后进行报复：你还剩下什么储备来对付另一个对手？”他补充道：“我们还不知道正确的数字是多少，但可能在 1,550 以上。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">鉴于限制核武器的新条约前景黯淡，美国正在探索与中国达成不太正式的安排，以防止危机演变成冲突。例如，沙利文先生提议将与俄罗斯的热线和通知系统扩展到<small>联合国</small>安理会所有五个常任理事国。但中国的反应却令人沮丧。他这样总结道：“如果你在车里系上安全带，你就会被激励开得更快、更疯狂，然后你就会发生车祸。所以，从某种程度上来说，最好不要系安全带。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">控制人工智能的使用更加困难，因为它无法像<small>洲际弹道导弹</small>那样被看到和计算。即使<small>人工智能</small>可以帮助决策，美国、英国和法国也已推动制定一项规范，要求在使用核武器时始终应有“一个人参与其中”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国的<small>NRRC</small>人员仍然充足，有 40 多人在排队等候，希望华盛顿和莫斯科之间能有更好的时光。 “在关系良好的时期保持这条路线很重要；当紧张局势加剧时，这一点就更加重要，因为随着其他渠道紧张，误判的潜在影响也会增加，”一位美国官员表示。一位会说俄语的人随时待命。在一个更明智的世界里，也会有一个说中文的人。屏幕上<a

class="article__body-text"> 2013 年 8 月 21 日，阿萨德向古塔发射了<a href="/middle-east-and-africa/2013/08/24/if-this-isnt-a-red-line-what-is">装有沙林的火箭。</a>这是叙利亚内战中伤亡最惨重的一天。它<a href="/leaders/2013/04/27/acid-test">要求时任美国总统巴拉克·奥巴马(Barack Obama)</a>按照他的警告采取行动，即“我们的红线是我们开始看到一大堆化学武器被转移或使用。这会改变我的计算。”</p><p class="article__body-text">古塔事件发生十年后，奥巴马在叙利亚问题上的红线被人们铭记为他总统任期的决定性时刻。他没有立即发动袭击，而是首先决定要求国会投票，然后同意<a href="/middle-east-and-africa/2013/09/20/an-unlikely-band-of-brothers">如果俄罗斯介入</a>监督叙利亚的化学武器裁军，他将完全不采取行动。批评者认为，奥巴马不愿惩罚阿萨德削弱了美国的信誉，而且其后果至今仍在显现。</p><p class="article__body-text">时任法国总统弗朗索瓦·奥朗德上个月在接受英国<small>广播公司</small>采访时表示，这“对中东尤其不利。对于西方与俄罗斯之间的关系而言，这具有决定性意义。”早在2013年， <i>《经济学人》</i>就曾对奥巴马的选择表示遗憾，指责他“<a href="/leaders/2013/09/20/the-weakened-west">削弱了西方</a>”。但值得重新审视这一判断。尽管西方国家的信誉在过去十年中受到侵蚀是无可争议的，但向阿萨德发射巡航导弹却很难拯救它。它甚至可能无法使叙利亚人民免受进一步的神经毒气袭击。</p><p class="article__body-text">奥巴马的红线是一个奇怪的例子，它的政策纯属偶然，后来取得了辉煌的成功，却被视为历史性的失败。它提出了这样的问题：领导人可以——或者应该——在多大程度上将可信度置于其计划的中心。</p><p class="article__body-text">对于如此一丝不苟的政治家来说，奇怪的是奥巴马先生竟然无意中划下了他的<a href="/middle-east-and-africa/2012/08/25/more-than-they-can-chew">红线</a>。尽管这个词表明他在仔细权衡自己的选择后做出了最后通牒，但总统在 2012 年 8 月 20 日的白宫新闻发布会上谈到了如果叙利亚使用化学武器的后果，这让他的助手们感到震惊。 。只有少数新闻媒体真正报道了他的言论，也许是因为官员们匆忙通报说，政府仍然不太可能干预叙利亚。</p><p class="article__body-text">官员们来得太晚了。美国政府内部和国外（包括伦敦）的许多人希望美国使用军事力量阻止阿萨德每天犯下暴行。他们抓住了奥巴马先生的话。 “它会立即引爆，”奥巴马前官员、美国中东政策新史《大妄想》一书的作者史蒂文·西蒙 (Steven Simon) 说。 “这上面没有安装延时保险丝。” </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HQhKnW2uWv8?enablejsapi=1" class></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text"> What&#39;s more, Mr Obama himself wavered. In December 2012 and March 2013 Mr Assad was accused of using chemical weapons against his people. On the first occasion Mr Obama called such weapons “totally unacceptable”, on the second “a game-changer”. Yet, having thus built up expectations, three weeks after Ghouta, the president suddenly denied that his credibility was at stake, saying, “I didn&#39;t set a red line. The world set a red line.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> With hindsight, Mr Obama&#39;s error was to seem to want to have it both ways. The red-line formulation helped strengthen America&#39;s warning when Mr Assad appeared to be thinking about using nerve gas to terrorise his people. Yet, after the atrocity, the very firmness that made it a powerful threat also raised the cost of seeming to do too little. Theodore Roosevelt, America&#39;s 26th president, famously advised leaders to “speak softly and carry a big stick”. Mr Obama swapped noise for stick and paid a heavy price.</p><h2> The -um in ultimatum</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Except that, if Mr Obama&#39;s aim was to stop Syria using nerve gas, he also succeeded beyond expectations. A few weeks after the attack, Russia had a plan for international inspectors to oversee the dismantling of Syria&#39;s chemical-weapons programme, if America would not strike.</p><p class="article__body-text"> “The deal to bring Syria into the Chemical Weapons Convention ( <small>CWC</small> ) was one of the greatest non-proliferation achievements of the 21st century,” believes Gregory Koblentz, a chemical-weapon expert who teaches at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Syria had the Middle East&#39;s most advanced programme, which it had built to deter a conventional military attack by Israel. With Russia&#39;s encouragement, international help and the good offices of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( <small>OPCW</small> ), it destroyed 1,300 tonnes of weapons and precursor chemicals, 1,200 munitions and demolished 27 production facilities. Dr Koblentz points out that ten to 12 rockets had killed over 1,000 people on August 21st. Each carried around 50 litres of nerve agent weighing a little under 55kg. By comparison, he reckons, the nerve agents Syria destroyed may have weighed 1,000 tonnes—enough to attack Ghouta 1,800 times over.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The record was far from perfect. Syria continued to use chlorine, including in <a href="/middle-east-and-africa/2018/04/09/america-vows-to-respond-to-a-suspected-chemical-attack-in-syria">one highly lethal attack</a> in 2018, which Donald Trump, Mr Obama&#39;s successor, and Britain and France met with a barrage of cruise missiles. Dr Koblentz also observes that Syria held on to some nerve agent—though a tiny fraction of its initial stock—because Mr Assad launched three more nerve-agent attacks, though they caused much less harm than in Ghouta. In every case, Russia covered up for its ally, blaming the attacks on rebel forces. During emergency sessions at the <small>OPCW</small> , Syria&#39;s ambassador flaunted his contempt by playing “Angry Birds” on his phone.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But the record is surely better than if America and its allies had tried to eliminate Syria&#39;s chemical weapons from afar. Mr Simon recalls how the early months of the war were all about how to stop chemical weapons falling into the wrong hands. “I spent a lot of my time dealing with the <small>US</small> and Israeli intelligence communities on pinpointing where all this stuff was,” he says, “and tracking or monitoring the vulnerability of specific installations to a breach by opposition forces and exploring ways with the <small>US</small> military on how those stockpiles might be destroyed by the United States unilaterally without creating a monstrous public-health hazard.”</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span><meta><img src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230826_IRC225.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230826_IRC225.png 200w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230826_IRC225.png 300w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230826_IRC225.png 400w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230826_IRC225.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230826_IRC225.png 640w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230826_IRC225.png 800w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230826_IRC225.png 1000w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230826_IRC225.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> In addition, the Syrian civil war has not weakened the <small>CWC</small> (see chart). Many countries strongly condemned Russia over its attempt to poison Sergei Skripal, a former member of the <small>KGB</small> living in Britain, back in 2018 and Alexei Navalny, an opposition leader, in 2020 using another nerve agent called novichok. The <a href="/the-economist-explains/2013/09/16/why-is-the-use-of-chemical-weapons-taboo">taboo against chemical weapons</a> remains.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet if Syria&#39;s programme was mostly dismantled and the <small>CWC</small> is intact, why has American credibility suffered? One answer, says Keren Yarhi-Milo, dean of Columbia University&#39;s School of International and Public Affairs, is that policy choices have audiences far beyond their narrow target. In Mr Obama&#39;s case this audience was packed with people who already doubted his resolve. His tough talk over Syria&#39;s red line was overshadowed by his oft-stated desire for America to devote less of its resources to policing the Middle East—and indeed the world as a whole. The United States had become bogged down in Afghanistan and Iraq. The decision to “lead from behind” in Libya to remove Muammar Qaddafi, its tyrannical president, at the behest of Britain and France had ended in chaos. Mr Obama&#39;s attempts to strike a deal with Iran over its nuclear programme was seen as too accommodating by some leaders in Israel and the Gulf.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Dr Yarhi-Milo argues that, as well as being judged on policies, leaders also acquire a “signalling reputation” reflecting their record of carrying out threats and honouring promises. Experts disagree about how much this reputation is worth. Some argue that foreign powers take hard-nosed decisions, based on their assessment of a leader&#39;s capabilities and interests in the moment, rather than on his or her past. However Dr Yarhi-Milo&#39;s research suggests that, in the real world, foreign powers use reputation as a guide. “Somebody like Putin doesn&#39;t engage in those kinds of super-rationalist calculations,” she says. “They use shortcuts. And those…many times are based on their personal experience interacting with that country.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Obama&#39;s reputation strikes Mr Simon as monumentally unfair. He points out that in 2013 the former president began a massive operation to train and support rebel fighters in Syria and argues that was far more significant than a punitive strike for Ghouta would have been. Middle Eastern leaders knew about this commitment, but it does not seem to have won much credit with them. Furthermore, Mr Simon describes in his book how, since the second term of George W. Bush, every American president has sought to limit America&#39;s commitment to the Middle East. And yet the red line over Syria is nevertheless treated as a turning-point.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> Looking back across a decade, Mr Obama&#39;s record shows how elusive credibility can be. Mr Obama has insisted he has no regrets. In 2016 he told the <i>Atlantic</i> that “dropping bombs on someone to prove that you&#39;re willing to drop bombs on someone is just about the worst reason to use force”. That is surely correct. When Richard Nixon bombed Cambodia and the Viet Cong in the 1970s, in the belief that developing countries would otherwise topple like dominoes, it cost a lot of lives without saving America&#39;s reputation. Furthermore, leaders such as Turkey&#39;s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, feel free to flip-flop but are still able to exert power.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Even so, the success in dealing with Syria&#39;s chemical weapons has been eclipsed by the more general truth that America&#39;s position in the Middle East has weakened—partly by choice. That has been thrown into relief by the rise of Islamic State in 2014 as a violent source of anarchy and chaos. It was made worse by the fact that the man who stepped in to handle Syria with Mr Obama&#39;s blessing was Vladimir Putin. He has since increased his hold over the country, derided America&#39;s pretences to act as a global policeman and sent his troops into Ukraine. The red line has stuck because it represents a powerful metaphor for America&#39;s ongoing struggles to cope with a complicated world. <span>■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 22 Aug 2023 15:39:32 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/bo415ehglq99vastu7lf5rolllspmlip</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/08/22/reassessing-barack-obamas-red-line-in-syria </item><item><title><![CDATA[The BRICS bloc is riven with tensions]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/054%20International%20-%20The%20BRICS%20summit-84cd09de06bdf14a3fd321f5fad74898.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>L</span> <small>IKE THE</small> iPod and MySpace, the <small>BRICS</small> bloc is a product of the benign optimism of the 2000s. In 2001 Goldman Sachs coined the acronym <small>BRIC</small> in a paper about the economic potential of Brazil, Russia, India and China. The quartet ran with the idea, holding its first summit in 2009. A year later South Africa was invited to join. Some analysts feared the <small>BRICS</small> might soon start to rival the <small>G7,</small> but the grouping quickly lost momentum. The non-Asian <small>BRICS</small> economies stagnated in the 2010s. At summits the bloc would issue garbled communiqués about the perfidious West—which the perfidious West would promptly ignore. The <small>BRICS</small> looked dead.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> And yet the bloc lives. On August 22nd the 15th <small>BRICS</small> summit will open in Johannesburg, a major South African city—a party for many of the biggest swing voters in geopolitics. Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa&#39;s president, will be joined by leaders including Narendra Modi of India, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil (known universally as Lula) and China&#39;s Xi Jinping. Vladimir Putin will not be there in person. Were he to attend, then South Africa, as a member of the International Criminal Court, would be obliged to act on the arrest warrant the court issued for Russia&#39;s president in March. And that might spoil the fun.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The meeting will underline how the bloc has been rejuvenated by Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine and rising tensions between the West and China. <small>BRICS</small> members, led by Beijing, are considering whether to expand and deepen the bloc. Some middle powers see the group as a possible vehicle for their interests. The bloc says that more than 40 countries have either applied to join it or have expressed an interest in doing so.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A “Big <small>BRICS</small> ” would be a challenge for the West. But it is not a mortal threat. China&#39;s efforts to enlarge the bloc are revealing its tensions and contradictions. A weakened Russia is going along with it, but Brazil, India and South Africa are sceptical. The <small>BRICS</small> are far more heterogeneous than the <small>G7</small> . Members differ politically, economically and militarily; expansion would make a motley crew even motlier. It would mean that although the <small>BRICS</small> could criticise the Western-led international order with a louder voice, they would struggle even more to articulate an alternative.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What, then, holds the <small>BRICS</small> together? Like the <small>G7,</small> the group has no charter or formal membership criteria. Nor is its mortar the product of personal chemistry. In June at a meeting of foreign ministers in Cape Town, a kind of warm-up for the main event, your correspondent snuck into the restaurant hosting the dignitaries&#39; lunch. The pasta salad was not the shindig&#39;s only sad sight. The delegations were scattered: the Chinese were too busy in meetings, the South Africans too disorganised, the Brazilians too late. Outside, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India&#39;s foreign minister, held court with his officials. Inside, Sergey Lavrov, his Russian counterpart, silently nursed a glass of white wine.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Working the room</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>BRICS</small> endure because the club serves several functions. One is to provide a platform for members to criticise, often with justification, the way institutions such as the World Bank, <small>IMF</small> and <small>UN</small> Security Council sideline the “global south”, a modish term for developing countries. In Cape Town Mr Jaishankar talked of the “concentration” of global economic power that was “leaving too many nations at the mercy of too few”. Oddly, such views have become more pointed as the <small>BRICS</small> &#39; share of world <small>GDP</small> has increased, from 8% in 2001 to 26% today. Over the same period the <small>G7</small> ’s share has fallen from 65% to 43% (see chart 1). </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The clubbiness of the <small>BRICS</small> is also a source of prestige, especially for struggling members. On average the <small>GDP</small> of Brazil, Russia and South Africa has grown by less than 1% annually since 2013 (versus around 6% for China and India). Any investment analyst who picked them among the most promising emerging markets today would be laughed off her Zoom call. But being the only Latin American country and the only African country in the group respectively allows Brazil and South Africa to project continental influence: Mr Ramaphosa has invited an enormous number of African leaders to the Johannesburg summit.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The bloc offers support in isolated times, too. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil&#39;s former president, turned to the <small>BRICS</small> after his ally, Donald Trump, left the White House. These days Russia needs the <small>BRICS</small> more than ever. At the meeting of foreign ministers your correspondent tried to ask Russia&#39;s ambassador to South Africa what the bloc&#39;s purpose was for his country. “To make more friends,” he grunted.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> He will have them, if China gets its way. Beijing wants to admit more countries from the global south. The reasoning is almost Newtonian: America&#39;s rallying of Western allies is prompting China into seeking an equal and opposite reaction via the <small>BRICS.</small> Viewed from China, there is no other bloc that could be a counterweight to the <small>G7.</small> The Shanghai Co-operation Organisation is too Eurasian. The <small>G20</small> is too dominated by its Western members. The <small>BRICS</small> represent the best party going. A Chinese official contrasts Beijing&#39;s desire for a “big family” of the <small>BRICS</small> countries with the West&#39;s “small circle”.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Supersize Xi</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is not the first time that Beijing has sought a bigger crowd. It championed South Africa&#39;s admission. Since then it has repeatedly raised the idea of adding more members, especially after Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. Though the <small>BRICS</small> say their decisions are based on consensus, China is hard to ignore. Its share of the <small>BRICS</small> output was 47% in 2001; today it is 70%. In 2022 it accounted for 69% of all trade by the group (the sum of members&#39; imports and exports), up from 55% in 2001. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The bloc has not released an official list of applicants. But, as part of a thought experiment, <i>The Economist</i> counted 18 countries that are possible candidates, based on their meeting at least one of three criteria as of the end of July (see map). First, the country is on record as saying it has applied. Second, South African officials have named the country as an applicant. Third, the country&#39;s foreign minister attended the Cape Town meeting as a “friend” of the bloc, either in person or virtually.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The guest list includes some increasingly assertive geopolitical swingers. For Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ( <small>UAE</small> ), joining the <small>BRICS</small> would fit with their efforts to recalibrate their relationship with America, their long-time ally, and to draw closer to China. Bangladesh and Indonesia, like India, are populous Asian democracies that claim to be non-aligned—and that might also like some protection from Western criticism of their human-rights records. Argentina, Ethiopia, Mexico and Nigeria are all among the largest countries on their continents.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the unlikely event that all 18 were admitted it would challenge the world&#39;s best Scrabble player to come up with a new acronym. It would also increase the population of the <small>BRICS</small> countries from 3.2bn (41% as a share of the world&#39;s) to 4.6bn (58%), versus 10% for the <small>G7</small> members. The Big <small>BRICS&#39;</small> share of world <small>GDP</small> would rise to 34%, still behind the <small>G7</small> ’s but twice the share of the <small>EU</small> . It would raise the bloc&#39;s share of world trade from 18% to 27%. China would still be the life, soul and wallet of the party, however. It would account for 55% of the 23 countries&#39; output (for reference, America has 58% of the <small>G7</small> ). China&#39;s share of the Big <small>BRICS</small> &#39; global trade would still be about half (46%).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even as the bloc debates expansion, it is deepening its existing relationships. On top of the annual summit of bigwigs there is an increasingly long list of meetings involving academics, firms, ministers, ruling parties and think-tanks from <small>BRICS</small> members and countries friendly to them. Some of these might look like excuses for per-diems. Last month a meeting of the “ <small>BRICS</small> youth summit” was hosted by South Africa&#39;s 74-year-old youth minister. Russia says it will host a “ <small>BRICS</small> Games” before the Paris Olympics next year. But the importance of the connections to officials should not be overlooked, argues Oliver Stuenkel of the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a Brazilian think-tank. “These meetings are often dull but they allow bureaucrats to globalise their network.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>BRICS</small> bloc also has more serious endeavours. It has established two financial institutions, which the Russian finance minister once reportedly described as a mini- <small>IMF</small> and a mini-World Bank. The former is the Contingent Reserve Arrangement ( <small>CRA</small> ), which was agreed to at the <small>BRICS</small> summit in 2014. It is an as yet untested series of swap lines for central banks to get hard currency if they have balance-of-payments problems.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The mini-World Bank is the New Development Bank ( <small>NDB</small> ). Since its establishment in 2015 it has lent $33bn for almost 100 projects. Three new members have joined in the past three years: Bangladesh, Egypt and the <small>UAE</small> . Uruguay is set to be admitted soon. (A state does not need to be a member of the <small>BRICS</small> to join the bank.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The possibility of expanding and deepening the grouping is seen by members as proof of its strength. Yet these efforts also highlight divisions among the gang. Economically and politically the <small>BRICS</small> are a mess—adding more members or functions would only emphasise that fact.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Start with the economic differences. The <small>GDP</small> per person of the poorest member, India, is roughly a fifth of that of China and Russia. The latter pair run current-account surpluses, the others deficits. Russia, an important member of the <small>OPEC+</small> cartel, and Brazil are net oil exporters; the other three depend on imports. China actively manages the exchange rate of its currency; the other four intervene less often. And so on.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All of this complicates the bloc&#39;s attempt to change the global economic order. A common <small>BRICS</small> reserve currency—something Mr Putin claimed the bloc was working on a year ago—would collapse on first contact with reality; no member would give up the power held by their central bank. Members regularly guard their own power at economic institutions. South Africa&#39;s efforts to have more African representation on the <small>IMF</small> board have been rejected. China has around 40% of the voting rights at the <small>CRA</small> , in line with its capital contribution, and insisted on a limit to what any country can receive in the absence of an <small>IMF</small> programme.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>NDB</small> has had a slow start. Its total lending since 2015 is a third of what the World Bank Group committed in 2021 alone. The World Bank is more transparent and accountable than the <small>NDB</small> , notes Daniel Bradlow of the University of Pretoria in South Africa. That the <small>NDB</small> mostly issues loans in <small>US</small> dollars or euros somewhat undermines its members&#39; claim to be trying to reduce the power of the greenback. A rule ensures that the five original members retain 55% of voting rights, belying their criticisms of uneven decision-making power at the World Bank and the <small>IMF</small> . “That does not suggest a truly progressive global-south bank,” says Mr Bradlow.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Politically, too, they are an eclectic bunch. Russia and China are autocracies that disdain liberal freedoms. Brazil, India and South Africa are by contrast raucous, if flawed, democracies. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The trio have more reason to be wary of public opinion as a result. A poll published on July 27th by the Pew Research Centre, a think-tank based in Washington, <small>DC</small> , found that negative views towards China have become more common since 2019—and not just in the West. In South Africa 40% of respondents had an unfavourable view of China, up from 35% four years ago. In Brazil and India unfavourable sentiment reached the highest levels since polling began in 2010 and 2013 respectively. In Brazil the share rose from 27% to 48%; in India from 46% to 67% (see chart 2).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The democracies are also keener than the autocracies on genuinely “non-aligned” foreign policies—they want to stay swingers. Take South Africa. It has angered the West by, among other things, hosting a naval exercise with China and Russia on the first anniversary of the war in Ukraine. It has government ministers who get dewy-eyed at the very mention of the Soviet Union.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Mr Ramaphosa is wary of pushing the West too far. Several of South Africa&#39;s main sources of foreign direct investment ( <small>FDI</small> ) are Western powers, and it hosts drills with <small>NATO</small> countries, too. He wants to keep South Africa&#39;s preferential trade terms with America, which some in Congress have said should be rescinded in light of his government&#39;s drift towards Russia.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Lula also has a more subtle approach than his peers in Beijing and Moscow. He would like to reduce what he sees as America&#39;s hegemonic role in the world; hence his enthusiasm for the <small>BRICS</small> , which he helped establish during his first period in office in the 2000s. At the same time he understands the need for good relations with the West, which is its main source of <small>FDI</small> and arms. And although India continues to buy arms from Russia, it is diversifying its military ties and buying more from America and France.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine has entrenched diplomatic faultlines in other ways. The bloc&#39;s strong emphasis on sovereignty—originally a way to draw an implicit contrast with an interventionist West—looks hollow when Russia invades its neighbour. Neither China nor Russia supports the others&#39; proposed reforms of the <small>UN</small> Security Council, of which they are both permanent members. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="An illustration of five mostly empty cocktail glasses with flags respresenting South Africa, China, Brazil, India and Russia scattered around and confetti on the floor.

Though Lula is more sympathetic to the idea of welcoming like-minded Latin American leaders to the club, such as Argentina&#39;s Alberto Fernández (with whom he is personally close), diplomatic types are more sceptical. Mauro Vieira, Brazil&#39;s foreign minister and a career diplomat, has spoken of the need to protect the <small>BRICS</small> “brand”. South Africa likes being the only African representative in the bloc. China would be emboldened by a bigger <small>BRICS;</small> others would feel enfeebled.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All these differences are coming to the fore because of expansion talk. “We do not want to dilute control of the <small>BRICS</small> from the original five,” says a South African official. South Africa instead hopes for a compromise whereby joiners are given second-class status, mere <small>B</small> -listers at the party. The details need to be worked out—something which may happen at the summit.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Warring parties</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The critical dissenting voice is likely to be India&#39;s, given its growing economic and geopolitical importance. In the early days of the bloc “India thought that with the help of Russia it could manage China better,” says Harsh Pant of the Observer Research Foundation, a think-tank in Delhi. That is harder now Russia is beholden to China. And India frets about some of the wannabes, such as Cuba and Belarus. India fears these would be mini-Russias, repeating China&#39;s talking points.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> India sees itself as a rival to China for leadership of the global south. It has used its presidency of the <small>G20</small> this year to amplify the concerns of developing countries regarding climate finance and international institutions. It would not want to play second fiddle to a Chinese effort to woo this same group.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The tricky thing for India is that it doesn&#39;t want to be a party-pooper either. Nor is it keen to attract the blame for blocking other emerging countries&#39; aspirations. And it aims to preserve decent relations with China, with which it has deep economic links and a long border. So India is proceeding with caution. It wants to discuss joining criteria for new members in the coming weeks, rather than simply handing out welcome drinks.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Johannesburg summit will be a defining moment for the <small>BRICS.</small> Enlargement would indicate the scale of China&#39;s sway on the scene. But if China is blocked it would underline the group&#39;s deep divisions. Either way, the global south is showing that it is as transactional as the Western countries it claims moral superiority over. And much more fractured. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 17 Aug 2023 13:33:27 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/g3hmdnml8f7f4j9i2v6sb2fu377bjsko</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/08/17/the-brics-are-getting-together-in-south-africa </item><item><title><![CDATA[What Ukraine’s bloody battlefield is teaching medics]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>A</span> MERICAN AND British intelligence agencies watched as Russia massed its troops on the border with Ukraine in the early weeks of 2022. They knew that Vladimir Putin had planned an invasion—they had stolen his plans. But would Mr Putin go through with it? One indicator that he would, says Major-General Tim Hodgetts, the surgeon-general of Britain&#39;s armed forces, was that field hospitals were moving to Russia&#39;s border with Ukraine.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That was telling, but not damning. Russia had deployed hospitals for exercises in the past. More worrying were the ongoing blood drives among the country&#39;s university students. Red blood cells last only six weeks if not frozen; donors can be bled only every three months. Even more troubling was what was happening inside the field hospitals. Russian surgeons were practising operations on large, anaesthetised animals. “Medical indicators and warnings are predictive of war,” concludes General Hodgetts. It is a vital lesson from Ukraine for future conflicts.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The war in Ukraine is the largest in Europe since 1945. Russia and Ukraine have fought at a scale and intensity that Western armies have not encountered since the Korean war. Military casualties have dwarfed those of recent American and European campaigns. America lost over 7,000 troops in Afghanistan and Iraq between 2001 and 2019. Ukraine has lost more than twice as many in a year, according to leaked American documents, Russia six to seven times more. The experience will change military medicine for good.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In Afghanistan and Iraq, America&#39;s army and its allies made astonishing progress in wartime medical care. Since the majority of deaths occur before soldiers arrive at a hospital, much was gained by evacuating wounded troops by helicopter and treating them within the “golden hour”, a period in which the chance of survival is far higher. Soldiers who once would have died pulled through. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The ratio of those wounded to killed, around three- or four-to-one in Vietnam, where care was poorer, shot up to as high as ten-to-one (see chart). In Ukraine the figure has plummeted back to Vietnam levels, say people familiar with the classified data. No more than 2% of American soldiers were killed or wounded in the post-2001 wars; the comparable figure is estimated at 5-10% for Ukraine. A study from 2022 by the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank, suggested that 40% of wounded Ukrainian personnel were suffering permanent injuries.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To a certain extent these figures reflect the limitations of medical care on both sides. Russia&#39;s army treats infantry as disposable. Wounded soldiers have been sent back to the front lines with serious shrapnel wounds and cardiac problems. Tanisha Fazal of the University of Minnesota, an expert on medical care in war, says her jaw dropped when she saw a video of a Russian officer using an obsolete rubber tourniquet. It was of the sort that America used in Afghanistan in the early 2000s.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For its part, Ukraine is in the midst of a transition away from Soviet-style care. Before 2017 it had no professional cadre of combat medics, says Maria Nazarova, an instructor in the country&#39;s armed forces. By 2022 it had trained 650 of them, a drop in the ocean for a notional million-man army. The training centre, short of instructors and facilities, now prepares fewer than 300 people per month for the battlefield, each of whom has had just those four weeks of instruction.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The current counter-offensive, which is forcing Ukrainian troops to cross minefields in the teeth of drone and artillery attacks, is intensifying the burden on medical care. “I have not seen such a spike in the demand for tourniquets since June last year,” says Evgen Vorobiov, a lawyer in Kyiv who works as a volunteer with six different brigades. He adds that chest seals and ultrasound devices are also needed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The shortages are compounded by structural problems. The supply of military equipment to front-line units remains inefficient and ad hoc, says Mr Vorobiov. Senior medics spend their time filling out paper forms to request supplies that arrive erratically and in small quantities. There is frequent tension between front-line units and the general staff&#39;s central medical command, which sees its job as running hospitals rather than supporting front-line care. It does not provide vital kit, such as portable ultrasound or intraosseous access devices, which are needed to get fluids into patients when veins can&#39;t be found—a common problem for soldiers in shock, says Ms Nazarova. Over 90% of medical supplies for combat medics are purchased by volunteers, she says.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This bureaucratic infighting has more serious consequences, too. America&#39;s army realised in the 2000s that transfusing wounded soldiers with “whole” blood, rather than components like plasma, was saving lives. Last summer Ukraine&#39;s health ministry legalised that practice. The medical command, in a fit of bureaucracy, then stepped in to ban it. But many “modern-thinking” Ukrainian brigades continue doing it regardless, says Ms Nazarova, using personal contacts with local blood-donation centres. The result is uneven levels of care throughout the armed forces.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Western armies would enjoy many advantages in a big war, including more skilled personnel and better equipment. But American and European military doctors acknowledge that a large conflict would prove a huge shock to medical care honed over decades of counterinsurgency campaigns against opponents lacking in artillery, missiles and drones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Take helicopters, which are critical for transporting the wounded. Just 70 American ones were downed by fire between 2001 and 2009 in Afghanistan and Iraq. Russia has lost 90 in 17 months. “This recognition that the next war will likely be very different in air superiority has changed lots of paradigms within the <small>US</small> and <small>NATO</small> militaries,” says John Holcomb, a professor at the University of Alabama who led the <small>US</small> Army&#39;s Institute of Surgical Research. There will be “prolonged field care” outside hospitals. “Clinical outcomes will be poor,” warns General Hodgetts.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Injury patterns will differ, too. Around 79% of America&#39;s casualties in the wars after the attacks of September 11th, 2001 were from improvised explosive devices. More than 70% of Ukrainian casualties are from artillery and rocket barrages, according to a recent paper published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons. These tend to affect a larger number of soldiers at once, causing “polytrauma”—damage to multiple body parts and organs.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Treating such injuries at scale will tax European armies. Consider blood. It is a “strategic commodity” for the alliance, writes Ronald Ti, a military-medical logistician at King&#39;s College London. A military health-care system that cannot provide it risks “systemic collapse of morale”, he warns. Dr Ti gives the example of Estonia: its main peacetime stock of blood could be exhausted in a single day of war (on <small>NATO</small> ’s standard assumptions about rates of use).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet stockpiling blood is not like storing ammo. Its shelf life when fresh is weeks (and, when frozen, months), not years. Thawing it from frozen takes time. Moreover, blood-donation levels in Britain routinely drop below a week&#39;s worth of reserves, notes General Hodgetts. The war is helping to resolve previously knotty legal issues in <small>NATO</small> around the interoperability of blood products and drugs. Britain is now investing to produce its own freeze-dried plasma, having previously depended on scarce French and German production that might be swamped in wartime.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another problem is how to shift tens of thousands of wounded soldiers. On July 11th <small>NATO</small> leaders approved the alliance&#39;s first comprehensive defence plans since the cold war. They included specific plans for mass-casualty transport across Europe, including how to distribute casualties among different allies, an issue neglected for years. <small>NATO</small> medical chiefs, sometimes joined by Ukraine&#39;s surgeon-general, have been meeting regularly to test how those procedures would fare in wartime. Up to 60% of Ukraine&#39;s military casualties have been moved by rail. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Medics once wanted hospitals to stand out in a war zone. The lesson from Ukraine, where Russia has struck facilities with large red crosses on the roof, is that it may be better to blend in. The World Health Organisation estimates that there have been almost 900 attacks on health facilities in the war (see map). Medical doctors are considering how to harden, camouflage or disperse their facilities. But light and agile field hospitals will inevitably provide more limited care. Another growing challenge is how to ensure that the electronic emissions of medical equipment do not serve as a beacon to enemy bombs.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Ready for action</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The war has also put nuclear weapons back on the agenda. In the autumn Western leaders grew concerned that Russia was preparing to use tactical nuclear weapons. America, Britain and France warned the Kremlin that it would face serious military consequences if it took that step; the danger subsided. In the cold war <small>NATO</small> planned to fight through a nuclear battlefield. Those plans faded away in the 1990s. Many officials now worry that America and its allies are medically unprepared for nuclear conflict. Vast numbers of burn kits would be needed, for example.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Finally, Ukraine illustrates how technology is changing military medicine. A study published in February 2021 by Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Maddry and his colleagues at the <small>US</small> Army&#39;s Institute of Surgical Research examined the records of 1,267 patients transported with traumatic injuries. Half did not receive any life-saving intervention en route and so might have been moved safely by drone.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine is testing that theory. It has already used large cargo drones, capable of carrying 180kg loads up to 70km, to evacuate wounded personnel, becoming the first country to conduct this sort of robotic medevac. “As technology advances,” write Lieutenant-Colonel Maddry and his co-authors, “robotics aboard [drones] could provide pain medications, blood products, oxygen, airway management, and even surgical procedures”—though the drones are subject to the same risks as helicopters, points out Dr Fazal.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The challenge is to learn from such experiments and Ukraine&#39;s broader experience. That requires turning anecdotes into hard data. America has offered to help Ukraine build a “trauma registry” of the sort that it used in Afghanistan and Iraq, a database which logs how patients are injured, how they have been treated and how they fare. Analysis will benefit not just allied armies, but also the wider public. Dr Holcomb has said that he was able to reduce the number of trauma deaths at his hospital, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, by 30% by applying skills picked up in the army. Ukraine&#39;s pain will lead to medical gains. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Correction (August 7th 2023): An earlier version of this article misspelt John Holcomb&#39;s name.对不起。</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 16:09:39 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/g794vi0alrl8i0nlpajpc32065ej0qfm</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/08/04/what-ukraines-bloody-battlefield-is-teaching-medics </item><item><title><![CDATA[Western values are steadily diverging from the rest of the world’s]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div id="script-microapp"><figure class="svelte-12c8hyb wide-image ds-container"><img src="/interactive/international/2023/08/03/western-values-are-steadily-diverging-from-the-rest-of-the-world/20230805_IRD001.jpg" alt class="svelte-86df6y"></figure><p class="article-text"> <span>I</span> <small>N 1981</small> OVER 40% of the world&#39;s population lived in extreme poverty. But economic growth was starting to accelerate in developing countries. And Ron Inglehart, a professor at the University of Michigan, was organising a worldwide survey team to test the theory that, as peasant farmers escape poverty, they begin to think and behave differently, as people in the past had done when they joined the middle classes.</p><p class="article-text"> They might give a higher priority to education, to widening their children&#39;s knowledge, than their own parents had done. They might give greater weight to their own experience and reasoning, and less to religious books or the authority of kings. And perhaps these new ways, these basic values, would begin to converge around the world. Such matters, Inglehart thought, could be tested by asking questions which revealed underlying values such as “How important is religion in your life?”, “Would you be happy living next to a foreigner?” and “Can you trust most people?”</p><p class="article-text"> Forty years later, only 8% of the world&#39;s population is still in extreme poverty; more than half, on some measures, count as middle class. The World Values Survey ( <small>WVS</small> ), Inglehart&#39;s baby, has become the world&#39;s biggest social-research network. Every five years or so its researchers sally out into the field interviewing, at last count, almost 130,000 people in 90 countries. Yet its latest wave of results, which covers 2017-22, provides only partial endorsement of the idea that basic values tend to converge as people get richer. In significant ways, the differences between how people think in different parts of the world seem to be widening.</p><p class="article-text"> Inglehart (who died in 2021) argued that security—or, to be precise, insecurity—is at the root of how people think and what they value. In an insecure world in which children or crops can be wiped out by disease or drought overnight, family is often the only defence against disaster, while church, mosque or temple are the main providers of consolation or explanation. But as wealth spreads, basic insecurity recedes. In a more stable environment, people may think more for themselves.</p><p class="article-text"> Inglehart thought this process occurred in two slightly different forms. He invented ways to measure each. </p><svelte-scroller-outer class="svelte-xdbafy"><svelte-scroller-background-container class="background-container svelte-xdbafy"><svelte-scroller-background class="svelte-xdbafy"></svelte-scroller-background></svelte-scroller-background-container><svelte-scroller-foreground class="svelte-xdbafy"><div class="svelte-1m937ma"><p class="foreground"><section class="svelte-1m937ma"><div class="svelte-1m937ma"> The first assesses the influence of customary sources of authority, such as family and religion.

In some ways it looks similar to today&#39;s. In both, Protestant Europeans are the most secular and individualistic. Catholic Europeans hold similar views, though less strongly.

In the map of 2022, by contrast, most are in just two. The outliers of bottom right and top left are fewer. Most countries are now aligned along a diagonal that starts in the bottom left, with strong traditional and collective values, and rises towards the top right, with more secular values and individualism. In 2022 there is a clear “best fit” line. In 1998, there was not.</p><p class="article-text"> On the face of it, this shift suggests that people do think differently as they escape from poverty and insecurity. The diagonal line implies that countries are either traditional-cum-collective or rational-cum-individualistic. The poorest countries are (mostly) at one end and the richest (mostly) at the other. Eventually, presumably, poorer countries will shuffle along the diagonal.</p><p class="article-text">也许。 But at the moment, the <small>WVS</small> findings suggest this is not happening without obstacles and detours. If poorer countries were indeed converging with rich ones in terms of values, you would expect that they would be the ones where values are changing fastest, whereas the countries they are catching up with would be more stable. In fact the survey finds the opposite. Countries that are already the most secular and individualistic are changing fastest and becoming even more secular; those that are most traditional and clannish are changing less and sometimes becoming more traditional, not less.<strong></strong></p><p class="article-text"> In 1998, 38% of Protestant Europeans and 32% of Muslims said most people could be trusted. By 2022 trust in Europe had risen (with more than half of Europeans saying that they trusted people) but it had plummeted in Islamic countries, where just 15% of respondents said people are trustworthy. In 1998 Catholic Europeans and Latin Americans also had comparable levels of trust. By 2022, the proportion of Catholic Europeans who said they trusted people was three times higher than that of Latin Americans.</p><p class="article-text"> Just as mistrust of strangers is a measure of collective values, so is unwillingness to sign petitions. This is because clannish societies tend not to believe that governing authorities will act in their interests, and for fear of reprisals. In 2022 nearly half of respondents in Latin American and Orthodox countries said they would never sign a petition. That marked a big increase in Latin America since 1998, and a small one in the Orthodox places. In contrast, the number of Europeans who said they would never sign a petition fell markedly, to levels roughly half those in most of the rest of the world.</p><p class="article-text"> On measure after measure—from thinking that children ought to be obedient, to tolerance of homosexuality, to agreeing that “when religion and science conflict, religion is always right”—European countries have moved in the direction of greater individualism and secularism in the past 25 years. That is also true of America. Though Americans have long been somewhat more religious than most Europeans, over time they have moved towards greater individualism and secularism at least as much as Europeans have.</p><p class="article-text"> In 1981, for example, 47% of Americans described themselves as non-religious (saying God was not important in their lives, that they did not attend church services and so on). The share in Sweden was 58%. By 2022 the share in America had risen by 14 points, almost matching Sweden&#39;s. Meanwhile Orthodox, Islamic and Latin American countries have seen either smaller changes or, in some cases, movement towards more traditionalism and collectivism. That does not necessarily invalidate the idea that global values will one day converge. But it does suggest that day may be some way off.</p><p class="article-text"> <strong>Mind the gap</strong></p><p class="article-text"> The findings raise three further questions. First, how long can this gap continue to widen? In particular, can Europeans and Americans really go on getting ever more individualistic and secular? “People keep asking me if there is a limit,” says Christian Welzel, a professor at Leuphana University in Luneburg, in Germany, and another of Inglehart&#39;s co-authors. “But I haven&#39;t seen any sign yet.” Dr Welzel has trawled through the <small>WVS</small> data by age cohort. He finds that in every region each generation becomes more individualistic and secular than the one before.</p><p class="article-text"> In Europe the gap between old and young is especially large, and many times greater than in Islamic or Orthodox countries. This implies that the shift towards more self-expression will continue in the next generation. In America there is a values gap between the more religious and more secular parts of the country, which could in theory imply that the religious areas (in the South and Midwest) might not be taking part in the drift towards secularism. Yet even this seems wrong. The gap between the most and least religious states has not changed materially since 1981. Whatever it is that is causing America&#39;s unusually polarised politics, it is not—the <small>WVS</small> suggests—a result of a fundamental shift in what people believe in different parts of the country.</p><p class="article-text"> Second, what are the political and geopolitical implications? At a broad level, values and politics are obviously and intimately connected. Traditional values seem to be more associated with autocracies; one-person-one-vote systems embody individualistic values. It can be no coincidence that during the past decade authoritarian populists have done especially well in two of the regions where the slowdown or reversal of secular-rational values has occurred: Orthodox countries (such as Russia and Belarus) and Latin America (Brazil, Nicaragua, Venezuela).</p><p class="article-text"> In Orthodox, Latin American and Islamic countries support for democracy also plummeted, as measured by the share of the population saying they thought it was good or fairly good to have a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament or elections. In all three regions the share saying they thought this rose by between one-third and two-thirds between 1998 and 2022. That hardly bodes well for the future of democracy.</p><p class="article-text"> Even so, there is no simple relationship between values and politics, as the example of American religious voters suggests. The persistence of the devout and traditionalist right in Europe and America is clearly connected with discontent at spreading individualism. But it is not so clear whether voters have changed and organised themselves into more powerful far-right parties, or whether the parties have simply managed more successfully than in the past to sell their politics to voters who have not changed that much themselves.</p><p class="article-text"> A similar point can be made about values and geopolitics. International conflicts over values seem to be spreading. Barely a day goes by without clashes between Western and non-Western governments over <small>LGBT</small> + rights. After President Joe Biden criticised Uganda&#39;s introduction of a harsh anti-gay law earlier this year Anita Among, the Ugandan parliament&#39;s speaker, said “The Western world will not come to rule Uganda.” And when Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey&#39;s president, threatened to block Sweden&#39;s application to join <small>NATO</small> because a man in Sweden had burned pages from the Koran, he was appealing to Turks&#39; strong religious convictions. But to many individualistic Swedes the book-burner had every right to free expression, as long as he obeyed the law.</p><p class="article-text"> Disagreements about values also pervade the superpower rivalry between America and China. Chinese leaders complain endlessly that there are no such things as “the so-called universal values of the West” (as Xi Jinping, China&#39;s president, puts it), and that appeals by the American government to such values are a mere smokescreen for a new kind of imperialism. Dilma Rousseff, a former president of Brazil, calls Western liberalism “this imposed value system”.</p><p class="article-text"> Even so, many of these conflicts would surely have happened regardless of differences over values. China would have challenged America for strategic and technological reasons. Turkey might have blocked Sweden to extract concessions from <small>NATO</small> . Vladimir Putin, Russia&#39;s president, claims to have invaded Ukraine because that country, once an integral part of the Orthodox world, is imbibing European habits of thought which (Mr Putin thinks) threaten Russia. But Mr Putin had many reasons for his decision, paranoid as well as calculated. The point is not that differences in values are artificial. But they may not be determinative. To authoritarian governments, “values” are an excuse as well as a set of beliefs.</p><p class="article-text"> Third, what does all this mean for arguments about “universal values”? The <small>WVS</small> implies that secular and liberal values are no more universal than religious and authoritarian ones. The two sets of values sit at opposite ends of the same spectrum of opinion; both are ways in which people adapt to their circumstances, whether secure or insecure. In that sense Mr Xi and others have a point: such values are not universal. But they are not entirely conditional upon a country&#39;s history or political culture.</p><p class="article-text"> As a rule of thumb, as prosperity spreads, life expectancy rises, fertility rates fall, and education expands, people tend to move towards the secular/rational end of the spectrum. Mr Welzel describes this as a shift in mindset from “prevention focus” (in which people&#39;s main concern is preventing harm and loss to themselves and their family) to what he calls “promotion focus” (under which people seek self-expression and freedom of choice about how to live their lives).</p><p class="article-text"> The <small>WVS</small> , however, finds that the speed at which this shift happens varies greatly in different countries. In some places it even goes into reverse. Different generations adjust more or less readily. Governments intervene to slow things down if it suits them. And it is clear that getting wealthier is not necessarily enough to trigger the shift in values, because countries that are getting richer can often feel less secure.</p><p class="article-text"> For all these reasons, traditional ways of thinking persist and the convergence of values widely expected to accompany economic growth is far from complete. Yet the impact of greater security on people&#39;s values does not go away. Slowly, unsurely, religious and authoritarian values tend to lose some of their appeal; secular and liberal values tend to gain. And the battle over values plays out between the two poles. <span>■</span></p><p class="article-sources"> Sources: <i>The Economist;</i> World Values Survey: Round Seven, Inglehart et al. 2022年</p><div class="related-content svelte-1hiq10b"><div class="wrapper svelte-13yxci9"><div class="tiles svelte-13yxci9"><div class="tile main svelte-13yxci9"> <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2023/08/04/what-ukraines-bloody-battlefield-is-teaching-medics" class="svelte-13yxci9"><img src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230805_IRP501.jpg" class="svelte-13yxci9"></a><p class="svelte-13yxci9"> Western armies have not dealt with mass casualties since the 1950s </p></div><div><div class="tile other svelte-13yxci9"><div class="image svelte-13yxci9"><img src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230805_IRD010.jpg" class="svelte-13yxci9"></div></div><div class="tile other svelte-13yxci9"><div class="image svelte-13yxci9"><img src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230729_IRP504.jpg" class="svelte-13yxci9"></div></div><div class="tile other svelte-13yxci9"><div class="image svelte-13yxci9"><img src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230729_IRP503.jpg" class="svelte-13yxci9"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 16:16:01 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/v79lh8skjj3fro5neffqhhuome8d2nt9</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/interactive/international/2023/08/03/western-values-are-steadily-diverging-from-the-rest-of-the-world </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ukrainian army commits new forces in a big southward push]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/046%20International%20-%20Ukraine_s%20counter-offensive-961581ebab9932bdc4baecebbf216306.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1m2w0l00"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">Ukraine war</a></i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>A</span> <small>fter eight</small> weeks of slow progress, Ukraine&#39;s counter-offensive entered a new phase on July 26th when Ukraine&#39;s army committed a big part of its reserve forces in the south.

But for that to happen, Ukraine must overcome the problems that hobbled the first phase of its offensive earlier this summer.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The counter-offensive began on June 4th when Ukraine launched attacks near Velyka Novosilka and around Bakhmut in Donetsk province, as well as a prior thrust in <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/16/zaporizhia-braces-itself-for-russian-nuclear-tricks">Zaporizhia province</a> in the south where it is now intensifying its assault. Its new Western-equipped brigades got bogged down, sometimes in <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/09/sappers-risk-their-lives-to-win-ukraine-back-inch-by-inch">minefields</a> , and were targeted by Russian artillery, anti-tank missiles, attack helicopters and loitering munitions. Ukraine responded by changing tactics. It held back armour and sent in smaller units of dismounted infantry, often no more than 20 soldiers, to proceed slowly and haltingly.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “The various wargames that were done ahead of time have predicted certain levels of advance,” conceded General Mark Milley, America&#39;s top officer, on July 18th. “And that has slowed down.” In part, the slow progress reflects the scale of the task. Russian defences are 30km deep in places, bristling with tank traps and spattered with mines. Most <small>NATO</small> armies would struggle to punch through comparable lines without complete dominance in the air, which Ukraine does not enjoy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another problem is that Russia has mounted a <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/07/03/how-ukraines-enemy-is-also-learning-lessons-albeit-slowly">stronger defence</a> than expected, conducting rapid, mobile counter-attacks in response to Ukrainian advances, rather than remaining confined to trenches. Rob Lee, an expert on Russia&#39;s armed forces who recently visited the front lines, notes that they have not just executed their doctrine competently, but also innovated, for instance by stacking multiple anti-tank mines on top of one another to destroy mine-clearing vehicles.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine&#39;s inability to breach Russian lines is partly to do with equipment—it needs demining kit, air-defence systems and anti-tank missiles capable of blunting Russian counter-attacks from a greater distance. It is also to do with tactics. Mr Lee describes an occasion when a brigade&#39;s advance was delayed by a couple of hours, until dawn. That not only negated Ukraine&#39;s advantage in night-vision systems, but also meant that the accompanying artillery barrage lifted hours earlier than it should have done. Russian infantry and anti-tank squads, who should have been suppressed by well-timed shellfire, were free to attack.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This lack of proficiency in co-ordinating complex attacks involving multiple units and different sorts of weapons is hardly surprising. Ukraine&#39;s new brigades were put together in a hurry with unfamiliar equipment. Newly mobilised men were given a month of training in Germany. They have struggled with tasks like reconnaissance, says Mr Lee, with new units becoming disoriented at night time. Co-ordination has also been a problem, with confusion around where friendly units have placed mines.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine&#39;s allies do not seem troubled by the slow progress to date. “It is far from a failure, in my view,” said General Milley, when asked whether the offensive had stalled. “I think that it&#39;s way too early to make that kind of call.” Optimists point to three factors in Ukraine&#39;s favour. One is that it need not fear a serious Russian counter-attack, despite minor Russian gains in northern Luhansk province in recent days. “There appears now to be little prospect of the Russian forces regaining momentum,” said Richard Moore, the head of <small>MI</small> 6, a British spy agency, on July 19th. That may be one reason why Russia has torn up a <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/18/why-the-death-of-ukraines-grain-deal-is-not-moving-wheat-markets">grain deal</a> and <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2023/07/27/russia-is-attacking-ukraines-agricultural-exports">resumed strikes</a> on Ukraine&#39;s ports and grain stores.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Second, Russia&#39;s decision to defend forward, rather than falling back to prepared defences, has slowed down Ukraine&#39;s progress but also left Russia with little mobile reserve in the rear, a point underscored by Yevgeny Prigozhin&#39;s unhindered march to Moscow in June.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The third factor is that Ukraine has been chipping away at Russia&#39;s combat power. On July 11th a Ukrainian strike reportedly killed Oleg Tsokov, a Russian general, in Berdyansk, suggesting that Ukraine was successfully targeting command posts. In recent days Ukraine has also used British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles to strike air bases and ammunition depots, including in Crimea. Meanwhile, America&#39;s decision to provide cluster munitions, allows Ukraine to keep up the offensive for longer than originally planned—certainly beyond the summer if necessary.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These factors explain why General Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine&#39;s top general, decided to throw in fresh legs on July 26th. He has been forced to adapt his original plan. Brigades from Ukraine&#39;s 9th Corps had been expected to fight their way to Russia&#39;s main line of defence. Then the 10th Corps, in essence a second echelon, including three Western-equipped brigades, were to be deployed to fight their way through the strongest defences. Finally, light, fast-moving air-assault units were supposed to exploit any breakthrough, pouring through the hard-won breach.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the event, 9th Corps struggled. Advances that were supposed to be completed in days ended up taking weeks. Ukraine was unable to deploy whole brigades, instead breaking them down into smaller units. Some experts worry that 10th Corps has now been thrown in prematurely. The main Russian line is still kilometres away and 10th Corps&#39;s units might be worn down before they get there, leaving them too exhausted to punch through.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Western officials play down these concerns. “I think they timed it well,” says one. Ukraine is in a “very strong operational position”, says another, pointing to the turmoil in Russia&#39;s senior ranks, including the decision in early July to sack General Ivan Popov, who commanded a big portion of Russian forces in southern Ukraine. Russian military bloggers have described heavy losses of Russian artillery pieces in recent weeks.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> However, a fluid war of manoeuvre is likely to remain a stretch for a force cobbled together in a few months. The Russian verb <i>peremalyvat (</i> to grind through) is invoked on both sides. But Ukraine&#39;s junior commanders, having seen their units gutted over the past 18 months, refuse to send their new citizen army into a meat-grinder in the way that Russia did in Bakhmut. As Ukraine has become more European, Ben Wallace, Britain&#39;s defence minister, recently suggested, it has acquired “a Western European caution”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some American and European military officials argue that Ukrainian commanders have in fact been too slow to strike with their new brigades, a mistake that they think Ukraine committed last year in Kherson, when tens of thousands of Russian troops withdrew east over the Dnieper river with their equipment. Ukrainian commanders chafe at the idea that they should gamble their army in circumstances that <small>NATO</small> generals have never faced.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The 10th Corps&#39;s assault is a break with that hesitation. And the upside of the aversion to casualties thus far is that many Ukrainian units are in better shape than planners had assumed. Brigades that assaulted Russian positions were expected to be left with only a third of their original strength. Thanks in part to well-armoured Western vehicles, they have taken a lighter knock. Even so, the commitment of 10th Corps is a fateful moment for General Zaluzhny, a cautious commander with the weight of Ukrainian and allied expectations on his shoulders. “This is the last big decision for Zaluzhny to make this summer,” says the Western official. “The die is cast.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Stay on top of our defence and international security coverage with <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-war-room">The War Room</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 11:17:56 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/6dcddo7e96s5miv5u35eirrquflvrg6n</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/07/27/the-ukrainian-army-commits-new-forces-in-a-big-southward-push </item><item><title><![CDATA[Russia is attacking Ukraine’s agricultural exports]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/047%20International%20-%20Ukraine_s%20grain%20exports-2e1a72cfad8c0975a963923efe40ebba.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>“T</span> <small>ODAY&#39;S DECISION</small> ”, António Guterres, the <small>UN</small> ’s secretary-general, lamented last week, “will strike a blow to people in need everywhere.” The injury he was decrying was Russia&#39;s repudiation of a year-old deal whereby it had allowed exports of food crops from Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea despite a naval blockade. The resulting leap in grain prices, Mr Guterres warned, would leave many hungry. This week Russia landed blows of a more literal sort on Ukraine&#39;s grain exports, bombing the ports around Odessa from which they are shipped.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A volley of missiles against wharves near the city centre on the night of July 22nd was so indiscriminate it hit one of the city&#39;s cathedrals. On July 19th 60,000 tonnes of grain were destroyed in another bombardment. And on July 24th Russia targeted Reni, a port on the Danube river (not covered by the agreement) through which Ukraine had been exporting grain via Romania.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Before Russia&#39;s invasion Ukraine exported some 45m tonnes of grain a year, around 90% of it via Odessa and other ports on the Black Sea. In the year the grain deal was in operation almost 33m tonnes were exported through Odessa&#39;s ports. That has now stopped.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Exports by road, rail and river barge have been increasing but Hanna Shelest, an analyst from Odessa, says there is not enough capacity to replace maritime shipments. Anyway, she adds, these alternatives are “several times more expensive in terms of logistics, and slower”. Exports by land have also caused grain prices to slump in neighbouring countries, infuriating farmers in otherwise friendly places such as Poland.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Before the war agriculture accounted for more than 10% of Ukraine&#39;s <small>gdp</small> and nearly 15% of employment. Many farms are still operating. The wheat harvest is under way. Sunflowers will follow in early autumn and maize a few weeks later. Russian bombardment has destroyed much of Ukraine&#39;s storage capacity, so the need to find a new outlet for Ukraine&#39;s exports is pressing. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 10:27:56 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/lv5o9l26mqa351i6ura85ovr11ud41us</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/07/27/russia-is-attacking-ukraines-agricultural-exports </item><item><title><![CDATA[Is Ukraine’s offensive stalling?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1m2w0l00"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">Ukraine war</a></i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>U</span> <small>KRAINE&#39;S COUNTER-OFFENSIVE</small> will soon enter its eighth week. It has already liberated more territory than Russia captured during a months-long winter offensive, which took the eastern town of Bakhmut and little else. The majority of Ukraine&#39;s Western-equipped brigades remain intact and uncommitted. But progress has been slower and harder than expected, dashing hopes of an early breakthrough. The offensive has devolved into a protracted battle of attrition, which seems likely to stretch into the autumn.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine launched its first big attacks in the south on June 4th around Orikhiv in <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/16/zaporizhia-braces-itself-for-russian-nuclear-tricks">Zaporizhia province</a> and around Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk province, along with a separate push around Bakhmut (see map). Ukraine&#39;s allies had spent months conducting wargames and simulations to predict how an assault might unfold. They were cautiously optimistic. They thought there was an outside chance of an early breakthrough, resulting in rapid progress of the sort that Ukraine had achieved in Kharkiv province last year. But such an outcome depended both on Ukraine executing its mission flawlessly and on Russia crumbling. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230729_EPM910.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In fact neither of those things has happened. Ukraine ran into trouble right away. Its new Western-equipped brigades became bogged down, sometimes in <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/09/sappers-risk-their-lives-to-win-ukraine-back-inch-by-inch">minefields</a> , and were targeted by Russian artillery, anti-tank missiles, attack helicopters and loitering munitions. Ukraine responded by changing tactics. It is now holding back armour and sending in smaller units of dismounted infantry, often no more than 20 soldiers, to proceed slowly and haltingly. The result is a grinding slog.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “The various wargames that were done ahead of time have predicted certain levels of advance,” conceded General Mark Milley, America&#39;s top officer, on July 18th. “And that has slowed down.” Ukraine says it has liberated 12 square kilometres of territory in the south in the week leading to July 24th, and 227 square kilometres in total since the start of the offensive. That is around 0.3% of the territory gained by Russia since the invasion last year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In part, the slow progress reflects the scale of Ukraine&#39;s task. Russian defences are 30km deep in places, bristling with earthworks and tank traps and spattered with mines. Most <small>NATO</small> armies would struggle to punch through comparable lines without complete dominance in the air, which Ukraine, unfortunately, does not enjoy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another problem is that Russia has mounted a <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/07/03/how-ukraines-enemy-is-also-learning-lessons-albeit-slowly">stronger defence</a> than expected, conducting mobile and rapid counter-attacks in response to Ukrainian advances, rather than remaining confined to trenches and fixed positions. Rob Lee, an expert on Russia&#39;s armed forces who recently visited the front lines, notes that Russia&#39;s army has not just executed its doctrine competently, but also innovated, for instance by stacking multiple anti-tank mines on top of one another to destroy mine-clearing vehicles.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine&#39;s inability to breach Russian lines is partly to do with equipment—it needs de-mining kit, air-defence systems and anti-tank missiles capable of blunting Russian counter-attacks from a greater distance. Air power would help a lot, but Western jets, although promised, are not arriving soon. Anyway, the handful that are expected would not themselves give Ukraine control of the skies.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine could, however, make better use of the equipment it does have. Mr Lee describes an occasion when a Ukrainian brigade&#39;s advance was delayed by a couple of hours, until dawn. That not only negated Ukraine&#39;s advantage in night-vision systems, but also meant that the accompanying artillery barrage lifted hours earlier than it should have done. Russian infantry and anti-tank squads, who should have been suppressed by well-timed shellfire, were free to attack. Many such assaults have been stopped even before they reach the main minefields.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This lack of proficiency in co-ordinating complex attacks involving multiple units using different sorts of weapons is hardly surprising. Ukraine&#39;s new brigades were put together in a hurry with unfamiliar equipment. Newly mobilised men were given a month of training in Germany. They have struggled with tasks like reconnaissance, says Mr Lee, with new units becoming disoriented at night time. Co-ordination has also been a problem, with confusion around where friendly units have placed mines. More experienced brigades would have planned for such eventualities, he suggests. It is impossible to tell how Ukrainian forces might have fared had their Western partners equipped and trained them better last summer, rather than waiting until January, or if Ukraine had launched the offensive in the spring, as many of its allies were urging.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine&#39;s partners are not panicking yet. “It is far from a failure, in my view,” said General Milley, when asked whether the offensive had stalled. “I think that it&#39;s way too early to make that kind of call.” Ukraine&#39;s progress was “not catastrophically behind schedule”, said Ben Wallace, Britain&#39;s defence minister, on July 11th. In some places Ukraine&#39;s army was less than 300 metres away from Russia&#39;s main line of defence, he added, with Russian-held towns increasingly coming within range of Ukrainian <small>HIMARS</small> rocket launchers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Optimists point to three factors in Ukraine&#39;s favour. One is that it need not fear a serious Russian counter-attack, despite minor Russian gains in northern Luhansk province in recent days. “There appears now to be little prospect of the Russian forces regaining momentum,” said Richard Moore, the chief of <small>MI6</small> , Britain&#39;s foreign-intelligence service, in a speech on July 19th. That may be one reason why Russia has torn up a <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/18/why-the-death-of-ukraines-grain-deal-is-not-moving-wheat-markets">grain deal</a> and resumed strikes on Ukraine&#39;s ports and grain stores.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Second, Russia&#39;s decision to defend forward, rather than falling back to prepared defences, has slowed down Ukraine&#39;s progress but also left Russia with little mobile reserve in the rear, a point underscored by Yevgeny Prigozhin&#39;s unhindered march to Moscow in June. “Russian reserves are running out,” noted Colonel Margo Grosberg, Estonia&#39;s military-intelligence chief, earlier this month, “as units cannot be rotated from the front.” If Ukraine were to break through into open country—perhaps by more circuitous routes, rather than a frontal attack in Zaporizhia—it could push ahead quickly, say some officials, though they privately acknowledge that Ukraine&#39;s chances of reaching the Sea of Azov are dimming.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The third factor is that Ukraine is chipping away at the basis of Russia&#39;s combat power. On July 11th a Ukrainian strike reportedly killed Oleg Tsokov, a Russian general, in the port city of Berdyansk, suggesting that Ukraine was successfully targeting command posts. In recent days Ukraine has also used British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles to strike air bases and ammunition depots, including in Crimea. One such strike is thought to have destroyed 2,500 tonnes of ammunition, said Mr Wallace. At the same time, Ukraine is increasingly hitting Moscow with drone strikes—the latest occurred on July 24th—with the intention of puncturing the Kremlin&#39;s authority and fanning opposition to the war.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is hard to tell what effect this campaign is having. Franz-Stefan Gady, an expert who visited the front lines with Mr Lee, is sceptical that Ukraine&#39;s attacks are truly dismantling Russia&#39;s command and control or starving it of munitions. In the south, he notes, Ukraine has an advantage in tube artillery (such as howitzers) but Russia is firing plenty of rockets. It also appears to have good intelligence coverage of the battlefield. But with the failure of Ukraine&#39;s initial attempts at breakthrough, the war has become dominated by attrition. Such wars are measured not in kilometres won or lost, but less visible factors such as relative rates of loss and the coherence of each army.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “The war is tactically balanced,” says a Western official closely involved in shaping strategy. Ukraine&#39;s army is highly motivated, he says, and, thanks to America&#39;s decision to provide cluster munitions, well-equipped to keep up the offensive for longer than was originally thought—certainly beyond the summer. Russia&#39;s army has been comfortable on the defence, he says, and will use the time to build new fortifications, but remains brittle. “They are certainly bleeding,” he says. “It could disintegrate.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some American and European military officials argue that Ukrainian commanders have been overly cautious in striking with their new brigades, a mistake that they think Ukraine committed last year in Kherson, when tens of thousands of Russian troops withdrew east over the Dnieper river with their equipment. Ukrainian commanders chafe at the idea that they should gamble their army in circumstances that <small>NATO</small> generals have never faced.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In that sense, the changing character of the offensive—from high-tempo assaults to a more patient approach—reflects both military reality and a deeper shift in identity. A fluid war of manoeuvre was always going to be a stretch for a force cobbled together in a few months. The Russian verb <i>peremalyvat</i> —to grind through—is invoked on both sides. But Ukraine&#39;s junior commanders, having watched their units gutted over the past 18 months, also refuse to send their new citizen army into a meat-grinder in the way that Russia did in Bakhmut. As Ukraine has become more European, suggested Mr Wallace, it has acquired “a Western European caution”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The upside of this aversion to casualties is that many Ukrainian units are in better shape than planners assumed. Brigades that assaulted Russian positions were expected to be left with only a third of their original strength. Thanks in part to well-armoured Western vehicles, they have taken a far lighter knock. If it is to avoid the costly frontal assaults of early June, Ukraine now has little choice but to wear down Russia&#39;s army as best it can using its advantages in long-range precision weapons, aided by copious Western intelligence. “This is going to be long, it&#39;s going to be hard, it&#39;s going to be bloody,” concluded General Milley. “And at the end of the day, we&#39;ll see where the Ukrainians end up.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 18:48:44 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/u63vccf764smnho3it51k4t7bllthmem</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/07/25/is-ukraines-offensive-stalling </item><item><title><![CDATA[What if China and India became friends?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/054%20International%20-%20China-India%20relations-5982909a6343af8347828fdf3bfe70b6.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>C</span> <small>hina&#39;s rulers</small> like to look down on India. They scorn its turbulent politics, its creaky infrastructure and its poverty. <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/04/26/why-indias-population-is-about-to-overtake-chinas">India</a> has looked across with a combination of fear and envy, hoping in vain to be treated <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/06/15/indias-foreign-minister-on-ties-with-america-china-and-russia">as an equal</a> . Now the tectonics of the trans-Himalayan relationship are shifting. Recent border bloodshed suggests mounting hostility. But blossoming economic ties tell a different story that could trouble America and its allies.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> When India&#39;s most revered poet toured China in April 1924, Chinese intellectuals were unimpressed. Rabindranath Tagore had been feted globally as the first non-European Nobel literature laureate. A fierce critic of British rule in India, he hoped to rebuild an ancient cultural bond between Asia&#39;s oldest civilisations.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For leading Chinese thinkers, however, his call for a revival of Eastern values and spirituality rang hollow. The Chinese, they argued, could only resist the West by learning from it—and rejecting their own traditional culture. China&#39;s youth should not become “Indianised”, wrote Chen Duxiu, a co-founder of the Chinese Communist Party. “Unless, that is, they want their coffins to lie one day in a land under the heel of a colonial power.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Almost a century later, a sense of disdain still infuses perceptions of India among Chinese officials and scholars. Just look at the data, they say. At its independence in 1947, India&#39;s <small>GDP</small> per head was higher than China&#39;s (on a purchasing-power basis). But by the early 1990s, China had moved ahead on that and many other measures. By 2022, their populations were roughly equal but China&#39;s economy was more than three times bigger.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China&#39;s generals tend to dismiss India, too. China&#39;s crushing victory in a border war in 1962 is recalled with pride. And they contrast China&#39;s current arsenal of home-grown modern weaponry with India&#39;s continuing reliance on Russian imports. “There&#39;s no way that India can catch up with China in the next 20-30 years,” says Senior Colonel Zhao Xiaozhuo of China&#39;s Academy of Military Science.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet the fundamentals of the China-India relationship—military and economic—are now changing in ways that are forcing the world&#39;s biggest democracy and its largest autocracy to reassess how they deal with each other, and with the rest of the world. The hope among American and allied officials is that India&#39;s continuing frontier friction with China is pushing it irreversibly into a democratic coalition determined to constrain Chinese power. The question is: what if they find a way to shelve the border dispute? </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRM987.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Consider the military equation first. India has been drawing closer to America since they signed a civil nuclear co-operation pact in 2008. But their alignment has accelerated since a series of clashes on the Indian frontier with China, including one in 2020 that killed 20 Indian troops and at least four Chinese ones. That was the bloodiest skirmish there since 1967 and brought to an end a three-decade period of relative stability on the border.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> India&#39;s armed forces have since undergone a historic shift of focus away from Pakistan. They have transferred about 70,000 troops as well as fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles to the frontier with China. They have also expanded joint exercises with America and its allies, especially Australia and Japan. America has provided some intelligence and high-altitude training for Indian border forces too.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The war in Ukraine has provided another spur. Indian commanders fret about their dependence on Russian arms. India wants to buy advanced American weaponry and to make more in India. In Washington in June the prime minister, Narendra Modi, made progress, with deals to buy armed aerial drones and to jointly manufacture fighter-jet engines in India.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China&#39;s exact motivations on the border are murky. It may have been responding to recent Indian road-building, which enabled more extensive patrolling, or to frustration at a lack of progress in negotiations on a settlement. Or it may have wanted to penalise India for its earlier rapprochement with America, to expose the relative weakness of Indian forces and to show that they cannot rely on American help.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China sees itself as in another league from India, competing directly with America, says Deependra Singh Hooda, a former chief of the Indian Army&#39;s Northern Command, which oversees part of the Chinese border. China&#39;s message appears to be: “You&#39;re no match for the <small>PLA</small> (People&#39;s Liberation Army)…You&#39;re just a sideshow.”</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> A two-sided triangle</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For whatever reason, Xi Jinping, China&#39;s leader, seems to think the fallout manageable. India&#39;s redeployments mean it can impose greater costs on China if it tries another border incursion. But China will for years keep enough military superiority to deter India from trying to recoup any perceived losses (see chart 1). And though India can help America in some areas, notably the Indian Ocean, it balks at a formal alliance and is unlikely to join a conflict over Taiwan or the South China Sea. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC895.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nonetheless, Mr Xi has strong incentives to stabilise the border, as America steps up efforts to circumscribe Chinese power. So does Mr Modi. He seems keen to play down the frontier issue, knowing he has few military options. He is wary of drawing domestic attention to any perceived loss of territory. And compromise seems possible. After 18 rounds of talks between military commanders, troops have pulled back from five flashpoints, establishing “buffer zones” where neither side patrols. Two major flashpoints remain.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China is pushing for another round of talks and urging India not to let the border issue define the bilateral relationship. India&#39;s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, met his Chinese counterpart in Jakarta on July 14th and discussed the frontier. In recent weeks he has stressed that without a peaceful and stable border, normal business ties cannot be resumed. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230722_IRC863.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A survey of the economic landscape, however, puts such Indian warnings in perspective. Commerce between China and India was negligible for most of their modern history. But by 2020 trade in goods had surged to $88bn, with China enjoying a surplus of $46bn and ranking as India&#39;s biggest trade partner (see chart 2). China had also become a big source of investment, notably in technology, property and infrastructure. Chinese brands are popular, too. Oppo and Xiaomi are among the bestselling mobile phones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The border skirmish in 2020 put that all at risk. India banned some 320 Chinese apps, launched tax raids on several Chinese companies and introduced new rules requiring the Indian government&#39;s approval for Chinese investments. Indian officials say they since have rejected 157 relevant applications. And yet bilateral goods trade grew by 43% in 2021 and 8.6% last year. Chinese investment is finding ways in too, sometimes via Singapore. Shein, a Chinese online fashion company whose app was among those banned by India in 2020, is relaunching there soon in partnership with Reliance Industries, India&#39;s biggest private company.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Indian officials want to rely less on Chinese imports and to woo more investment from elsewhere, notably big multinational manufacturers looking for an alternative to China. “We need to stop looking for a China fix,” Mr Jaishankar, the Indian foreign minister, said in May. “Indian growth cannot be built on Chinese efficiency.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Privately, though, many of India&#39;s business leaders predict that it will depend on Chinese imports for years to come if the Indian government is to achieve its goals in developing infrastructure and manufacturing. India&#39;s pharmaceutical industry, for instance, relies on China for roughly 70% of its active ingredients.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That does, in theory, make India vulnerable to the kind of economic coercion that China has inflicted on others. But China&#39;s leverage may be waning as it faces an economic slowdown, a shrinking population and an increasingly hostile West. Chinese companies now see India, whose population overtook China&#39;s this year, as an important source of growth, with Goldman Sachs predicting that Indian <small>GDP</small> will be second only to China&#39;s by 2075.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There are economic synergies in other areas too. India is the biggest borrower from the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which China set up in 2016 as an alternative to Western-led lending institutions. India is also a member of the Shanghai-based New Development Bank, formed by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (the <small>BRICS</small> ) in 2015.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Hearty economic exchanges are no guarantee against further border bloodshed—or even war. Both countries are led by men who feed off nationalism and historical grievances. Other tensions include China&#39;s growing influence in South Asia, its damming upstream of rivers vital to India, and the sanctuary that India affords the Dalai Lama, Tibet&#39;s spiritual leader.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Still, the burgeoning business ties will weigh ever heavier in both sides&#39; decision-making. And stabilising the border issue, as was achieved for three decades after Rajiv Gandhi visited China as Indian prime minister in 1988, would leave ample room for co-operation. Both countries want a bigger role in global governance, reject Western criticism on human rights and climate change and share concerns about Islamic extremism. Both refuse to condemn Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Also noteworthy is that before the recent frontier flare-up, Mr Modi seemed determined to build a close relationship with Mr Xi, taking the unusual step of hosting him in his home state of Gujarat in 2014. India and China shared similar aspirations, challenges and opportunities, Mr Modi said in Beijing the following year. “In the global uncertainties of our times, we can reinforce each other&#39;s progress.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such a prospect may not please Americans and others who see India as a counterweight to China. Nor is it what Tagore had in mind in 1924, when he urged China to reject Western materialism and “free the human soul from the dungeon of the machine”. But it may be the more realistic path towards a sustainable, mutually beneficial relationship between Asia&#39;s titans. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 19 Jul 2023 17:59:05 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/kc44bjfhd4f8j99lm2b44phuarvuu6cp</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/07/19/what-if-china-and-india-became-friends</item></channel></rss>
