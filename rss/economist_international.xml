e190yofl0"> <span>“我们</span><small>将消灭</small>哈马斯。我们会取得胜利。这可能需要时间，但我们将比以往更强大地结束这场战争。”以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡的话不仅是为了表达决心，也是为了表明<a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/11/netanyahu-wages-war-and-fights-for-his-own-survival">他在加沙的战争</a>是不同的。以色列的目的不再是惩罚和威慑<a href="https://www.economist.com/films/2023/10/13/what-is-hamas">哈马斯</a>。现在它想彻底摧毁它。</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">了解有关以色列和哈马斯之间战争的更多信息</p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这是一个艰巨的任务。哈马斯同时是一个宗教理念、一个社会运动、一个政党、一个政府和一个与恐怖主义结合的混合民兵组织。无论加沙发生什么，哈马斯仍然是西岸强大的政治力量。在私下谈话中，以色列军方官员对目标的定义更为狭隘：夺取主要城市中心加沙城；消灭哈马斯在该领土的最高政治和军事领导层；并尽可能多地摧毁其军事能力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">鉴于加沙地下有广泛的隧道网络，这可能需要数周甚至数月的挨家挨户的战斗。 2017年，在伊拉克和叙利亚，当地军队在西方空军和数千名西方军队的支持下，在摩苏尔街头度过了277天，在拉卡度过了90天，与伊斯兰国圣战分子作战。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列前总理<a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/15/ehud-barak-blames-binyamin-netanyahu-for-the-greatest-failure-in-israels-history">埃胡德·巴拉克</a>认为，以色列面临四个制约因素。其中三个是关于战争的：如何在人质存在的情况下进行战斗，如何避免黎巴嫩真主党民兵卷入的两线战争，以及随着巴勒斯坦苦难的加剧，国际支持不可避免地受到侵蚀，如何管理时间。第四个问题是战斗结束后的第二天：“我们可以将火炬传递给谁？”巴拉克先生问道。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最后一个问题是一个棘手的问题，内塔尼亚胡先生没有给出答案。哈马斯10月7日的袭击表明，以色列通过封锁陆地和海上边界从外部控制领土的政策是危险的。然而，事实证明，过去对拥有超过 200 万人口的加沙的占领成本太高，难以维持。在哈马斯和其他民兵组织的暴力压力下，以色列于 2005 年从该领土撤出了最后一批军队和犹太定居者。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果没有可行的“后天”安全和政治战略，任何军事胜利都可能化为泡影。 “记住阿富汗。记住伊拉克。记住黎巴嫩，”巴拉克在美国智库卡内基国际和平基金会最近的一次网络研讨会上警告说。他指的是1982年以色列入侵黎巴嫩、2001年美国入侵阿富汗和2003年入侵伊拉克。这三起事件都是由恐怖主义行为挑起的。这三个国家都在最初的军事上取得了巨大的成功。这三件事都变成了严重的政治崩溃。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">华盛顿特区智库美国企业研究所的肯尼思·波拉克 (Kenneth Pollack) 表示，“以色列人的处境与我们美国人在 9/11 事件后的处境相同”。 “我们非常愤怒，也非常害怕。我们真正关注的只是消灭任何威胁我们的人，而对接下来发生的事情却没有给予足够的关注。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><b>发生了哪些反恐战争</b></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国的“全球反恐战争”胜利打响。 2001年9月基地组织袭击美国仅两个月后，美国领导的部队就控制了阿富汗首都喀布尔。塔利班政府已经不复存在了。基地组织遭到追捕。其领导人奥萨马·本·拉登 (Osama bin Laden) 于 2011 年被追踪到巴基斯坦并被击毙。但塔利班却与日益壮大的叛乱活动作斗争。美国在失去 2,400 多名军事人员后于 2021 年撤离。阿富汗政府几乎立即垮台，塔利班重新掌权。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px"

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">伊拉克战争也是不光彩的，而且更加血腥。 2003年4月，美国军队再次迅速占领首都巴格达。布什总统在<i>亚伯拉罕·林肯号</i>航空母舰的飞行甲板上昂首阔步，上面写着“任务完成”。事实上，该国即将陷入内战。美军抓获了伊拉克独裁者萨达姆·侯赛因，但很快就面临逊尼派和什叶派民兵的血腥叛乱。美军于 2011 年撤出，但在 2014 年以较小规模的部队返回，帮助击退伊斯兰国占领伊拉克和叙利亚大片地区（见图表）。总共，美国失去了大约 4,500 名军人，更不用说大约 30 万伊拉克人死亡，其中大多数是平民。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对于美国智库华盛顿阿拉伯海湾国家研究所的侯赛因·伊比什来说，教训是显而易见的。他认为，恐怖分子和叛乱组织诉诸大规模暴力来引发非理性反应：“他们知道，他们对主导力量造成的伤害是有限的。他们明白，主导力量对自己造成的伤害是无限大的。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列自身的历史也提出了类似的警告。 1982年6月，在以色列北部边境炮火交火的紧张停火期间，以及巴勒斯坦保护伞组织巴勒斯坦解放组织（<small>巴解组织</small>）发动的一系列其他袭击中，枪手开枪打伤了以色列驻伦敦大使。以色列政府将此次袭击视为入侵黎巴嫩并解散<small>巴解组织的</small><i>宣战理由</i>，尽管这次袭击是其竞争对手阿布·尼达尔组织所为。以色列军队围困贝鲁特西部的<small>巴解组织</small>，迫使其领导人亚西尔·阿拉法特和数千名战士扬帆流亡。以色列的基督教盟友巴希尔·杰马耶勒当选黎巴嫩总统。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然后一切都崩溃了。杰马耶勒被炸毁。在以色列军队的注视下，他的长枪党战士通过杀害萨布拉和查蒂拉难民营中的巴勒斯坦人来进行报复。以色列调查委员会发现，以色列国防部长阿里尔·沙龙负有间接责任，因此他被降职。一年之内，在反战抗议的压力下，总理梅纳赫姆·贝京宣布辞职。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">黎巴嫩纷争的影响之一是<small>巴解组织</small>被更强大的什叶派民兵真主党取代，真主党于 2000 年成功将以色列赶出黎巴嫩。另一个影响是对以色列占领的约旦河西岸和加沙地带的巴勒斯坦人。他们的第一次起义，即“摆脱”，是 1987 年开始的投掷石块的起义，为 1993 年以色列与<small>巴解组织</small>之间达成奥斯陆协议奠定了基础。次年，阿拉法特凯旋返回加沙。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">哈马斯成为暴力拒绝主义的主要力量。它效仿真主党的自杀策略，极大地破坏了奥斯陆协定。 2005年，它迫使以色列撤出加沙，并在2006年赢得了巴勒斯坦立法选举。次年，它驱逐了<small>巴解组织</small>创建的巴勒斯坦权力机构（ <small>PA</small> ）。阿拉法特于 2004 年去世；被困在西岸的一些自治领土上；由于无法通过谈判在建国方面取得进展，<small>巴勒斯坦权力机构</small>因陷入独裁和腐败而迅速声名狼藉。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><b>威慑理论</b></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">自2006年以来，以色列的战争一直以惩罚和威慑为基础，其目的不是消灭敌人，而是付出惨重代价，以阻止哈马斯和真主党等组织攻击以色列。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，威慑力却很难衡量。就真主党而言，自 2006 年黎巴嫩上一次大规模战争以来，这场战争一直在持续，当时真主党的一次跨境袭击导致两名以色列士兵被俘。战斗导致了大范围的破坏，特别是在贝鲁特的什叶派社区达希耶。真主党领导人哈桑·纳斯鲁拉后来承认，如果他知道以色列的反应会如此严厉，他就不会下令发动袭击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但在加沙，平静的时间较短。以色列进行了一些人所说的“割草”，即定期打击哈马斯以削弱其实力。为了应对哈马斯的火箭弹袭击，以色列军队主要依靠报复性轰炸以及铁穹防空系统的保护。地面部队只是不情愿地进入加沙。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">威慑力一直有效，直到突然间它不再有效。伊比什先生指出，哈马斯 10 月 7 日的杀戮“也许是以色列和巴勒斯坦 100 年来冲突中最残酷的行动”。然而，以色列正在落入哈马斯的“陷阱”，进行残酷的报复。伊比什表示，这场战斗将使国际社会对以色列的同情转向巴勒斯坦人，让哈马斯声称领导巴勒斯坦事业，并破坏以色列和沙特阿拉伯之间和解的前景。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">以色列没有心情克制。忘记割草；它想要消灭。但这种连根拔起又产生了一个新问题。 “如果你要消灭哈马斯，这是一个政治问题，而不是军事问题，”伦敦国王学院的劳伦斯·弗里德曼说。 “你必须建立一些东西，否则哈马斯就会卷土重来。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 1982 年以色列人在黎巴嫩，以及 2001 年之后美国人在阿富汗和伊拉克，都有实地盟友和日复一日的计划，但事实证明这些计划是有缺陷的。今天在加沙，以色列正在独自行动。巴勒斯坦<small>权力机构</small>很弱，不可能乘坐以色列坦克返回加沙。大多数阿拉伯政府对哈马斯没什么好感，也没有勇气让人们看到他们与以色列密谋反对它。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “我不在乎接下来会发生什么，”以色列智库贝京-萨达特战略研究中心主任埃坦·沙米尔说。 “无论是什么，首先要摧毁哈马斯。”他指出，盟军对纳粹发动了战争，直到后来才制定了管理战后德国的计划。在他看来，美国和以色列的不幸始于他们开始干涉当地政治而不是立即离开。此外，沙米尔表示，美国的经验与以色列没有多大关系。它参与了远征战争，可以将军队带回家：“以色列完全不同。我们正在为我们的家园而战。我们别无选择。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对于许多像沙米尔一样认为和平在可预见的未来遥不可及的以色列人来说，唯一的选择就是继续严厉打击敌人，直到他们消失或改变。他们说，如果当前的战争给以色列带来了几年的平静，那就足够了。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，以色列并没有放手一搏。国际法和有时国内舆论限制了其反应的严厉程度。它依靠西方特别是美国来抵御国际压力，但它的支持并不是无限的。美国“支持以色列”的承诺可能会使其成为以色列行动的同谋，从而损害其在该地区和其他地方的利益。举个例子：阿拉伯评论员已经将美国对俄罗斯在乌克兰的暴行的谴责与对以色列轰炸加沙的容忍进行了比较。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这些担忧解释了为什么国务卿安东尼·布林肯一直在中东地区穿梭，寻求开辟一条人道主义走廊，允许重要物资进入加沙，并至少允许一些人进入埃及。不过，就目前而言，布林肯对后哈马斯世界的看法大多是陈词滥调：“一个国家团结在一起、一体化、关系正常化的地区，人们为了共同利益而为共同目标而努力。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">解决方案并不容易。现在更有理由考虑这个问题。 2003 年负责在伊拉克组建新政府的美国将军杰伊·加纳 (Jay Garner) 抱怨道，第二次世界大战期间的美国陆军参谋长乔治·马歇尔 (George Marshall) 花了两年多的时间为后希特勒德国制定计划，而他却在只有几个月的时间来为后萨达姆时代的伊拉克做准备。以色列和世界可能没有多少时间为加沙哈马斯之后的情况做准备。

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>“我们</span><small>需要</small>成为地球的好管家。但这并不意味着我需要放弃我的燃油汽车，转而使用来自中国的电池的电动汽车，”密歇根州共和党主席克里斯蒂娜·卡拉莫 (Kristina Karamo) 9 月 22 日表示。她警告说，美国民主党正试图“说服我们，如果我们不将权力集中在政府手中，地球就会灭亡。这似乎是达尔文进化论以来最大的骗局之一。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">人们很容易将卡拉莫女士视为无关紧要的怪人，但她并非无关紧要。她代表了一场正在世界各地加速发展的运动的极端派别：对亲气候政策的强烈抵制。其中一位更为人们所熟悉的啦啦队员可能会成为美国的下一任总统。 9 月 27 日，唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 表示：“你可以忠于美国劳工，也可以忠于环保疯子，但你不可能真正忠于两者……狡猾的乔（拜登）站在左翼疯子一边，他们会摧毁汽车制造业，就会摧毁我们的国家本身。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 9 月 20 日，英国首相里希·苏纳克 (Rishi Sunak) 宣布削弱净零排放目标，其中包括将禁止销售新汽油汽车的禁令推迟五年。两周前，德国搁置了一项在未来几年实施严格的绿色家庭供暖规则的提案。法国爆发了针对高油价的大规模抗议活动，有一天可能会选举玛丽娜·勒庞为总统，她对风电场表示遗憾，并认为能源转型应该“慢得多”。在美国，气候变化已成为文化战争的战场：在最近的共和党总统候选人辩论中，只有一位候选人承认人为气候变化是真实存在的。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这一切对于遏制全球碳排放来说是多么严重的障碍？英国谢菲尔德大学的迈克尔·雅各布斯看到了谨慎乐观的理由。作为世界上最大的排放国，中国了解脱碳的必要性，并正在大力投资太阳能和风能。第二大排放国美国在拜登的领导下实现了绿色转型。巴西解雇了一位砍伐雨林的总统；澳大利亚抛弃了一位溺爱煤炭的总理。近四分之一的排放量现在受到碳定价的影响。创新的步伐令人印象深刻。两年前，全球机构国际能源署估计，到 2050 年实现净零排放所需的近 50% 的减排量将来自尚未商业化的技术。 9月份，该公司称这一数字已降至35%。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px"

e190yofl0">政治暗流则不太令人放心。选民们意识到，重塑整个全球经济将具有破坏性。一些人（少数）质疑人为造成的气候变化正在发生。其他人反对为解决这个问题而采取的某些政策，因为它们给普通公民带来了成本，或者给他们过度紧张的日常生活增添了麻烦。有些人，尤其是老年人，根本不喜欢改变，尤其是当这意味着今天要大惊小怪，以换取他们可能无法活着看到的好处时。即使在那些认为需要采取行动的人中，对于谁应该承担这一负担也存在不同的看法。许多人宁愿它落在别人身上。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在过去的野火烧焦的十年里，人们对气候变化危险的认识似乎有所提高。美国智库皮尤研究中心对12个富裕国家进行的民意调查显示，除韩国外，认为这是“重大威胁”的受访者比例均有所上升（韩国的比例本来就很高（见图1））。除以色列外，世界各地绝大多数人都同意这一描述。但这并不意味着他们愿意缴纳更多税收来帮助防止气候变化（见图2）。民意调查机构益普索(Ipsos)对29个国家进行的一项调查显示，只有30%的受访者表示愿意吐槽。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">排挤</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">也许最令人担忧的是，甚至在科学问题上也出现了党派分歧。在皮尤 2022 年调查的所有 14 个富裕国家中，政治右翼人士将气候变化视为主要威胁的可能性低于左翼人士（见图 3）。在澳大利亚、加拿大、德国、荷兰和瑞典，差距非常大：在 22 到 44 个百分点之间。在美国，这是令人瞠目结舌的 63 分。 YouGov 为<i>《经济学人》</i>进行的一项新民意调查发现，虽然 87% 的拜登选民认为气候变化是由人类活动引起的，但只有 21% 的特朗普选民同意这一观点。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt

（公众舆论在独裁国家也很重要，但这超出了本文的范围。）尤其是在富裕的民主国家，民粹主义政客加剧了气候分歧，他们对待真正的问题（例如成本和破坏）并夸大了它们，同时声称实施绿色政策的精英并不关心普通驾车者，因为他们骑自行车上班。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">民粹主义往往会以多种方式破坏有效的气候政策。首先，民粹主义者常常对专家持怀疑态度。卡拉莫女士表示，当人们说“相信专家”时，他们真正的意思是：“你太愚蠢了，无法对自己的生活做出决定。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其次，民粹主义者对全球机构和外国人持怀疑态度。共和党总统候选人维韦克·拉马斯瓦米 (Vivek Ramaswamy) 表示：“我们向电动汽车制造商提供的每一项补贴实际上都是对（中国共产党）的补贴，因为我们对它们的依赖就像套在我们脖子上的绞索一样。”华盛顿<small>特区</small>美利坚大学的丹·菲奥里诺认为，这种态度不利于缓解气候变化，因为“气候政策既是经济政策的问题，也是外交关系的问题。” </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “他们说，购买电动汽车时最快乐的一天是驾驶它的前十分钟，然后，因为担心而感到恐慌。我到底该去哪里收取费用才能让这件事继续下去？恐慌！”他告诉密歇根州的工人。 “如果你想买一辆电动汽车，那绝对没问题……但我们不应该强迫消费者购买电动汽车……不存在公平过渡到生活方式终结这样的事情。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果特朗普在2024年连任，他将再次退出气候变化《巴黎协定》。他还将撤销有关甲烷排放等问题的行政命令。他可能无法废除拜登的大型气候法（被误导性地称为《减少通货膨胀法》），该法涉及巨额补贴，深受红州和蓝州接受者的欢迎。但他会任命可能阻碍其实施的官僚。马基表示，至少，美国将在关键时刻停止在气候变化问题上发挥领导作用。 “你不能坐在高脚凳上宣扬节制。如果你作为一个国家不做正确的事，你就无法告诉其他国家做正确的事。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">类似的反对绿化的争论也在欧洲扎根。即使民粹主义政党不在政府中，他们也可以影响政府。在瑞典，只有 4% 的人认为气候变化“不是威胁”，但中右翼执政联盟在过去一年中仍多次削减化石燃料税。原因之一是，如果没有拥有20%议会席位的民粹主义瑞典民主党的支持，它就无法通过预算。民粹主义者想要更便宜的燃料。许多瑞典选民也是如此。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">瑞典 Facebook 群组“Fuel Rebellion”拥有 60 万名会员。该组织领导人之一佩德·布洛姆·博肯希尔姆 (Peder Blohm Bokenhielm) 表示，汽车“一直是他生活的重要组成部分”。他的父亲将美国野马和护卫舰进口到瑞典。他小时候的第一个词是“汽车”。他也有反对高燃油税的实际理由。他说，在瑞典的一个小村庄，“没有商店，每天只有两辆公共汽车”。 “如果你想买杂货，你需要一辆车。”充电站还不是到处都有，在一个长途旅行、被困在雪地里很危险的国家里，汽车的续航里程很重要。不要让人们开始了解家庭取暖的费用。博肯希尔姆表示，政客们维持高油价“让人们更难住在自己想住的地方”。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">正确的方式？</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">今年在德国，极右翼德国另类选择党 ( <small>AfD</small> ) 通过猛烈抨击包括绿党<small>在内</small>的执政联盟的能源政策，在民意调查中取得了上升，并在 10 月 8 日的州选举中表现出色。它说他们将使国家“贫穷”。<small>德国</small>选择<small>党</small>受到主流政党的排斥，但中右翼却借用了它的论点。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在没有足够熟练的安装人员安装热泵之前，绿党计划几乎强制实施绿色家庭供暖，这损害了他们自己的事业。住户很难找到商人。政府在 9 月份做出了让步，并延长了最后期限，但政治损失已经造成。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">现在在德国，攻击绿党的不仅仅是极右翼分子。他们的集会遭到石块、鸡蛋和侮辱的投掷。巴伐利亚主要中右翼政党基督教社会联盟 ( <small>CSU</small> ) 的马丁·胡贝尔 (Martin Huber) 告诉<i>《经济学人》</i> ，绿党所做的就是制定<i>Verbotsgesetze</i> （禁止事物的法律）。在距离慕尼黑 40 公里的安德赫斯 (Andechs) 一个美丽村庄的一次集会上，<small>基社盟主</small>席马库斯·索德 (Markus Söder) 的一系列刺拳引得喝得醉醺醺的啤酒节人群大笑。当灯光突然变亮时，他打趣道：“所以至少他们仍在从柏林向我们输送电力。”一位年长的支持者说：“我用木头给房子取暖。我怎样才能负担得起改变这一点，为什么我要在晚年改变这一点呢？”</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">不符合他们的口味</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在英国，保守党首相采用了民粹主义的主要主题。在上个月的一次演讲中，苏纳克强调，他赞成遏制排放，但谴责英国设定气候目标的方式“没有就如何实现目标进行任何有意义的民主辩论”。 （他的政党自 2010 年以来一直执政。）他还感叹绿色政策“将带来不可接受的成本”。他列出了具体的、令人恐惧的金额。 “对于住在达灵顿联排别墅的家庭来说，[热泵]的前期成本可能约为 10,000 英镑（12,200 美元）。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">他发誓要废除从未认真考虑过的计划：“对吃肉征税……强制汽车共享[以及]政府命令将垃圾分类到七个不同的垃圾箱”。他打出了民族主义牌。 “当我们在全球排放量中所占的份额还不到 1% 时，英国公民被告知要比其他人做出更多的牺牲，这怎么可能是正确的呢？” （英国人不到全球人口的 1%。）</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Rishi 是在玩火，”伦敦大学学院的迈克尔·格鲁布 (Michael Grubb) 说。企业渴望可预测的政策，以便制定长期计划。 “让气候变化成为文化战争的一部分将削弱投资者的信心。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">荷兰乌得勒支大学的詹姆斯·帕特森认为，当环保主义者做得太过分时，有时会出现反绿色的强烈抵制。例如，制定的政策具有强制性，以至于许多人认为这些政策是非法的。这已经发生在荷兰。当政府开始惩罚排放过多氮的农场时，一个新的民粹主义政党“BoerBurgerBeweging”（农民公民运动）迅速声名鹊起。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">氮气不是温室气体；问题在于，荷兰大型集约化农场生产的肥料（来自化肥和牛粪）足以威胁到重要的自然保护区。政府希望收购农民的股份，导致牲畜数量减少五分之一到一半。这种专横激起了乡村的愤怒，全国各地的拖拉机抗议和农场倒挂国旗。在这个只有 2.2% 的人口从事农业的国家，农民公民运动在今年的省级选举中获得了 20% 的选票。在 11 月 22 日的大选中，更环保的政党预计将获得重击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对于大多数发展中国家来说，与富裕国家相比，气候变化在国内政治中的争议性较小。精英们对此进行了讨论——政府希望获得工业化世界过去排放量的补偿，并吸引能源转型投资。但在印度或非洲的选举期间，这个话题几乎没有被提及。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，发展中国家的选民对生活成本的上涨比富裕国家的选民更加敏感。因此，他们经常抵制他们认为会破坏预算的政策。因此，削减化石燃料补贴非常困难，根据<small>国际货币基金组织的数据</small>，到 2022 年，化石燃料补贴将高达 1.3 万亿美元（占全球<small>GDP</small>的 1.3%）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">此类施舍如此受欢迎，以至于它们对环境造成的危害很少有足够的动机让政府摆脱它们。尼日利亚新任总统博拉·蒂努布今年取消了燃料补贴，不是因为它鼓励人们燃烧碳，而是因为以低于市场的价格出售汽油正在使财政部破产。到 2022 年，它的成本将达到 100 亿美元，这家国有石油公司已经没有什么可以留给联邦政府了，而它通常是联邦政府最大的资金来源。取消补贴可以腾出数十亿美元用于公共服务，并带来减少排放的令人高兴的副作用。然而，存在恢复它的压力。随着油价上涨，一些人担心补贴将悄然重新引入。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">印度尼西亚和印度等一些中等收入国家正在燃烧更多的化石燃料，尽管它们试图将自己重塑为绿色大国。印度政府计划到本十年末将可再生能源发电能力提高两倍。它还宣布暂停新建燃煤电厂，并致力于成为绿色氢的大型生产商。这是个好消息，但似乎至少与对气候变化的担忧一样，是由对能源安全的担忧推动的：去年的绿色氢战略提到了到 2047 年实现“能源独立”的计划，然后再实现“净零排放”的目标。 2070 年。尽管印度暂停了新建燃煤电厂的建设，但去年印度煤炭产量仍增长了 14.8%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">国家安全论点可以刺激绿色投资。建设风电场可以减少对能源进口的依赖，这是许多政界人士强调的一点。但如果这些论点也促使政府对外国投入设置壁垒，那么能源转型的成本就会更高。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">从绿色角度来看，过去一年进步最大的中等收入大国可能是巴西。但它也很复杂。在 1 月份上任的总统路易斯·伊纳西奥·卢拉·达席尔瓦 (Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva) 的领导下，今年前 8 个月亚马逊地区的森林砍伐量与 2022 年同期相比累计下降了 48%，当时他热爱伐木的前任雅伊尔·博尔索纳罗 (Jair Bolsonaro)负责。不过，卢拉也支持巴西国家石油公司（Petrobras）提出的到 2030 年将产量从每天 290 万桶增加到 520 万桶的计划。但他的绿色计划遇到了阻力。在国会，594 名立法者中有 347 名属于农业企业核心小组，其成员担心绿党阻碍发展。国会限制了环境部的权力。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">播撒不满情绪</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在大多数发展中国家，净零目标还遥遥无期，选民还没有被要求为实现这些目标做出巨大牺牲。对于许多人来说，气候变化本身造成的危害是一个更大的担忧。例如，根据耶鲁大学的一项调查，74% 的印度人表示他们经历过全球变暖的影响，而 2011 年这一比例为 50%。 “由于极端高温和降雨，我们的庄稼损失惨重，而且过去几年情况变得更糟，”德里的农场工人希夫·库马里 (Shiv Kumari) 说，他的田地今年夏天被洪水淹没。这种创伤转化为对绿色政策的更大支持：55%的印度人表示印度应该立即减少排放，而不需要等待其他国家采取行动，这一比例高于2011年的36%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在全球范围内，创新最终将缓解引发如此多反气候反弹的抱怨。伦敦经济学院的尼古拉斯·斯特恩表示：“在经济的许多领域，清洁的成本已经比肮脏的成本低，而且这些领域只会变得越来越大。”但这种情况发生的速度有多快非常重要。许多绿色技术需要大量的前期投资，当利率高时，这会变得更加困难。这尤其影响到贫困世界。 “看看非洲。如果支付 15% 的利息，风能和太阳能发电并不比化石燃料便宜，尽管它们便宜 7% 或 8%，”斯特恩教授说。他建议向多边贷款机构提供大力支持，以吸引其他资金来源。 “最不现实和最危险的事情就是慢慢来，”他说。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs

satisfaction with “democracy”, the lowest share since at least 2014. The backing for potential strongmen or deep dissatisfaction with democracy was common across the coup belt, but also in relatively stable places, including Botswana and South Africa (see chart 2). Afropopulism, for want of a better phrase, is an increasingly potent force.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Why is there such widespread discontent? Africans are frustrated with the sham that passes for “democracy” in most countries. They are also fed up with flimsy states that provide neither security nor prosperity. Around two-thirds of them, as well as majorities in 28 of 36 polled countries, feel their countries are heading in the wrong direction. Should this continue, many Africans, especially younger ones, may be tempted to reconsider shabby social contracts—and look for radical change. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">The most important failure is the provision of security. African states are often strong in areas where they ought to be weak and weak where they ought to be strong. Many regimes are adept at beating or locking up opponents, but inept at stopping their citizens from being robbed or killed. As a consequence, those promising to restore security, however ruthlessly, can gain support from ordinary citizens.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Although some African wars in the late 20th century were much deadlier, the overall number of African conflicts is rising, according to a paper published last year by the Peace Research Institute Oslo. It noted that small conflicts caused more deaths in 2021 than at any point since its data began in 1989. The number of conflicts in which at least one side is a state was higher in 2021 than a decade earlier.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Mounting chaos</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Since 2021 things have become only bloodier. In Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, a trio of countries where jihadists linked to al-Qaeda and Islamic State run riot, deaths in conflict have risen from under 800 in 2016 to over 10,000 in 2022. It is no coincidence that all three have gone from being largely democratic to suffering coups in the 2020s. Putschists have sought to justify their takeovers and gained support by pointing to insecurity under democracy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As the jihadist chaos spills into coastal states, political chaos could follow. Togo, for example, has a dynastic dictatorship like the one recently toppled in Gabon: the Gnassingbé family has run the country for 56 years. And it faces growing jihadist insecurity—at least 140 people have been killed since July 2022.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In Nigeria, Africa&#39;s most populous country, jihadists terrorise the north-east, gangs kidnap hundreds at a time in the north-west and armed separatists pillage the south-east. Clashes between farmers and herders in the centre add to the bloodshed. More than 10,000 people died in conflict in the country in both of 2021 and 2022. This year will be almost as bad. <small>ACLED</small> , a conflict-tracking group, rates Nigeria as having the fifth-most extreme violence globally, behind Ukraine.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nigeria&#39;s political class, lounging in well-guarded mansions, is out of touch. Turnout in this year&#39;s election was 29%, the lowest ever. More than 40% of Nigerians think it would be legitimate for the armed forces to take over in the event of abuses of power by elected leaders. Before the election senior Nigerian political figures told <i>The Economist</i> they had heard of coup-plotting. That is a troubling development, given that the country was run (abysmally) by military dictators for much of the second half of the 20th century.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Harsh ingredients</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Other large countries are riven with conflict. Though the civil war centred on Ethiopia&#39;s Tigray region may be over, clashes in Amhara and Oromia spiral on. Resurgent violence in the east of Congo has caused almost 3m people to flee from their homes since March 2022. In April 2023 Sudan plunged into civil war. All three countries are among Africa&#39;s ten most populous. In every place people will seek protection where they think they can find it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Insecurity is felt beyond war zones. In a poll of 30 countries around the world released last month by Open Society Foundations, an <small>NGO</small> network, four of the five countries with the highest share of respondents fearing political violence were African: Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa. The latter&#39;s murder rate, among the highest in the world, is rising again. Lawlessness increases support for populists and vigilantes. And 72% of South Africans would swap elected governments for a crime-bashing strongman. One former cabinet minister, who campaigned against apartheid, praises Paul Kagame for Rwanda&#39;s apparent lack of crime (but says less about its abuses of human rights). “Kagame has the right idea: sometimes you need to crack the whip.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Economic stagnation compounds the political crisis. From 1990 to 2018 the number of people living in extreme poverty in sub-Saharan Africa rose from 284m to 433m, as population growth often outstripped the economic sort. The region has lost another decade: real <small>GDP</small> per person was lower in 2022 than ten years earlier.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Households and governments are also facing a tightening financial squeeze. The median inflation rate in sub-Saharan Africa has more than doubled since the start of the pandemic. In a region where food makes up 40% of consumption, there is double-digit food-price inflation in 80% of countries. Some 17% of government revenues will be spent on servicing external debt this year, the highest share since 1999.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Job creation” is by far the most-cited priority by 18- to 35-year-olds in Afrobarometer polls. The Mo Ibrahim Foundation, a British <small>NGO</small> , reckons that 18m formal jobs must be created annually to absorb the numbers entering the labour force; the current figure is 3m. Almost half of 18- to 24-year-olds in 15 countries surveyed last year by the Africa Youth Survey, a poll by a South African charity, said they were thinking of emigrating. Young Nigerians talk of “adulthood na scam” and hunt ways to <i>japa</i> , Yoruba slang for to emigrate.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Earlier this year Hakainde Hichilema, whom the West sees as a rare liberal on the continent, warned his outside champions that African democrats need to secure material results or they will face political consequences. “[Y]ou can&#39;t eat democracy,” argued Zambia&#39;s president in an opinion piece urging foreign creditors to speed up debt restructuring. “Human rights may sustain the spirit, but not the body.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The desperation to meet basic needs partly explains why Africans may be relatively willing to consider strongmen. The Open Society poll asked whether authoritarians would produce better results in ten policy areas, such as creating jobs and fighting crime. In eight cases the sub-Saharan African average was higher than the global one. “Invariably, juntas that promise better material conditions will show up and win enough people&#39;s hearts and minds,” notes Ken Opalo of Georgetown University in America.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nevertheless, Africans&#39; faith in what passes for democracy is plummeting not just because of the insecurity and poverty their governments deliver, but also because of the nature of politics itself. In the 1990s and 2000s most African countries ditched one-party systems and embraced multi-party elections. The pageantry of elections, however, obscures the fact that much of Africa has only the patina of democracy. <small>EIU</small> , our sister outfit, classifies just one African country (Mauritius) as a “full democracy” and six as “flawed”. Between 1990 and 2019 sitting presidents won 88% of the 112 elections they ran in.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nine leaders have kept power for more than 20 years. These include Uganda&#39;s Yoweri Museveni; Cameroon&#39;s Paul Biya, who spends much of the year in a Swiss hotel; Equatorial Guinea&#39;s Teodoro Obiang, the longest-serving president of any country; and Mr Kagame. All fear fair elections; all may be grooming a son for office.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even relative newbies abuse the law, entrenching frustration. In August Zimbabwe&#39;s main opposition party did not contest yet another dubious election because it sees the courts as biased. A month earlier the Central African Republic&#39;s president won a referendum he rammed through the courts that will end term limits. In 2020 Alassane Ouattara, president of Ivory Coast, won a third term after controversially tweaking the constitution so he could get around the two-term limit. Senegal&#39;s Macky Sall this year opted against a similar move after violent protests. But any goodwill earned was undermined by the arrest of hundreds of opposition-party members, including a presidential candidate.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> On average in Afrobarometer polls only 13% believe that no one in their country&#39;s presidency is corrupt. Transparency International ( <small>TI</small> ), a watchdog, finds that sub-Saharan African countries are on average seen as less clean than El Salvador, where graft is so endemic that a millennial authoritarian has promised to build a huge jail specially for white-collar criminals. On average, perceptions of corruption in sub-Saharan Africa were slightly worse in 2022 than they were a decade earlier, reckons <small>TI.</small></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Open Society poll found that corruption was the gravest national issue for voters in Ghana and Nigeria. Voters also fret about it in South Africa, where “state capture” became ubiquitous under Jacob Zuma, president from 2009 to 2018. The looting of state institutions remains a problem in South Africa today—and in many other countries. “The capture of democratic political systems by private power networks is arguably the greatest threat to civil liberties and inclusive development in Africa,” argues Nic Cheeseman of the University of Birmingham in Britain.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Youth and experience</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Putschists exploit anger at graft—and it works, at least initially. In a poll before the first coup in Mali, 58% of people thought most or all the people in the presidency were corrupt. Two years and a second coup later, just 25% did. In Guinea the share before the coup was almost 50%. After it the share fell to 28%.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Why doesn&#39;t dissatisfaction with sham democracy spur Africans to try to obtain a better version of it? There are several reasons. For a start it is fiendishly difficult to oppose dictatorships. The bad guys usually have the guns. Ruling parties also often co-opt <small>NGO</small> s<small> </small>and youth groups. Many activists have tried to improve democracy and to vote out authoritarians. Yet after decades of failing, some may be concluding that only more radical methods, even coups, can end stagnation and state capture. Guinea&#39;s main opposition leader, for example, told <i>The Economist</i> of his “relief” immediately after the coup that ousted Alpha Condé, then president, in 2021.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Second, there is reason to believe that support for liberal democracy is softer than its champions would wish. In Mali, for example, support for the idea of military rule had been flat for years at just under 30% before the first coup. Now almost 80% of Malians say they approve or strongly approve of rule by military men.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Although outsiders may point out that liberal democracy has never really been tried in Africa, that is not always the view of Africans. Last month Olusegun Obasanjo, a former Nigerian president, said: “We have seen that the liberal type of democracy as practised in the West will not work for us.” Mr Kagame has argued similarly. (“The West does not define democracy in Africa.”) In the Africa Youth Survey just 39% of respondents said that Africans should emulate “Western democracy”; 53% said Africa needed to find its own version.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Indeed, too much is often expected of young Africans. Many of them are apathetic when confronted with the façade of democracy. They are more than twice as likely to say they did not vote in the last election as the over-56s. In Nigeria&#39;s election this year young voters helped Peter Obi to the best-ever result for a third-party candidate but he still came only third. In South Africa&#39;s last general election only 30% of eligible 20-somethings voted—from apartheid to apathy in a single generation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Support for military rule if elected leaders abuse power is highest among the young. On average 56% of 18- to 35-year-olds would contemplate it, versus 46% of those aged 56 and older. It is young men who rally in support after coups, complicating potential efforts by African countries or the West to reverse takeovers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Not that outsiders&#39; commitment to African democracy is especially strong—the third reason for its feebleness. The continental organisation, the African Union, is weak and ultimately the creature of its mostly authoritarian members. Regional hegemons such as South Africa carry less weight: economic stagnation means it has less hard power, while endorsing rigged elections in Zimbabwe and elsewhere means it has less soft power. Meanwhile, China skews aid towards corrupt autocratic regimes, as the Chinese Communist Party preaches its model to Africa&#39;s ruling parties. Russia, whether through the notorious Wagner Group or via arms sales, props up juntas and authoritarians. Newer players such as Turkey and Gulf countries will not promote democratic norms.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The West offers half-hearted help and hypocrisy. It sometimes speaks out when elections look sketchy, as was the case this year in Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone. But America decided to whitewash dodgy results in mineral-rich Congo in 2018. Britain is unlikely to criticise Mr Kagame given that it wants to fly asylum-seekers to Rwanda. France rails against coups in countries where it stands to lose influence, such as Niger, but says little when the putschists are in tune with Paris, as was the case with Chad&#39;s coup in 2021.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Françafrique—the term given to how France has maintained influence in former colonies by propping up autocratic elites—is coming back to bite Paris. In Mali a survey in 2021 found that more than a fifth of Malians believed that France&#39;s armed forces in the country were in league with jihadists or separatists. In Burkina Faso the new president, 35-year-old Captain Ibrahim Traoré, says that he is restoring sovereignty. It is the free choice of his junta, like Mali&#39;s, to ask Russia for help. After Niger&#39;s coup, the junta quickly scapegoated France, which had troops fighting jihadists in the country. Crowds waved Russian flags and decapitated a rooster painted in French colours. In Senegal, protesters against Mr Sall&#39;s flirtation with a third term burned down French-owned supermarkets and petrol stations. Half of Ivorians say that France is the country they trust least, according to Premise Data, a pollster.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Winter of discontent</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> So long as Africans see—and experience—“democracy” as a charade played by corrupt elites with the help of foreigners, then many will consider other options. What those look like will vary depending on the context. In South Africa frustration at meagre progress since apartheid is opening up space for Julius Malema, a hard-left black nationalist, and for ethnic-based parties. In Nigeria the efforts of Nnamdi Kanu, a separatist, to resuscitate the dream of an independent Biafra rely on charisma, populism, disregard for the truth and violence.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Elsewhere populist military men may prove appealing, at least temporarily. In Burkina Faso Captain Traoré chooses deliberately to mimic Thomas Sankara, a revered former socialist leader often referred to as Africa&#39;s Che Guevara. He came to power in a coup in 1983 aged 33 before being gunned down four years later. France has been a butt of both men.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is a well-intentioned desire to see Africans, especially younger ones, as a latent progressive force. But it is also patronising to deny, given the present circumstances amid what passes for democracy on the continent, that many Africans will be tempted by authoritarians. They are no more immune to populism than Americans are to Donald Trump, or Turks are to Recep Tayyip Erdogan. They will gravitate to those who seem to meet their needs—or at least offer a change from those who manifestly do not. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 18:51:15 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/7fied3rvfpciktgotman52rbdsobkjfe</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/03/africas-coups-are-part-of-a-far-bigger-crisis </item><item><title><![CDATA[States are becoming more brazen about killing foes abroad]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/058%20International%20-%20Political%20murder-c0f96e8683974cc2a381bd6e1d44124d-2.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>he murder</small> of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist activist who was shot in Canada in June, has caused <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/20/if-india-ordered-a-murder-in-canada-there-must-be-consequences">an explosive row</a> between Canada and India. It has also brought into sharp relief an incendiary facet of the new world disorder: assassinations. Killings of dissidents and terrorists, and of political or military figures, are as old as politics itself, but their incidence may be rising. Ukraine targets occupiers and collaborators; Russia has tried to kill Ukraine&#39;s president. On September 25th Ukraine claimed to have killed the head of Russia&#39;s Black Sea Fleet, only for him seemingly to appear in a video a day later.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Beyond the war in Europe a new cohort of rising powers, including India and Saudi Arabia, are projecting force abroad. They resent what they view as Western double standards on state-sponsored killings. New technologies make it easier than ever for governments to strike their enemies with precision, even from great distances.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet even as assassinations are becoming easier, and perhaps more frequent, the world has not yet figured out how to respond to them. You only need to look at the West&#39;s response to such killings. Russia&#39;s assassination of Alexander Litvinenko, a former <small>KGB</small> agent, in Britain in 2006 caused an outcry and led to sanctions. After <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/02/26/the-cia-blames-mbs-for-the-murder-of-jamal-khashoggi">the gruesome murder</a> in 2018 in Istanbul of Jamal Khashoggi, an exiled Saudi journalist living in America, Joe Biden said Saudi Arabia should be treated as a pariah. Yet last year he<a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/07/05/what-mbs-wants-from-joe-biden">fist-bumped</a> Muhammad bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince and de facto ruler, and is <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/09/24/an-israeli-saudi-pact-could-upend-the-middle-east">seeking to coax him</a> into making peace with Israel. Meanwhile India denies involvement in Mr Nijjar&#39;s death and may avoid any serious consequences relating to it. The world&#39;s most populous country is important to the West, both as an economic partner and a geopolitical counterweight to China. These inconsistencies reflect a longstanding moral and legal maze over state-backed killings.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Bible may extol the Israelite Ehud for killing Eglon, the oppressive and “very fat” Moabite king. Yet it also commands obedience to authority, “For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.” Assassination, in the sense of killing a prominent person for a political motive with no legal process, carries the connotation of perfidy. Dante placed Julius Caesar&#39;s killers in the deepest circle of hell, alongside Judas, their bodies gnawed on by Satan. Yet states kill prominent foes abroad—for different reasons and with varied methods. A paper in 2016 by Warner Schilling and Jonathan Schilling lists 14 possible objectives, from revenge to weakening an enemy or destroying a rival state.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Reliable data on the patterns of assassinations and their causes are hard to come by, given the problems of identifying killings and culprits. Some 298 assassination attempts on national leaders were reported between 1875 and 2004, according to a paper by Benjamin Jones and Benjamin Olken published by the <i>American Economic Journal</i> in 2009. Since 1950, they find, a national leader has been assassinated in nearly two out of every three years.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> War by other means</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For Rory Cormac of the University of Nottingham in Britain, the shooting in Canada is evidence of a weakening of international norms against assassination: “With every high-profile killing, the taboo erodes a bit,” he says. He offers two big reasons: authoritarian regimes “are becoming more brazen” about challenging liberal norms; and democracies&#39; resort to targeted killings has “emboldened other states”. Other factors, such as ease of travel and drones that make possible long-distance surveillance and strikes, probably worsen the problem. Over the years America has killed thousands of suspected jihadists—and many civilians, too—with drones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Assassination has never changed the history of the world,” the British politician Benjamin Disraeli remarked, after Abraham Lincoln&#39;s killing. Yet some murders can have a dramatic impact. A bullet fired by a Serbian nationalist, killing Austria&#39;s Archduke Franz Ferdinand in June 1914, detonated the first world war. And assassination risks retaliation: both Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, respectively a former American secretary of state and national security adviser, have allegedly been the targets of an Iranian assassination plot. Britain&#39;s domestic-intelligence service, <small>MI5</small> , says Iran has “ambitions to kidnap or even kill British or <small>UK</small> -based individuals perceived as enemies of the regime”.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Cloaks and daggers</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> When it comes to methods, Russia likes poison. Its agents murdered Litvinenko using radioactive polonium. They nearly killed another former spook in Britain, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter Yulia with Novichok, a nerve agent, in 2018. North Korea favours poison, too. It killed Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of the country&#39;s leader, Kim Jong Un, by smearing him with <small>VX</small> , another nerve agent, at Kuala Lumpur&#39;s international airport in 2017.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America prefers bombs and bullets. Its special forces raided a safe house in Pakistan and killed Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda&#39;s leader, in 2011. An American drone strike killed his successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in Kabul in 2022. Another one took out Qassem Suleimani, head of the Quds Force, Iran&#39;s foreign-operations outfit, at Baghdad&#39;s airport in 2020.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This is all in spite of the fact that, in 1961, President John Kennedy (who was himself later assassinated) told an aide that he disapproved of the practice: “We can&#39;t get into that kind of thing or we would all be targets.” Yet America was certainly into that kind of thing, back in the early years of the cold war. Revelations of its secret efforts to kill leaders such as Fidel Castro of Cuba (unsuccessfully) and Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic (successfully) caused a backlash. In 1976 President Gerald Ford issued an executive order stating that no member of the American government “shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, assassination”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Killing abroad still continues. These days, says Luca Trenta of Swansea University in Wales, autocracies use covert action to give them plausible—or often implausible—deniability. But democracies such as America seek to wrap a veil of plausible legality around “targeted killing”, particularly of suspected terrorists.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>UN</small> Charter enjoins all its members to “refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”. At the same time, however, it recognises “the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> International human-rights lawyers take a restrictive view. In peacetime, assassinations and targeted killings are unlawful. In wartime they may be permissible, if they conform to the laws of war. Ukraine targets senior Russian commanders just as the Allies in 1943 shot down a plane carrying a Japanese admiral, Yamamoto Isoroku, over the Solomon Islands.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What about international terrorism, which seems to lie between ordinary policing and war? Mary Ellen O&#39;Connell of the University of Notre Dame in America argues that “there is no grey zone.” Under international law, she says, countries must deal with terrorism through the tools of law enforcement, including international co-operation and extradition; lethal action amounts to “extra-judicial killing”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nevertheless America, in particular, has sought greater legal freedom of action. One track has been to qualify sovereignty. Military action, it contends, is permissible where a state is “unwilling or unable” to prevent acts of terrorism. It has also at times designated territories abroad as “areas of active hostilities”, where armed forces can operate more freely. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="Close-up of a hitman's feet with scattered bullet casings on the ground." width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_IRD002.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_IRD002.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_IRD002.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_IRD002.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_IRD002.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_IRD002.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_IRD002.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_IRD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_IRD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_IRD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_IRD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_IRD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_IRD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_IRD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_IRD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_IRD002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230930_IRD002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Juan Bernabeu</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another route has been to expand the right to self-defence. One step is to declare that it includes responding to attacks by non-state actors as well as by states. The next is to aver a right to “anticipatory self-defence”, allowing a country to use force to forestall an “imminent” threat of attack. The most widely accepted definition is that the threat should be “instant, overwhelming and leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation”. But this, too, has been stretched.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In 2001 President George W. Bush went further, and began adopting ideas of pre-emption and prevention to justify the use of force even before threats are “fully formed”. Barack Obama&#39;s administration also redefined the meaning of “imminent”. Eric Holder, his attorney-general, said it had to consider not only the proximity of the threat, but also the “window of opportunity to act”. Much of this thinking is borrowed from Israel, whose supreme court ruled in 2006 that, in the case of terrorists, “rest between hostilities is nothing more than preparation for the next hostility”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America&#39;s example has encouraged a similar loosening of rules in Britain, Australia and France, says Dr Trenta. But for Professor O&#39;Connell, it all amounts to the West granting itself rights that do not apply to others, “a rules-based order in violation of international law”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> India could well argue—as government-friendly newspapers do—that Mr Nijjar&#39;s killing falls within the West&#39;s ideas of counter-terrorism. Sikh separatism has led to past bloodshed, not least the assassination in 1984 of the prime minister, Indira Gandhi, and the bombing the following year of an Air India jet flying from Montreal to London. Though it has much abated, Sikh violence could flare up again. India claims that Mr Nijjar was a terrorist and offered a reward for his capture; his supporters say that he was a peaceful activist. In India&#39;s view, the West&#39;s refusal to clamp down on Sikh separatists poses a menace. The government, though, prefers to say it has nothing to do with Mr Nijjar&#39;s death. As for law enforcement, co-operation becomes harder the more India chips away at democratic liberties.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Killer instincts</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Developing a long arm for covert operations is not easy. It requires resources and know-how to track a target, organise a hit and avoid arrest. India&#39;s spooks may think they are emulating those of America and Israel as the necessarily harsh defenders of democracy. Some even talk of the “Israelification” of India&#39;s foreign-intelligence service, the Research and Analysis Wing ( <small>RAW</small> ). But if it is seen to turn from mitigating clear security threats to bumping off political foes, <small>RAW</small> will become the shadowy outward face of repression at home, as Russia&#39;s or Saudi Arabia&#39;s spooks are seen. Assassinations can alert the world to the brutality of the regimes ordering them. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023 19:42:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/9lvf8k4tgou1lrogrbm4ni44au85qjfn</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/09/26/states-are-becoming-more-brazen-about-killing-foes-abroad </item><item><title><![CDATA[Meet the world’s new arms dealers]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/054%20International%20-%20The%20global%20arms%20bazaar-be99378861574aa61aea04b729c3bb48-2.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>HE SIGHT</small> of North Korea&#39;s chubby leader, Kim Jong Un, shaking hands <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/13/the-dangers-posed-by-a-deal-between-russia-and-north-korea">with Vladimir Putin</a> on September 13th—having travelled by train to a spaceport in Russia&#39;s far east to discuss selling its dictator a stash of North Korean weapons—was remarkable both on its own terms and for what it said about the business of selling arms. The world&#39;s five biggest arms-sellers (America, Russia, France, China and Germany) account for more than three-quarters of exports. But up-and-coming weapons producers are giving the old guard a run for their money. They are making the most of opportunities created by shifting geopolitics. And they are benefiting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Kim&#39;s trip to Russia followed a visit to Pyongyang in July by Sergei Shoigu, Russia&#39;s defence minister, who wanted to see if North Korea could provide gear that would help his country&#39;s faltering war effort. North Korea would love to find buyers for its kit. And few regimes are willing to sell Russia arms. China has <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/03/02/chinese-arms-could-revive-russias-failing-war">so far been deterred</a> from providing much more than dual-purpose chips (although it could yet channel more lethal stuff through North Korea). Only Iran has obliged, selling some 2,400 of its <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/19/iranian-drones-pose-a-fiendish-military-problem-for-ukraine">Shahed “kamikaze” drones</a> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> North Korea could provide a wider range of stuff. As well as drones and missiles such as the <small>KN</small> -23, which is almost a replica of the Russian Iskander ballistic missile, it could offer self-propelled howitzers and multi-launch rocket systems. According to sources in American intelligence, North Korea has been delivering 152mm shells and Katyusha-type rockets to Russia for the best part of a year. Russia is shopping in Pyongyang and Tehran because both regimes are already so heavily targeted by international sanctions that they have nothing to lose and much to gain by doing business with Mr Putin&#39;s government. They are not so much an “axis of evil” as a marketplace of pariahs. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_IRC610.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_IRC610.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_IRC610.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_IRC610.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_IRC610.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_IRC610.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_IRC610.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_IRC610.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_IRC610.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_IRC610.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_IRC610.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_IRC610.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_IRC610.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_IRC610.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_IRC610.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_IRC610.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230923_IRC610.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">If the North Korean arms industry is being boosted by the war in Ukraine, its southern foe is doing even better. South Korea&#39;s arms exporters were cleaning up even before the conflict. In the five years to 2022 the country rose to ninth place in a ranking of weapons-sellers compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute ( <small>SIPRI</small> ), a think-tank (see chart). The government aspires to make South Korea the world&#39;s fourth-largest arms exporter by 2027. Last year it sold arms worth $17bn, more than twice as much as in 2021. Some $14.5bn came from sales to Poland.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The size and scope of the agreements South Korea has reached with Poland, which sees itself as a front-line country in Europe&#39;s defence against a revanchist Russia, are jaw-dropping. The deal includes 1,000 <small>K</small> 2 Black Panther tanks, 180 of them delivered rapidly from the army&#39;s own inventory and 820 to be made under licence in Poland. That is more tanks than are operating in the armies of Britain, France, Germany and Italy combined. It also includes 672 <small>K</small> 9 Thunder self-propelled howitzers; 288 <small>K</small> 239 Chunmoo multiple-rocket launchers; and 48 Golden Eagle <small>FA</small> -50s, a cut-price fourth-generation fighter jet.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/02/12/south-korea-wants-to-become-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-arms-exporters">South Korea&#39;s success</a> in the arms business is down to competitive costs, high-quality weaponry and swift delivery, says Tom Waldwyn at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank based in London. Its prices reflect South Korea&#39;s efficient manufacturing. The quality derives from South Korea&#39;s experience working with the best American weaponry, and from its own high-tech civil sector. Speedy delivery is possible because the South Koreans, facing a major threat across their northern border, run hot production lines that can also ramp up quickly.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Siemon Wezeman, a researcher with <small>SIPRI</small> ’s arms-transfer programme, says wholehearted support from government and attractive credit arrangements are also critical to South Korea&#39;s success. Asian customers like the fact that it has close ties to America without being America, which is often seen as an unreliable ally. This could also help South Korea clinch a $45bn deal to renew Canada&#39;s submarine fleet. Questions for the future include how far South Korea will go in transferring technology to its customers—a crucial issue for Poland, which sees itself as an exporting partner of South Korea&#39;s, competing with Germany and France in the European market.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> If South Korea is the undisputed leader among emerging arms exporters, second place goes to Turkey. Since the ruling <small>AK</small> party came to power in 2002 it has poured money into its defence industry. A goal of achieving near-autarky in weapons production has become more pressing in the face of American and European sanctions—the former imposed in 2019 after Turkey, a <small>NATO</small> member, bought Russian <small>S</small> -400 surface-to-air missiles.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Rocket-fuelled</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>SIPRI</small> thinks that between 2018 and 2022 Turkey&#39;s weapons exports increased by 69% compared with the previous five-year period, and that its share of the global arms market doubled. According to a report in July by a local industry body, the value of its defence and aerospace exports rose by 38% in 2022, compared with the previous year, reaching $4.4bn. The target for this year is $6bn. Pakistan is receiving modernised submarines from Turkey. And the last of four corvettes which Turkey has sold to the Pakistan navy was launched last month. More sales to other countries are likely, both because Turkey&#39;s ships are competitively priced and because Turkey has few qualms about who it will sell to.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet Turkey&#39;s export charge is led by armed drones. On July 18th Turkey signed a $3bn agreement with Saudi Arabia to supply the Akinci unmanned combat aerial vehicle ( <small>UCAV</small> ). It was made by Baykar, which also produces the Bayraktar <small>TB</small> 2—a drone that has been used in combat by Azerbaijan, Ethiopia, Libya and Ukraine. The <small>TB</small> 2 was developed to hunt Kurdish militants after America refused to sell Turkey its Predator drone. More than 20 countries lined up to buy it because it was cheaper and more readily available than the American alternative, and more reliable than the Chinese <small>UCAV</small> s that had previously dominated the non-Western market.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Akinci (pictured right, next to the <small>TB</small> 2) is more powerful. It can carry lots of big weapons, including air-to-air missiles and the <small>SOM</small> - <small>A</small> , a stealthy cruise missile with a range of 250km. It will find buyers among several other Gulf countries, such as Oman, Qatar and the <small>UAE,</small> which are keen to hedge against souring relations with America by reducing their reliance on its weaponry. These countries also have ambitions to build their own defence industries; they see Turkey as a willing partner and as an example to follow.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Turkey&#39;s ambitions are shown by what else is in the pipeline. Its new navy flagship, the <i>Anadolu,</i> is a 25,000-tonne amphibious assault ship and light aircraft-carrier that will carry Bayraktar <small>UCAV</small> s. At least one Gulf country is said to be in talks to buy a similar ship. Turkey&#39;s fifth-generation fighter jet, the <small>KAAN</small> , in which Pakistan and Azerbaijan are partners, should fly before the end of the year. Developed with help from Britain&#39;s <small>BAE</small> Systems and Rolls-Royce, the <small>KAAN</small> could be seen as a response to Turkey&#39;s ejection from the <small>F</small> -35 partner programme (as punishment for buying the <small>S</small> -400). Turkey will market the plane to anyone America will not sell <small>F</small> -35s to—or who balks at the conditions. Once again, Gulf countries may be first in line.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> South Korea and Turkey have benefited from the woes of their main competitors. <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/23/russian-arms-have-fewer-takers-in-south-east-asia">Russia&#39;s arms exports</a> between 2018 and 2022 were 31% lower than in the preceding five-year period, according to <small>SIPRI</small> . It is facing further large declines because of the strain its war of aggression is putting on its defence industries, its geopolitical isolation and the efforts of two major customers, India and China, to reduce their reliance on Russian weaponry.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> India, previously Russia&#39;s biggest customer, cut its purchases of Russian arms by 37% in the 2018-22 period. It is probably wishing it had gone further: Russia&#39;s largely state-controlled arms industry is having to put its own army&#39;s needs ahead of commitments to customers. Many of India&#39;s 272 Su-30 <small>MKI</small> s, the backbone of its air force, are kaput because Russia cannot supply parts. Some of Russia&#39;s weapons have performed poorly in Ukraine compared with <small>NATO</small> kit. And sanctions on Russia are limiting trade in things such as microchips, ball-bearings, machine tools and optical systems, which will hinder Russia&#39;s ability to sell combat aircraft, attack helicopters and other lethal contraptions. The longer the war in Ukraine lasts, the more Russia will struggle to claw back its position in the global arms market.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Damp squibs</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As for China, over half its arms exports in the 2018-22 period went to just one country, Pakistan, which it sees as an ally against India. Nearly 80% of Pakistan&#39;s major weapons needs are met by China, according to <small>SIPRI</small> . These include combat aircraft, missiles, frigates and submarines. Beijing has no interest in its customers&#39; human-rights records, how they plan to use what China sends or whether they are under Western sanctions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But China&#39;s arms industry also has its problems. One challenge, says Mr Waldwyn, is that although China set out to dominate the military drone market a decade ago, its customers got fed up with poor quality and even worse support, opening a door for Turkey. A second is that, with the exception of a putative submarine deal with Thailand and a package of weapons for Myanmar, countries in South-East Asia are tired of Chinese bullying and “won&#39;t touch them”, says Mr Wezeman.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At least China does not have to worry about competition from India. Despite much effort, India&#39;s growth as an arms exporter has been glacial. The government of Narendra Modi has listed a huge range of weapons parts that must be made in India; it hopes home-made light tanks and artillery will enter service by the end of the decade. But India has relied for too long on the transfer of technology from Russia under production-licensing agreements for aircraft, tanks and warships that have failed to deliver. Investment is wastefully channelled through state-owned bodies. Red tape suffocates initiative.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Projects such as the Tejas light combat aircraft have taken decades to reach production and remain fraught with problems. The Dhruv light helicopter, launched in 2002, has crashed dozens of times. After decades in development, the Arjun Mk-2 tank turned out to be too heavy for deployment across the border with Pakistan. Locally made kit is often rejected by India&#39;s own armed forces. “If they don&#39;t want it, exporting it becomes impossible,” says Mr Wezeman. South Korea and Turkey show how countries can build lucrative arms businesses that underpin domestic security. India, for all its bombast, is a lesson in how not to do it. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 17:09:42 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/p7bnujg5n1gugqcfrgf2jqusnaa2m2e8</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/09/19/meet-the-worlds-new-arms-dealers </item><item><title><![CDATA[Are Ukraine’s tactics working?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/055%20International%20-%20The%20counter-offensive-36ada54a6f318491c493c12b58f53b41.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">Ukraine war</a></i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>D</span> <small>MYTRO KULEBA</small> , Ukraine&#39;s foreign minister, is a smooth and affable diplomat, unruffled by the trickiest questions. But on August 31st his patience snapped. “Criticising the slow pace of the counter-offensive equals…spitting into the face of the Ukrainian soldier who sacrifices his life every day,” he told journalists. “I would recommend all critics to shut up, come to Ukraine and try to liberate one square centimetre by themselves.” That outburst was prompted by weeks of stories in the American press, in which anonymous officials took issue with Ukraine&#39;s <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/08/16/ukraines-counter-offensive-is-making-progress-slowly">slow progress</a> on the battlefield and questioned its military tactics. The row is unseemly. But is Ukraine&#39;s approach working?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Allied debates over strategy are hardly unusual. American and British officials worked closely with Ukraine in the months before it launched its counter-offensive in June. They gave intelligence and advice, conducted detailed war games to simulate how different attacks might play out, and helped design and train the brigades that received the lion&#39;s share of Western equipment. Even so, Ukraine—stung by a big leak of American intelligence documents unearthed in April—kept its own counsel. It delayed the start of the offensive and held plans close to its chest.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One big point of contention was Ukraine&#39;s earlier decision, over the first half of the year, to keep fighting for <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/06/01/bakhmut-and-the-spirit-of-verdun">Bakhmut</a> , a town in the eastern Donbas region that has limited strategic significance but became a symbol of resistance. Ukraine&#39;s decision to defend the town at all costs had a “big influence” on the subsequent counter-offensive, argues Konrad Muzyka of Rochan Consulting, a firm that tracks the war. Ukraine burned through its stockpile of shells while Russia gained time to build up its formidable defences in the south—the so-called Surovikin line, named after a now-fired Russian general.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Quarrels persisted even after the counter-offensive began. American officials had encouraged Ukraine to concentrate its forces on the main axis of attack in the south, towards the Sea of Azov. Instead Ukraine split its forces with the aim of stretching the Russians over a longer front. The most experienced brigades, armed mostly with older gear, were kept in Bakhmut, where they are making modest progress on the town&#39;s flanks. One source says that politics is playing an unhelpful role in military strategy, with well-connected brigades around Bakhmut getting a larger share of scarce ammunition than military considerations alone might warrant.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Meanwhile Ukraine deployed less experienced brigades on the more important southern axis, armed with newer kit. They quickly became bogged down in dense minefields covered by Russian artillery, drones and helicopters. Untested commanders made a series of mistakes, such as running into friendly mines and mistiming attacks. “If more experienced Ukrainian brigades were given the new equipment, they may not have committed many of the errors the new brigades made,” write Michael Kofman and Rob Lee, both experts on Russia&#39;s armed forces, in an essay for War on the Rocks, an online journal.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some blame for early missteps lies with those who helped plan the counter-offensive. In a recent paper Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds at the Royal United Services Institute ( <small>RUSI</small> ), a think-tank in London, argue that the assault relied in part on outdated assumptions that did not take into account the threat from new sorts of sensors and drones. They conclude: “Much of the data supporting the tactics that Ukraine&#39;s international partners sought to train Ukrainian forces to adopt was based on operational analysis from the 20th century that did not contend with a range of technologies employed in Ukraine.” Russian fortifications were also <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/07/03/how-ukraines-enemy-is-also-learning-lessons-albeit-slowly">far more substantial</a> than Western planners assumed. </p><iframe type="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JtVE4Wp5Z1A?enablejsapi=1" class="css-xm8n1m e195f1ec0"></iframe><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Wherever the fault lies, it is clear that something went wrong. “It seems that Kyiv had no contingency plans that could be quickly implemented in case the attack stalled,” notes Mr Muzyka. Eventually Ukrainian commanders decided to hold back their heavy armour and switch to a simpler approach. <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/09/sappers-risk-their-lives-to-win-ukraine-back-inch-by-inch">Groups of sappers</a> , often crawling on their bellies, now clear minefields by hand. Platoons and companies, rather than brigades, fight tree line to tree line, advancing on foot so as to present a smaller target. This has helped limit losses of men and equipment, but allows only 700 to 1,200 metres of progress every five days, notes the <small>RUSI</small> paper, giving Russian troops time to “reset” their defences (the rate may have picked up a little of late).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That leads to two debates. One is whether Ukrainian commanders have been too risk-averse. Some Western officials argue that if Ukraine had stuck with bolder and larger-scale attacks, as planned, they would have taken higher casualties at first but had more luck breaking through Russian lines, shortening the offensive and reducing the overall toll. Ukrainian officials retort that this would only have led to more bloodshed, and that officers could not expect a heavily depleted citizen army to mimic Russian human-wave attacks.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A second debate is whether Ukraine should emulate a Western way of war or carve out its own path. Western armed forces prize the idea of combined-arms manoeuvre, in which armoured forces synchronise their movement with infantry, artillery, air defence and (increasingly) electronic and cyber-attacks. The five weeks of pre-offensive training given to Ukrainian troops in Germany was not nearly enough to make them proficient in this sort of warfare.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “The Ukrainians are still tied to Soviet doctrine,” complains an American official. Heavy artillery barrages, in place of more judicious and precise attacks, are one source of tension, not least because America is playing the lead role in sourcing ammunition for Ukrainian guns. “It&#39;s going to take time for their mindset…and tactics to change,” says the official.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In fact the Ukrainian approach is fit for purpose, says BA Friedman, a retired artillery officer in the <small>US</small> Marine Corps and author of a book on military tactics. In the spring of 1918, after years of stalemate on the western front of the first world war, the German army realised that large units were too vulnerable to artillery fire. Their solution was smaller, nimbler and well-drilled “storm troopers” who could cross enemy lines and grab territory, with heavier units moving up later. “Since Ukraine doesn&#39;t have the ability to use <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/08/22/how-soon-will-ukraine-be-able-to-use-its-f-16s">air power</a> on any kind of relevant scale, it makes total sense to solve the problem the way it was solved before air power matured,” says Mr Friedman. Many European officers acknowledge that their own better trained and equipped armies would struggle to break the Surovikin line.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Fighting about fighting</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> American officials are not well placed to offer lessons on tactical best practice, says Mr Friedman. The bulk of their recent experience of combat has been in mountainous or desert areas where small units cannot take advantage of cover to advance in this way. The two main training centres for America&#39;s ground forces, the army&#39;s site at Fort Irwin and the marines&#39; location at Twentynine Palms, are both in Californian desert environments, he points out. “ <small>US</small> forces have very little experience facing anything like what Ukraine is facing, whether in combat or in training.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The problem is: nor does Ukraine. Mr Watling and Mr Reynolds argue that attrition of officers and the dramatic expansion of Ukraine&#39;s army over the past 18 months mean that it lacks sufficient junior leaders with expertise in offensive operations. The result, they say, is that decisions are thrown up to more senior officers, overwhelming brigade headquarters that already have a lot on their plate. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">They give the example of a Ukrainian attack on the village of Rivnopil in Donetsk province earlier in the summer. Attackers are supposed to release smoke to cover their movement and confuse the enemy. But only 3% of Ukraine&#39;s artillery-fire missions involved smoke—in part because senior commanders did not want to obscure their own view of the battle from drones circling overhead. The lesson is that Ukraine needs more junior officers who can be trusted to take the initiative even when their bosses cannot watch from afar.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The quality of training is important, too. Western training facilities are hobbled by a “safety culture in <small>NATO</small> ”, argue Mr Watling and Mr Reynolds. Drones are central to Ukraine&#39;s tactics, allowing artillery units to spot targets and infantry to perform reconnaissance. Yet most <small>NATO</small> training areas impose tight restrictions on when and how drones may be flown, for fear they will veer off course. Safety rules also mean that artillery skills are typically taught later in courses. But in Ukraine “troops who are not prepared to deal with artillery are not prepared for the fight,” write the <small>RUSI</small> analysts. Europe&#39;s health and safety rules are not a good fit for a war of national survival.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Most of these issues will not be resolved during the current counter-offensive. Ukraine will eventually need to reintroduce mechanised and armoured forces if it is to exploit any breakthroughs. That could get easier: minefields are less dense beyond the first line of defence. It is thought to have enough ammunition to fight through the autumn. But on September 10th Mark Milley, America&#39;s top general, said that Ukraine probably had 30 to 45 days of combat left before <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/10/the-particular-problems-of-fighting-in-the-ukrainian-autumn">rain and mud</a> would make it too difficult for vehicles to advance.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In recent weeks Ukraine has made faster progress in the south by piercing the <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/06/how-the-pentagon-assesses-ukraines-progress">first of Russia&#39;s three defensive lines</a> in Zaporizhia around the village of Robotyne, widening the resulting salient by pressing east to Verbove and then attacking towards the village of Novoprokopivka (see map). On September 13th it struck with missiles a shipyard in Crimea used by Russia&#39;s Black Sea fleet, setting vessels ablaze. Russia has had to commit reserves from its 76th air assault division; but it has been able to because Ukraine threw in its own in August.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is not clear how much fresh manpower either side has left. Rates of attrition appear to favour Ukraine over Russia, but sources suggest that Russia can probably still scrape together enough reserves to plug holes. “Unless there is a collapse of Russian lines, the battles we have seen for the past three months are the ones we will likely continue to see over the next few months,” concludes Mr Muzyka, who argues that only the deployment of larger formations, beyond Ukraine&#39;s capacity, would speed things up. Dozens of Western officials consulted by <i>The Economist</i> are also sceptical that a major breakthrough will come before winter. “We&#39;ve got to extend our timeline,” says one of them. “This could be a very long struggle.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 12 Sep 2023 17:29:33 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/hds9rt1nj2on31lqke4u2ne9h76ulktt</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/09/12/are-ukraines-tactics-working </item><item><title><![CDATA[The growing global movement to restrain house prices]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/053%20International%20-%20The%20new%20zing%20in%20zoning-eb687d80e8cd526b9da7fdd37bfc6fbf.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>F</span> <small>LANNERY ASSOCIATES</small> did not even have a website until the end of August. But a lawsuit involving the firm, first filed in a federal court in May, has uncovered the huge extent of its land holdings in Solano County, which lies around 60 miles (97km) north-east of San Francisco in California. The suit revealed that Flannery had committed to buying 140 properties for a total of more than $800m and was paying well over the market odds: as much as $15,000 per acre, for land valued to tax authorities for as little as a tenth of that. The entire scheme spans 50,000 acres, an area far larger than that of San Francisco proper.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Who would be willing to pay so much for seemingly so little? On August 25th the <i>New York Times</i> revealed that the formerly anonymous owners of Flannery Associates include almost a dozen Silicon Valley titans. Among them are Michael Moritz, former head of Sequoia Capital, a huge venture-capital firm, and Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, a networking app. Though none of the land is currently zoned for housing, the plan, apparently, is to build a town from scratch. Its new website is branded “California Forever”, with architectural drawings of families eating in sunny Mediterranean-style plazas. This constitutes “a vision”, says Brian Brokaw of Flannery Associates.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nowhere in the world is the failure to build enough housing clearer than in the San Francisco Bay Area. The overriding reason why boils down to Nimbyism, or “Not in My Backyard”, the tendency of locals to resist new development. A growing movement is trying to fix that. The secretive plans for a new city in Solano County are just one of the more outlandish strands of Yimbyism—a growing movement that says yes, not no, to development.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>Yimby</small> s argue that housing shortages are caused largely by laws that control who can build what and where. Zoning and planning laws, they say, are so strict that building new housing is in many places completely illegal, and in almost all it is slow, difficult and expensive. In the past decade or so, Yimbyism has spread from a minority pursuit of economists and a few dedicated activists into a plausible political movement of its own, with thousands of members and chapters spreading across countries including America, Australia, Britain and New Zealand.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Not everyone agrees on everything. <small>Yimby</small> s range from libertarian-leaning tech types through to self-described socialists, such as John Bauters. He is the bicycle-riding mayor of the tiny Californian city of Emeryville, who allows development because it gives him more rich people to tax. Yet all share one belief: more housing needs to be built, especially in the biggest and costliest cities.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> House of straw</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In recent decades house prices have outstripped income growth across the developed world. The reasons for this are numerous. Interest rates affect how much buyers can afford, as does income growth. Population changes, culture and demography all have an impact on demand, as do bank regulation, lending practices and the like. But underlying it all is basic economic logic: where demand outpaces the supply of new homes, prices tend to rise. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">According to data collated by Jim Gleeson, a researcher at the Greater London Authority, since the millennium the number of homes in English-speaking countries is lower relative to populations than elsewhere in the rich world, and growing more slowly, too. Between 2000 and 2020, the number of homes for every 100 people rose in Britain from 43 to 44. In America it went from 41 to 42, and in Australia from 40 to 41. In New Zealand population growth outpaced construction, and the number of homes per 100 residents fell slightly, to 38. In France by contrast, the figure was already 50 in 2000, and had risen to 55 by 2020; in Germany it went from 47 to 52, and in Japan from 42 to 49 (see chart 1).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What explains this? In most markets, higher prices stimulate supply. When demand for cars increases, carmakers open more factories. But all rich countries regulate construction, for good reason. Whereas a car can be manufactured and then transported almost anywhere, land is an inherently scarce resource, and for the most part housing is only valuable when it is near jobs, public services and infrastructure. Few people want to live right next door to a sewage plant; lots want to live near a large park. Planning is meant to take such things into account.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> House of sticks </h2><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Because jobs move, a stable ratio of housing to people across a country can mask a growing shortage in the hottest local economies. In places like California and London, wages are far higher than elsewhere in America and Britain, and have risen faster in the past decade. But for workers who do not own property, the gains are eaten up by higher rents (see chart 2). Findings published in January by the National Bureau of Economic Research show that for workers with degrees, although living in a big coastal American city comes with a substantial wage premium, a higher cost of living means that overall they are about as well off as if they lived in a poorer city. Lower-skilled workers are much worse off, which means they move out to make space.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> California&#39;s <small>Yimby</small> s point to a broken system. The state&#39;s population is shrinking even as California generates huge numbers of well-paying jobs. Consider that the median monthly rent of a one-bedroom apartment in the city of San Francisco is $3,007, or 63%, of what the median American adult working full time makes before taxes. And yet, so far this year, the Bay Area has issued permits to build only 4,500 new units of housing—scarcely more, relative to its population, than Detroit, the former powerhouse of the Midwest. The Austin area in Texas, with roughly half of the Bay Area&#39;s population, has issued some 20,000.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> California has tried to control development since at least the 1970s. Scott Wiener, a state senator who represents San Francisco, says that with housing in the state “the rules get made up as you go along”. The process “takes years and years and is so chaotic it ultimately mutilates or kills the project entirely”. Mr Wiener was among the first <small>Yimby</small> politicians and crafted a new state law, <small>SB35</small> , which passed not long after he took office in 2017.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>SB35</small> encourages more development by forcing reluctant city governments to comply with state-led targets. These have existed for decades in order to facilitate new housing. For San Francisco (the city, not the entire metro area), the legal target is 82,000 homes by 2031. The number of homes that have actually been built to date means that the target looks wildly out of reach. Other laws passed by Mr Wiener and his allies have extended rights to homeowners to build “accessory dwelling units”, or granny flats, and have restricted mandates that force developers to provide masses of free parking in new buildings.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At the higher levels of politics at least, Yimbyism is now practically mainstream in California. “Pro-housing policies are pro-job policies,” tweeted London Breed, San Francisco&#39;s mayor, in July. Gavin Newsom, the state&#39;s governor, promised to build 3.5m homes in a speech for his election campaign. Across the state such politicians are engaged in an increasingly pitched legislative battle with local politicians, such as city council members and the leaders of suburbs, who are generally determined not to build more.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yimbyism abounds elsewhere, too. In New York this year Kathy Hochul, the state governor, (unsuccessfully) proposed a radical “upzoning”, approving a greater density of housing in a particular area. She argued that it would allow the construction of 800,000 more homes over a decade, primarily by letting more apartments be built around railway stations in New York City&#39;s suburbs. In Canada Pierre Poilievre, who leads the opposition Conservative Party, wants the federal government to be able to force municipalities to allow more housing construction. Both major political parties in Britain say they want more houses built, no doubt mindful of an election expected next year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet constructing housing remains extremely tricky. The problem, says Brian Hanlon, a co-founder of California <small>Yimby,</small> a pro-housing pressure group, is that “we are all inheritors of this English town-planning system, which is disastrous”. In Britain the first extensive regulation of landowners&#39; rights to build on their property was introduced with the Town Planning Act in 1909 and then expanded dramatically in 1947 with the Town and Country Planning Act. In America “zoning” laws were passed in most urban areas in the 1920s and 1930s. “When Ireland got independence, we practically copied everything Great Britain did,” says Robert Tolan, a housing economist in Dublin. That included Ireland&#39;s own version of the planning act in 1963. New Zealand got its Town and Country Planning Act, named after the British one, in 1953.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In many English-speaking countries, inspired by Victorian worries about “slums”, planning laws tended to prioritise detached houses. For urban planners, such as Ebenezer Howard, density was seen as akin to crowding. In packed industrial hotspots, “downzoning” and slum clearance were used to flatten cities and spread them out by force. The writer George Orwell was sceptical of the proceedings: “If people are going to live in large towns at all they must learn to live on top of one another,” he declared. But he reckoned that many workers in Britain did not “take kindly to flats”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Today far fewer citizens of English-speaking countries live in flats than elsewhere. In England 80% of people now dwell in houses, and just 6% in flats in buildings taller than three storeys. In France 44% of people live in apartments, as opposed to houses. In cities including Dublin, Los Angeles and Sydney, sprawl is running out of road. At the densities allowed by law, almost all of the land within a reasonable commute of city centres has already been “built out”. Instead, new subdivisions are built in separate towns, perhaps 50 or 60 miles away from the core, with residents typically facing punishing commutes by car to work. (In Britain these workers typically leap over the “green belts” around cities within which construction is mostly illegal.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In San Francisco construction cost on average around $440 per square foot last summer (a figure far higher than elsewhere in America). But homes sold for roughly twice that. In southern England an acre of agricultural land might cost as much as £15,000 ($19,000). An acre with planning permission is worth at least 60 times that. What this means is that giving permission to developers to build creates vast amounts of value by the stroke of a pen. And yet it doesn&#39;t happen, largely because, through the planning system, local residents and political groups are generally able to block any development. Rules intended to regulate development, such as environmental reviews, design consultations, parking requirements and so on, in fact serve the purpose of stopping it.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> House of bricks</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nimbyism has plenty of origins. Most obviously, homeowners want to protect the value of their properties. Allowing the construction of individual detached houses only on large lots—a type of zoning—is an effective way to stop poor people from moving into wealthy neighbourhoods. In America there were racist motives behind the adoption of zoning and behind its tightening in the 1960s and 1970s.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nowadays, people are more likely to fear that new housing will worsen traffic, or that their views will be spoiled, or that new neighbours will be annoying, or that public services will not expand to meet extra demand. This all creates strong incentives for existing residents to organise against new development. By contrast, the people who would live in homes that are not yet built do not get a say.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even most <small>Yimby</small> s do not argue that developers ought to have an untrammelled right to build anything, anywhere. In the decades after the second world war entire neighbourhoods were demolished by overzealous planners in a host of countries. But the pendulum has since swung too far the other way. In 2021 in Bethnal Green in east London, 291 homes were blocked by the High Court in part to save a mulberry tree. In Washington, <small>DC</small> ,<small> </small>earlier this year a surface car park built in the 1960s was ruled to be an integral part of a historic bank, making any plans to build on it subject to tough additional scrutiny. In Dublin, Ireland, in January a development of nearly 1,600 homes was blocked by the High Court for a variety of reasons. But it was noted that the move protected a pair of “striking brick arches” from demolition. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="1383" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Ryan Gillett</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> David Broockman, a San Francisco <small>Yimby</small> who happens to be a political scientist at Berkeley, suggests that Nimbyism often wins despite the huge benefits of building. That is because a project&#39;s interested parties squabble over how to share the value created by allowing it. Some want it to be used to subsidise affordable housing; some want environmental protections; some want prettier buildings; some want tax. “Every group is asking for too much,” says Mr Broockman. The end result is that nothing gets done and everybody is worse off, he concludes.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Is Yimbyism able to help? Housing construction has risen in California in recent years: more homes were built in the state last year than in any since 2008. Some of this is thanks to modest <small>Yimby</small> reforms. In the Los Angeles area, there has been a boom in the construction of accessory dwelling units. Typically, these are built in the garden of an existing house. Statewide, around 60,000 have been permitted since 2017 and in 2022 they made up one in seven of all homes constructed; most of them have been put up in the Los Angeles area.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Overall construction is still far too low to make California truly affordable again, however. The big question is whether recent reforms can induce more. In May, Emeryville, home of the socialist bicycle-riding mayor, was designated by the state of California as one of just 22 cities out of 482 to be officially “pro-housing”, meaning it plans to substantially exceed its mandated targets for construction. The city, which is wedged in between Berkeley and Oakland, about half an hour from downtown San Francisco, proposes to allow the construction of 3,687 new homes over the next eight years. That is roughly one new unit for every two existing units. But many other places are fighting their legal requirements to plan for more housing.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What is clear is that allowing construction does reduce rents. Activists point to one place where it has already had a measurable and large effect. In 2016 New Zealand&#39;s parliament passed a sweeping upzoning of the city of Auckland. The result, says Ryan Greenaway-McGrevy, an economist at the University of Auckland who has analysed the data, was a big increase in building. The number of new homes that got permission to be built went up from 2,500 to 15,000 between 2010 and 2021. Of course, like many other countries, New Zealand was dealing with the effects of the global financial crisis back in 2010. But all over the city, smart blocks of flats that can fit many inhabitants have quickly replaced fading 1960s detached houses. Homeowners have seen the value of their land go up, as it can now be redeveloped. But the cost of renting a single home has fallen, unlike in the rest of New Zealand.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It will take a lot to undo decades of undersupply. In Britain a study published this year by the Centre for Cities, a think-tank, estimates that the country is short of 4.3m homes relative to the number built in other European countries. A study in 2015 of America put the annual cost of restricted development in America&#39;s biggest cities at more than 9% of <small>GDP</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But as the costs rise, so too do the potential benefits of building. Whether Silicon Valley&#39;s richest tech investors can take advantage of that remains to be seen. Already the existing residents of Solano County are preparing to push back against “California Forever”. More politicians should look at Mr Bauters in Emeryville and follow his example. For his part, Mr Bauters just wishes that everyone would spend much less time talking and far more time building. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Sep 2023 19:11:55 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/8ervd8t1hpi4r2877llb0l57qf0mkm3k</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/09/06/the-growing-global-movement-to-restrain-house-prices </item><item><title><![CDATA[A new nuclear arms race looms]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/053%20International%20-%20A%20new%20nuclear%20arms%20race-057531408493f81ba5d410acd741dfe6.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>F</span> <small>rom</small> <small>offices</small> in America&#39;s State Department and Russia&#39;s Ministry of Defence, officials take turns “pinging” each other every couple of hours just to check the line is working. Then, almost always, silence follows. It is the dying heartbeat of global nuclear arms control.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Until March the direct link between the Nuclear Risk Reduction Centres ( <small>nrrc</small> s) of the world&#39;s two biggest nuclear powers was alive with messages informing each other about the movement of missiles and bombers. Under New <small>start</small> , which came into force in 2011 and which includes caps on long-range nuclear weapons, there were 2,000-odd such notifications in 2022. No longer. The half-yearly updates on warhead numbers have stopped, too. And there have been no on-site inspections since March 2020.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For now, Russia and America still abide by the treaty&#39;s confines on warhead numbers. They also exchange notifications of upcoming ballistic-missile launches under a previous accord (they have swapped only a few such messages in recent months). And they still hear from each other through separate multilateral channels used for the dozen or so agreements requiring notification through <small>nrrc</small> s.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nevertheless, the world is drifting towards a new nuclear arms race.

They brought down the global nuclear stockpile from 70,400 warheads in 1986 to 12,500 today (see chart).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That era is ending, for four main reasons: America&#39;s abandonment of agreements, Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine, China&#39;s nuclear build-up and disruptive technology. Begin with America. In 2002 President George W. Bush withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (which limited anti-missile defences), pointing to the dangers from North Korea and Iran. And in 2019 another Republican president, Donald Trump, pulled out of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/02/01/america-withdraws-from-the-intermediate-range-nuclear-forces-treaty">Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty</a> (which eliminated that category of missiles), citing cheating by Russia and China&#39;s rise.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Democratic presidents have been keener on arms control. <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/01/30/the-world-is-facing-an-upsurge-of-nuclear-proliferation">New <small>start</small></a> was negotiated by Barack Obama and then renewed for five years by Joe Biden in 2021. It limits each side&#39;s “strategic” nuclear weapons (long-distance arms with high destructive power) to 1,550 deployed warheads and 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles <small>(ICBM</small> s), bombers and submarine-launched ballistic missiles.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But New <small>start</small> does not control “non-strategic” or “tactical” weapons, usually smaller ones for battlefield use. Russia is thought to have 1,800 of them and America just 200. Nor does it capture Russia&#39;s work on things such as nuclear-propelled cruise missiles and torpedoes. In turn, Russia complains that the nuclear arsenals of Britain and France, American allies with more than 200 warheads each, are excluded. New <small>start</small> is set to expire in February 2026, and there is little prospect of a follow-on deal. In less than three years, the last major restraint on the world&#39;s nuclear stockpile may well be removed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For that blame Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine, and its <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2022/09/29/could-the-war-in-ukraine-go-nuclear">repeated threats</a> to use nuclear weapons. Western countries have armed Ukraine, but have not sent their own troops, in part for fear of “world war three”. In February Russia said it would “suspend” New <small>start</small> , halting notifications. America <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/03/30/perils-grow-as-america-and-russia-stop-sharing-data-on-nukes">responded in kind</a> in March and June. Each side has since become ever less certain about the other&#39;s posture, magnifying the risk of nuclear brinkmanship—especially at a time when the Kremlin is at war. Poland says Russia has started moving tactical weapons to Belarus.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Then there is China, which is already racing to build up its <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/china-seeks-to-join-the-nuclear-big-league/21806104">nuclear force</a> . Unconstrained by treaties, it has long observed a “minimal deterrence” policy with a few hundred warheads. But the Pentagon estimates its stockpile will grow to perhaps 1,500 by 2035. That is close to New <small>start&#39;</small> s deployed limit.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nuclear tensions could spread further and unpredictably. India, which has an unresolved border dispute with China, may feel compelled to increase its stockpile, currently estimated at more than 160 warheads. That in turn may prompt Pakistan, with a similar number, to build up. North Korea, with perhaps 30 warheads, is intensively testing <small>ICBM</small> s. And Iran has become a threshold nuclear state.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> New technologies could aggravate matters. Hypersonic missiles are harder to detect and shoot down than ballistic ones. Improvements in sensors and accuracy heighten worries about a disabling surprise attack. And the spread of artificial intelligence ( <small>aI</small> ) raises questions of how far nuclear war might be fought by computers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In response, America has been flashing its nuclear sabre, if not quite rattling it. Its ballistic-missile submarines, which usually lurk unseen for months-long patrols, have been surfacing around the world of late. In July the <i>USS Kentucky</i> moored in the South Korean port of Busan, and the <i>USS Tennessee</i> called at Faslane in Scotland. In May naval commanders from Japan and South Korea embarked the <i>USS Maine</i> off Guam. Last October the <i>USS West Virginia</i> popped up in the Arabian Sea, in an apparent signal to Iran, for a visit by the head of America&#39;s Central Command.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The “silent service” is no longer silent. “You can&#39;t have a credible deterrent without communicating your capabilities,” Rear Admiral Jeffrey Jablon, commander of America&#39;s submarine force in the Indo-Pacific, told <i>Breaking Defense</i> . “If the adversary doesn&#39;t know anything about that specific deterrent, it&#39;s not a deterrent.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America wants to reassure allies that its “extended deterrence”—the promise to defend them from nuclear attack even if they eschew nuclear weapons—remains strong. Some in Poland and South Korea want America to store <small>b</small> 61 nuclear gravity bombs in their countries. It has resisted. But showing “boomer” subs serves as warning to foes and reassurance to friends.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America is busy modernising all three legs of its nuclear “triad” with new ground, air and sea systems. An unspoken aim is to rev up the nuclear industrial base to be able to produce more weapons in future, should they be needed. Some want to go further. A paper in March by the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, a government-funded institute that among other things designs nuclear warheads, said America&#39;s current nuclear force is “only marginally sufficient”. America should expand it when New <small>start</small> expires by “expeditious uploading”, deploying weapons currently held in reserve, for instance as multiple warheads on <small>icbm</small> s; before then, it should demonstrate the ability to do so.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America has a greater “upload capacity” than Russia. The Federation of American Scientists, which campaigns to minimise global risks, calculates that from the current total of about 1,670 deployed strategic warheads each (it uses different counting rules from those for New <small>Start</small> ), America could within a couple of years deploy 3,570 compared with 2,629 for Russia. Some experts worry that big powers might also resume testing nuclear weapons, an idea discussed in the Trump years.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Talking of an “inflection point” in the nuclear balance, Jake Sullivan, Mr Biden&#39;s national security adviser, declared in June that America was ready to discuss arms control with Russia and China “without preconditions”. Neither is rushing to take up his offer. Given its heavy losses in Ukraine, Russia is either too aggrieved or too reliant on nuclear weapons to consider a new accord. China, for its part, seems uninterested in limits, possibly until it achieves parity with America.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Indeed, parity has been the basis of arms control between America and Russia. But it is harder to agree on when three powers are involved. America, in particular, worries that Russia and China might ally against it, given that they have declared a “friendship without limits” and conduct joint air and sea patrols. Mr Sullivan insists that America does not need “to outnumber the combined total of our competitors” to deter them. Yet the pressure for America to increase its numbers may prove irresistible, says James Acton of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, an American think-tank. As long as America&#39;s targeting policy rests on “counterforce”—aiming nuclear weapons at the other&#39;s nuclear sites to neutralise them—more weapons in the hands of rivals will mean that America will need more, too.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Destroyer of worlds</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Eric Edelman, the Pentagon&#39;s former under-secretary for policy under Mr Bush, puts it differently, recalling cold-war reckonings about the ability to absorb a first strike and still be able to inflict unacceptable damage on a foe: “If you&#39;ve got two adversaries with 1,500 weapons each and one launched a strike and you ride it out, then retaliate: what reserve do you have left to deal with the other adversary?” He adds: “We don&#39;t really know yet what the right number is, but it&#39;s probably north of 1,550.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Given the poor prospects for new treaties to limit nuclear weapons, America is exploring less formal arrangements with China to prevent crises turning into conflict. Mr Sullivan proposed, for instance, extending the system of hotlines and notifications with Russia to all five permanent members of the <small>un</small> Security Council. But the Chinese response has been dispiriting. He summarised it thus: “If you wear a seat belt in a car, you&#39;re going to be incentivised to drive faster and more crazy, and then you&#39;ll have a crash. So, in a way, better not to have the seat belt.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Controlling the use of artificial intelligence is even harder, given that it cannot be seen and counted as <small>ICBM</small> s can. Even if <small>ai</small> can help decision-making, America, Britain and France have pushed for a norm requiring that there should always be “a man in the loop” when it comes to the use of nuclear weapons.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America&#39;s <small>nrrc</small> remains fully staffed, with 40-odd people tending the lines, hoping for better times between Washington and Moscow. “Maintaining that line in times of good relations is important; it&#39;s much more important when tensions rise, because the potential impact of miscalculations grows as other channels are strained,” says an American official. A Russian-speaker is always on hand. In a wiser world, there would be a Chinese-speaker, too. On screen <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/07/14/realism-with-oppenheimer-or-escapism-with-barbie">Oppenheimer</a> is told that he has given people “the power to destroy themselves”. The question now is whether humanity still has the power to save itself in the face of new nuclear nightmares. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 29 Aug 2023 19:54:48 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/0t37ltqo54rqg3pqo0rrg5i5djuuh8th</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/08/29/a-new-nuclear-arms-race-looms </item><item><title><![CDATA[Reassessing Obama’s biggest mistake]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/054%20International%20-%20A%20red%20line%20over%20Syria-ceb29324071ee9f75670e6dc08a272c0.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>HE FORCES</small> of Syria&#39;s president, Bashar al-Assad, struck soon after 2am. Residents of Ghouta, a Damascus suburb, told reporters that they heard a strange noise, as if someone was opening a bottle of Pepsi. A local doctor, fighting back tears, explained that many people had sought shelter underground, but the gas was heavier than air and it pooled in basements and cellars. Had they climbed the stairs instead, they would have lived. More than 1,000 people perished that night. The doctor distributed some 25,000 ampoules of atropine and 7,000 of hydrocortisone to medical teams so they could try to save those who were suffering the effects of nerve agent.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Assad fired <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2013/08/24/if-this-isnt-a-red-line-what-is">sarin-filled rockets</a> at Ghouta on August 21st 2013. It was the deadliest day of the Syrian civil war. It <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2013/04/27/acid-test">challenged Barack Obama</a> , then America&#39;s president, to act on his warning that “a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons being moved around or utilised. That would change my calculus.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ten years after Ghouta, Mr Obama&#39;s red line over Syria is remembered as a defining moment of his presidency. Rather than strike immediately, he first decided to ask for a vote in Congress and then agreed not to act at all <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2013/09/20/an-unlikely-band-of-brothers">if Russia stepped in</a> to oversee Syria&#39;s chemical disarmament. Critics argue that Mr Obama&#39;s reluctance to punish Mr Assad diminished America&#39;s credibility and that the consequences are still being felt even now.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Speaking to the <small>BBC</small> last month, François Hollande, who was French president at the time, argued that it “was particularly bad for the Middle East. And it was decisive when it comes to relations between the West and Russia.” Back in 2013, <i>The Economist</i> lamented Mr Obama&#39;s choice, too, blaming him for “ <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2013/09/20/the-weakened-west">the weakened West</a> ”. But it is worth revisiting that judgment. Although there is no disputing the erosion of the West&#39;s credibility over the past decade, a salvo of cruise missiles fired against Mr Assad would hardly have rescued it. It may not even have spared the Syrian people from further nerve-gas attacks.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Obama&#39;s red line is a curious case of a policy that came about by accident and then succeeded brilliantly in its own terms only to be remembered as a historic failure. It raises questions over how much leaders can—or should—put credibility at the centre of their plans.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Oddly for such a meticulous politician, Mr Obama stumbled into laying down his <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2012/08/25/more-than-they-can-chew">red line</a> . Although the term suggests that he had settled on an ultimatum after carefully weighing up his options, the president shocked his aides at a White House news conference on August 20th 2012 when, seemingly on an impulse, he spoke about the consequences if Syria used chemical weapons. Only a handful of news outlets actually reported his remarks, perhaps because officials hastily briefed that the administration remained highly unlikely to intervene in Syria.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The officials were too late. Many people within the American government and abroad, including in London, wanted America to use military force to stop Mr Assad committing daily atrocities. They seized on Mr Obama&#39;s words. “It was going to detonate immediately,” says Steven Simon, a former Obama official and author of “Grand Delusions”, a new history of American policy in the Middle East. “There was no time-delay fuse attached to this.” </p><iframe type="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HQhKnW2uWv8?enablejsapi=1" class="css-xm8n1m e195f1ec0"></iframe><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What&#39;s more, Mr Obama himself wavered. In December 2012 and March 2013 Mr Assad was accused of using chemical weapons against his people. On the first occasion Mr Obama called such weapons “totally unacceptable”, on the second “a game-changer”. Yet, having thus built up expectations, three weeks after Ghouta, the president suddenly denied that his credibility was at stake, saying, “I didn&#39;t set a red line. The world set a red line.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> With hindsight, Mr Obama&#39;s error was to seem to want to have it both ways. The red-line formulation helped strengthen America&#39;s warning when Mr Assad appeared to be thinking about using nerve gas to terrorise his people. Yet, after the atrocity, the very firmness that made it a powerful threat also raised the cost of seeming to do too little. Theodore Roosevelt, America&#39;s 26th president, famously advised leaders to “speak softly and carry a big stick”. Mr Obama swapped noise for stick and paid a heavy price.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The -um in ultimatum</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Except that, if Mr Obama&#39;s aim was to stop Syria using nerve gas, he also succeeded beyond expectations. A few weeks after the attack, Russia had a plan for international inspectors to oversee the dismantling of Syria&#39;s chemical-weapons programme, if America would not strike.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “The deal to bring Syria into the Chemical Weapons Convention ( <small>CWC</small> ) was one of the greatest non-proliferation achievements of the 21st century,” believes Gregory Koblentz, a chemical-weapon expert who teaches at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Syria had the Middle East&#39;s most advanced programme, which it had built to deter a conventional military attack by Israel. With Russia&#39;s encouragement, international help and the good offices of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( <small>OPCW</small> ), it destroyed 1,300 tonnes of weapons and precursor chemicals, 1,200 munitions and demolished 27 production facilities. Dr Koblentz points out that ten to 12 rockets had killed over 1,000 people on August 21st. Each carried around 50 litres of nerve agent weighing a little under 55kg. By comparison, he reckons, the nerve agents Syria destroyed may have weighed 1,000 tonnes—enough to attack Ghouta 1,800 times over.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The record was far from perfect. Syria continued to use chlorine, including in <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/04/09/america-vows-to-respond-to-a-suspected-chemical-attack-in-syria">one highly lethal attack</a> in 2018, which Donald Trump, Mr Obama&#39;s successor, and Britain and France met with a barrage of cruise missiles. Dr Koblentz also observes that Syria held on to some nerve agent—though a tiny fraction of its initial stock—because Mr Assad launched three more nerve-agent attacks, though they caused much less harm than in Ghouta. In every case, Russia covered up for its ally, blaming the attacks on rebel forces. During emergency sessions at the <small>OPCW</small> , Syria&#39;s ambassador flaunted his contempt by playing “Angry Birds” on his phone.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the record is surely better than if America and its allies had tried to eliminate Syria&#39;s chemical weapons from afar. Mr Simon recalls how the early months of the war were all about how to stop chemical weapons falling into the wrong hands. “I spent a lot of my time dealing with the <small>US</small> and Israeli intelligence communities on pinpointing where all this stuff was,” he says, “and tracking or monitoring the vulnerability of specific installations to a breach by opposition forces and exploring ways with the <small>US</small> military on how those stockpiles might be destroyed by the United States unilaterally without creating a monstrous public-health hazard.” </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In addition, the Syrian civil war has not weakened the <small>CWC</small> (see chart). Many countries strongly condemned Russia over its attempt to poison Sergei Skripal, a former member of the <small>KGB</small> living in Britain, back in 2018 and Alexei Navalny, an opposition leader, in 2020 using another nerve agent called novichok. The <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2013/09/16/why-is-the-use-of-chemical-weapons-taboo">taboo against chemical weapons</a> remains.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet if Syria&#39;s programme was mostly dismantled and the <small>CWC</small> is intact, why has American credibility suffered? One answer, says Keren Yarhi-Milo, dean of Columbia University&#39;s School of International and Public Affairs, is that policy choices have audiences far beyond their narrow target. In Mr Obama&#39;s case this audience was packed with people who already doubted his resolve. His tough talk over Syria&#39;s red line was overshadowed by his oft-stated desire for America to devote less of its resources to policing the Middle East—and indeed the world as a whole. The United States had become bogged down in Afghanistan and Iraq. The decision to “lead from behind” in Libya to remove Muammar Qaddafi, its tyrannical president, at the behest of Britain and France had ended in chaos. Mr Obama&#39;s attempts to strike a deal with Iran over its nuclear programme was seen as too accommodating by some leaders in Israel and the Gulf.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Dr Yarhi-Milo argues that, as well as being judged on policies, leaders also acquire a “signalling reputation” reflecting their record of carrying out threats and honouring promises. Experts disagree about how much this reputation is worth. Some argue that foreign powers take hard-nosed decisions, based on their assessment of a leader&#39;s capabilities and interests in the moment, rather than on his or her past. However Dr Yarhi-Milo&#39;s research suggests that, in the real world, foreign powers use reputation as a guide. “Somebody like Putin doesn&#39;t engage in those kinds of super-rationalist calculations,” she says. “They use shortcuts. And those…many times are based on their personal experience interacting with that country.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Obama&#39;s reputation strikes Mr Simon as monumentally unfair. He points out that in 2013 the former president began a massive operation to train and support rebel fighters in Syria and argues that was far more significant than a punitive strike for Ghouta would have been. Middle Eastern leaders knew about this commitment, but it does not seem to have won much credit with them. Furthermore, Mr Simon describes in his book how, since the second term of George W. Bush, every American president has sought to limit America&#39;s commitment to the Middle East. And yet the red line over Syria is nevertheless treated as a turning-point.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Looking back across a decade, Mr Obama&#39;s record shows how elusive credibility can be. Mr Obama has insisted he has no regrets. In 2016 he told the <i>Atlantic</i> that “dropping bombs on someone to prove that you&#39;re willing to drop bombs on someone is just about the worst reason to use force”. That is surely correct. When Richard Nixon bombed Cambodia and the Viet Cong in the 1970s, in the belief that developing countries would otherwise topple like dominoes, it cost a lot of lives without saving America&#39;s reputation. Furthermore, leaders such as Turkey&#39;s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, feel free to flip-flop but are still able to exert power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even so, the success in dealing with Syria&#39;s chemical weapons has been eclipsed by the more general truth that America&#39;s position in the Middle East has weakened—partly by choice. That has been thrown into relief by the rise of Islamic State in 2014 as a violent source of anarchy and chaos. It was made worse by the fact that the man who stepped in to handle Syria with Mr Obama&#39;s blessing was Vladimir Putin. He has since increased his hold over the country, derided America&#39;s pretences to act as a global policeman and sent his troops into Ukraine. The red line has stuck because it represents a powerful metaphor for America&#39;s ongoing struggles to cope with a complicated world. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 22 Aug 2023 15:39:32 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/bo415ehglq99vastu7lf5rolllspmlip</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/08/22/reassessing-barack-obamas-red-line-in-syria </item><item><title><![CDATA[The BRICS bloc is riven with tensions]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/054%20International%20-%20The%20BRICS%20summit-84cd09de06bdf14a3fd321f5fad74898.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>L</span> <small>IKE THE</small> iPod and MySpace, the <small>BRICS</small> bloc is a product of the benign optimism of the 2000s. In 2001 Goldman Sachs coined the acronym <small>BRIC</small> in a paper about the economic potential of Brazil, Russia, India and China. The quartet ran with the idea, holding its first summit in 2009. A year later South Africa was invited to join. Some analysts feared the <small>BRICS</small> might soon start to rival the <small>G7,</small> but the grouping quickly lost momentum. The non-Asian <small>BRICS</small> economies stagnated in the 2010s. At summits the bloc would issue garbled communiqués about the perfidious West—which the perfidious West would promptly ignore. The <small>BRICS</small> looked dead.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> And yet the bloc lives. On August 22nd the 15th <small>BRICS</small> summit will open in Johannesburg, a major South African city—a party for many of the biggest swing voters in geopolitics. Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa&#39;s president, will be joined by leaders including Narendra Modi of India, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil (known universally as Lula) and China&#39;s Xi Jinping. Vladimir Putin will not be there in person. Were he to attend, then South Africa, as a member of the International Criminal Court, would be obliged to act on the arrest warrant the court issued for Russia&#39;s president in March. And that might spoil the fun.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The meeting will underline how the bloc has been rejuvenated by Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine and rising tensions between the West and China. <small>BRICS</small> members, led by Beijing, are considering whether to expand and deepen the bloc. Some middle powers see the group as a possible vehicle for their interests. The bloc says that more than 40 countries have either applied to join it or have expressed an interest in doing so.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A “Big <small>BRICS</small> ” would be a challenge for the West. But it is not a mortal threat. China&#39;s efforts to enlarge the bloc are revealing its tensions and contradictions. A weakened Russia is going along with it, but Brazil, India and South Africa are sceptical. The <small>BRICS</small> are far more heterogeneous than the <small>G7</small> . Members differ politically, economically and militarily; expansion would make a motley crew even motlier. It would mean that although the <small>BRICS</small> could criticise the Western-led international order with a louder voice, they would struggle even more to articulate an alternative.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What, then, holds the <small>BRICS</small> together? Like the <small>G7,</small> the group has no charter or formal membership criteria. Nor is its mortar the product of personal chemistry. In June at a meeting of foreign ministers in Cape Town, a kind of warm-up for the main event, your correspondent snuck into the restaurant hosting the dignitaries&#39; lunch. The pasta salad was not the shindig&#39;s only sad sight. The delegations were scattered: the Chinese were too busy in meetings, the South Africans too disorganised, the Brazilians too late. Outside, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India&#39;s foreign minister, held court with his officials. Inside, Sergey Lavrov, his Russian counterpart, silently nursed a glass of white wine.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Working the room</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>BRICS</small> endure because the club serves several functions. One is to provide a platform for members to criticise, often with justification, the way institutions such as the World Bank, <small>IMF</small> and <small>UN</small> Security Council sideline the “global south”, a modish term for developing countries. In Cape Town Mr Jaishankar talked of the “concentration” of global economic power that was “leaving too many nations at the mercy of too few”. Oddly, such views have become more pointed as the <small>BRICS</small> &#39; share of world <small>GDP</small> has increased, from 8% in 2001 to 26% today. Over the same period the <small>G7</small> ’s share has fallen from 65% to 43% (see chart 1). </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The clubbiness of the <small>BRICS</small> is also a source of prestige, especially for struggling members. On average the <small>GDP</small> of Brazil, Russia and South Africa has grown by less than 1% annually since 2013 (versus around 6% for China and India). Any investment analyst who picked them among the most promising emerging markets today would be laughed off her Zoom call. But being the only Latin American country and the only African country in the group respectively allows Brazil and South Africa to project continental influence: Mr Ramaphosa has invited an enormous number of African leaders to the Johannesburg summit.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The bloc offers support in isolated times, too. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil&#39;s former president, turned to the <small>BRICS</small> after his ally, Donald Trump, left the White House. These days Russia needs the <small>BRICS</small> more than ever. At the meeting of foreign ministers your correspondent tried to ask Russia&#39;s ambassador to South Africa what the bloc&#39;s purpose was for his country. “To make more friends,” he grunted.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> He will have them, if China gets its way. Beijing wants to admit more countries from the global south. The reasoning is almost Newtonian: America&#39;s rallying of Western allies is prompting China into seeking an equal and opposite reaction via the <small>BRICS.</small> Viewed from China, there is no other bloc that could be a counterweight to the <small>G7.</small> The Shanghai Co-operation Organisation is too Eurasian. The <small>G20</small> is too dominated by its Western members. The <small>BRICS</small> represent the best party going. A Chinese official contrasts Beijing&#39;s desire for a “big family” of the <small>BRICS</small> countries with the West&#39;s “small circle”.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Supersize Xi</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is not the first time that Beijing has sought a bigger crowd. It championed South Africa&#39;s admission. Since then it has repeatedly raised the idea of adding more members, especially after Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. Though the <small>BRICS</small> say their decisions are based on consensus, China is hard to ignore. Its share of the <small>BRICS</small> output was 47% in 2001; today it is 70%. In 2022 it accounted for 69% of all trade by the group (the sum of members&#39; imports and exports), up from 55% in 2001. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The bloc has not released an official list of applicants. But, as part of a thought experiment, <i>The Economist</i> counted 18 countries that are possible candidates, based on their meeting at least one of three criteria as of the end of July (see map). First, the country is on record as saying it has applied. Second, South African officials have named the country as an applicant. Third, the country&#39;s foreign minister attended the Cape Town meeting as a “friend” of the bloc, either in person or virtually.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The guest list includes some increasingly assertive geopolitical swingers. For Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ( <small>UAE</small> ), joining the <small>BRICS</small> would fit with their efforts to recalibrate their relationship with America, their long-time ally, and to draw closer to China. Bangladesh and Indonesia, like India, are populous Asian democracies that claim to be non-aligned—and that might also like some protection from Western criticism of their human-rights records. Argentina, Ethiopia, Mexico and Nigeria are all among the largest countries on their continents.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the unlikely event that all 18 were admitted it would challenge the world&#39;s best Scrabble player to come up with a new acronym. It would also increase the population of the <small>BRICS</small> countries from 3.2bn (41% as a share of the world&#39;s) to 4.6bn (58%), versus 10% for the <small>G7</small> members. The Big <small>BRICS&#39;</small> share of world <small>GDP</small> would rise to 34%, still behind the <small>G7</small> ’s but twice the share of the <small>EU</small> . It would raise the bloc&#39;s share of world trade from 18% to 27%. China would still be the life, soul and wallet of the party, however. It would account for 55% of the 23 countries&#39; output (for reference, America has 58% of the <small>G7</small> ). China&#39;s share of the Big <small>BRICS</small> &#39; global trade would still be about half (46%).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even as the bloc debates expansion, it is deepening its existing relationships. On top of the annual summit of bigwigs there is an increasingly long list of meetings involving academics, firms, ministers, ruling parties and think-tanks from <small>BRICS</small> members and countries friendly to them. Some of these might look like excuses for per-diems. Last month a meeting of the “ <small>BRICS</small> youth summit” was hosted by South Africa&#39;s 74-year-old youth minister. Russia says it will host a “ <small>BRICS</small> Games” before the Paris Olympics next year. But the importance of the connections to officials should not be overlooked, argues Oliver Stuenkel of the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a Brazilian think-tank. “These meetings are often dull but they allow bureaucrats to globalise their network.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>BRICS</small> bloc also has more serious endeavours. It has established two financial institutions, which the Russian finance minister once reportedly described as a mini- <small>IMF</small> and a mini-World Bank. The former is the Contingent Reserve Arrangement ( <small>CRA</small> ), which was agreed to at the <small>BRICS</small> summit in 2014. It is an as yet untested series of swap lines for central banks to get hard currency if they have balance-of-payments problems.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The mini-World Bank is the New Development Bank ( <small>NDB</small> ). Since its establishment in 2015 it has lent $33bn for almost 100 projects. Three new members have joined in the past three years: Bangladesh, Egypt and the <small>UAE</small> . Uruguay is set to be admitted soon. (A state does not need to be a member of the <small>BRICS</small> to join the bank.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The possibility of expanding and deepening the grouping is seen by members as proof of its strength. Yet these efforts also highlight divisions among the gang. Economically and politically the <small>BRICS</small> are a mess—adding more members or functions would only emphasise that fact.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Start with the economic differences. The <small>GDP</small> per person of the poorest member, India, is roughly a fifth of that of China and Russia. The latter pair run current-account surpluses, the others deficits. Russia, an important member of the <small>OPEC+</small> cartel, and Brazil are net oil exporters; the other three depend on imports. China actively manages the exchange rate of its currency; the other four intervene less often. And so on.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All of this complicates the bloc&#39;s attempt to change the global economic order. A common <small>BRICS</small> reserve currency—something Mr Putin claimed the bloc was working on a year ago—would collapse on first contact with reality; no member would give up the power held by their central bank. Members regularly guard their own power at economic institutions. South Africa&#39;s efforts to have more African representation on the <small>IMF</small> board have been rejected. China has around 40% of the voting rights at the <small>CRA</small> , in line with its capital contribution, and insisted on a limit to what any country can receive in the absence of an <small>IMF</small> programme.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>NDB</small> has had a slow start. Its total lending since 2015 is a third of what the World Bank Group committed in 2021 alone. The World Bank is more transparent and accountable than the <small>NDB</small> , notes Daniel Bradlow of the University of Pretoria in South Africa. That the <small>NDB</small> mostly issues loans in <small>US</small> dollars or euros somewhat undermines its members&#39; claim to be trying to reduce the power of the greenback. A rule ensures that the five original members retain 55% of voting rights, belying their criticisms of uneven decision-making power at the World Bank and the <small>IMF</small> . “That does not suggest a truly progressive global-south bank,” says Mr Bradlow.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Politically, too, they are an eclectic bunch. Russia and China are autocracies that disdain liberal freedoms. Brazil, India and South Africa are by contrast raucous, if flawed, democracies. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The trio have more reason to be wary of public opinion as a result. A poll published on July 27th by the Pew Research Centre, a think-tank based in Washington, <small>DC</small> , found that negative views towards China have become more common since 2019—and not just in the West. In South Africa 40% of respondents had an unfavourable view of China, up from 35% four years ago. In Brazil and India unfavourable sentiment reached the highest levels since polling began in 2010 and 2013 respectively. In Brazil the share rose from 27% to 48%; in India from 46% to 67% (see chart 2).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The democracies are also keener than the autocracies on genuinely “non-aligned” foreign policies—they want to stay swingers. Take South Africa. It has angered the West by, among other things, hosting a naval exercise with China and Russia on the first anniversary of the war in Ukraine. It has government ministers who get dewy-eyed at the very mention of the Soviet Union.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Mr Ramaphosa is wary of pushing the West too far. Several of South Africa&#39;s main sources of foreign direct investment ( <small>FDI</small> ) are Western powers, and it hosts drills with <small>NATO</small> countries, too. He wants to keep South Africa&#39;s preferential trade terms with America, which some in Congress have said should be rescinded in light of his government&#39;s drift towards Russia.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Lula also has a more subtle approach than his peers in Beijing and Moscow. He would like to reduce what he sees as America&#39;s hegemonic role in the world; hence his enthusiasm for the <small>BRICS</small> , which he helped establish during his first period in office in the 2000s. At the same time he understands the need for good relations with the West, which is its main source of <small>FDI</small> and arms. And although India continues to buy arms from Russia, it is diversifying its military ties and buying more from America and France.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine has entrenched diplomatic faultlines in other ways. The bloc&#39;s strong emphasis on sovereignty—originally a way to draw an implicit contrast with an interventionist West—looks hollow when Russia invades its neighbour. Neither China nor Russia supports the others&#39; proposed reforms of the <small>UN</small> Security Council, of which they are both permanent members. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="An illustration of five mostly empty cocktail glasses with flags respresenting South Africa, China, Brazil, India and Russia scattered around and confetti on the floor.

Though Lula is more sympathetic to the idea of welcoming like-minded Latin American leaders to the club, such as Argentina&#39;s Alberto Fernández (with whom he is personally close), diplomatic types are more sceptical. Mauro Vieira, Brazil&#39;s foreign minister and a career diplomat, has spoken of the need to protect the <small>BRICS</small> “brand”. South Africa likes being the only African representative in the bloc. China would be emboldened by a bigger <small>BRICS;</small> others would feel enfeebled.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All these differences are coming to the fore because of expansion talk. “We do not want to dilute control of the <small>BRICS</small> from the original five,” says a South African official. South Africa instead hopes for a compromise whereby joiners are given second-class status, mere <small>B</small> -listers at the party. The details need to be worked out—something which may happen at the summit.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Warring parties</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The critical dissenting voice is likely to be India&#39;s, given its growing economic and geopolitical importance. In the early days of the bloc “India thought that with the help of Russia it could manage China better,” says Harsh Pant of the Observer Research Foundation, a think-tank in Delhi. That is harder now Russia is beholden to China. And India frets about some of the wannabes, such as Cuba and Belarus. India fears these would be mini-Russias, repeating China&#39;s talking points.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> India sees itself as a rival to China for leadership of the global south. It has used its presidency of the <small>G20</small> this year to amplify the concerns of developing countries regarding climate finance and international institutions. It would not want to play second fiddle to a Chinese effort to woo this same group.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The tricky thing for India is that it doesn&#39;t want to be a party-pooper either. Nor is it keen to attract the blame for blocking other emerging countries&#39; aspirations. And it aims to preserve decent relations with China, with which it has deep economic links and a long border. So India is proceeding with caution. It wants to discuss joining criteria for new members in the coming weeks, rather than simply handing out welcome drinks.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Johannesburg summit will be a defining moment for the <small>BRICS.</small> Enlargement would indicate the scale of China&#39;s sway on the scene. But if China is blocked it would underline the group&#39;s deep divisions. Either way, the global south is showing that it is as transactional as the Western countries it claims moral superiority over.

They knew that Vladimir Putin had planned an invasion—they had stolen his plans. But would Mr Putin go through with it? One indicator that he would, says Major-General Tim Hodgetts, the surgeon-general of Britain&#39;s armed forces, was that field hospitals were moving to Russia&#39;s border with Ukraine.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That was telling, but not damning. Russia had deployed hospitals for exercises in the past. More worrying were the ongoing blood drives among the country&#39;s university students. Red blood cells last only six weeks if not frozen; donors can be bled only every three months. Even more troubling was what was happening inside the field hospitals. Russian surgeons were practising operations on large, anaesthetised animals. “Medical indicators and warnings are predictive of war,” concludes General Hodgetts. It is a vital lesson from Ukraine for future conflicts.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The war in Ukraine is the largest in Europe since 1945. Russia and Ukraine have fought at a scale and intensity that Western armies have not encountered since the Korean war. Military casualties have dwarfed those of recent American and European campaigns. America lost over 7,000 troops in Afghanistan and Iraq between 2001 and 2019. Ukraine has lost more than twice as many in a year, according to leaked American documents, Russia six to seven times more. The experience will change military medicine for good.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In Afghanistan and Iraq, America&#39;s army and its allies made astonishing progress in wartime medical care. Since the majority of deaths occur before soldiers arrive at a hospital, much was gained by evacuating wounded troops by helicopter and treating them within the “golden hour”, a period in which the chance of survival is far higher. Soldiers who once would have died pulled through. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The ratio of those wounded to killed, around three- or four-to-one in Vietnam, where care was poorer, shot up to as high as ten-to-one (see chart). In Ukraine the figure has plummeted back to Vietnam levels, say people familiar with the classified data. No more than 2% of American soldiers were killed or wounded in the post-2001 wars; the comparable figure is estimated at 5-10% for Ukraine. A study from 2022 by the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank, suggested that 40% of wounded Ukrainian personnel were suffering permanent injuries.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To a certain extent these figures reflect the limitations of medical care on both sides. Russia&#39;s army treats infantry as disposable. Wounded soldiers have been sent back to the front lines with serious shrapnel wounds and cardiac problems. Tanisha Fazal of the University of Minnesota, an expert on medical care in war, says her jaw dropped when she saw a video of a Russian officer using an obsolete rubber tourniquet. It was of the sort that America used in Afghanistan in the early 2000s.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For its part, Ukraine is in the midst of a transition away from Soviet-style care. Before 2017 it had no professional cadre of combat medics, says Maria Nazarova, an instructor in the country&#39;s armed forces. By 2022 it had trained 650 of them, a drop in the ocean for a notional million-man army. The training centre, short of instructors and facilities, now prepares fewer than 300 people per month for the battlefield, each of whom has had just those four weeks of instruction.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The current counter-offensive, which is forcing Ukrainian troops to cross minefields in the teeth of drone and artillery attacks, is intensifying the burden on medical care. “I have not seen such a spike in the demand for tourniquets since June last year,” says Evgen Vorobiov, a lawyer in Kyiv who works as a volunteer with six different brigades. He adds that chest seals and ultrasound devices are also needed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The shortages are compounded by structural problems. The supply of military equipment to front-line units remains inefficient and ad hoc, says Mr Vorobiov. Senior medics spend their time filling out paper forms to request supplies that arrive erratically and in small quantities. There is frequent tension between front-line units and the general staff&#39;s central medical command, which sees its job as running hospitals rather than supporting front-line care. It does not provide vital kit, such as portable ultrasound or intraosseous access devices, which are needed to get fluids into patients when veins can&#39;t be found—a common problem for soldiers in shock, says Ms Nazarova. Over 90% of medical supplies for combat medics are purchased by volunteers, she says.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This bureaucratic infighting has more serious consequences, too. America&#39;s army realised in the 2000s that transfusing wounded soldiers with “whole” blood, rather than components like plasma, was saving lives. Last summer Ukraine&#39;s health ministry legalised that practice. The medical command, in a fit of bureaucracy, then stepped in to ban it. But many “modern-thinking” Ukrainian brigades continue doing it regardless, says Ms Nazarova, using personal contacts with local blood-donation centres. The result is uneven levels of care throughout the armed forces.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Western armies would enjoy many advantages in a big war, including more skilled personnel and better equipment. But American and European military doctors acknowledge that a large conflict would prove a huge shock to medical care honed over decades of counterinsurgency campaigns against opponents lacking in artillery, missiles and drones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Take helicopters, which are critical for transporting the wounded. Just 70 American ones were downed by fire between 2001 and 2009 in Afghanistan and Iraq. Russia has lost 90 in 17 months. “This recognition that the next war will likely be very different in air superiority has changed lots of paradigms within the <small>US</small> and <small>NATO</small> militaries,” says John Holcomb, a professor at the University of Alabama who led the <small>US</small> Army&#39;s Institute of Surgical Research. There will be “prolonged field care” outside hospitals. “Clinical outcomes will be poor,” warns General Hodgetts.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Injury patterns will differ, too. Around 79% of America&#39;s casualties in the wars after the attacks of September 11th, 2001 were from improvised explosive devices. More than 70% of Ukrainian casualties are from artillery and rocket barrages, according to a recent paper published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons. These tend to affect a larger number of soldiers at once, causing “polytrauma”—damage to multiple body parts and organs.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Treating such injuries at scale will tax European armies. Consider blood. It is a “strategic commodity” for the alliance, writes Ronald Ti, a military-medical logistician at King&#39;s College London. A military health-care system that cannot provide it risks “systemic collapse of morale”, he warns. Dr Ti gives the example of Estonia: its main peacetime stock of blood could be exhausted in a single day of war (on <small>NATO</small> ’s standard assumptions about rates of use).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet stockpiling blood is not like storing ammo. Its shelf life when fresh is weeks (and, when frozen, months), not years. Thawing it from frozen takes time. Moreover, blood-donation levels in Britain routinely drop below a week&#39;s worth of reserves, notes General Hodgetts. The war is helping to resolve previously knotty legal issues in <small>NATO</small> around the interoperability of blood products and drugs. Britain is now investing to produce its own freeze-dried plasma, having previously depended on scarce French and German production that might be swamped in wartime.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another problem is how to shift tens of thousands of wounded soldiers. On July 11th <small>NATO</small> leaders approved the alliance&#39;s first comprehensive defence plans since the cold war. They included specific plans for mass-casualty transport across Europe, including how to distribute casualties among different allies, an issue neglected for years. <small>NATO</small> medical chiefs, sometimes joined by Ukraine&#39;s surgeon-general, have been meeting regularly to test how those procedures would fare in wartime. Up to 60% of Ukraine&#39;s military casualties have been moved by rail. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Medics once wanted hospitals to stand out in a war zone. The lesson from Ukraine, where Russia has struck facilities with large red crosses on the roof, is that it may be better to blend in. The World Health Organisation estimates that there have been almost 900 attacks on health facilities in the war (see map). Medical doctors are considering how to harden, camouflage or disperse their facilities. But light and agile field hospitals will inevitably provide more limited care. Another growing challenge is how to ensure that the electronic emissions of medical equipment do not serve as a beacon to enemy bombs.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Ready for action</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The war has also put nuclear weapons back on the agenda. In the autumn Western leaders grew concerned that Russia was preparing to use tactical nuclear weapons. America, Britain and France warned the Kremlin that it would face serious military consequences if it took that step; the danger subsided. In the cold war <small>NATO</small> planned to fight through a nuclear battlefield. Those plans faded away in the 1990s. Many officials now worry that America and its allies are medically unprepared for nuclear conflict. Vast numbers of burn kits would be needed, for example.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Finally, Ukraine illustrates how technology is changing military medicine. A study published in February 2021 by Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Maddry and his colleagues at the <small>US</small> Army&#39;s Institute of Surgical Research examined the records of 1,267 patients transported with traumatic injuries. Half did not receive any life-saving intervention en route and so might have been moved safely by drone.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine is testing that theory. It has already used large cargo drones, capable of carrying 180kg loads up to 70km, to evacuate wounded personnel, becoming the first country to conduct this sort of robotic medevac. “As technology advances,” write Lieutenant-Colonel Maddry and his co-authors, “robotics aboard [drones] could provide pain medications, blood products, oxygen, airway management, and even surgical procedures”—though the drones are subject to the same risks as helicopters, points out Dr Fazal.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The challenge is to learn from such experiments and Ukraine&#39;s broader experience. That requires turning anecdotes into hard data. America has offered to help Ukraine build a “trauma registry” of the sort that it used in Afghanistan and Iraq, a database which logs how patients are injured, how they have been treated and how they fare. Analysis will benefit not just allied armies, but also the wider public. Dr Holcomb has said that he was able to reduce the number of trauma deaths at his hospital, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, by 30% by applying skills picked up in the army. Ukraine&#39;s pain will lead to medical gains. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Correction (August 7th 2023): An earlier version of this article misspelt John Holcomb&#39;s name.对不起。</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 16:09:39 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/g794vi0alrl8i0nlpajpc32065ej0qfm</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/08/04/what-ukraines-bloody-battlefield-is-teaching-medics</item></channel></rss>
