公里到达红海沿岸，并且只穿过过去三年发生过政变的国家（见地图）。从几内亚到苏丹的长途跋涉将穿越撒哈拉以南的萨赫勒地区，自 2020 年 8 月以来，马里和布基纳法索各发生了两起政变，7 月在尼日尔发生了一场政变。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">非洲的面积比美国、中国、印度、日本和西欧的总和还要大，而且也不仅仅是政变地带。然而，这些收购是更广泛的政治危机的一部分。民意调查机构 Afrobarometer 的最新调查发现，自 2014 年以来，30 个国家中有 24 个国家对军事统治理念的支持度有所上升。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure

2014 年以来的最低比例。对潜在强人的支持或对民主的深切不满在整个政变带都很常见，但在相对稳定的地方也很常见，包括博茨瓦纳和南非（见图表） 2）。非洲民粹主义，由于缺乏更好的措辞，是一股日益强大的力量。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">为什么会有如此广泛的不满情绪？非洲人对大多数国家的“民主”骗局感到沮丧。他们还厌倦了既不提供安全也不提供繁荣的脆弱国家。其中约三分之二的人以及 36 个接受调查的国家中 28 个国家的大多数人认为，他们的国家正在走向错误的方向。如果这种情况继续下去，许多非洲人，尤其是年轻人，可能会忍不住重新考虑破旧的社会契约，并寻求彻底的改变。 </p><div

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最重要的失败是安全保障的提供。非洲国家往往在该弱的地方强，在该强的地方弱。许多政权善于殴打或关押对手，但却无能阻止其公民被抢劫或杀害。因此，那些承诺恢复安全的人，无论多么无情，都可以获得普通公民的支持。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">奥斯陆和平研究所去年发表的一篇论文称，尽管 20 世纪末的一些非洲战争造成的伤亡要大得多，但非洲冲突的总数正在上升。报告指出，2021 年小型冲突造成的死亡人数比自 1989 年开始提供数据以来的任何时候都要多。2021 年至少一方为国家的冲突数量比十年前要多。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">混乱加剧</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">自 2021 年以来，事情变得更加血腥。在布基纳法索、马里和尼日尔这三个与基地组织和伊斯兰国有联系的圣战分子发动骚乱的国家，冲突中的死亡人数已从 2016 年的不到 800 人上升到 2022 年的 10,000 多人。这三个国家的死亡人数已从 2016 年的不到 800 人上升到 2022 年的 10,000 多人。从基本上民主到 2020 年代遭受政变。政变主义者试图为他们的接管行为辩护，并通过指出民主制度下的不安全感来获得支持。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">随着圣战混乱蔓延到沿海国家，政治混乱可能随之而来。例如，多哥就拥有类似于最近在加蓬被推翻的王朝独裁政权：纳辛贝家族已经统治这个国家 56 年。该国还面临着日益严重的圣战不安全局势——自 2022 年 7 月以来，至少有 140 人被杀。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在非洲人口最多的国家尼日利亚，圣战分子在东北部制造恐怖袭击，帮派在西北部一次绑架数百人，武装分裂分子在东南部进行掠夺。中部地区农民和牧民之间的冲突加剧了流血事件。 2021 年和 2022 年，该国都有超过 10,000 人在冲突中丧生。今年的情况几乎同样糟糕。冲突追踪组织<small>ACLED</small>将尼日利亚列为全球暴力事件第五严重的国家，仅次于乌克兰。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尼日利亚的政治阶层懒洋洋地躺在戒备森严的豪宅里，与世隔绝。今年选举的投票率为29%，为历年来最低。超过 40% 的尼日利亚人认为，如果民选领导人滥用权力，武装部队接管权力是合法的。选举前，尼日利亚高级政治人物告诉<i>《经济学人》</i> ，他们听说过政变阴谋。鉴于该国在 20 世纪下半叶的大部分时间里都是由军事独裁者统治（极其糟糕），这是一个令人不安的事态发展。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">成分苛刻</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其他大国也因冲突而四分五裂。尽管以埃塞俄比亚提格雷地区为中心的内战可能已经结束，但阿姆哈拉州和奥罗米亚州的冲突仍在继续。自 2022 年 3 月以来，刚果东部暴力事件死灰复燃，已导致近 300 万人逃离家园。2023 年 4 月，苏丹陷入内战。这三个国家都是非洲人口最多的十个国家之一。在每个地方，人们都会在他们认为可以找到的地方寻求保护。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">战区以外的地区也感受到了不安全感。<small>非政府组织</small>网络开放社会基金会上个月发布的一项针对全球 30 个国家的民意调查显示，受访者担心政治暴力比例最高的 5 个国家中有 4 个是非洲国家：肯尼亚、尼日利亚、塞内加尔和南非。后者的谋杀率位居世界最高之列，并且正在再次上升。无法无天增加了对民粹主义者和治安维持者的支持。 72% 的南非人愿意将民选政府换成打击犯罪的强人。一位反对种族隔离的前内阁部长称赞保罗·卡加梅（Paul Kagame）因卢旺达明显缺乏犯罪行为（但较少提及其侵犯人权的情况）。 “卡加梅的想法是正确的：有时你需要敲响鞭子。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">经济停滞加剧了政治危机。从 1990 年到 2018 年，撒哈拉以南非洲的极端贫困人口从 2.84 亿增加到 4.33 亿，人口增长往往超过经济增长。该地区又损失了一个十年：2022 年的实际人均<small>GDP</small>低于十年前。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">家庭和政府也面临着财政紧缩。自大流行开始以来，撒哈拉以南非洲地区的通货膨胀率中位数增加了一倍多。在一个食品占消费量 40% 的地区，80% 的国家食品价格上涨幅度达到两位数。今年，约 17% 的政府收入将用于偿还外债，这是自 1999 年以来的最高比例。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在 Afrobarometer 民意调查中，“创造就业机会”是迄今为止 18 至 35 岁人群提到最多的优先事项。英国非<small>政府组织</small>莫·易卜拉欣基金会 (Mo Ibrahim Foundation) 估计，每年必须创造 1800 万个正式就业岗位，才能吸纳进入劳动力市场的人数；目前的数字是3m。去年，南非慈善机构非洲青年调查对 15 个国家的 18 至 24 岁青少年进行了调查，其中近一半表示他们正在考虑移民。年轻的尼日利亚人谈论“成年是一场骗局”，并寻找前往“ <i>japa</i> ”（约鲁巴语俚语，意为移民）的方法。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">今年早些时候，被西方视为非洲大陆罕见的自由派人士的哈坎德·希奇莱马警告他的外部支持者，非洲民主人士需要确保取得实质性成果，否则将面临政治后果。 “你不能吃民主，”赞比亚总统在一篇敦促外国债权人加快债务重组的评论文章中表示。 “人权可以支撑精神，但不能支撑身体。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对满足基本需求的渴望在一定程度上解释了为什么非洲人可能相对愿意考虑强人。开放社会民意调查询问威权主义者是否会在创造就业和打击犯罪等十个政策领域取得更好的成果。在八个案例中，撒哈拉以南非洲地区的平均水平高于全球平均水平。美国乔治城大学的肯·奥帕洛指出：“承诺提供更好物质条件的军政府总是会出现并赢得足够多的人心。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，非洲人对民主的信心正在直线下降，不仅因为他们的政府带来的不安全和贫困，还因为政治本身的性质。 20世纪90年代和2000年代，大多数非洲国家放弃一党制，实行多党选举。然而，盛大的选举掩盖了这样一个事实：非洲大部分地区仅拥有民主的光辉。我们的姊妹机构经济学人智库<small>(EIU)</small>仅将一个非洲国家（毛里求斯）列为“完全民主国家”，将六个国家列为“有缺陷的民主国家”。 1990 年至 2019 年间，现任总统在参加的 112 次选举中赢得了 88% 的胜利。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">九位领导人掌权已超过20年。其中包括乌干达的约韦里·穆塞韦尼 (Yoweri Museveni)；喀麦隆的保罗·比亚 (Paul Biya) 一年中大部分时间都在瑞士酒店度过；赤道几内亚总统特奥多罗·奥比昂是在任时间最长的国家总统；还有卡加梅先生。所有人都害怕公平的选举；所有人都可能在培养儿子担任公职。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">即使是相对新手也会滥用法律，从而加深挫败感。八月，津巴布韦主要反对党没有参加另一场可疑的选举，因为它认为法院有偏见。一个月前，中非共和国总统赢得了一场公投，他强行通过了法院，结束了任期限制。 2020 年，科特迪瓦总统阿拉萨内·瓦塔拉 (Alassane Ouattara) 在颇具争议地修改宪法以绕过两届任期限制后赢得了第三个任期。塞内加尔的麦基·萨尔今年在暴力抗议后选择不采取类似行动。但包括一名总统候选人在内的数百名反对党成员被捕，破坏了所赢得的任何善意。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在非洲晴雨表民意调查中，平均只有 13% 的人认为他们国家的总统中没有人腐败。监管机构透明国际 ( <small>TI</small> ) 发现，撒哈拉以南非洲国家的平均廉洁程度低于萨尔瓦多，萨尔瓦多腐败盛行，以至于千禧一代独裁者承诺专门为白领罪犯建造一座巨大监狱。 <small>TI 认为，平均而言，2022 年撒哈拉以南非洲地区的腐败认知比十年前稍差。</small></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">开放社会民意调查发现，腐败是加纳和尼日利亚选民最严重的国家问题。南非的选民也对此感到担忧，在 2009 年至 2018 年总统雅各布·祖马 (Jacob Zuma) 的领导下，“国家掠夺”变得无处不在。今天，对国家机构的掠夺仍然是南非和许多其他国家的一个问题。英国伯明翰大学的尼克·奇斯曼（Nic Cheeseman）认为，“私人权力网络对民主政治制度的控制可以说是对非洲公民自由和包容性发展的最大威胁。”</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">青春与经历</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">政变者利用对腐败的愤怒——而且它确实有效，至少在最初是这样。在马里第一次政变之前的一项民意调查中，58％的人认为总统职位上的大多数或全部人都腐败。两年后，第二次政变发生后，只有 25% 的人这么做了。在几内亚，政变前的比例几乎为 50%。此后份额下降至28%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">为什么对虚假民主的不满没有促使非洲人尝试获得更好的民主版本？有几个原因。首先，反对独裁是极其困难的。坏人通常都有枪。执政党也经常拉拢<small>非政府组织</small><small> </small>和青年团体。许多活动人士试图改善民主并投票罢免独裁者。然而，在经历了几十年的失败之后，一些人可能会得出这样的结论：只有更激进的方法，甚至政变，才能结束停滞和国家夺取。例如，几内亚主要反对派领导人告诉<i>《经济学人</i>》，在 2021 年政变推翻时任总统阿尔法·孔戴后，他立即“松了口气”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其次，有理由相信，对自由民主的支持比其拥护者希望的要软。例如，在马里，在第一次政变之前，对军事统治理念的支持率多年来一直持平，略低于 30%。现在，近 80% 的马里人表示他们赞成或强烈赞成军人统治。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管外界可能会指出自由民主从未在非洲真正尝试过，但这并不总是非洲人的观点。尼日利亚前总统奥卢塞贡·奥巴桑乔上个月表示：“我们已经看到，西方实行的自由主义民主对我们不起作用。”卡加梅先生也提出了类似的观点。 （“西方并没有定义非洲的民主。”）在非洲青年调查中，只有 39% 的受访者表示非洲人应该效仿“西方民主”； 53% 的人表示非洲需要找到自己的版本。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">事实上，人们对非洲年轻人的期望往往过高。他们中的许多人在面对民主的表象时表现得冷漠。他们表示自己在上次选举中没有投票的可能性是 56 岁以上人群的两倍多。在今年尼日利亚的选举中，年轻选民帮助彼得·奥比取得了第三方候选人有史以来最好的成绩，但他仍然只获得第三名。在南非上次大选中，只有 30% 的 20 多岁的符合条件的人参加了投票——从种族隔离到冷漠只用了一代人的时间。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果民选领导人滥用权力，年轻人对军事统治的支持度最高。平均 56% 的 18 岁至 35 岁的人会考虑这样做，而 56 岁及以上的人中这一比例为 46%。政变后聚集支持的是年轻人，这使得非洲国家或西方扭转接管的潜在努力变得更加复杂。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这并不是说外界对非洲民主的承诺特别强烈——这是非洲民主软弱的第三个原因。非洲联盟这个大陆组织很弱，最终是其大多数独裁成员的产物。南非等地区霸主的影响力较小：经济停滞意味着其硬实力较弱，而支持津巴布韦和其他地方的舞弊选举则意味着其软实力较弱。与此同时，随着中国共产党向非洲执政党宣扬其模式，中国将援助转向腐败的专制政权。俄罗斯无论是通过臭名昭著的瓦格纳集团还是通过军售，都在支持军政府和独裁者。土耳其和海湾国家等新参与者不会提倡民主规范。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">西方提供的帮助是半心半意和虚伪的。当选举看起来很粗略时，它有时会说出来，就像今年津巴布韦和塞拉利昂的情况一样。但2018年，美国决定粉饰矿产资源丰富的刚果的不可靠结果。英国不太可能批评卡加梅先生，因为它希望将寻求庇护者空运到卢旺达。法国强烈反对尼日尔等可能失去影响力的国家发生政变，但当政变主义者与巴黎保持一致时，法国却很少表态，就像 2021 年乍得政变的情况一样。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “法兰西”——这个词指的是法国如何通过支持专制精英来维持在前殖民地的影响力——正在卷土重来，攻击巴黎。在马里，2021 年的一项调查发现，超过五分之一的马里人认为法国驻该国武装部队与圣战分子或分裂分子勾结。在布基纳法索，35 岁的新总统易卜拉欣·特拉奥雷上尉表示，他正在恢复主权。与马里军政府一样，他的军政府可以自由选择向俄罗斯寻求帮助。尼日尔政变后，军政府迅速将法国作为替罪羊，该国派有军队在该国与圣战分子作战。人群挥舞着俄罗斯国旗，并斩下了一只涂有法国颜色的公鸡。在塞内加尔，反对萨尔先生第三次连任的抗议者烧毁了法国人拥有的超市和加油站。根据民意调查机构 Premise Data 的数据，一半的科特迪瓦人表示，法国是他们最不信任的国家。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">不满的冬天</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">只要非洲人将“民主”视为腐败精英在外国人的帮助下玩的把戏，那么许多人就会考虑其他选择。这些看起来会根据上下文而有所不同。在南非，种族隔离以来进展微薄，令人沮丧，这为极左黑人民族主义者朱利叶斯·马莱马和种族政党打开了空间。在尼日利亚，分离主义者纳姆迪·卡努 (Nnamdi Kanu) 依靠个人魅力、民粹主义、无视真相和暴力来复兴比夫拉独立的梦想。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在其他地方，民粹主义军人可能很有吸引力，至少暂时如此。在布基纳法索，特拉奥雷上尉故意选择模仿托马斯·桑卡拉，一位受人尊敬的前社会主义领导人，通常被称为非洲的切·格瓦拉。 1983 年，33 岁的他在一场政变中上台，四年后被枪杀。法国一直是两人的屁股。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">人们善意地希望将非洲人，尤其是年轻人，视为潜在的进步力量。但考虑到目前非洲大陆看似民主的情况，否认许多非洲人会受到威权主义的诱惑，这也是一种居高临下的态度。他们对民粹主义的免疫力并不比美国人对唐纳德·特朗普的免疫力，或者土耳其人对雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安的免疫力高。他们会被那些似乎满足他们需求的人所吸引，或者至少为那些明显不能满足他们需求的人提供改变。 <span

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">锡克教分裂主义活动家哈迪普·辛格·尼贾尔 (Hardeep Singh Nijjar) 于 6 月在加拿大被<small>枪杀，这一事件</small><span>引发</span>了加拿大和印度之间的<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/20/if-india-ordered-a-murder-in-canada-there-must-be-consequences">爆炸性争吵</a>。它还凸显了新世界混乱的一个煽动性方面：暗杀。对持不同政见者和恐怖分子以及政治或军事人物的杀害与政治本身一样古老，但其发生率可能正在上升。乌克兰以占领者和合作者为目标；俄罗斯曾试图刺杀乌克兰总统。 9月25日，乌克兰声称杀死了俄罗斯黑海舰队的指挥官，但一天后他似乎出现在视频中。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">除了欧洲战争之外，包括印度和沙特阿拉伯在内的一批新崛起大国正在向海外投射力量。他们对西方在国家支持的杀戮问题上的双重标准感到不满。新技术使政府比以往任何时候都更容易精确打击敌人，甚至可以远距离打击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，即使暗杀变得越来越容易，甚至可能更加频繁，世界仍然没有弄清楚如何应对它们。你只需看看西方对此类杀戮的反应即可。 2006年，俄罗斯在英国刺杀前<small>克格勃</small>特工亚历山大·利特维年科，引起强烈抗议并导致制裁。 2018 年，居住在美国的流亡沙特记者贾迈勒·卡舒吉 (Jamal Khashoggi) 在伊斯坦布尔发生<a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/02/26/the-cia-blames-mbs-for-the-murder-of-jamal-khashoggi">可怕的谋杀案</a>后，乔·拜登表示，沙特阿拉伯应该被视为贱民。然而去年，他与沙特王储、事实上的统治者穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼(Muhammad bin Salman)<a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/07/05/what-mbs-wants-from-joe-biden">重拳相撞</a>，并<a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/09/24/an-israeli-saudi-pact-could-upend-the-middle-east">试图劝说他</a>与以色列讲和。与此同时，印度否认与尼贾尔的死亡有关，并可能避免与之相关的任何严重后果。这个世界上人口最多的国家对西方很重要，既可以作为经济伙伴，也可以作为对中国的地缘政治制衡。这些不一致反映了国家支持的杀戮长期以来存在的道德和法律混乱。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">圣经可能会赞扬以色列人埃胡德杀死了暴虐且“非常肥胖”的摩押国王埃格隆。然而，它也要求人们服从权威，“因为统治者不惧怕善行，却惧怕恶行。”暗杀是指在没有法律程序的情况下出于政治动机杀害知名人士，具有背信弃义的含义。但丁将杀害尤利乌斯·凯撒的凶手与犹大一起放入地狱的最深处，他们的尸体被撒旦啃食。然而，各国出于不同的原因并采用不同的方法杀死国外的主要敌人。华纳·席林 (Warner Schilling) 和乔纳森·席林 (Jonathan Schilling) 在 2016 年发表的一篇论文列出了 14 个可能的目标，从复仇到削弱敌人或摧毁敌对国家。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">鉴于识别杀戮和凶手的问题，很难获得有关暗杀模式及其原因的可靠数据。根据本杰明·琼斯和本杰明·奥尔肯 2009 年在<i>《美国经济杂志》</i>上发表的一篇论文，1875 年至 2004 年间，报告了大约 298 起针对国家领导人的暗杀企图。他们发现，自 1950 年以来，近两起国家领导人遭到暗杀。每三年一次。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">通过其他方式进行战争</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对于英国诺丁汉大学的罗里·科马克（Rory Cormac）来说，加拿大的枪击事件证明了反对暗杀的国际规范正在减弱：“随着每一次高调的杀戮，禁忌都会被削弱一点，”他说。他提出了两大原因：独裁政权“变得更加厚颜无耻”地挑战自由主义规范；民主国家采取的定点清除“让其他国家更加大胆”。其他因素，例如旅行的便利性和可以进行远程监视和袭击的无人机，可能会使问题变得更加严重。多年来，美国用无人机杀死了数千名疑似圣战分子，还有许多平民。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “暗杀从未改变过世界历史，”英国政治家本杰明·迪斯雷利在亚伯拉罕·林肯被杀后说道。然而，有些谋杀案可能会产生巨大的影响。 1914 年 6 月，塞尔维亚民族主义者发射的一颗子弹杀死了奥地利大公弗朗茨·斐迪南，引发了第一次世界大战。暗杀可能会遭到报复：美国前国务卿迈克·蓬佩奥和国家安全顾问约翰·博尔顿据称都是伊朗暗杀阴谋的目标。英国国内情报机构<small>军情五处</small>表示，伊朗“野心是绑架甚至杀害被视为该政权敌人的英国人或居住<small>在英国</small>的个人”。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">斗篷和匕首</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">说到手段，俄罗斯喜欢毒药。其特工使用放射性钋谋杀了利特维年科。 2018 年，他们差点用神经毒剂诺维乔克杀死了英国另一位前间谍谢尔盖·斯克里帕尔 (Sergei Skripal) 和他的女儿尤利娅 (Yulia)。朝鲜也喜欢毒药。 2017 年，该国领导人金正恩同父异母的兄弟金正男在吉隆坡国际机场使用了另一种神经毒剂<small>VX</small> ，导致金正男死亡。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国更喜欢炸弹和子弹。 2011 年，美国特种部队突袭了巴基斯坦的一处安全屋，击毙了基地组织领导人奥萨马·本·拉登。2022 年，美国无人机袭击在喀布尔打死了他的继任者艾曼·扎瓦希里。另一架无人机击毙了基地组织领导人卡西姆·苏莱马尼。 2020 年，伊朗的对外行动机构圣城旅在巴格达机场。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管事实上，1961 年约翰·肯尼迪总统（他本人后来被暗杀）告诉一名助手，他不赞成这种做法：“我们不能卷入这种事情，否则我们都会成为目标”。然而，早在冷战初期，美国就肯定热衷于这类事情。其暗杀古巴菲德尔·卡斯特罗（未成功）和多米尼加共和国拉斐尔·特鲁希略（成功）等领导人的秘密行动的曝光引起了强烈反对。 1976 年，杰拉尔德·福特总统发布了一项行政命令，规定美国政府任何成员“不得参与或密谋参与暗杀”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">国外的杀戮仍在继续。威尔士斯旺西大学的卢卡·特伦塔表示，如今，独裁政权利用秘密行动来给予他们看似合理的——或者往往是难以置信的——否认。但美国等民主国家却试图给“定点清除”（尤其是针对恐怖分子嫌疑人）披上看似合法的面纱。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 《<small>联合国宪章</small>》责成所有成员国“在国际关系中不得以武力相威胁或使用武力侵犯任何国家的领土完整或政治独立”。但与此同时，它承认“如果发生武装袭击，个人或集体自卫的固有权利”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">国际人权律师持限制性观点。在和平时期，暗杀和定点清除是非法的。在战时，如果符合战争法，它们可能是被允许的。 1943 年，盟军在所罗门群岛上空击落了一架载有日本海军上将山本五十六的飞机时，乌克兰就瞄准了俄罗斯高级指挥官。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">那么似乎介于普通治安和战争之间的国际恐怖主义又如何呢？美国圣母大学的玛丽·艾伦·奥康奈尔认为“不存在灰色地带”。她说，根据国际法，各国必须通过执法手段应对恐怖主义，包括国际合作和引渡；致命行动相当于“法外处决”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管如此，美国尤其寻求更大的法律行动自由。其中一条途径就是确定主权的资格。它认为，如果一个国家“不愿意或无法”阻止恐怖主义行为，则可以采取军事行动。它还有时将海外领土指定为“活跃敌对行动地区”，武装部队可以在那里更自由地行动。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure

edweubf1">图片：胡安·伯纳乌</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">另一条途径是扩大自卫权。第一步是宣布它包括对非国家行为者和国家的攻击做出反应。接下来是主张“预期自卫”的权利，允许一个国家使用武力来阻止“迫在眉睫”的攻击威胁。最广泛接受的定义是，威胁应该是“即时的、压倒性的、没有手段可供选择、也没有审议的时间”。但这也被拉长了。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 2001年，乔治·W·布什总统走得更远，甚至在威胁“完全形成”之前就开始采用先发制人和预防的思想来证明使用武力的合理性。巴拉克·奥巴马政府还重新定义了“迫在眉睫”的含义。他的总检察长埃里克·霍尔德表示，不仅要考虑威胁的接近程度，还要考虑“采取行动的机会之窗”。这种想法大部分借鉴自以色列，以色列最高法院在 2006 年裁定，就恐怖分子而言，“敌对行动之间的休息只不过是为下一次敌对行动做准备”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">特伦塔博士表示，美国的榜样鼓励了英国、澳大利亚和法国也放松了类似的规定。但对奥康奈尔教授来说，这一切都等于西方授予自己不适用于其他国家的权利，“违反国际法的基于规则的秩序”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">印度完全可以像亲政府报纸那样辩称，尼贾尔被杀符合西方的反恐理念。锡克教分离主义曾导致过流血事件，尤其是 1984 年总理英迪拉·甘地 (Indira Gandhi) 被暗杀，以及次年印度航空 (Air India) 一架从蒙特利尔飞往伦敦的飞机被爆炸事件。尽管锡克教暴力事件已经大大减弱，但它可能会再次爆发。印度声称尼贾尔是一名恐怖分子，并悬赏抓捕他；他的支持者称他是一名和平活动家。在印度看来，西方拒绝镇压锡克教分裂分子构成了威胁。不过，政府更愿意说这与尼贾尔先生的死无关。至于执法方面，印度越削弱民主自由，合作就越困难。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">杀手本能</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">开发用于秘密行动的长臂并不容易。它需要资源和专业知识来跟踪目标、组织打击并避免被捕。印度的间谍可能认为他们正在效仿美国和以色列的间谍，成为必然严厉的民主捍卫者。有些人甚至谈论印度外国情报部门研究与分析部门（ <small>RAW</small> ）的“以色列化”。但如果人们认为它从减轻明显的安全威胁转向打击政治敌人，那么<small>RAW</small>将成为国内镇压的阴暗外表，就像俄罗斯或沙特阿拉伯的间谍一样。暗杀可以让世界警惕下令暗杀的政权的残暴行为。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 9 月 13 日，朝鲜<small>胖乎乎</small>的领导人<span>金正恩</span>(Kim Jong Un) <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/13/the-dangers-posed-by-a-deal-between-russia-and-north-korea">与弗拉基米尔·普京 (Vladimir Putin)</a>握手，当时他正乘坐火车前往俄罗斯远东的一个太空港，讨论向其独裁者出售一批朝鲜武器。自己的条款以及关于出售武器业务的说法。世界五个最大的军火销售国（美国、俄罗斯、法国、中国和德国）占出口额的四分之三以上。但崭露头角的武器生产商正在与守旧派展开竞争。他们正在充分利用地缘政治变化所创造的机会。他们还从俄罗斯入侵乌克兰中受益。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">金正恩访问俄罗斯之前，俄罗斯国防部长谢尔盖·绍伊古 (Sergei Shoigu) 于 7 月访问了平壤，绍伊古希望了解朝鲜能否提供装备来帮助该国摇摇欲坠的战争努力。朝鲜很乐意为其装备寻找买家。很少有政权愿意向俄罗斯出售武器。 <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/03/02/chinese-arms-could-revive-russias-failing-war">到目前为止，</a>中国只提供了两用芯片（尽管它还可以通过朝鲜输送更多致命的东西）。只有伊朗履行了义务，出售了约 2,400 架<a

e190yofl0">朝鲜可以提供更广泛的东西。除了无人机和<small>KN</small> -23（几乎是俄罗斯伊斯坎德尔弹道导弹的复制品）等导弹外，它还可以提供自行榴弹炮和多管火箭系统。据美国情报部门消息称，朝鲜在一年中的大部分时间里一直在向俄罗斯运送152毫米炮弹和喀秋莎型火箭弹。俄罗斯之所以在平壤和德黑兰进行采购，是因为这两个政权已经成为国际制裁的重点目标，与普京政府做生意对他们来说没有什么可失去的，而且会获得很多好处。与其说它们是“邪恶轴心”，不如说它们是贱民的市场。

The deal includes 1,000 <small>K</small> 2 Black Panther tanks, 180 of them delivered rapidly from the army&#39;s own inventory and 820 to be made under licence in Poland. That is more tanks than are operating in the armies of Britain, France, Germany and Italy combined. It also includes 672 <small>K</small> 9 Thunder self-propelled howitzers; 288 <small>K</small> 239 Chunmoo multiple-rocket launchers; and 48 Golden Eagle <small>FA</small> -50s, a cut-price fourth-generation fighter jet.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/02/12/south-korea-wants-to-become-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-arms-exporters">South Korea&#39;s success</a> in the arms business is down to competitive costs, high-quality weaponry and swift delivery, says Tom Waldwyn at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank based in London. Its prices reflect South Korea&#39;s efficient manufacturing. The quality derives from South Korea&#39;s experience working with the best American weaponry, and from its own high-tech civil sector. Speedy delivery is possible because the South Koreans, facing a major threat across their northern border, run hot production lines that can also ramp up quickly.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Siemon Wezeman, a researcher with <small>SIPRI</small> ’s arms-transfer programme, says wholehearted support from government and attractive credit arrangements are also critical to South Korea&#39;s success. Asian customers like the fact that it has close ties to America without being America, which is often seen as an unreliable ally. This could also help South Korea clinch a $45bn deal to renew Canada&#39;s submarine fleet. Questions for the future include how far South Korea will go in transferring technology to its customers—a crucial issue for Poland, which sees itself as an exporting partner of South Korea&#39;s, competing with Germany and France in the European market.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> If South Korea is the undisputed leader among emerging arms exporters, second place goes to Turkey. Since the ruling <small>AK</small> party came to power in 2002 it has poured money into its defence industry. A goal of achieving near-autarky in weapons production has become more pressing in the face of American and European sanctions—the former imposed in 2019 after Turkey, a <small>NATO</small> member, bought Russian <small>S</small> -400 surface-to-air missiles.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Rocket-fuelled</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>SIPRI</small> thinks that between 2018 and 2022 Turkey&#39;s weapons exports increased by 69% compared with the previous five-year period, and that its share of the global arms market doubled. According to a report in July by a local industry body, the value of its defence and aerospace exports rose by 38% in 2022, compared with the previous year, reaching $4.4bn. The target for this year is $6bn. Pakistan is receiving modernised submarines from Turkey. And the last of four corvettes which Turkey has sold to the Pakistan navy was launched last month. More sales to other countries are likely, both because Turkey&#39;s ships are competitively priced and because Turkey has few qualms about who it will sell to.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet Turkey&#39;s export charge is led by armed drones. On July 18th Turkey signed a $3bn agreement with Saudi Arabia to supply the Akinci unmanned combat aerial vehicle ( <small>UCAV</small> ). It was made by Baykar, which also produces the Bayraktar <small>TB</small> 2—a drone that has been used in combat by Azerbaijan, Ethiopia, Libya and Ukraine. The <small>TB</small> 2 was developed to hunt Kurdish militants after America refused to sell Turkey its Predator drone. More than 20 countries lined up to buy it because it was cheaper and more readily available than the American alternative, and more reliable than the Chinese <small>UCAV</small> s that had previously dominated the non-Western market.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Akinci (pictured right, next to the <small>TB</small> 2) is more powerful. It can carry lots of big weapons, including air-to-air missiles and the <small>SOM</small> - <small>A</small> , a stealthy cruise missile with a range of 250km. It will find buyers among several other Gulf countries, such as Oman, Qatar and the <small>UAE,</small> which are keen to hedge against souring relations with America by reducing their reliance on its weaponry. These countries also have ambitions to build their own defence industries; they see Turkey as a willing partner and as an example to follow.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Turkey&#39;s ambitions are shown by what else is in the pipeline. Its new navy flagship, the <i>Anadolu,</i> is a 25,000-tonne amphibious assault ship and light aircraft-carrier that will carry Bayraktar <small>UCAV</small> s. At least one Gulf country is said to be in talks to buy a similar ship. Turkey&#39;s fifth-generation fighter jet, the <small>KAAN</small> , in which Pakistan and Azerbaijan are partners, should fly before the end of the year. Developed with help from Britain&#39;s <small>BAE</small> Systems and Rolls-Royce, the <small>KAAN</small> could be seen as a response to Turkey&#39;s ejection from the <small>F</small> -35 partner programme (as punishment for buying the <small>S</small> -400). Turkey will market the plane to anyone America will not sell <small>F</small> -35s to—or who balks at the conditions. Once again, Gulf countries may be first in line.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> South Korea and Turkey have benefited from the woes of their main competitors. <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/23/russian-arms-have-fewer-takers-in-south-east-asia">Russia&#39;s arms exports</a> between 2018 and 2022 were 31% lower than in the preceding five-year period, according to <small>SIPRI</small> . It is facing further large declines because of the strain its war of aggression is putting on its defence industries, its geopolitical isolation and the efforts of two major customers, India and China, to reduce their reliance on Russian weaponry.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> India, previously Russia&#39;s biggest customer, cut its purchases of Russian arms by 37% in the 2018-22 period. It is probably wishing it had gone further: Russia&#39;s largely state-controlled arms industry is having to put its own army&#39;s needs ahead of commitments to customers. Many of India&#39;s 272 Su-30 <small>MKI</small> s, the backbone of its air force, are kaput because Russia cannot supply parts. Some of Russia&#39;s weapons have performed poorly in Ukraine compared with <small>NATO</small> kit. And sanctions on Russia are limiting trade in things such as microchips, ball-bearings, machine tools and optical systems, which will hinder Russia&#39;s ability to sell combat aircraft, attack helicopters and other lethal contraptions. The longer the war in Ukraine lasts, the more Russia will struggle to claw back its position in the global arms market.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Damp squibs</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As for China, over half its arms exports in the 2018-22 period went to just one country, Pakistan, which it sees as an ally against India. Nearly 80% of Pakistan&#39;s major weapons needs are met by China, according to <small>SIPRI</small> . These include combat aircraft, missiles, frigates and submarines. Beijing has no interest in its customers&#39; human-rights records, how they plan to use what China sends or whether they are under Western sanctions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But China&#39;s arms industry also has its problems. One challenge, says Mr Waldwyn, is that although China set out to dominate the military drone market a decade ago, its customers got fed up with poor quality and even worse support, opening a door for Turkey. A second is that, with the exception of a putative submarine deal with Thailand and a package of weapons for Myanmar, countries in South-East Asia are tired of Chinese bullying and “won&#39;t touch them”, says Mr Wezeman.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At least China does not have to worry about competition from India. Despite much effort, India&#39;s growth as an arms exporter has been glacial. The government of Narendra Modi has listed a huge range of weapons parts that must be made in India; it hopes home-made light tanks and artillery will enter service by the end of the decade. But India has relied for too long on the transfer of technology from Russia under production-licensing agreements for aircraft, tanks and warships that have failed to deliver. Investment is wastefully channelled through state-owned bodies. Red tape suffocates initiative.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Projects such as the Tejas light combat aircraft have taken decades to reach production and remain fraught with problems. The Dhruv light helicopter, launched in 2002, has crashed dozens of times. After decades in development, the Arjun Mk-2 tank turned out to be too heavy for deployment across the border with Pakistan. Locally made kit is often rejected by India&#39;s own armed forces. “If they don&#39;t want it, exporting it becomes impossible,” says Mr Wezeman. South Korea and Turkey show how countries can build lucrative arms businesses that underpin domestic security. India, for all its bombast, is a lesson in how not to do it. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 17:09:42 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/p7bnujg5n1gugqcfrgf2jqusnaa2m2e8</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/09/19/meet-the-worlds-new-arms-dealers </item><item><title><![CDATA[Are Ukraine’s tactics working?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/055%20International%20-%20The%20counter-offensive-36ada54a6f318491c493c12b58f53b41.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><i>阅读我们最近对<a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">乌克兰战争</a>的更多报道</i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>D</span> <small>MYTRO KULEBA</small> , Ukraine&#39;s foreign minister, is a smooth and affable diplomat, unruffled by the trickiest questions. But on August 31st his patience snapped. “Criticising the slow pace of the counter-offensive equals…spitting into the face of the Ukrainian soldier who sacrifices his life every day,” he told journalists. “I would recommend all critics to shut up, come to Ukraine and try to liberate one square centimetre by themselves.” That outburst was prompted by weeks of stories in the American press, in which anonymous officials took issue with Ukraine&#39;s <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/08/16/ukraines-counter-offensive-is-making-progress-slowly">slow progress</a> on the battlefield and questioned its military tactics. The row is unseemly. But is Ukraine&#39;s approach working?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Allied debates over strategy are hardly unusual. American and British officials worked closely with Ukraine in the months before it launched its counter-offensive in June. They gave intelligence and advice, conducted detailed war games to simulate how different attacks might play out, and helped design and train the brigades that received the lion&#39;s share of Western equipment. Even so, Ukraine—stung by a big leak of American intelligence documents unearthed in April—kept its own counsel. It delayed the start of the offensive and held plans close to its chest.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One big point of contention was Ukraine&#39;s earlier decision, over the first half of the year, to keep fighting for <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/06/01/bakhmut-and-the-spirit-of-verdun">Bakhmut</a> , a town in the eastern Donbas region that has limited strategic significance but became a symbol of resistance. Ukraine&#39;s decision to defend the town at all costs had a “big influence” on the subsequent counter-offensive, argues Konrad Muzyka of Rochan Consulting, a firm that tracks the war. Ukraine burned through its stockpile of shells while Russia gained time to build up its formidable defences in the south—the so-called Surovikin line, named after a now-fired Russian general.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Quarrels persisted even after the counter-offensive began. American officials had encouraged Ukraine to concentrate its forces on the main axis of attack in the south, towards the Sea of Azov. Instead Ukraine split its forces with the aim of stretching the Russians over a longer front. The most experienced brigades, armed mostly with older gear, were kept in Bakhmut, where they are making modest progress on the town&#39;s flanks. One source says that politics is playing an unhelpful role in military strategy, with well-connected brigades around Bakhmut getting a larger share of scarce ammunition than military considerations alone might warrant.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Meanwhile Ukraine deployed less experienced brigades on the more important southern axis, armed with newer kit. They quickly became bogged down in dense minefields covered by Russian artillery, drones and helicopters. Untested commanders made a series of mistakes, such as running into friendly mines and mistiming attacks. “If more experienced Ukrainian brigades were given the new equipment, they may not have committed many of the errors the new brigades made,” write Michael Kofman and Rob Lee, both experts on Russia&#39;s armed forces, in an essay for War on the Rocks, an online journal.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some blame for early missteps lies with those who helped plan the counter-offensive. In a recent paper Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds at the Royal United Services Institute ( <small>RUSI</small> ), a think-tank in London, argue that the assault relied in part on outdated assumptions that did not take into account the threat from new sorts of sensors and drones. They conclude: “Much of the data supporting the tactics that Ukraine&#39;s international partners sought to train Ukrainian forces to adopt was based on operational analysis from the 20th century that did not contend with a range of technologies employed in Ukraine.” Russian fortifications were also <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/07/03/how-ukraines-enemy-is-also-learning-lessons-albeit-slowly">far more substantial</a> than Western planners assumed. </p><iframe type="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JtVE4Wp5Z1A?enablejsapi=1" class="css-xm8n1m e195f1ec0"></iframe><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Wherever the fault lies, it is clear that something went wrong. “It seems that Kyiv had no contingency plans that could be quickly implemented in case the attack stalled,” notes Mr Muzyka. Eventually Ukrainian commanders decided to hold back their heavy armour and switch to a simpler approach. <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/09/sappers-risk-their-lives-to-win-ukraine-back-inch-by-inch">Groups of sappers</a> , often crawling on their bellies, now clear minefields by hand. Platoons and companies, rather than brigades, fight tree line to tree line, advancing on foot so as to present a smaller target. This has helped limit losses of men and equipment, but allows only 700 to 1,200 metres of progress every five days, notes the <small>RUSI</small> paper, giving Russian troops time to “reset” their defences (the rate may have picked up a little of late).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That leads to two debates. One is whether Ukrainian commanders have been too risk-averse. Some Western officials argue that if Ukraine had stuck with bolder and larger-scale attacks, as planned, they would have taken higher casualties at first but had more luck breaking through Russian lines, shortening the offensive and reducing the overall toll. Ukrainian officials retort that this would only have led to more bloodshed, and that officers could not expect a heavily depleted citizen army to mimic Russian human-wave attacks.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A second debate is whether Ukraine should emulate a Western way of war or carve out its own path. Western armed forces prize the idea of combined-arms manoeuvre, in which armoured forces synchronise their movement with infantry, artillery, air defence and (increasingly) electronic and cyber-attacks. The five weeks of pre-offensive training given to Ukrainian troops in Germany was not nearly enough to make them proficient in this sort of warfare.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “The Ukrainians are still tied to Soviet doctrine,” complains an American official. Heavy artillery barrages, in place of more judicious and precise attacks, are one source of tension, not least because America is playing the lead role in sourcing ammunition for Ukrainian guns. “It&#39;s going to take time for their mindset…and tactics to change,” says the official.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In fact the Ukrainian approach is fit for purpose, says BA Friedman, a retired artillery officer in the <small>US</small> Marine Corps and author of a book on military tactics. In the spring of 1918, after years of stalemate on the western front of the first world war, the German army realised that large units were too vulnerable to artillery fire. Their solution was smaller, nimbler and well-drilled “storm troopers” who could cross enemy lines and grab territory, with heavier units moving up later. “Since Ukraine doesn&#39;t have the ability to use <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/08/22/how-soon-will-ukraine-be-able-to-use-its-f-16s">air power</a> on any kind of relevant scale, it makes total sense to solve the problem the way it was solved before air power matured,” says Mr Friedman. Many European officers acknowledge that their own better trained and equipped armies would struggle to break the Surovikin line.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Fighting about fighting</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> American officials are not well placed to offer lessons on tactical best practice, says Mr Friedman. The bulk of their recent experience of combat has been in mountainous or desert areas where small units cannot take advantage of cover to advance in this way. The two main training centres for America&#39;s ground forces, the army&#39;s site at Fort Irwin and the marines&#39; location at Twentynine Palms, are both in Californian desert environments, he points out. “ <small>US</small> forces have very little experience facing anything like what Ukraine is facing, whether in combat or in training.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The problem is: nor does Ukraine. Mr Watling and Mr Reynolds argue that attrition of officers and the dramatic expansion of Ukraine&#39;s army over the past 18 months mean that it lacks sufficient junior leaders with expertise in offensive operations. The result, they say, is that decisions are thrown up to more senior officers, overwhelming brigade headquarters that already have a lot on their plate. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230916_IRM927.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">They give the example of a Ukrainian attack on the village of Rivnopil in Donetsk province earlier in the summer. Attackers are supposed to release smoke to cover their movement and confuse the enemy. But only 3% of Ukraine&#39;s artillery-fire missions involved smoke—in part because senior commanders did not want to obscure their own view of the battle from drones circling overhead. The lesson is that Ukraine needs more junior officers who can be trusted to take the initiative even when their bosses cannot watch from afar.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The quality of training is important, too. Western training facilities are hobbled by a “safety culture in <small>NATO</small> ”, argue Mr Watling and Mr Reynolds. Drones are central to Ukraine&#39;s tactics, allowing artillery units to spot targets and infantry to perform reconnaissance. Yet most <small>NATO</small> training areas impose tight restrictions on when and how drones may be flown, for fear they will veer off course. Safety rules also mean that artillery skills are typically taught later in courses. But in Ukraine “troops who are not prepared to deal with artillery are not prepared for the fight,” write the <small>RUSI</small> analysts. Europe&#39;s health and safety rules are not a good fit for a war of national survival.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Most of these issues will not be resolved during the current counter-offensive. Ukraine will eventually need to reintroduce mechanised and armoured forces if it is to exploit any breakthroughs. That could get easier: minefields are less dense beyond the first line of defence. It is thought to have enough ammunition to fight through the autumn. But on September 10th Mark Milley, America&#39;s top general, said that Ukraine probably had 30 to 45 days of combat left before <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/10/the-particular-problems-of-fighting-in-the-ukrainian-autumn">rain and mud</a> would make it too difficult for vehicles to advance.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In recent weeks Ukraine has made faster progress in the south by piercing the <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/06/how-the-pentagon-assesses-ukraines-progress">first of Russia&#39;s three defensive lines</a> in Zaporizhia around the village of Robotyne, widening the resulting salient by pressing east to Verbove and then attacking towards the village of Novoprokopivka (see map). On September 13th it struck with missiles a shipyard in Crimea used by Russia&#39;s Black Sea fleet, setting vessels ablaze. Russia has had to commit reserves from its 76th air assault division; but it has been able to because Ukraine threw in its own in August.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is not clear how much fresh manpower either side has left. Rates of attrition appear to favour Ukraine over Russia, but sources suggest that Russia can probably still scrape together enough reserves to plug holes. “Unless there is a collapse of Russian lines, the battles we have seen for the past three months are the ones we will likely continue to see over the next few months,” concludes Mr Muzyka, who argues that only the deployment of larger formations, beyond Ukraine&#39;s capacity, would speed things up. Dozens of Western officials consulted by <i>The Economist</i> are also sceptical that a major breakthrough will come before winter. “We&#39;ve got to extend our timeline,” says one of them. “This could be a very long struggle.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 12 Sep 2023 17:29:33 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/hds9rt1nj2on31lqke4u2ne9h76ulktt</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/09/12/are-ukraines-tactics-working </item><item><title><![CDATA[The growing global movement to restrain house prices]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/053%20International%20-%20The%20new%20zing%20in%20zoning-eb687d80e8cd526b9da7fdd37bfc6fbf.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>F</span> <small>LANNERY ASSOCIATES</small> did not even have a website until the end of August. But a lawsuit involving the firm, first filed in a federal court in May, has uncovered the huge extent of its land holdings in Solano County, which lies around 60 miles (97km) north-east of San Francisco in California. The suit revealed that Flannery had committed to buying 140 properties for a total of more than $800m and was paying well over the market odds: as much as $15,000 per acre, for land valued to tax authorities for as little as a tenth of that. The entire scheme spans 50,000 acres, an area far larger than that of San Francisco proper.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Who would be willing to pay so much for seemingly so little? On August 25th the <i>New York Times</i> revealed that the formerly anonymous owners of Flannery Associates include almost a dozen Silicon Valley titans. Among them are Michael Moritz, former head of Sequoia Capital, a huge venture-capital firm, and Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, a networking app. Though none of the land is currently zoned for housing, the plan, apparently, is to build a town from scratch. Its new website is branded “California Forever”, with architectural drawings of families eating in sunny Mediterranean-style plazas. This constitutes “a vision”, says Brian Brokaw of Flannery Associates.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nowhere in the world is the failure to build enough housing clearer than in the San Francisco Bay Area. The overriding reason why boils down to Nimbyism, or “Not in My Backyard”, the tendency of locals to resist new development. A growing movement is trying to fix that. The secretive plans for a new city in Solano County are just one of the more outlandish strands of Yimbyism—a growing movement that says yes, not no, to development.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>Yimby</small> s argue that housing shortages are caused largely by laws that control who can build what and where. Zoning and planning laws, they say, are so strict that building new housing is in many places completely illegal, and in almost all it is slow, difficult and expensive. In the past decade or so, Yimbyism has spread from a minority pursuit of economists and a few dedicated activists into a plausible political movement of its own, with thousands of members and chapters spreading across countries including America, Australia, Britain and New Zealand.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Not everyone agrees on everything. <small>Yimby</small> s range from libertarian-leaning tech types through to self-described socialists, such as John Bauters. He is the bicycle-riding mayor of the tiny Californian city of Emeryville, who allows development because it gives him more rich people to tax. Yet all share one belief: more housing needs to be built, especially in the biggest and costliest cities.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> House of straw</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In recent decades house prices have outstripped income growth across the developed world. The reasons for this are numerous. Interest rates affect how much buyers can afford, as does income growth. Population changes, culture and demography all have an impact on demand, as do bank regulation, lending practices and the like. But underlying it all is basic economic logic: where demand outpaces the supply of new homes, prices tend to rise. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">According to data collated by Jim Gleeson, a researcher at the Greater London Authority, since the millennium the number of homes in English-speaking countries is lower relative to populations than elsewhere in the rich world, and growing more slowly, too. Between 2000 and 2020, the number of homes for every 100 people rose in Britain from 43 to 44. In America it went from 41 to 42, and in Australia from 40 to 41. In New Zealand population growth outpaced construction, and the number of homes per 100 residents fell slightly, to 38. In France by contrast, the figure was already 50 in 2000, and had risen to 55 by 2020; in Germany it went from 47 to 52, and in Japan from 42 to 49 (see chart 1).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What explains this? In most markets, higher prices stimulate supply. When demand for cars increases, carmakers open more factories. But all rich countries regulate construction, for good reason. Whereas a car can be manufactured and then transported almost anywhere, land is an inherently scarce resource, and for the most part housing is only valuable when it is near jobs, public services and infrastructure. Few people want to live right next door to a sewage plant; lots want to live near a large park. Planning is meant to take such things into account.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> House of sticks </h2><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Because jobs move, a stable ratio of housing to people across a country can mask a growing shortage in the hottest local economies. In places like California and London, wages are far higher than elsewhere in America and Britain, and have risen faster in the past decade. But for workers who do not own property, the gains are eaten up by higher rents (see chart 2). Findings published in January by the National Bureau of Economic Research show that for workers with degrees, although living in a big coastal American city comes with a substantial wage premium, a higher cost of living means that overall they are about as well off as if they lived in a poorer city. Lower-skilled workers are much worse off, which means they move out to make space.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> California&#39;s <small>Yimby</small> s point to a broken system. The state&#39;s population is shrinking even as California generates huge numbers of well-paying jobs. Consider that the median monthly rent of a one-bedroom apartment in the city of San Francisco is $3,007, or 63%, of what the median American adult working full time makes before taxes. And yet, so far this year, the Bay Area has issued permits to build only 4,500 new units of housing—scarcely more, relative to its population, than Detroit, the former powerhouse of the Midwest. The Austin area in Texas, with roughly half of the Bay Area&#39;s population, has issued some 20,000.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> California has tried to control development since at least the 1970s. Scott Wiener, a state senator who represents San Francisco, says that with housing in the state “the rules get made up as you go along”. The process “takes years and years and is so chaotic it ultimately mutilates or kills the project entirely”. Mr Wiener was among the first <small>Yimby</small> politicians and crafted a new state law, <small>SB35</small> , which passed not long after he took office in 2017.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>SB35</small> encourages more development by forcing reluctant city governments to comply with state-led targets. These have existed for decades in order to facilitate new housing. For San Francisco (the city, not the entire metro area), the legal target is 82,000 homes by 2031. The number of homes that have actually been built to date means that the target looks wildly out of reach. Other laws passed by Mr Wiener and his allies have extended rights to homeowners to build “accessory dwelling units”, or granny flats, and have restricted mandates that force developers to provide masses of free parking in new buildings.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At the higher levels of politics at least, Yimbyism is now practically mainstream in California. “Pro-housing policies are pro-job policies,” tweeted London Breed, San Francisco&#39;s mayor, in July. Gavin Newsom, the state&#39;s governor, promised to build 3.5m homes in a speech for his election campaign. Across the state such politicians are engaged in an increasingly pitched legislative battle with local politicians, such as city council members and the leaders of suburbs, who are generally determined not to build more.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yimbyism abounds elsewhere, too. In New York this year Kathy Hochul, the state governor, (unsuccessfully) proposed a radical “upzoning”, approving a greater density of housing in a particular area. She argued that it would allow the construction of 800,000 more homes over a decade, primarily by letting more apartments be built around railway stations in New York City&#39;s suburbs. In Canada Pierre Poilievre, who leads the opposition Conservative Party, wants the federal government to be able to force municipalities to allow more housing construction. Both major political parties in Britain say they want more houses built, no doubt mindful of an election expected next year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet constructing housing remains extremely tricky. The problem, says Brian Hanlon, a co-founder of California <small>Yimby,</small> a pro-housing pressure group, is that “we are all inheritors of this English town-planning system, which is disastrous”. In Britain the first extensive regulation of landowners&#39; rights to build on their property was introduced with the Town Planning Act in 1909 and then expanded dramatically in 1947 with the Town and Country Planning Act. In America “zoning” laws were passed in most urban areas in the 1920s and 1930s. “When Ireland got independence, we practically copied everything Great Britain did,” says Robert Tolan, a housing economist in Dublin. That included Ireland&#39;s own version of the planning act in 1963. New Zealand got its Town and Country Planning Act, named after the British one, in 1953.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In many English-speaking countries, inspired by Victorian worries about “slums”, planning laws tended to prioritise detached houses. For urban planners, such as Ebenezer Howard, density was seen as akin to crowding. In packed industrial hotspots, “downzoning” and slum clearance were used to flatten cities and spread them out by force. The writer George Orwell was sceptical of the proceedings: “If people are going to live in large towns at all they must learn to live on top of one another,” he declared. But he reckoned that many workers in Britain did not “take kindly to flats”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Today far fewer citizens of English-speaking countries live in flats than elsewhere. In England 80% of people now dwell in houses, and just 6% in flats in buildings taller than three storeys. In France 44% of people live in apartments, as opposed to houses. In cities including Dublin, Los Angeles and Sydney, sprawl is running out of road. At the densities allowed by law, almost all of the land within a reasonable commute of city centres has already been “built out”. Instead, new subdivisions are built in separate towns, perhaps 50 or 60 miles away from the core, with residents typically facing punishing commutes by car to work. (In Britain these workers typically leap over the “green belts” around cities within which construction is mostly illegal.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In San Francisco construction cost on average around $440 per square foot last summer (a figure far higher than elsewhere in America). But homes sold for roughly twice that. In southern England an acre of agricultural land might cost as much as £15,000 ($19,000). An acre with planning permission is worth at least 60 times that. What this means is that giving permission to developers to build creates vast amounts of value by the stroke of a pen. And yet it doesn&#39;t happen, largely because, through the planning system, local residents and political groups are generally able to block any development. Rules intended to regulate development, such as environmental reviews, design consultations, parking requirements and so on, in fact serve the purpose of stopping it.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> House of bricks</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nimbyism has plenty of origins. Most obviously, homeowners want to protect the value of their properties. Allowing the construction of individual detached houses only on large lots—a type of zoning—is an effective way to stop poor people from moving into wealthy neighbourhoods. In America there were racist motives behind the adoption of zoning and behind its tightening in the 1960s and 1970s.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nowadays, people are more likely to fear that new housing will worsen traffic, or that their views will be spoiled, or that new neighbours will be annoying, or that public services will not expand to meet extra demand. This all creates strong incentives for existing residents to organise against new development. By contrast, the people who would live in homes that are not yet built do not get a say.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even most <small>Yimby</small> s do not argue that developers ought to have an untrammelled right to build anything, anywhere. In the decades after the second world war entire neighbourhoods were demolished by overzealous planners in a host of countries. But the pendulum has since swung too far the other way. In 2021 in Bethnal Green in east London, 291 homes were blocked by the High Court in part to save a mulberry tree. In Washington, <small>DC</small> ,<small> </small>earlier this year a surface car park built in the 1960s was ruled to be an integral part of a historic bank, making any plans to build on it subject to tough additional scrutiny. In Dublin, Ireland, in January a development of nearly 1,600 homes was blocked by the High Court for a variety of reasons. But it was noted that the move protected a pair of “striking brick arches” from demolition. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="1383" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Ryan Gillett</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> David Broockman, a San Francisco <small>Yimby</small> who happens to be a political scientist at Berkeley, suggests that Nimbyism often wins despite the huge benefits of building. That is because a project&#39;s interested parties squabble over how to share the value created by allowing it. Some want it to be used to subsidise affordable housing; some want environmental protections; some want prettier buildings; some want tax. “Every group is asking for too much,” says Mr Broockman. The end result is that nothing gets done and everybody is worse off, he concludes.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Is Yimbyism able to help? Housing construction has risen in California in recent years: more homes were built in the state last year than in any since 2008. Some of this is thanks to modest <small>Yimby</small> reforms. In the Los Angeles area, there has been a boom in the construction of accessory dwelling units. Typically, these are built in the garden of an existing house. Statewide, around 60,000 have been permitted since 2017 and in 2022 they made up one in seven of all homes constructed; most of them have been put up in the Los Angeles area.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Overall construction is still far too low to make California truly affordable again, however. The big question is whether recent reforms can induce more. In May, Emeryville, home of the socialist bicycle-riding mayor, was designated by the state of California as one of just 22 cities out of 482 to be officially “pro-housing”, meaning it plans to substantially exceed its mandated targets for construction. The city, which is wedged in between Berkeley and Oakland, about half an hour from downtown San Francisco, proposes to allow the construction of 3,687 new homes over the next eight years. That is roughly one new unit for every two existing units. But many other places are fighting their legal requirements to plan for more housing.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What is clear is that allowing construction does reduce rents. Activists point to one place where it has already had a measurable and large effect. In 2016 New Zealand&#39;s parliament passed a sweeping upzoning of the city of Auckland. The result, says Ryan Greenaway-McGrevy, an economist at the University of Auckland who has analysed the data, was a big increase in building. The number of new homes that got permission to be built went up from 2,500 to 15,000 between 2010 and 2021. Of course, like many other countries, New Zealand was dealing with the effects of the global financial crisis back in 2010. But all over the city, smart blocks of flats that can fit many inhabitants have quickly replaced fading 1960s detached houses. Homeowners have seen the value of their land go up, as it can now be redeveloped. But the cost of renting a single home has fallen, unlike in the rest of New Zealand.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It will take a lot to undo decades of undersupply. In Britain a study published this year by the Centre for Cities, a think-tank, estimates that the country is short of 4.3m homes relative to the number built in other European countries. A study in 2015 of America put the annual cost of restricted development in America&#39;s biggest cities at more than 9% of <small>GDP</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But as the costs rise, so too do the potential benefits of building. Whether Silicon Valley&#39;s richest tech investors can take advantage of that remains to be seen. Already the existing residents of Solano County are preparing to push back against “California Forever”. More politicians should look at Mr Bauters in Emeryville and follow his example. For his part, Mr Bauters just wishes that everyone would spend much less time talking and far more time building. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Sep 2023 19:11:55 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/8ervd8t1hpi4r2877llb0l57qf0mkm3k</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/09/06/the-growing-global-movement-to-restrain-house-prices </item><item><title><![CDATA[A new nuclear arms race looms]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/053%20International%20-%20A%20new%20nuclear%20arms%20race-057531408493f81ba5d410acd741dfe6.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>F</span> <small>rom</small> <small>offices</small> in America&#39;s State Department and Russia&#39;s Ministry of Defence, officials take turns “pinging” each other every couple of hours just to check the line is working.

The danger of “a chain reaction that would destroy the entire world”—the words spoken by Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, at the end of Christopher Nolan&#39;s eponymous film—looms ever larger. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_IRC348.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_IRC348.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_IRC348.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_IRC348.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_IRC348.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_IRC348.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_IRC348.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_IRC348.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_IRC348.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_IRC348.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_IRC348.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_IRC348.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_IRC348.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_IRC348.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_IRC348.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_IRC348.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_IRC348.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That humanity averted annihilation owes much to the many agreements between America and the Soviet Union, now Russia, that limited nuclear weapons and built trust even as each retained the means to destroy the other. They brought down the global nuclear stockpile from 70,400 warheads in 1986 to 12,500 today (see chart).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That era is ending, for four main reasons: America&#39;s abandonment of agreements, Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine, China&#39;s nuclear build-up and disruptive technology. Begin with America. In 2002 President George W. Bush withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (which limited anti-missile defences), pointing to the dangers from North Korea and Iran. And in 2019 another Republican president, Donald Trump, pulled out of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/02/01/america-withdraws-from-the-intermediate-range-nuclear-forces-treaty">Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty</a> (which eliminated that category of missiles), citing cheating by Russia and China&#39;s rise.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Democratic presidents have been keener on arms control. <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/01/30/the-world-is-facing-an-upsurge-of-nuclear-proliferation">New <small>start</small></a> was negotiated by Barack Obama and then renewed for five years by Joe Biden in 2021. It limits each side&#39;s “strategic” nuclear weapons (long-distance arms with high destructive power) to 1,550 deployed warheads and 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles <small>(ICBM</small> s), bombers and submarine-launched ballistic missiles.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But New <small>start</small> does not control “non-strategic” or “tactical” weapons, usually smaller ones for battlefield use. Russia is thought to have 1,800 of them and America just 200. Nor does it capture Russia&#39;s work on things such as nuclear-propelled cruise missiles and torpedoes. In turn, Russia complains that the nuclear arsenals of Britain and France, American allies with more than 200 warheads each, are excluded. New <small>start</small> is set to expire in February 2026, and there is little prospect of a follow-on deal. In less than three years, the last major restraint on the world&#39;s nuclear stockpile may well be removed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For that blame Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine, and its <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2022/09/29/could-the-war-in-ukraine-go-nuclear">repeated threats</a> to use nuclear weapons. Western countries have armed Ukraine, but have not sent their own troops, in part for fear of “world war three”. In February Russia said it would “suspend” New <small>start</small> , halting notifications. America <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/03/30/perils-grow-as-america-and-russia-stop-sharing-data-on-nukes">responded in kind</a> in March and June. Each side has since become ever less certain about the other&#39;s posture, magnifying the risk of nuclear brinkmanship—especially at a time when the Kremlin is at war. Poland says Russia has started moving tactical weapons to Belarus.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Then there is China, which is already racing to build up its <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/china-seeks-to-join-the-nuclear-big-league/21806104">nuclear force</a> . Unconstrained by treaties, it has long observed a “minimal deterrence” policy with a few hundred warheads. But the Pentagon estimates its stockpile will grow to perhaps 1,500 by 2035. That is close to New <small>start&#39;</small> s deployed limit.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nuclear tensions could spread further and unpredictably. India, which has an unresolved border dispute with China, may feel compelled to increase its stockpile, currently estimated at more than 160 warheads. That in turn may prompt Pakistan, with a similar number, to build up. North Korea, with perhaps 30 warheads, is intensively testing <small>ICBM</small> s. And Iran has become a threshold nuclear state.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> New technologies could aggravate matters. Hypersonic missiles are harder to detect and shoot down than ballistic ones. Improvements in sensors and accuracy heighten worries about a disabling surprise attack. And the spread of artificial intelligence ( <small>aI</small> ) raises questions of how far nuclear war might be fought by computers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In response, America has been flashing its nuclear sabre, if not quite rattling it. Its ballistic-missile submarines, which usually lurk unseen for months-long patrols, have been surfacing around the world of late. In July the <i>USS Kentucky</i> moored in the South Korean port of Busan, and the <i>USS Tennessee</i> called at Faslane in Scotland. In May naval commanders from Japan and South Korea embarked the <i>USS Maine</i> off Guam. Last October the <i>USS West Virginia</i> popped up in the Arabian Sea, in an apparent signal to Iran, for a visit by the head of America&#39;s Central Command.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The “silent service” is no longer silent. “You can&#39;t have a credible deterrent without communicating your capabilities,” Rear Admiral Jeffrey Jablon, commander of America&#39;s submarine force in the Indo-Pacific, told <i>Breaking Defense</i> . “If the adversary doesn&#39;t know anything about that specific deterrent, it&#39;s not a deterrent.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America wants to reassure allies that its “extended deterrence”—the promise to defend them from nuclear attack even if they eschew nuclear weapons—remains strong. Some in Poland and South Korea want America to store <small>b</small> 61 nuclear gravity bombs in their countries. It has resisted. But showing “boomer” subs serves as warning to foes and reassurance to friends.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America is busy modernising all three legs of its nuclear “triad” with new ground, air and sea systems. An unspoken aim is to rev up the nuclear industrial base to be able to produce more weapons in future, should they be needed. Some want to go further. A paper in March by the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, a government-funded institute that among other things designs nuclear warheads, said America&#39;s current nuclear force is “only marginally sufficient”. America should expand it when New <small>start</small> expires by “expeditious uploading”, deploying weapons currently held in reserve, for instance as multiple warheads on <small>icbm</small> s; before then, it should demonstrate the ability to do so.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America has a greater “upload capacity” than Russia. The Federation of American Scientists, which campaigns to minimise global risks, calculates that from the current total of about 1,670 deployed strategic warheads each (it uses different counting rules from those for New <small>Start</small> ), America could within a couple of years deploy 3,570 compared with 2,629 for Russia. Some experts worry that big powers might also resume testing nuclear weapons, an idea discussed in the Trump years.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Talking of an “inflection point” in the nuclear balance, Jake Sullivan, Mr Biden&#39;s national security adviser, declared in June that America was ready to discuss arms control with Russia and China “without preconditions”. Neither is rushing to take up his offer. Given its heavy losses in Ukraine, Russia is either too aggrieved or too reliant on nuclear weapons to consider a new accord. China, for its part, seems uninterested in limits, possibly until it achieves parity with America.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Indeed, parity has been the basis of arms control between America and Russia. But it is harder to agree on when three powers are involved. America, in particular, worries that Russia and China might ally against it, given that they have declared a “friendship without limits” and conduct joint air and sea patrols. Mr Sullivan insists that America does not need “to outnumber the combined total of our competitors” to deter them. Yet the pressure for America to increase its numbers may prove irresistible, says James Acton of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, an American think-tank. As long as America&#39;s targeting policy rests on “counterforce”—aiming nuclear weapons at the other&#39;s nuclear sites to neutralise them—more weapons in the hands of rivals will mean that America will need more, too.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Destroyer of worlds</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Eric Edelman, the Pentagon&#39;s former under-secretary for policy under Mr Bush, puts it differently, recalling cold-war reckonings about the ability to absorb a first strike and still be able to inflict unacceptable damage on a foe: “If you&#39;ve got two adversaries with 1,500 weapons each and one launched a strike and you ride it out, then retaliate: what reserve do you have left to deal with the other adversary?” He adds: “We don&#39;t really know yet what the right number is, but it&#39;s probably north of 1,550.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Given the poor prospects for new treaties to limit nuclear weapons, America is exploring less formal arrangements with China to prevent crises turning into conflict. Mr Sullivan proposed, for instance, extending the system of hotlines and notifications with Russia to all five permanent members of the <small>un</small> Security Council. But the Chinese response has been dispiriting. He summarised it thus: “If you wear a seat belt in a car, you&#39;re going to be incentivised to drive faster and more crazy, and then you&#39;ll have a crash. So, in a way, better not to have the seat belt.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Controlling the use of artificial intelligence is even harder, given that it cannot be seen and counted as <small>ICBM</small> s can. Even if <small>ai</small> can help decision-making, America, Britain and France have pushed for a norm requiring that there should always be “a man in the loop” when it comes to the use of nuclear weapons.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America&#39;s <small>nrrc</small> remains fully staffed, with 40-odd people tending the lines, hoping for better times between Washington and Moscow. “Maintaining that line in times of good relations is important; it&#39;s much more important when tensions rise, because the potential impact of miscalculations grows as other channels are strained,” says an American official. A Russian-speaker is always on hand. In a wiser world, there would be a Chinese-speaker, too. On screen <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/07/14/realism-with-oppenheimer-or-escapism-with-barbie">Oppenheimer</a> is told that he has given people “the power to destroy themselves”. The question now is whether humanity still has the power to save itself in the face of new nuclear nightmares. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 29 Aug 2023 19:54:48 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/0t37ltqo54rqg3pqo0rrg5i5djuuh8th</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/08/29/a-new-nuclear-arms-race-looms </item><item><title><![CDATA[Reassessing Obama’s biggest mistake]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/054%20International%20-%20A%20red%20line%20over%20Syria-ceb29324071ee9f75670e6dc08a272c0.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>HE FORCES</small> of Syria&#39;s president, Bashar al-Assad, struck soon after 2am. Residents of Ghouta, a Damascus suburb, told reporters that they heard a strange noise, as if someone was opening a bottle of Pepsi. A local doctor, fighting back tears, explained that many people had sought shelter underground, but the gas was heavier than air and it pooled in basements and cellars. Had they climbed the stairs instead, they would have lived. More than 1,000 people perished that night. The doctor distributed some 25,000 ampoules of atropine and 7,000 of hydrocortisone to medical teams so they could try to save those who were suffering the effects of nerve agent.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Assad fired <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2013/08/24/if-this-isnt-a-red-line-what-is">sarin-filled rockets</a> at Ghouta on August 21st 2013. It was the deadliest day of the Syrian civil war. It <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2013/04/27/acid-test">challenged Barack Obama</a> , then America&#39;s president, to act on his warning that “a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons being moved around or utilised. That would change my calculus.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ten years after Ghouta, Mr Obama&#39;s red line over Syria is remembered as a defining moment of his presidency. Rather than strike immediately, he first decided to ask for a vote in Congress and then agreed not to act at all <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2013/09/20/an-unlikely-band-of-brothers">if Russia stepped in</a> to oversee Syria&#39;s chemical disarmament. Critics argue that Mr Obama&#39;s reluctance to punish Mr Assad diminished America&#39;s credibility and that the consequences are still being felt even now.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Speaking to the <small>BBC</small> last month, François Hollande, who was French president at the time, argued that it “was particularly bad for the Middle East. And it was decisive when it comes to relations between the West and Russia.” Back in 2013, <i>The Economist</i> lamented Mr Obama&#39;s choice, too, blaming him for “ <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2013/09/20/the-weakened-west">the weakened West</a> ”. But it is worth revisiting that judgment. Although there is no disputing the erosion of the West&#39;s credibility over the past decade, a salvo of cruise missiles fired against Mr Assad would hardly have rescued it. It may not even have spared the Syrian people from further nerve-gas attacks.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Obama&#39;s red line is a curious case of a policy that came about by accident and then succeeded brilliantly in its own terms only to be remembered as a historic failure. It raises questions over how much leaders can—or should—put credibility at the centre of their plans.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Oddly for such a meticulous politician, Mr Obama stumbled into laying down his <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2012/08/25/more-than-they-can-chew">red line</a> . Although the term suggests that he had settled on an ultimatum after carefully weighing up his options, the president shocked his aides at a White House news conference on August 20th 2012 when, seemingly on an impulse, he spoke about the consequences if Syria used chemical weapons. Only a handful of news outlets actually reported his remarks, perhaps because officials hastily briefed that the administration remained highly unlikely to intervene in Syria.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The officials were too late. Many people within the American government and abroad, including in London, wanted America to use military force to stop Mr Assad committing daily atrocities. They seized on Mr Obama&#39;s words. “It was going to detonate immediately,” says Steven Simon, a former Obama official and author of “Grand Delusions”, a new history of American policy in the Middle East. “There was no time-delay fuse attached to this.” </p><iframe type="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HQhKnW2uWv8?enablejsapi=1" class="css-xm8n1m e195f1ec0"></iframe><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What&#39;s more, Mr Obama himself wavered. In December 2012 and March 2013 Mr Assad was accused of using chemical weapons against his people. On the first occasion Mr Obama called such weapons “totally unacceptable”, on the second “a game-changer”. Yet, having thus built up expectations, three weeks after Ghouta, the president suddenly denied that his credibility was at stake, saying, “I didn&#39;t set a red line. The world set a red line.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> With hindsight, Mr Obama&#39;s error was to seem to want to have it both ways. The red-line formulation helped strengthen America&#39;s warning when Mr Assad appeared to be thinking about using nerve gas to terrorise his people. Yet, after the atrocity, the very firmness that made it a powerful threat also raised the cost of seeming to do too little. Theodore Roosevelt, America&#39;s 26th president, famously advised leaders to “speak softly and carry a big stick”. Mr Obama swapped noise for stick and paid a heavy price.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The -um in ultimatum</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Except that, if Mr Obama&#39;s aim was to stop Syria using nerve gas, he also succeeded beyond expectations. A few weeks after the attack, Russia had a plan for international inspectors to oversee the dismantling of Syria&#39;s chemical-weapons programme, if America would not strike.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “The deal to bring Syria into the Chemical Weapons Convention ( <small>CWC</small> ) was one of the greatest non-proliferation achievements of the 21st century,” believes Gregory Koblentz, a chemical-weapon expert who teaches at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Syria had the Middle East&#39;s most advanced programme, which it had built to deter a conventional military attack by Israel. With Russia&#39;s encouragement, international help and the good offices of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( <small>OPCW</small> ), it destroyed 1,300 tonnes of weapons and precursor chemicals, 1,200 munitions and demolished 27 production facilities. Dr Koblentz points out that ten to 12 rockets had killed over 1,000 people on August 21st. Each carried around 50 litres of nerve agent weighing a little under 55kg. By comparison, he reckons, the nerve agents Syria destroyed may have weighed 1,000 tonnes—enough to attack Ghouta 1,800 times over.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The record was far from perfect. Syria continued to use chlorine, including in <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/04/09/america-vows-to-respond-to-a-suspected-chemical-attack-in-syria">one highly lethal attack</a> in 2018, which Donald Trump, Mr Obama&#39;s successor, and Britain and France met with a barrage of cruise missiles. Dr Koblentz also observes that Syria held on to some nerve agent—though a tiny fraction of its initial stock—because Mr Assad launched three more nerve-agent attacks, though they caused much less harm than in Ghouta. In every case, Russia covered up for its ally, blaming the attacks on rebel forces. During emergency sessions at the <small>OPCW</small> , Syria&#39;s ambassador flaunted his contempt by playing “Angry Birds” on his phone.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the record is surely better than if America and its allies had tried to eliminate Syria&#39;s chemical weapons from afar. Mr Simon recalls how the early months of the war were all about how to stop chemical weapons falling into the wrong hands. “I spent a lot of my time dealing with the <small>US</small> and Israeli intelligence communities on pinpointing where all this stuff was,” he says, “and tracking or monitoring the vulnerability of specific installations to a breach by opposition forces and exploring ways with the <small>US</small> military on how those stockpiles might be destroyed by the United States unilaterally without creating a monstrous public-health hazard.” </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_IRC225.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In addition, the Syrian civil war has not weakened the <small>CWC</small> (see chart). Many countries strongly condemned Russia over its attempt to poison Sergei Skripal, a former member of the <small>KGB</small> living in Britain, back in 2018 and Alexei Navalny, an opposition leader, in 2020 using another nerve agent called novichok. The <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2013/09/16/why-is-the-use-of-chemical-weapons-taboo">taboo against chemical weapons</a> remains.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet if Syria&#39;s programme was mostly dismantled and the <small>CWC</small> is intact, why has American credibility suffered? One answer, says Keren Yarhi-Milo, dean of Columbia University&#39;s School of International and Public Affairs, is that policy choices have audiences far beyond their narrow target. In Mr Obama&#39;s case this audience was packed with people who already doubted his resolve. His tough talk over Syria&#39;s red line was overshadowed by his oft-stated desire for America to devote less of its resources to policing the Middle East—and indeed the world as a whole. The United States had become bogged down in Afghanistan and Iraq. The decision to “lead from behind” in Libya to remove Muammar Qaddafi, its tyrannical president, at the behest of Britain and France had ended in chaos. Mr Obama&#39;s attempts to strike a deal with Iran over its nuclear programme was seen as too accommodating by some leaders in Israel and the Gulf.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Dr Yarhi-Milo argues that, as well as being judged on policies, leaders also acquire a “signalling reputation” reflecting their record of carrying out threats and honouring promises. Experts disagree about how much this reputation is worth. Some argue that foreign powers take hard-nosed decisions, based on their assessment of a leader&#39;s capabilities and interests in the moment, rather than on his or her past. However Dr Yarhi-Milo&#39;s research suggests that, in the real world, foreign powers use reputation as a guide. “Somebody like Putin doesn&#39;t engage in those kinds of super-rationalist calculations,” she says. “They use shortcuts. And those…many times are based on their personal experience interacting with that country.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Obama&#39;s reputation strikes Mr Simon as monumentally unfair. He points out that in 2013 the former president began a massive operation to train and support rebel fighters in Syria and argues that was far more significant than a punitive strike for Ghouta would have been. Middle Eastern leaders knew about this commitment, but it does not seem to have won much credit with them. Furthermore, Mr Simon describes in his book how, since the second term of George W. Bush, every American president has sought to limit America&#39;s commitment to the Middle East. And yet the red line over Syria is nevertheless treated as a turning-point.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Looking back across a decade, Mr Obama&#39;s record shows how elusive credibility can be. Mr Obama has insisted he has no regrets. In 2016 he told the <i>Atlantic</i> that “dropping bombs on someone to prove that you&#39;re willing to drop bombs on someone is just about the worst reason to use force”. That is surely correct. When Richard Nixon bombed Cambodia and the Viet Cong in the 1970s, in the belief that developing countries would otherwise topple like dominoes, it cost a lot of lives without saving America&#39;s reputation. Furthermore, leaders such as Turkey&#39;s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, feel free to flip-flop but are still able to exert power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even so, the success in dealing with Syria&#39;s chemical weapons has been eclipsed by the more general truth that America&#39;s position in the Middle East has weakened—partly by choice. That has been thrown into relief by the rise of Islamic State in 2014 as a violent source of anarchy and chaos. It was made worse by the fact that the man who stepped in to handle Syria with Mr Obama&#39;s blessing was Vladimir Putin. He has since increased his hold over the country, derided America&#39;s pretences to act as a global policeman and sent his troops into Ukraine. The red line has stuck because it represents a powerful metaphor for America&#39;s ongoing struggles to cope with a complicated world. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 22 Aug 2023 15:39:32 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/bo415ehglq99vastu7lf5rolllspmlip</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/08/22/reassessing-barack-obamas-red-line-in-syria </item><item><title><![CDATA[The BRICS bloc is riven with tensions]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/054%20International%20-%20The%20BRICS%20summit-84cd09de06bdf14a3fd321f5fad74898.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>L</span> <small>IKE THE</small> iPod and MySpace, the <small>BRICS</small> bloc is a product of the benign optimism of the 2000s. In 2001 Goldman Sachs coined the acronym <small>BRIC</small> in a paper about the economic potential of Brazil, Russia, India and China. The quartet ran with the idea, holding its first summit in 2009. A year later South Africa was invited to join. Some analysts feared the <small>BRICS</small> might soon start to rival the <small>G7,</small> but the grouping quickly lost momentum. The non-Asian <small>BRICS</small> economies stagnated in the 2010s. At summits the bloc would issue garbled communiqués about the perfidious West—which the perfidious West would promptly ignore. The <small>BRICS</small> looked dead.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> And yet the bloc lives. On August 22nd the 15th <small>BRICS</small> summit will open in Johannesburg, a major South African city—a party for many of the biggest swing voters in geopolitics. Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa&#39;s president, will be joined by leaders including Narendra Modi of India, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil (known universally as Lula) and China&#39;s Xi Jinping. Vladimir Putin will not be there in person. Were he to attend, then South Africa, as a member of the International Criminal Court, would be obliged to act on the arrest warrant the court issued for Russia&#39;s president in March. And that might spoil the fun.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The meeting will underline how the bloc has been rejuvenated by Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine and rising tensions between the West and China. <small>BRICS</small> members, led by Beijing, are considering whether to expand and deepen the bloc. Some middle powers see the group as a possible vehicle for their interests. The bloc says that more than 40 countries have either applied to join it or have expressed an interest in doing so.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A “Big <small>BRICS</small> ” would be a challenge for the West. But it is not a mortal threat. China&#39;s efforts to enlarge the bloc are revealing its tensions and contradictions. A weakened Russia is going along with it, but Brazil, India and South Africa are sceptical. The <small>BRICS</small> are far more heterogeneous than the <small>G7</small> . Members differ politically, economically and militarily; expansion would make a motley crew even motlier. It would mean that although the <small>BRICS</small> could criticise the Western-led international order with a louder voice, they would struggle even more to articulate an alternative.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What, then, holds the <small>BRICS</small> together? Like the <small>G7,</small> the group has no charter or formal membership criteria. Nor is its mortar the product of personal chemistry. In June at a meeting of foreign ministers in Cape Town, a kind of warm-up for the main event, your correspondent snuck into the restaurant hosting the dignitaries&#39; lunch. The pasta salad was not the shindig&#39;s only sad sight. The delegations were scattered: the Chinese were too busy in meetings, the South Africans too disorganised, the Brazilians too late. Outside, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India&#39;s foreign minister, held court with his officials. Inside, Sergey Lavrov, his Russian counterpart, silently nursed a glass of white wine.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Working the room</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>BRICS</small> endure because the club serves several functions. One is to provide a platform for members to criticise, often with justification, the way institutions such as the World Bank, <small>IMF</small> and <small>UN</small> Security Council sideline the “global south”, a modish term for developing countries. In Cape Town Mr Jaishankar talked of the “concentration” of global economic power that was “leaving too many nations at the mercy of too few”. Oddly, such views have become more pointed as the <small>BRICS</small> &#39; share of world <small>GDP</small> has increased, from 8% in 2001 to 26% today. Over the same period the <small>G7</small> ’s share has fallen from 65% to 43% (see chart 1). </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC144.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The clubbiness of the <small>BRICS</small> is also a source of prestige, especially for struggling members. On average the <small>GDP</small> of Brazil, Russia and South Africa has grown by less than 1% annually since 2013 (versus around 6% for China and India). Any investment analyst who picked them among the most promising emerging markets today would be laughed off her Zoom call. But being the only Latin American country and the only African country in the group respectively allows Brazil and South Africa to project continental influence: Mr Ramaphosa has invited an enormous number of African leaders to the Johannesburg summit.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The bloc offers support in isolated times, too. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil&#39;s former president, turned to the <small>BRICS</small> after his ally, Donald Trump, left the White House. These days Russia needs the <small>BRICS</small> more than ever. At the meeting of foreign ministers your correspondent tried to ask Russia&#39;s ambassador to South Africa what the bloc&#39;s purpose was for his country. “To make more friends,” he grunted.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> He will have them, if China gets its way. Beijing wants to admit more countries from the global south. The reasoning is almost Newtonian: America&#39;s rallying of Western allies is prompting China into seeking an equal and opposite reaction via the <small>BRICS.</small> Viewed from China, there is no other bloc that could be a counterweight to the <small>G7.</small> The Shanghai Co-operation Organisation is too Eurasian. The <small>G20</small> is too dominated by its Western members. The <small>BRICS</small> represent the best party going. A Chinese official contrasts Beijing&#39;s desire for a “big family” of the <small>BRICS</small> countries with the West&#39;s “small circle”.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Supersize Xi</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is not the first time that Beijing has sought a bigger crowd. It championed South Africa&#39;s admission. Since then it has repeatedly raised the idea of adding more members, especially after Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. Though the <small>BRICS</small> say their decisions are based on consensus, China is hard to ignore. Its share of the <small>BRICS</small> output was 47% in 2001; today it is 70%. In 2022 it accounted for 69% of all trade by the group (the sum of members&#39; imports and exports), up from 55% in 2001. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRM970.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The bloc has not released an official list of applicants. But, as part of a thought experiment, <i>The Economist</i> counted 18 countries that are possible candidates, based on their meeting at least one of three criteria as of the end of July (see map). First, the country is on record as saying it has applied. Second, South African officials have named the country as an applicant. Third, the country&#39;s foreign minister attended the Cape Town meeting as a “friend” of the bloc, either in person or virtually.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The guest list includes some increasingly assertive geopolitical swingers. For Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ( <small>UAE</small> ), joining the <small>BRICS</small> would fit with their efforts to recalibrate their relationship with America, their long-time ally, and to draw closer to China. Bangladesh and Indonesia, like India, are populous Asian democracies that claim to be non-aligned—and that might also like some protection from Western criticism of their human-rights records. Argentina, Ethiopia, Mexico and Nigeria are all among the largest countries on their continents.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the unlikely event that all 18 were admitted it would challenge the world&#39;s best Scrabble player to come up with a new acronym. It would also increase the population of the <small>BRICS</small> countries from 3.2bn (41% as a share of the world&#39;s) to 4.6bn (58%), versus 10% for the <small>G7</small> members. The Big <small>BRICS&#39;</small> share of world <small>GDP</small> would rise to 34%, still behind the <small>G7</small> ’s but twice the share of the <small>EU</small> . It would raise the bloc&#39;s share of world trade from 18% to 27%. China would still be the life, soul and wallet of the party, however. It would account for 55% of the 23 countries&#39; output (for reference, America has 58% of the <small>G7</small> ). China&#39;s share of the Big <small>BRICS</small> &#39; global trade would still be about half (46%).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even as the bloc debates expansion, it is deepening its existing relationships. On top of the annual summit of bigwigs there is an increasingly long list of meetings involving academics, firms, ministers, ruling parties and think-tanks from <small>BRICS</small> members and countries friendly to them. Some of these might look like excuses for per-diems. Last month a meeting of the “ <small>BRICS</small> youth summit” was hosted by South Africa&#39;s 74-year-old youth minister. Russia says it will host a “ <small>BRICS</small> Games” before the Paris Olympics next year. But the importance of the connections to officials should not be overlooked, argues Oliver Stuenkel of the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a Brazilian think-tank. “These meetings are often dull but they allow bureaucrats to globalise their network.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>BRICS</small> bloc also has more serious endeavours. It has established two financial institutions, which the Russian finance minister once reportedly described as a mini- <small>IMF</small> and a mini-World Bank. The former is the Contingent Reserve Arrangement ( <small>CRA</small> ), which was agreed to at the <small>BRICS</small> summit in 2014. It is an as yet untested series of swap lines for central banks to get hard currency if they have balance-of-payments problems.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The mini-World Bank is the New Development Bank ( <small>NDB</small> ). Since its establishment in 2015 it has lent $33bn for almost 100 projects. Three new members have joined in the past three years: Bangladesh, Egypt and the <small>UAE</small> . Uruguay is set to be admitted soon. (A state does not need to be a member of the <small>BRICS</small> to join the bank.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The possibility of expanding and deepening the grouping is seen by members as proof of its strength. Yet these efforts also highlight divisions among the gang. Economically and politically the <small>BRICS</small> are a mess—adding more members or functions would only emphasise that fact.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Start with the economic differences. The <small>GDP</small> per person of the poorest member, India, is roughly a fifth of that of China and Russia. The latter pair run current-account surpluses, the others deficits. Russia, an important member of the <small>OPEC+</small> cartel, and Brazil are net oil exporters; the other three depend on imports. China actively manages the exchange rate of its currency; the other four intervene less often.等等。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All of this complicates the bloc&#39;s attempt to change the global economic order. A common <small>BRICS</small> reserve currency—something Mr Putin claimed the bloc was working on a year ago—would collapse on first contact with reality; no member would give up the power held by their central bank. Members regularly guard their own power at economic institutions. South Africa&#39;s efforts to have more African representation on the <small>IMF</small> board have been rejected. China has around 40% of the voting rights at the <small>CRA</small> , in line with its capital contribution, and insisted on a limit to what any country can receive in the absence of an <small>IMF</small> programme.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>NDB</small> has had a slow start. Its total lending since 2015 is a third of what the World Bank Group committed in 2021 alone. The World Bank is more transparent and accountable than the <small>NDB</small> , notes Daniel Bradlow of the University of Pretoria in South Africa. That the <small>NDB</small> mostly issues loans in <small>US</small> dollars or euros somewhat undermines its members&#39; claim to be trying to reduce the power of the greenback. A rule ensures that the five original members retain 55% of voting rights, belying their criticisms of uneven decision-making power at the World Bank and the <small>IMF</small> . “That does not suggest a truly progressive global-south bank,” says Mr Bradlow.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Politically, too, they are an eclectic bunch. Russia and China are autocracies that disdain liberal freedoms. Brazil, India and South Africa are by contrast raucous, if flawed, democracies. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230819_IRC145.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The trio have more reason to be wary of public opinion as a result. A poll published on July 27th by the Pew Research Centre, a think-tank based in Washington, <small>DC</small> , found that negative views towards China have become more common since 2019—and not just in the West. In South Africa 40% of respondents had an unfavourable view of China, up from 35% four years ago. In Brazil and India unfavourable sentiment reached the highest levels since polling began in 2010 and 2013 respectively. In Brazil the share rose from 27% to 48%; in India from 46% to 67% (see chart 2).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The democracies are also keener than the autocracies on genuinely “non-aligned” foreign policies—they want to stay swingers. Take South Africa. It has angered the West by, among other things, hosting a naval exercise with China and Russia on the first anniversary of the war in Ukraine. It has government ministers who get dewy-eyed at the very mention of the Soviet Union.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But Mr Ramaphosa is wary of pushing the West too far. Several of South Africa&#39;s main sources of foreign direct investment ( <small>FDI</small> ) are Western powers, and it hosts drills with <small>NATO</small> countries, too. He wants to keep South Africa&#39;s preferential trade terms with America, which some in Congress have said should be rescinded in light of his government&#39;s drift towards Russia.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Lula also has a more subtle approach than his peers in Beijing and Moscow. He would like to reduce what he sees as America&#39;s hegemonic role in the world; hence his enthusiasm for the <small>BRICS</small> , which he helped establish during his first period in office in the 2000s. At the same time he understands the need for good relations with the West, which is its main source of <small>FDI</small> and arms. And although India continues to buy arms from Russia, it is diversifying its military ties and buying more from America and France.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine has entrenched diplomatic faultlines in other ways. The bloc&#39;s strong emphasis on sovereignty—originally a way to draw an implicit contrast with an interventionist West—looks hollow when Russia invades its neighbour. Neither China nor Russia supports the others&#39; proposed reforms of the <small>UN</small> Security Council, of which they are both permanent members. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="An illustration of five mostly empty cocktail glasses with flags respresenting South Africa, China, Brazil, India and Russia scattered around and confetti on the floor.

Though Lula is more sympathetic to the idea of welcoming like-minded Latin American leaders to the club, such as Argentina&#39;s Alberto Fernández (with whom he is personally close), diplomatic types are more sceptical. Mauro Vieira, Brazil&#39;s foreign minister and a career diplomat, has spoken of the need to protect the <small>BRICS</small> “brand”. South Africa likes being the only African representative in the bloc. China would be emboldened by a bigger <small>BRICS;</small> others would feel enfeebled.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All these differences are coming to the fore because of expansion talk. “We do not want to dilute control of the <small>BRICS</small> from the original five,” says a South African official. South Africa instead hopes for a compromise whereby joiners are given second-class status, mere <small>B</small> -listers at the party. The details need to be worked out—something which may happen at the summit.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Warring parties</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The critical dissenting voice is likely to be India&#39;s, given its growing economic and geopolitical importance. In the early days of the bloc “India thought that with the help of Russia it could manage China better,” says Harsh Pant of the Observer Research Foundation, a think-tank in Delhi. That is harder now Russia is beholden to China. And India frets about some of the wannabes, such as Cuba and Belarus. India fears these would be mini-Russias, repeating China&#39;s talking points.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> India sees itself as a rival to China for leadership of the global south. It has used its presidency of the <small>G20</small> this year to amplify the concerns of developing countries regarding climate finance and international institutions. It would not want to play second fiddle to a Chinese effort to woo this same group.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The tricky thing for India is that it doesn&#39;t want to be a party-pooper either. Nor is it keen to attract the blame for blocking other emerging countries&#39; aspirations. And it aims to preserve decent relations with China, with which it has deep economic links and a long border. So India is proceeding with caution. It wants to discuss joining criteria for new members in the coming weeks, rather than simply handing out welcome drinks.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Johannesburg summit will be a defining moment for the <small>BRICS.</small> Enlargement would indicate the scale of China&#39;s sway on the scene. But if China is blocked it would underline the group&#39;s deep divisions. Either way, the global south is showing that it is as transactional as the Western countries it claims moral superiority over. And much more fractured. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 17 Aug 2023 13:33:27 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/g3hmdnml8f7f4j9i2v6sb2fu377bjsko</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/08/17/the-brics-are-getting-together-in-south-africa </item><item><title><![CDATA[What Ukraine’s bloody battlefield is teaching medics]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>A</span> MERICAN AND British intelligence agencies watched as Russia massed its troops on the border with Ukraine in the early weeks of 2022. They knew that Vladimir Putin had planned an invasion—they had stolen his plans. But would Mr Putin go through with it? One indicator that he would, says Major-General Tim Hodgetts, the surgeon-general of Britain&#39;s armed forces, was that field hospitals were moving to Russia&#39;s border with Ukraine.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That was telling, but not damning. Russia had deployed hospitals for exercises in the past. More worrying were the ongoing blood drives among the country&#39;s university students. Red blood cells last only six weeks if not frozen; donors can be bled only every three months. Even more troubling was what was happening inside the field hospitals. Russian surgeons were practising operations on large, anaesthetised animals. “Medical indicators and warnings are predictive of war,” concludes General Hodgetts. It is a vital lesson from Ukraine for future conflicts.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The war in Ukraine is the largest in Europe since 1945. Russia and Ukraine have fought at a scale and intensity that Western armies have not encountered since the Korean war. Military casualties have dwarfed those of recent American and European campaigns. America lost over 7,000 troops in Afghanistan and Iraq between 2001 and 2019. Ukraine has lost more than twice as many in a year, according to leaked American documents, Russia six to seven times more. The experience will change military medicine for good.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In Afghanistan and Iraq, America&#39;s army and its allies made astonishing progress in wartime medical care. Since the majority of deaths occur before soldiers arrive at a hospital, much was gained by evacuating wounded troops by helicopter and treating them within the “golden hour”, a period in which the chance of survival is far higher. Soldiers who once would have died pulled through. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRC130.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The ratio of those wounded to killed, around three- or four-to-one in Vietnam, where care was poorer, shot up to as high as ten-to-one (see chart). In Ukraine the figure has plummeted back to Vietnam levels, say people familiar with the classified data. No more than 2% of American soldiers were killed or wounded in the post-2001 wars; the comparable figure is estimated at 5-10% for Ukraine. A study from 2022 by the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank, suggested that 40% of wounded Ukrainian personnel were suffering permanent injuries.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To a certain extent these figures reflect the limitations of medical care on both sides. Russia&#39;s army treats infantry as disposable. Wounded soldiers have been sent back to the front lines with serious shrapnel wounds and cardiac problems. Tanisha Fazal of the University of Minnesota, an expert on medical care in war, says her jaw dropped when she saw a video of a Russian officer using an obsolete rubber tourniquet. It was of the sort that America used in Afghanistan in the early 2000s.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For its part, Ukraine is in the midst of a transition away from Soviet-style care. Before 2017 it had no professional cadre of combat medics, says Maria Nazarova, an instructor in the country&#39;s armed forces. By 2022 it had trained 650 of them, a drop in the ocean for a notional million-man army. The training centre, short of instructors and facilities, now prepares fewer than 300 people per month for the battlefield, each of whom has had just those four weeks of instruction.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The current counter-offensive, which is forcing Ukrainian troops to cross minefields in the teeth of drone and artillery attacks, is intensifying the burden on medical care. “I have not seen such a spike in the demand for tourniquets since June last year,” says Evgen Vorobiov, a lawyer in Kyiv who works as a volunteer with six different brigades. He adds that chest seals and ultrasound devices are also needed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The shortages are compounded by structural problems. The supply of military equipment to front-line units remains inefficient and ad hoc, says Mr Vorobiov. Senior medics spend their time filling out paper forms to request supplies that arrive erratically and in small quantities. There is frequent tension between front-line units and the general staff&#39;s central medical command, which sees its job as running hospitals rather than supporting front-line care. It does not provide vital kit, such as portable ultrasound or intraosseous access devices, which are needed to get fluids into patients when veins can&#39;t be found—a common problem for soldiers in shock, says Ms Nazarova. Over 90% of medical supplies for combat medics are purchased by volunteers, she says.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This bureaucratic infighting has more serious consequences, too. America&#39;s army realised in the 2000s that transfusing wounded soldiers with “whole” blood, rather than components like plasma, was saving lives. Last summer Ukraine&#39;s health ministry legalised that practice. The medical command, in a fit of bureaucracy, then stepped in to ban it. But many “modern-thinking” Ukrainian brigades continue doing it regardless, says Ms Nazarova, using personal contacts with local blood-donation centres. The result is uneven levels of care throughout the armed forces.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Western armies would enjoy many advantages in a big war, including more skilled personnel and better equipment. But American and European military doctors acknowledge that a large conflict would prove a huge shock to medical care honed over decades of counterinsurgency campaigns against opponents lacking in artillery, missiles and drones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Take helicopters, which are critical for transporting the wounded. Just 70 American ones were downed by fire between 2001 and 2009 in Afghanistan and Iraq. Russia has lost 90 in 17 months. “This recognition that the next war will likely be very different in air superiority has changed lots of paradigms within the <small>US</small> and <small>NATO</small> militaries,” says John Holcomb, a professor at the University of Alabama who led the <small>US</small> Army&#39;s Institute of Surgical Research. There will be “prolonged field care” outside hospitals. “Clinical outcomes will be poor,” warns General Hodgetts.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Injury patterns will differ, too. Around 79% of America&#39;s casualties in the wars after the attacks of September 11th, 2001 were from improvised explosive devices. More than 70% of Ukrainian casualties are from artillery and rocket barrages, according to a recent paper published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons. These tend to affect a larger number of soldiers at once, causing “polytrauma”—damage to multiple body parts and organs.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Treating such injuries at scale will tax European armies. Consider blood. It is a “strategic commodity” for the alliance, writes Ronald Ti, a military-medical logistician at King&#39;s College London. A military health-care system that cannot provide it risks “systemic collapse of morale”, he warns. Dr Ti gives the example of Estonia: its main peacetime stock of blood could be exhausted in a single day of war (on <small>NATO</small> ’s standard assumptions about rates of use).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet stockpiling blood is not like storing ammo. Its shelf life when fresh is weeks (and, when frozen, months), not years. Thawing it from frozen takes time. Moreover, blood-donation levels in Britain routinely drop below a week&#39;s worth of reserves, notes General Hodgetts. The war is helping to resolve previously knotty legal issues in <small>NATO</small> around the interoperability of blood products and drugs. Britain is now investing to produce its own freeze-dried plasma, having previously depended on scarce French and German production that might be swamped in wartime.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another problem is how to shift tens of thousands of wounded soldiers. On July 11th <small>NATO</small> leaders approved the alliance&#39;s first comprehensive defence plans since the cold war. They included specific plans for mass-casualty transport across Europe, including how to distribute casualties among different allies, an issue neglected for years. <small>NATO</small> medical chiefs, sometimes joined by Ukraine&#39;s surgeon-general, have been meeting regularly to test how those procedures would fare in wartime. Up to 60% of Ukraine&#39;s military casualties have been moved by rail. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230805_IRM925.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Medics once wanted hospitals to stand out in a war zone. The lesson from Ukraine, where Russia has struck facilities with large red crosses on the roof, is that it may be better to blend in. The World Health Organisation estimates that there have been almost 900 attacks on health facilities in the war (see map). Medical doctors are considering how to harden, camouflage or disperse their facilities. But light and agile field hospitals will inevitably provide more limited care. Another growing challenge is how to ensure that the electronic emissions of medical equipment do not serve as a beacon to enemy bombs.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Ready for action</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The war has also put nuclear weapons back on the agenda. In the autumn Western leaders grew concerned that Russia was preparing to use tactical nuclear weapons. America, Britain and France warned the Kremlin that it would face serious military consequences if it took that step; the danger subsided. In the cold war <small>NATO</small> planned to fight through a nuclear battlefield. Those plans faded away in the 1990s. Many officials now worry that America and its allies are medically unprepared for nuclear conflict. Vast numbers of burn kits would be needed, for example.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Finally, Ukraine illustrates how technology is changing military medicine. A study published in February 2021 by Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Maddry and his colleagues at the <small>US</small> Army&#39;s Institute of Surgical Research examined the records of 1,267 patients transported with traumatic injuries. Half did not receive any life-saving intervention en route and so might have been moved safely by drone.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine is testing that theory. It has already used large cargo drones, capable of carrying 180kg loads up to 70km, to evacuate wounded personnel, becoming the first country to conduct this sort of robotic medevac. “As technology advances,” write Lieutenant-Colonel Maddry and his co-authors, “robotics aboard [drones] could provide pain medications, blood products, oxygen, airway management, and even surgical procedures”—though the drones are subject to the same risks as helicopters, points out Dr Fazal.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The challenge is to learn from such experiments and Ukraine&#39;s broader experience. That requires turning anecdotes into hard data. America has offered to help Ukraine build a “trauma registry” of the sort that it used in Afghanistan and Iraq, a database which logs how patients are injured, how they have been treated and how they fare. Analysis will benefit not just allied armies, but also the wider public. Dr Holcomb has said that he was able to reduce the number of trauma deaths at his hospital, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, by 30% by applying skills picked up in the army. Ukraine&#39;s pain will lead to medical gains. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Correction (August 7th 2023): An earlier version of this article misspelt John Holcomb&#39;s name.对不起。</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 16:09:39 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/g794vi0alrl8i0nlpajpc32065ej0qfm</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/08/04/what-ukraines-bloody-battlefield-is-teaching-medics </item><item><title><![CDATA[Western values are steadily diverging from the rest of the world’s]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div id="script-microapp"><figure class="svelte-12c8hyb wide-image ds-container"><img src="/interactive/international/2023/08/03/western-values-are-steadily-diverging-from-the-rest-of-the-world/20230805_IRD001.jpg" alt class="svelte-86df6y"></figure><p class="article-text"> <span>I</span> <small>N 1981</small> OVER 40% of the world&#39;s population lived in extreme poverty. But economic growth was starting to accelerate in developing countries. And Ron Inglehart, a professor at the University of Michigan, was organising a worldwide survey team to test the theory that, as peasant farmers escape poverty, they begin to think and behave differently, as people in the past had done when they joined the middle classes.</p><p class="article-text"> They might give a higher priority to education, to widening their children&#39;s knowledge, than their own parents had done. They might give greater weight to their own experience and reasoning, and less to religious books or the authority of kings. And perhaps these new ways, these basic values, would begin to converge around the world. Such matters, Inglehart thought, could be tested by asking questions which revealed underlying values such as “How important is religion in your life?”, “Would you be happy living next to a foreigner?” and “Can you trust most people?”</p><p class="article-text"> Forty years later, only 8% of the world&#39;s population is still in extreme poverty; more than half, on some measures, count as middle class. The World Values Survey ( <small>WVS</small> ), Inglehart&#39;s baby, has become the world&#39;s biggest social-research network. Every five years or so its researchers sally out into the field interviewing, at last count, almost 130,000 people in 90 countries. Yet its latest wave of results, which covers 2017-22, provides only partial endorsement of the idea that basic values tend to converge as people get richer. In significant ways, the differences between how people think in different parts of the world seem to be widening.</p><p class="article-text"> Inglehart (who died in 2021) argued that security—or, to be precise, insecurity—is at the root of how people think and what they value. In an insecure world in which children or crops can be wiped out by disease or drought overnight, family is often the only defence against disaster, while church, mosque or temple are the main providers of consolation or explanation.

In some ways it looks similar to today&#39;s. In both, Protestant Europeans are the most secular and individualistic. Catholic Europeans hold similar views, though less strongly. In Islamic and African countries, religion and family hold sway. What the <small>WVS</small> calls “Confucian” countries, including China, Japan and South Korea, are a mixture. They hold secular values as strongly as Europeans; when responding to assertions such as “where religion and science conflict, religion is always right”, they are even less likely to agree than Germans or Dutch.

They included America, Ireland and some Latin American countries, such as Venezuela. This amalgam put them at the bottom right corner. Many Orthodox countries (such as Russia and Romania) showed the inverse: weak religious values but strong “tribal”, or collective, ones. They were irreligious ethno-nationalists, clustered in the top left. </p><div class="ai2html-chart svelte-1hiq10b"><div class="ds-image ai2html-chart"><div class="container svelte-1ajxt9k"><div class><div id="g-20230805_IRC938-box" class="ai2html svelte-3ng2es"><div id="g-20230805_IRC938-Artboard_1_copy_2-700" class="g-artboard svelte-3ng2es"><img id="g-20230805_IRC938-Artboard_1_copy_2-700-img" class="g-20230805_IRC938-Artboard_1_copy_2-img g-aiImg svelte-3ng2es" alt src="/interactive/international/2023/08/03/western-values-are-steadily-diverging-from-the-rest-of-the-world/images/20230805_IRC938-Artboard_1_copy_2-700.png"></div><div id="g-20230805_IRC938-Artboard_1_copy_2-590" class="g-artboard svelte-3ng2es"><img id="g-20230805_IRC938-Artboard_1_copy_2-590-img" class="g-20230805_IRC938-Artboard_1_copy_2-img g-aiImg svelte-3ng2es" alt src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhCgAKAIAAAB8fHwAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAAKAAoAAAIIhI+py+0PYysAOw=="></div><div id="g-20230805_IRC938-Artboard_1_copy_2-336" class="g-artboard svelte-3ng2es"><img id="g-20230805_IRC938-Artboard_1_copy_2-336-img" class="g-20230805_IRC938-Artboard_1_copy_2-img g-aiImg svelte-3ng2es" alt src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhCgAKAIAAAB8fHwAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAAKAAoAAAIIhI+py+0PYysAOw=="></div></div></div></div></div></div><p class="article-text"> If you look at the map of 1998, you will see countries scattered across all four quadrants. In the map of 2022, by contrast, most are in just two. The outliers of bottom right and top left are fewer. Most countries are now aligned along a diagonal that starts in the bottom left, with strong traditional and collective values, and rises towards the top right, with more secular values and individualism. In 2022 there is a clear “best fit” line. In 1998, there was not.</p><p class="article-text"> On the face of it, this shift suggests that people do think differently as they escape from poverty and insecurity. The diagonal line implies that countries are either traditional-cum-collective or rational-cum-individualistic. The poorest countries are (mostly) at one end and the richest (mostly) at the other. Eventually, presumably, poorer countries will shuffle along the diagonal.</p><p class="article-text"> Perhaps. But at the moment, the <small>WVS</small> findings suggest this is not happening without obstacles and detours. If poorer countries were indeed converging with rich ones in terms of values, you would expect that they would be the ones where values are changing fastest, whereas the countries they are catching up with would be more stable. In fact the survey finds the opposite. Countries that are already the most secular and individualistic are changing fastest and becoming even more secular; those that are most traditional and clannish are changing less and sometimes becoming more traditional, not less.<strong></strong></p><p class="article-text"> In 1998, 38% of Protestant Europeans and 32% of Muslims said most people could be trusted. By 2022 trust in Europe had risen (with more than half of Europeans saying that they trusted people) but it had plummeted in Islamic countries, where just 15% of respondents said people are trustworthy. In 1998 Catholic Europeans and Latin Americans also had comparable levels of trust. By 2022, the proportion of Catholic Europeans who said they trusted people was three times higher than that of Latin Americans.</p><p class="article-text"> Just as mistrust of strangers is a measure of collective values, so is unwillingness to sign petitions. This is because clannish societies tend not to believe that governing authorities will act in their interests, and for fear of reprisals. In 2022 nearly half of respondents in Latin American and Orthodox countries said they would never sign a petition. That marked a big increase in Latin America since 1998, and a small one in the Orthodox places. In contrast, the number of Europeans who said they would never sign a petition fell markedly, to levels roughly half those in most of the rest of the world.</p><p class="article-text"> On measure after measure—from thinking that children ought to be obedient, to tolerance of homosexuality, to agreeing that “when religion and science conflict, religion is always right”—European countries have moved in the direction of greater individualism and secularism in the past 25 years. That is also true of America. Though Americans have long been somewhat more religious than most Europeans, over time they have moved towards greater individualism and secularism at least as much as Europeans have.</p><p class="article-text"> In 1981, for example, 47% of Americans described themselves as non-religious (saying God was not important in their lives, that they did not attend church services and so on). The share in Sweden was 58%. By 2022 the share in America had risen by 14 points, almost matching Sweden&#39;s. Meanwhile Orthodox, Islamic and Latin American countries have seen either smaller changes or, in some cases, movement towards more traditionalism and collectivism. That does not necessarily invalidate the idea that global values will one day converge. But it does suggest that day may be some way off.</p><p class="article-text"> <strong>Mind the gap</strong></p><p class="article-text"> The findings raise three further questions. First, how long can this gap continue to widen? In particular, can Europeans and Americans really go on getting ever more individualistic and secular? “People keep asking me if there is a limit,” says Christian Welzel, a professor at Leuphana University in Luneburg, in Germany, and another of Inglehart&#39;s co-authors. “But I haven&#39;t seen any sign yet.” Dr Welzel has trawled through the <small>WVS</small> data by age cohort. He finds that in every region each generation becomes more individualistic and secular than the one before.</p><p class="article-text"> In Europe the gap between old and young is especially large, and many times greater than in Islamic or Orthodox countries. This implies that the shift towards more self-expression will continue in the next generation. In America there is a values gap between the more religious and more secular parts of the country, which could in theory imply that the religious areas (in the South and Midwest) might not be taking part in the drift towards secularism. Yet even this seems wrong. The gap between the most and least religious states has not changed materially since 1981. Whatever it is that is causing America&#39;s unusually polarised politics, it is not—the <small>WVS</small> suggests—a result of a fundamental shift in what people believe in different parts of the country.</p><p class="article-text"> Second, what are the political and geopolitical implications? At a broad level, values and politics are obviously and intimately connected. Traditional values seem to be more associated with autocracies; one-person-one-vote systems embody individualistic values. It can be no coincidence that during the past decade authoritarian populists have done especially well in two of the regions where the slowdown or reversal of secular-rational values has occurred: Orthodox countries (such as Russia and Belarus) and Latin America (Brazil, Nicaragua, Venezuela).</p><p class="article-text"> In Orthodox, Latin American and Islamic countries support for democracy also plummeted, as measured by the share of the population saying they thought it was good or fairly good to have a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament or elections. In all three regions the share saying they thought this rose by between one-third and two-thirds between 1998 and 2022. That hardly bodes well for the future of democracy.</p><p class="article-text"> Even so, there is no simple relationship between values and politics, as the example of American religious voters suggests. The persistence of the devout and traditionalist right in Europe and America is clearly connected with discontent at spreading individualism. But it is not so clear whether voters have changed and organised themselves into more powerful far-right parties, or whether the parties have simply managed more successfully than in the past to sell their politics to voters who have not changed that much themselves.</p><p class="article-text"> A similar point can be made about values and geopolitics. International conflicts over values seem to be spreading. Barely a day goes by without clashes between Western and non-Western governments over <small>LGBT</small> + rights. After President Joe Biden criticised Uganda&#39;s introduction of a harsh anti-gay law earlier this year Anita Among, the Ugandan parliament&#39;s speaker, said “The Western world will not come to rule Uganda.” And when Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey&#39;s president, threatened to block Sweden&#39;s application to join <small>NATO</small> because a man in Sweden had burned pages from the Koran, he was appealing to Turks&#39; strong religious convictions. But to many individualistic Swedes the book-burner had every right to free expression, as long as he obeyed the law.</p><p class="article-text"> Disagreements about values also pervade the superpower rivalry between America and China. Chinese leaders complain endlessly that there are no such things as “the so-called universal values of the West” (as Xi Jinping, China&#39;s president, puts it), and that appeals by the American government to such values are a mere smokescreen for a new kind of imperialism. Dilma Rousseff, a former president of Brazil, calls Western liberalism “this imposed value system”.</p><p class="article-text"> Even so, many of these conflicts would surely have happened regardless of differences over values. China would have challenged America for strategic and technological reasons. Turkey might have blocked Sweden to extract concessions from <small>NATO</small> . Vladimir Putin, Russia&#39;s president, claims to have invaded Ukraine because that country, once an integral part of the Orthodox world, is imbibing European habits of thought which (Mr Putin thinks) threaten Russia. But Mr Putin had many reasons for his decision, paranoid as well as calculated. The point is not that differences in values are artificial. But they may not be determinative. To authoritarian governments, “values” are an excuse as well as a set of beliefs.</p><p class="article-text"> Third, what does all this mean for arguments about “universal values”? The <small>WVS</small> implies that secular and liberal values are no more universal than religious and authoritarian ones. The two sets of values sit at opposite ends of the same spectrum of opinion; both are ways in which people adapt to their circumstances, whether secure or insecure. In that sense Mr Xi and others have a point: such values are not universal. But they are not entirely conditional upon a country&#39;s history or political culture.</p><p class="article-text"> As a rule of thumb, as prosperity spreads, life expectancy rises, fertility rates fall, and education expands, people tend to move towards the secular/rational end of the spectrum. Mr Welzel describes this as a shift in mindset from “prevention focus” (in which people&#39;s main concern is preventing harm and loss to themselves and their family) to what he calls “promotion focus” (under which people seek self-expression and freedom of choice about how to live their lives).</p><p class="article-text"> The <small>WVS</small> , however, finds that the speed at which this shift happens varies greatly in different countries. In some places it even goes into reverse. Different generations adjust more or less readily. Governments intervene to slow things down if it suits them. And it is clear that getting wealthier is not necessarily enough to trigger the shift in values, because countries that are getting richer can often feel less secure.</p><p class="article-text"> For all these reasons, traditional ways of thinking persist and the convergence of values widely expected to accompany economic growth is far from complete. Yet the impact of greater security on people&#39;s values does not go away. Slowly, unsurely, religious and authoritarian values tend to lose some of their appeal; secular and liberal values tend to gain. And the battle over values plays out between the two poles. <span>■</span></p><p class="article-sources"> Sources: <i>The Economist;</i> World Values Survey: Round Seven, Inglehart et al. 2022年</p><div class="related-content svelte-1hiq10b"><div class="wrapper svelte-13yxci9"><div class="tiles svelte-13yxci9"><div class="tile main svelte-13yxci9"> <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2023/08/04/what-ukraines-bloody-battlefield-is-teaching-medics" class="svelte-13yxci9"><img src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230805_IRP501.jpg" class="svelte-13yxci9"></a><p class="svelte-13yxci9"> Western armies have not dealt with mass casualties since the 1950s </p></div><div><div class="tile other svelte-13yxci9"><div class="image svelte-13yxci9"><img src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230805_IRD010.jpg" class="svelte-13yxci9"></div></div><div class="tile other svelte-13yxci9"><div class="image svelte-13yxci9"><img src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230729_IRP504.jpg" class="svelte-13yxci9"></div></div><div class="tile other svelte-13yxci9"><div class="image svelte-13yxci9"><img src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/image/20230729_IRP503.jpg" class="svelte-13yxci9"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 16:16:01 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/v79lh8skjj3fro5neffqhhuome8d2nt9</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/interactive/international/2023/08/03/western-values-are-steadily-diverging-from-the-rest-of-the-world </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ukrainian army commits new forces in a big southward push]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/046%20International%20-%20Ukraine_s%20counter-offensive-961581ebab9932bdc4baecebbf216306.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><i>阅读我们最近对<a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">乌克兰战争</a>的更多报道</i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>A</span> <small>fter eight</small> weeks of slow progress, Ukraine&#39;s counter-offensive entered a new phase on July 26th when Ukraine&#39;s army committed a big part of its reserve forces in the south.

But for that to happen, Ukraine must overcome the problems that hobbled the first phase of its offensive earlier this summer.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The counter-offensive began on June 4th when Ukraine launched attacks near Velyka Novosilka and around Bakhmut in Donetsk province, as well as a prior thrust in <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/16/zaporizhia-braces-itself-for-russian-nuclear-tricks">Zaporizhia province</a> in the south where it is now intensifying its assault. Its new Western-equipped brigades got bogged down, sometimes in <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/09/sappers-risk-their-lives-to-win-ukraine-back-inch-by-inch">minefields</a> , and were targeted by Russian artillery, anti-tank missiles, attack helicopters and loitering munitions. Ukraine responded by changing tactics. It held back armour and sent in smaller units of dismounted infantry, often no more than 20 soldiers, to proceed slowly and haltingly.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “The various wargames that were done ahead of time have predicted certain levels of advance,” conceded General Mark Milley, America&#39;s top officer, on July 18th. “And that has slowed down.” In part, the slow progress reflects the scale of the task. Russian defences are 30km deep in places, bristling with tank traps and spattered with mines. Most <small>NATO</small> armies would struggle to punch through comparable lines without complete dominance in the air, which Ukraine does not enjoy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another problem is that Russia has mounted a <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/07/03/how-ukraines-enemy-is-also-learning-lessons-albeit-slowly">stronger defence</a> than expected, conducting rapid, mobile counter-attacks in response to Ukrainian advances, rather than remaining confined to trenches. Rob Lee, an expert on Russia&#39;s armed forces who recently visited the front lines, notes that they have not just executed their doctrine competently, but also innovated, for instance by stacking multiple anti-tank mines on top of one another to destroy mine-clearing vehicles.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine&#39;s inability to breach Russian lines is partly to do with equipment—it needs demining kit, air-defence systems and anti-tank missiles capable of blunting Russian counter-attacks from a greater distance. It is also to do with tactics. Mr Lee describes an occasion when a brigade&#39;s advance was delayed by a couple of hours, until dawn. That not only negated Ukraine&#39;s advantage in night-vision systems, but also meant that the accompanying artillery barrage lifted hours earlier than it should have done. Russian infantry and anti-tank squads, who should have been suppressed by well-timed shellfire, were free to attack.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This lack of proficiency in co-ordinating complex attacks involving multiple units and different sorts of weapons is hardly surprising. Ukraine&#39;s new brigades were put together in a hurry with unfamiliar equipment. Newly mobilised men were given a month of training in Germany. They have struggled with tasks like reconnaissance, says Mr Lee, with new units becoming disoriented at night time. Co-ordination has also been a problem, with confusion around where friendly units have placed mines.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ukraine&#39;s allies do not seem troubled by the slow progress to date. “It is far from a failure, in my view,” said General Milley, when asked whether the offensive had stalled. “I think that it&#39;s way too early to make that kind of call.” Optimists point to three factors in Ukraine&#39;s favour. One is that it need not fear a serious Russian counter-attack, despite minor Russian gains in northern Luhansk province in recent days. “There appears now to be little prospect of the Russian forces regaining momentum,” said Richard Moore, the head of <small>MI</small> 6, a British spy agency, on July 19th. That may be one reason why Russia has torn up a <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/18/why-the-death-of-ukraines-grain-deal-is-not-moving-wheat-markets">grain deal</a> and <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2023/07/27/russia-is-attacking-ukraines-agricultural-exports">resumed strikes</a> on Ukraine&#39;s ports and grain stores.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Second, Russia&#39;s decision to defend forward, rather than falling back to prepared defences, has slowed down Ukraine&#39;s progress but also left Russia with little mobile reserve in the rear, a point underscored by Yevgeny Prigozhin&#39;s unhindered march to Moscow in June.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The third factor is that Ukraine has been chipping away at Russia&#39;s combat power. On July 11th a Ukrainian strike reportedly killed Oleg Tsokov, a Russian general, in Berdyansk, suggesting that Ukraine was successfully targeting command posts. In recent days Ukraine has also used British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles to strike air bases and ammunition depots, including in Crimea. Meanwhile, America&#39;s decision to provide cluster munitions, allows Ukraine to keep up the offensive for longer than originally planned—certainly beyond the summer if necessary.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These factors explain why General Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine&#39;s top general, decided to throw in fresh legs on July 26th. He has been forced to adapt his original plan. Brigades from Ukraine&#39;s 9th Corps had been expected to fight their way to Russia&#39;s main line of defence. Then the 10th Corps, in essence a second echelon, including three Western-equipped brigades, were to be deployed to fight their way through the strongest defences. Finally, light, fast-moving air-assault units were supposed to exploit any breakthrough, pouring through the hard-won breach.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the event, 9th Corps struggled. Advances that were supposed to be completed in days ended up taking weeks. Ukraine was unable to deploy whole brigades, instead breaking them down into smaller units. Some experts worry that 10th Corps has now been thrown in prematurely. The main Russian line is still kilometres away and 10th Corps&#39;s units might be worn down before they get there, leaving them too exhausted to punch through.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Western officials play down these concerns. “I think they timed it well,” says one. Ukraine is in a “very strong operational position”, says another, pointing to the turmoil in Russia&#39;s senior ranks, including the decision in early July to sack General Ivan Popov, who commanded a big portion of Russian forces in southern Ukraine. Russian military bloggers have described heavy losses of Russian artillery pieces in recent weeks.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> However, a fluid war of manoeuvre is likely to remain a stretch for a force cobbled together in a few months. The Russian verb <i>peremalyvat (</i> to grind through) is invoked on both sides. But Ukraine&#39;s junior commanders, having seen their units gutted over the past 18 months, refuse to send their new citizen army into a meat-grinder in the way that Russia did in Bakhmut. As Ukraine has become more European, Ben Wallace, Britain&#39;s defence minister, recently suggested, it has acquired “a Western European caution”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some American and European military officials argue that Ukrainian commanders have in fact been too slow to strike with their new brigades, a mistake that they think Ukraine committed last year in Kherson, when tens of thousands of Russian troops withdrew east over the Dnieper river with their equipment. Ukrainian commanders chafe at the idea that they should gamble their army in circumstances that <small>NATO</small> generals have never faced.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The 10th Corps&#39;s assault is a break with that hesitation. And the upside of the aversion to casualties thus far is that many Ukrainian units are in better shape than planners had assumed. Brigades that assaulted Russian positions were expected to be left with only a third of their original strength. Thanks in part to well-armoured Western vehicles, they have taken a lighter knock. Even so, the commitment of 10th Corps is a fateful moment for General Zaluzhny, a cautious commander with the weight of Ukrainian and allied expectations on his shoulders. “This is the last big decision for Zaluzhny to make this summer,” says the Western official. “The die is cast.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Stay on top of our defence and international security coverage with <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-war-room">The War Room</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 11:17:56 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/6dcddo7e96s5miv5u35eirrquflvrg6n</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/07/27/the-ukrainian-army-commits-new-forces-in-a-big-southward-push</item></channel></rss>
