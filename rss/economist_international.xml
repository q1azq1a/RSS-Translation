e190yofl0"><span>这</span><small>不是</small>快乐的时光。以色列和哈马斯在加沙的战争有可能蔓延到整个中东，而美国和伊朗则在幕后对峙。乌克兰战争是 1945 年以来欧洲最大规模的战争，目前还没有结束的迹象。现在，中国的飞机和军舰越来越多、越来越频繁地威胁台湾，而台湾即将举行的选举可能会带来更多的骚乱。马里、缅甸和苏丹的内战最近几周也恶化了。</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><i>阅读我们对<a href="https://www.economist.com/israel-hamas">以色列-哈马斯战争</a>和<a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">乌克兰战争</a>的报道</i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一系列危机并非史无前例。历史学家谢尔盖·拉琴科 (Sergey Radchenko) 列举了苏联入侵匈牙利和 1956 年苏伊士运河危机、1958 年黎巴嫩和台湾海峡危机以及 1978-79 年中国入侵越南、伊朗伊斯兰革命和苏联入侵阿富汗接连展开。 1999年，新装备了核导弹的印度和巴基斯坦就克什米尔发动了战争，而<small>北约则</small>轰炸了南斯拉夫境内的塞尔维亚军队。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但美国及其盟国无法像以前那样轻松或廉价地进行干预。中国和俄罗斯等对手更加自信，合作也越来越频繁。包括印度和土耳其在内的不结盟国家也是如此，它们在影响遥远事件方面的影响力越来越大，并相信一种新的、更有利的秩序正在出现。大国之间爆发直接战争的可能性笼罩着世界，迫使各国在今天奋战的同时也要密切关注未来。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">大型多人游戏</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">大国在曾经可能朝着同一方向推进的问题上变得更加两极分化。例如，在中东， <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/17/putins-plan-to-profit-from-the-israel-hamas-war">俄罗斯</a>与哈马斯走得更近，撕毁了与以色列多年的谨慎外交关系。<a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/10/26/how-china-sees-gaza">中国</a>在过去的战争中曾发表过温和的声明，敦促缓和局势，但现在却利用这场危机批评美国在该地区的作用。除了匈牙利领导人欧尔班维克托这样的强人之外，很少有西方国家再与俄罗斯对话。甚至与中国的对话也越来越以威胁和警告为主，而不是努力解决气候变化等共同问题。乔·拜登和习近平计划于 11 月 15 日在加利福尼亚州举行的会议可能就是一个很好的例子，尽管有传言称将就人工智能的军事应用达成协议。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">另一个转变是美国的对手之间日益趋同。 “俄罗斯、中国、朝鲜和伊朗之间确实正在出现一个轴心，它拒绝接受他们版本的美国领导的国际秩序，”斯蒂芬·哈德利说。他曾于 1970 年代在美国国家安全委员会任职，并于 1980 年代在五角大楼任职，随后于 2005 年成为乔治·W·布什的国家安全顾问。乌克兰战争巩固了俄罗斯与中国之间的伙伴关系。这不是一个正式的联盟，但两国今年六月在西太平洋进行了四年多来的第六次联合轰炸机巡逻。随后，他们于 8 月在该地区进行了 13,000 公里的联合海军巡逻。<a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2023/09/19/meet-the-worlds-new-arms-dealers">伊朗和朝鲜</a>都向俄罗斯提供武器，以换取军事技术。结果就是更大的纠缠。涉及一个敌人的危机越来越有可能卷入另一个敌人。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">而且，每次危机不仅涉及更多的敌人，而且还涉及更多的玩家。澳大利亚、日本、新西兰和韩国领导人均出席了过去两届在欧洲举行的<small>北约</small>峰会。如果没有韩国炮弹的注入，乌克兰今年的反攻就不可能发生。土耳其已成为整个地区的主要武器供应国，凭借其军事技术和顾问重塑了利比亚、叙利亚和阿塞拜疆的冲突。欧洲国家正在更深入地计划如何应对台湾危机。因此，危机有更多的变化因素。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这反映了经济和政治权力分配的更广泛转变。 “多极化”这一概念曾经仅限于学术界，指的是这样一个世界：权力不是集中在两个地方（如冷战时期），也不是集中在一个地方（如美国主导的 20 世纪 90 年代），而是集中在一个地方。有几个——已进入外交主流。 9月，印度外交部长苏杰生指出，美国面临“伊拉克和阿富汗的长期后果”（这是对两场失败战争的认可）以及相对经济衰退，“正在适应多极世界”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这个论点是值得商榷的。美国国家安全顾问杰克·沙利文在最近的一篇文章中认为，与陷入这些战争时相比，美国现在的地位更加强大。 “如果美国仍在阿富汗作战，”他写道，“俄罗斯很可能会竭尽全力帮助塔利班将华盛顿控制在阿富汗，阻止其集中精力帮助乌克兰。”这是有道理的。但美国的形象无疑受到了损害。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">智库欧洲外交关系委员会2月份进行的一项民意调查发现，超过61%的俄罗斯人和中国人、51%的土耳其人和48%的印度人预计世界要么是多极化，要么是中国主导。在 2016 年 1 月的最后一次国情咨文演讲中，时任美国总统巴拉克·奥巴马 (Barack Obama) 坚称，“在每一个重要的国际问题上，世界人民不会指望北京或莫斯科来领导——他们在呼唤我们。”七年过去了，事情已经不再那么清晰了。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这一切的结果就是一种混乱感。美国及其盟国面临越来越大的威胁。俄罗斯和中国看到了机遇。中等强国受到大国的追捧，但对世界贸易组织和联合国等机构日益功能失调感到担忧，他们看到了两者。 “一种无政府状态正在渗透到国际关系中，”曾任印度外交大臣兼国家安全顾问的希夫尚卡尔·梅农(Shivshankar Menon)在去年发表的一篇文章中写道。他解释说，这“不是严格意义上的无政府状态，而是缺乏中央组织原则或霸权”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其他几个趋势加剧了这种趋势。一是<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/04/19/in-sudan-and-beyond-the-trend-towards-global-peace-has-been-reversed">气候危机</a>，它增加了世界许多地区发生冲突的风险，并通过绿色转型创造了新的竞争来源，例如对风力涡轮机和电动汽车至关重要的关键材料的竞争。另一个是技术变革的步伐不断加快，人工智能以指数级的速度进步，并带来不可预测的后果。第三个是全球化，它以新的方式将危机交织在一起。例如，台湾战争将对半导体行业造成严重破坏，从而对世界经济造成严重破坏。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">第四是民族主义和民粹主义的高涨，影响了解决所有这些全球性问题的努力。最近辞去五角大楼政策负责人职务的科林·卡尔 (Colin Kahl) 和拜登国家安全委员会高级官员托马斯·赖特 (Thomas Wright) 在 2021 年出版的一本书中指出，在新冠肺炎 (covid-19) 大流行期间，各国紧急采取行动，国际合作陷入停顿。关闭边界并保护自己。 “出于所有实际目的，七国集团已不复存在，”他们指出。 “流行病政治最终对旧的国际秩序造成了最后的打击。”</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">从黎明到黎明</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">新的世界秩序使美国及其盟国的机构能力面临压力，同时也使它们的军事能力捉襟见肘。首先考虑制度压力。哈德利先生认为，冷战是一个“有组织的世界”。他承认存在全球性挑战，但许多挑战都是更大的超级大国斗争的子集。 “对于冷战后的国家安全顾问来说，”他说，“这更像是在一个有八个燃烧器的炉子上做饭，每个燃烧器都有一个锅，每个锅都快要沸腾了。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一个更多危机同时发生的世界给负责管理危机的领导人和外交官带来了两种挑战。一是同时扑救多处火灾的战术问题。一位前英国高级外交官表示，危机往往会产生集中效应，首相或总统亲自负责处理原本可能分散在外交部和国防部的问题。即使在大国和强大的国家，官僚的带宽也可能非常有限。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">深陷危机的外交官常常认为自己的时代异常混乱。 2009年至2014年担任欧盟事实上的外交部长的凯瑟琳·阿什顿男爵夫人指出，她同时处理阿拉伯之春、伊朗核计划和塞尔维亚-科索沃争端。 “我记得很清楚，当乌克兰危机开始时，”她指的是 2014 年基辅的一场革命，“我只是不知道我们是否有足够的带宽来应对这一切。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">问题之一是竞争已经转变为冲突。乌克兰战争对外交的影响尤其严重。阿什顿男爵夫人回忆说，2014年乌克兰危机爆发时，她在维也纳与伊朗进行核谈判的谈判小组中就包括俄罗斯副外长。她将前往基辅谴责俄罗斯的干涉，他将前往莫斯科谴责欧盟。 “然后我们会飞回来，大家坐下来继续进行伊朗谈判。”这种快速的划分现在是不可能的。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国国家安全委员会的运作十分简陋，部分原因是国会不愿意资助白宫工作人员。在 2016 年发表的一篇文章中，现任美国驻<small>北约</small>特使朱丽安·史密斯 (Julianne Smith) 回忆起自己在拜登担任副总统时担任副国家安全顾问的经历。 “典型的一天通常会涉及四到六个小时的连续会议，讨论从叙利亚到网络安全再到朝鲜的任何问题”，然后每天处理 150 到 500 封电子邮件。 “我的计划能力、思考能力超出第二天在办公室的能力，或者显着加深我对任何单一问题的了解的能力几乎不存在。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对高级官员在危机中代表国家的期望往往会给少数人带来巨大压力。过去六周里，美国国务卿安东尼·布林肯几乎每时每刻都在中东各国首都之间穿梭。他最近从中东飞往东京，参加<small>七国集团</small>外长会议，然后飞往印度，最后飞往旧金山。沙利文先生的分布也很薄弱。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">笔和剑</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">即使外交官能够成功地扭转多个局面，危机的同时发生也会给军事力量带来更大的战略问题。当前的中东危机表明，军事力量是一种稀缺资源，就像外交带宽一样。即使在最近几年，五角大楼官员也会吹嘘说，在阿富汗和伊拉克进行了二十年的平叛之后，他们终于将海军力量从中东重新平衡到了亚洲。现在，在事件的压力下，这一趋势正在逆转。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 11月4日，<i>艾森豪威尔号航空母舰</i>及其护航舰进入红海，这是美国航空母舰两年来首次在中东活动。早些时候与<i>杰拉尔德·R·福特号航空母舰</i>进行的演习标志着一次异常大规模的武力展示。如果加沙战争持续下去或扩大，美国海军可能需要做出选择：是留在原地、在包括亚洲在内的世界其他地区制造差距，还是鼓励伊朗。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">与此同时，西方官员越来越认为乌克兰战争可能会再拖五年，俄罗斯和乌克兰都不准备屈服，但也无力打破僵局。随着2020年代的到来，红灯开始闪烁。许多美国情报官员和一些亚洲情报官员认为，中国攻击台湾的风险在本十年末的一个窗口期达到最大。太早了，中国还没有准备好。为时已晚，中国面临着人口下降和新一代西方军事技术的前景。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">即使没有战争，西方的军事能力在未来几年也将面临巨大压力。乌克兰战争提醒我们，大规模战争消耗了多少弹药，也提醒我们西方的军械库及其补给手段到底有多么贫乏。美国正在大幅增加 155 毫米炮弹的产量。即便如此，其2025年的产量也可能低于俄罗斯2024年的产量。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">乌克兰和加沙的战争说明了这些压力。以色列和乌克兰正在打两种不同类型的战争。乌克兰需要远程导弹来打击克里米亚，需要装甲车来让步兵在弹片面前前进，需要排雷装备来穿透广阔的雷区。以色列希望空投智能炸弹，包括掩体破坏者和铁穹防空系统的拦截器，这些炸弹的发射速度惊人。但也存在重叠。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">去年，美国动用了以色列储存的炮弹来武装乌克兰。十月，它不得不将一些飞往乌克兰的炮弹转移到以色列。两国还使用爱国者导弹防御系统，该系统可以拦截飞机和更大的导弹。中东其他盟国也是如此：10 月 19 日，沙特阿拉伯使用爱国者炮台拦截从也门发射、飞往以色列的导弹。由于俄罗斯储存导弹数月之久，对乌克兰电网发动持续攻击，乌克兰拦截弹的消耗量可能会在冬季大幅上升。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国或许可以暂时满足它的两个朋友。最近几周，法国和德国都承诺增加对乌克兰的援助。但如果其中一场战争——或者两场战争——持续下去，就会出现困难。华盛顿智库战略与国际研究中心的马克·坎西恩（Mark Cancian）写道：“随着时间的推移，某些关键系统将被转移到以色列，因此将会出现权衡。” “乌克兰反攻所需的一些系统可能无法达到乌克兰想要的数量。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">更大的问题是，实际上，美国无法同时武装自己和盟友。约翰·霍普金斯大学的伊斯坎德尔·雷曼在最近一篇关于旷日持久的战争的论文中指出：“如果<small>美国的</small>生产线已经难以跟上武装乌克兰的紧急情况，那么一旦发生真正的旷日持久的、同等水平的战争，它们将完全不堪重负。”与中国这样的对手发生冲突。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这些挑战表明美国国防战略中存在更深层次的紧张局势。从1992年起，美国军事规划者坚持所谓的“两次战争”标准。美国武装部队必须做好准备，同时应对两场针对地区大国（例如伊拉克或伊朗）的中型战争，而不仅仅是一场大规模战争。 2018年，特朗普政府将其改为“一场战争”标准：实际上，承诺能够在欧洲或亚洲打一场战争，但不能同时在两地打仗。拜登政府坚持这种做法。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其目的是向五角大楼灌输纪律，并使目的与手段相一致：美国的国防预算按实际价值计算几乎持平，而中国的国防开支却在飙升。但批评者认为，风险在于，一战标准会诱使敌人开辟第二条战线，从而迫使美国要么做出让步，要么采取核威胁等不具吸引力的选择。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">盘子太多</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国及其盟友在外交和军事领域如此广泛的扩张会带来哪些风险？如果乌克兰战争在欧洲仍然是一个开放性的疮口，而中东仍然火热，那么一旦另一场严重危机爆发，西方将陷入严重困境。一种风险是，对手只是利用其他地方的混乱来达到自己的目的。例如，如果美国陷入太平洋战争，伊朗肯定会更有信心通过发展核武器来摆脱困境。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">更令人担忧的是积极串通的前景。欧洲军事规划者重视俄罗斯可能在台湾危机期间采取威胁行动的可能性，以转移美国的注意力并束缚其盟友，阻止他们在亚洲伸出援手。与冷战时期一样，每一次危机，无论多么狭隘或微不足道，都可能被视为对美国或中国实力的考验，从而吸引每个国家参与其中。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然后就是惊喜。西方情报机构正全力监视中国和俄罗斯。很少有人预计哈马斯会像 10 月 7 日那样让中东重新陷入混乱。尽管俄罗斯在萨赫勒地区的影响力不断增强，但刚果民主共和国、马里、缅甸、索马里和苏丹的内战和叛乱在外交上都被忽视了。与此同时，11 月 10 日，数十艘中国船只包围了菲律宾船只，其中一艘试图向南海仁爱礁（中国声称拥有该礁）的前哨基地补给，并用水炮轰击其中一艘。如果对抗恶化，美国与菲律宾的防务条约条款可能会迫使其进行干预。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在混乱中，战略家们谈论“走路和嚼口香糖”的重要性。这是一个独特的美国比喻，曾经指的是同时执行两项琐碎的活动，现在解释了地缘政治多任务处理的重要性。其他可用。历史学家拉琴科在他即将出版的新书《统治世界》中引用了中国总理周恩来的话，指出了 1964 年美国的困境：“如果非洲再多几个刚果，亚洲再多几个越南，在拉丁美洲再多几个古巴，那么美国就得向另外十个地方伸出十个手指……我们可以把他们一一砍掉。”</p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 13 Nov 2023 18:38:58 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

<i>《经济学人</i>》自己的计算显示，根据我们掌握的可靠数据，富裕国家的移民数量在 15 年来以最快的速度增长（见图 1）。在<small>经合组织</small>中，大约 10% 的人生活在他们并非出生的国家。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs

e190yofl0">希望移民的人数在未来几年只会增加。一些人担心气候变化可能引发人口外流。从富裕国家的角度来看，更大的担忧涉及人口结构：随着年龄的增长，他们将需要更多的进口劳动力。几十年来，富裕国家群的净移民占总人口的比例高于净出生人口的比例（见图2）。近 1500 万德国居民（占总人口的 18%）是第一代移民，这一比例高于 1890 年美国鼎盛时期的比例。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">不同的定义</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">监管边境的官员正在努力应对这种情况，更不用说试图穿越边境的移民了。部分问题在于，人们移民旅程的复杂性模糊了国际法严格维护的区别。它是在难民（那些由于“有充分理由担心受到迫害”而无法返回原籍国并通过庇护系统寻求帮助的人）和其他移民之间进行的。去年在<small>经合组织</small>国家申请庇护的人数达到创纪录的200万人。紧张局势加剧是因为任何抵达 1951 年<small>《联合国</small>难民公约》签署国的人都可以提出庇护申请。这阻碍了政府降低新移民数量的努力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果一个逃离苦难的人也想要一份工作会怎样？有组织的劳动力移民计划规模太小，无法管理移民劳动力的供应或需求。这可能使庇护系统成为移民进入国家而不存在立即被驱逐出境风险的唯一渠道之一。由于资金不足和不堪重负，许多人都陷入了困境。富裕国家发现自己陷入了困境：如何平衡受人口结构和劳动力市场紧张困扰的经济体的需求与微妙的移民和庇护政治？</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">教会与国家</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">所有这些困难都在美国表现出来。截至 9 月份的一年内，有创纪录的 240 万移民在南部边境被捕。该国的庇护制度已经摇摇欲坠。它积压了 200 万个案件，平均需要四年的时间来处理每个案件。 “我们没有向移民法官、庇护官员以及那些决定你抓到的人是否可以留下来的人投入资金，”曾在布什和奥巴马政府的国土安全部任职的特蕾莎·布朗说。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">了解抵达者的构成如何发生变化，可以揭示推动移民前往该国的艰辛。如今，立即向边境官员投降的家庭所占的比例比过去高得多。上个月，委内瑞拉人首次超过墨西哥人，成为在边境被捕的移民中人数最多的国籍。他们是尼古拉斯·马杜罗独裁政权的流亡者。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">何塞·卡斯蒂略（José Castillo）就是其中之一，他住在圣地亚哥的一个教堂庇护所里。当他和其他移民每天外出寻找工作时，他们会将自己的物品装进垃圾袋，堆放在花园的帐篷下。圣母玛利亚的雕像矗立着。卡斯蒂略先生将妻子和两个年幼的女儿留在了法尔孔州，然后在墨西哥北部的蒙特雷等待了几个月，通过<small>CBP</small> One 手机应用程序与美国海关和边境保护局进行庇护预约。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">该应用程序试图引导移民走上合法途径，并减少拥挤在美国南部边境的潜在移民人数。但数字却让其管理陷入困境。去年推出的另一项计划为来自拉丁美洲和加勒比地区的某些拥有私人赞助商的公民提供两年的居留权，最初减少了来自这些国家的边境入境人数。但事实也证明它不足以满足需求。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国紧张的劳动力市场——有 960 万个职位空缺——对移民来说是一个明显的吸引力。卡斯蒂略先生是一名机械师，他解释说，他在加州一天赚的钱比在家里几个月赚的钱还要多。加州大学圣地亚哥分校名誉教授韦恩·科尼利厄斯认为，现在是移民在美国寻找工作的最佳时机。 9月，拜登政府临时允许近50万委内瑞拉移民合法居留和工作。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这样做的部分原因是为了减轻像纽约这样陷入困境的城市政府的负担，纽约政府希望给予寻求庇护者工作的权利，以便他们能够负担得起住房。但共和党人和民主党人也都发现了填补劳动力缺口的机会。美国的正式就业移民计划远远不足以满足公司对工人（无论是高技能工人还是其他工人）的需求。<small>美国</small>商会估计，到 2024 年，每 10 名申请人中只有 1 人获得<small>H-1B</small>技术工作签证。 “政策辩论几乎完全没有考虑到劳动力市场的现实，”科尼利厄斯教授认为。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">不过，如果您认为美国看起来很糟糕，请尝试欧洲。政客们再次在非法移民问题上互相争斗。整个原本无需护照的申根区已重新实施边境检查。各国政府正在重启离岸处理等可疑想法：本周，意大利右翼政府对一项协议表示欢迎，该协议将使阿尔巴尼亚接收一些寻求庇护者。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">欧洲的困难比美国更深，因为它不是一个统一的权威。无论将寻求庇护者分布在成员国之间看起来多么合理，一国或另一国政府总是会拒绝。<small>欧盟</small>的共同庇护制度确实制定了共同标准，但各国政府却小心翼翼地捍卫自己做出庇护裁决的权利。即使是备受诟病的“都柏林”制度，根据该制度，寻求庇护者应该被遣返回他们最初登记的<small>欧盟</small>国家，但在这种违规行为中，也基本上得到了尊重。去年，德国仅将其认为符合都柏林规定资格的寻求庇护者的 6% 遣返回其他<small>欧盟</small>国家。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">困难在于欧洲也急需工人。瓦伦·库马尔·贾恩 (Varun Kumar Jain) 的故事很有启发性。 2017年，他离开家乡印度东部的比哈尔邦前往华沙。他厌倦了比哈尔邦的酷热，同时也被波兰首都在他的领域缺乏竞争对手所吸引：印度烹饪。他很快就能将旅游签证转化为工作许可证。在一家印度餐厅里熬煮和切菜四年后，他刚刚开了自己的餐厅。他的孩子们在一所波兰学校上学，他则在该国唯一的锡克教寺庙上学。尽管存在强烈的反移民言论，但劳动力匮乏的波兰政府仍然导致此类移民大幅增长。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">回到旧大陆</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">老龄化的欧洲将需要更多的外国工人，以满足其人口结构不断增长的劳动力市场需求。其中位年龄为 44 岁，明显高于美国的 39 岁。据一项估计，<small>欧盟</small>需要在未来 25 年内引进 5000 万人，才能保持人口稳定。随着劳动力短缺的加剧，富裕国家将加剧对移民的竞争，不仅是高技能移民，欧洲对护理人员、卡车司机和木匠的需求也巨大。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img width="608" sizes="300px"

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管移民不能解决一个国家的人口困难（因为移民也会变老），但它可以控制抚养比（经济上依赖于工作年龄成年人的倍数）的变化速度。这对欧洲至关重要（见图 3）。<small>联合国</small>移民机构国际移民组织总干事艾米·波普表示：“如果管理得当，今天成为替罪羊的流动人口明天将受到热烈追捧。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">欧洲毗邻一个经济和政治现实迫使人们离开的地方。非洲的平均年龄为 19 岁。在整个非洲大陆，每年进入劳动力市场的 1000 万至 1200 万非洲人只能提供 300 万个正式工作岗位。大多数非洲移民在非洲大陆内流动，南非道路两旁的求职者游行就证明了这一点。第二批人，尤其是东非的人，在海湾石油国家赚取了体面的收入，尽管他们的许多公民权利受到损害。但越来越多的人前往欧洲，而且随着非洲变得更加富裕，更多人将获得这样做的手段。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">未来的旅程</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">未能在申请人之间做出适当裁决会削弱公众对所有形式移民的支持，特别是当劳务移民是通过庇护系统引导时。可以想象一种更理性的前进方式。需要资源充足的庇护系统以及量身定制的劳务移民计划，使新移民能够快速进入劳动力市场。这些内容应该足以改变人们原本计划进行未经授权的旅行的动机。但很难想象这样的计划能够规模大到足以容纳所有可能想要移民的人。德国外交关系委员会的移民专家维多利亚·里蒂格（Victoria Rietig）表示：“我对通过增加合法移民来减少非正常移民的重大承诺表示怀疑，因为我们创造的是小的法律涓滴，而不是大的法律途径。”柏林的研究机构。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">加拿大和澳大利亚提供了有趣的例子。这两个富裕国家都保持公众对极高移民率的支持（尽管并非没有麻烦）。去年，加拿大迎来了 100 万新移民，人口增长了近 3%。它占全球难民重新安置（直接将弱势难民转移到富裕国家）的 42%。澳大利亚又占了15%。但很难从他们的经验中推断出来。他们的地理位置帮助他们保持控制，这反过来又降低了其他人前来的动力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">事实上，管理移民的巨大困难导致了官方的扭曲。一方面，对庇护人数感到不安的政策制定者很乐意支持潜在的非法政策，例如海上抵制。另一方面，各国政府越来越开放地欢迎寻求庇护者进入劳动力市场。这可以采取明确的形式：德国一些州以“日益严重的劳动力短缺”为由，寻求给予寻求庇护者立即开始工作的权利，而不是花几个月的时间参加语言和融合课程。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但更常见的是，政府忽视了劳动力市场一体化。由于无法应对，不堪重负的庇护系统将申请人推入了法律困境。从那里，许多人会找到账外的工作，并希望他们的身份能够得到正规化；例如，在美国，很少有寻求庇护者要等待法律要求的 180 天或更长时间才能合法找到工作。最终，他们将能够获得社会保障号码和工作许可证，甚至在移民身份最终确定之前就正式进入劳动力市场。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">挫败感正在导致其他政府走上艰难的道路。 Confronted with unmanageable numbers of so-called spontaneous arrivals, some are increasingly reluctant to accept refugees via formal, often <small>UN</small> -organised resettlement. In 1980 America accepted over 200,000 resettled refugees; last year it took in just 25,000. </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="意大利萨莱诺港，一名红十字志愿者帮助一名在吉奥巴伦支河跳板上下船的妇女" width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_IRP002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_IRP002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_IRP002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_IRP002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_IRP002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_IRP002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_IRP002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_IRP002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_IRP002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_IRP002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-nggv6j edweubf0">A welcome of sorts</span> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some on the political right have suggested rewriting or even tearing up the <small>UN</small> ’s Refugee Convention. Progressives, meanwhile, worry that the convention&#39;s provisions, not seriously revised for over 50 years, are too narrow to encompass those fleeing violent crime and extreme poverty—in parts of Central America or the Caribbean, for example. Yet it is by no means certain that a better agreement would emerge from the ashes of the old one, notes Elizabeth Collett, a global fellow based in Australia working for the Migration Policy Institute, an American think-tank. Merely to open the discussion could in fact lead to the removal of what protections there are for refugees.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Muddling through with a smarter set of tools is the most practical bet.各国政府恢复公众对庇护系统的信心并阻止未来难民到来的主要希望是表明他们有能力驱逐无权留在该国的人。 Mr Biden has recently (and not without controversy) resumed deporting Venezuelans. Facing a resurgent far right, Olaf Scholz, Germany&#39;s chancellor, has been touring African countries seeking return agreements to fulfil his promise to “deport people more often, and faster”. A new <small>EU</small> proposal would see some asylum cases fully adjudicated within 12 weeks, with claimants held near borders. Last year slightly fewer than half of all asylum decisions across the <small>EU</small> were positive (although some appeals are successful). That leaves hundreds of thousands of claimants notionally eligible for deportation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Securing return deals requires a deft deployment of diplomatic carrots (development aid, formal migration partnerships) and sticks (withdrawals of visa or trade privileges), notes Ms Rietig. In the past readmission agreements on paper rarely translated into movements of people. Big countries with which Europe needs to maintain strategic relationships can be difficult to impress with sweeteners or credibly threaten with sanctions. In 2017 Nigeria rejected <small>EU</small> inducements to take back its people on the grounds that Turkey struck a better deal a year earlier. And agreements with bullying Europeans can prove extremely unpopular.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Unless governments can improve their asylum systems, they will feel obliged to keep striking dodgy deals with neighbouring autocrats that leave them exposed to political racketeering. The <small>EU</small> ’s €6bn ($6.4bn) migration agreement with Turkey in 2016 was a desperate, and largely successful, attempt to block a repeat of the 2015 migration crisis, which scarred Europe. Despite supposedly falling through, a recent €1bn deal with Tunisia, a popular departure point for Europe, does seem to have reduced migrant numbers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the absence of fully open borders, there will always be inducements for migrants to attempt unauthorised journeys. No policy alone can expect to reduce numbers dramatically. But the right combination might draw the political sting from migration and so create the space for more generous labour-migration and refugee policies alike. “Here&#39;s the thing no one wants to hear,” says Ms Rietig. “Migration is not a problem to be solved, but a reality we can only hope to manage.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 14:01:38 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/egpj706n7gk7l0qiue9ecfia214it9q8</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/11/09/why-migration-is-in-such-a-mess-once-more </item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel is more popular than social-media posts suggest]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1y6lujj e1ey6m750"><figure class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"></figure><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span>I</span> <small>f you scroll</small> through a typical x (formerly Twitter) feed, it looks like sympathy for Israel following last month&#39;s attacks has dried up.

In polls of people in Denmark, France, Spain and Sweden, Israel drew more total sympathy, but young participants&#39; opinions matched social-media ratios.

That is certainly the sense in which <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/10/how-powerful-is-hamas">Hamas</a> uses the phrase. The children chanting it at the base of Nelson&#39;s column in London on October 21st, during a big pro-Palestinian march, may not have grasped the menace. But several marchers who were yelling the words, or bearing them on placards, seemed aware of it, clamming up defensively when asked to explain them.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Anyone who&#39;s paying attention knows exactly what that means,” says<b> </b>Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League, an American anti-hate group which, like watchdogs in Britain and elsewhere, has documented a steep rise in antisemitic incidents since <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/08/the-lessons-from-hamass-assault-on-israel">Hamas&#39;s bloody raid</a> on Israel on October 7th. (Islamophobic incidents have multiplied in several countries, too.) The ubiquity of this deceptively hardline mantra points up an important shift in Western attitudes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Three related forces are driving it: technology, demography and ideology.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Western left once sympathised with Zionism. That changed markedly after the six-day war of 1967 and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Especially since the end of apartheid in South Africa, the <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/23/can-the-palestinian-authority-control-gaza-if-hamas-is-ousted">Palestinian</a> cause has been a talismanic issue for left-leaning Westerners. Why it acquired this status is a matter of debate. In some analyses, Israel serves as an avatar for American power, or for bygone colonial struggles. Jewish groups and others have wondered why the casualties in, say, Syria or Afghanistan—where the perpetrators as well as the victims are Muslim—stir less <i>bien-pensant</i> concern.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> After a period in which the issue receded in prominence in Western diplomacy and headlines, Gaza&#39;s plight is now inspiring protests and disputes as never before. A glut of open letters by artists and other luminaries have decried Israel&#39;s bombardment and Western leaders&#39; acquiescence to it. (Counter-petitions mourn the atrocities of October 7th and affirm Israel&#39;s right to self-defence.) Pro-Palestinian rallies have been held in many cities, including some where they were notionally banned.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The recriminations flow both ways. In Britain the <small>BBC</small> ’s reluctance to refer to Hamas as “terrorists” led to an outcry and a partial climbdown. Dave Chappelle, an American comedian, reportedly had a spat with punters at a gig in Boston after he lamented the crisis in Gaza. Some American students have been hounded for their stridently anti-Israel views; talks by Palestinian authors have been cancelled. Palestine Legal, which supports pro-Palestinian activists in America, says they are “facing a wave of McCarthyite backlash targeting their livelihoods and careers”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Silence is violence”, runs another popular protest slogan, a position taken by some on all sides. A range of institutions, from universities to unions, have been berated for the wording of their public statements, or for failing to issue one. Calls for peace have been likened to appeasement. And supporters of both Israel and the Palestinians make analogies with Ukraine to show the supposed hypocrisy of the opposing camp. Backers of the Palestinians see Gaza as the victim (like Ukraine) of invasion by a bullying neighbour. Pro-Israelis point to Hamas&#39;s incursion and liken its barbarity to Russian war crimes.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The polarised passions and viral slogans are in part a sharp manifestation of the echo-chamber effect of social media. Millions of people have watched footage of Hamas&#39;s depredations in horror. Many others are transfixed instead by images of Gaza&#39;s agony. In Germany, for instance, where a synagogue has been firebombed and Stars of David daubed on Jewish homes, some Islamists exist in “parallel societies”, relying on digital and overseas news, says Felix Klein, the federal commissioner for antisemitism. So, he adds, do many on the far right, which commits most of the country&#39;s antisemitic crimes. (There, as in America, the two groups have made common cause online.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Worse, the heart-rending clips and pictures sometimes come from the wrong country or the wrong war, or even from video games. Like the echo-chamber effect, online disinformation is a familiar problem that has seemed as acute as ever in the ongoing crisis.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The blast at the Ahli Arab hospital on October 17th was a supreme example of the reach and clout of falsehoods. Swiftly picked up by major news outfits, misleading reports contributed, in short order, to the cancelling of a summit between Arab leaders and President Joe Biden. Demand for disinformation, reckons Peter Pomerantsev of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, is an even bigger problem than supply. In wartime, “people are looking for reasons to confirm their biases,” he says glumly. “It isn&#39;t about the facts.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Screen habits encourage another striking feature of reactions to the war: the “gamification” of news, whereby irony and taboo-busting are prized, even amid the gravest calamities. The paragliders on which some Hamas murderers flew to Israel were, for a few onlookers, irresistibly meme-worthy. Black Lives Matter Chicago briefly posted an image of a paraglider with the words, “I stand with Palestine.” “From Chicago to Gaza,” runs another of its messages, “from the river to the sea.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As for demography: immigration is one factor skewing the culture war in the West over the tragic one in the Middle East. Muslim populations in Western countries are both growing and changing in composition. In the past, notes Yunus Ulusoy of the Centre for Turkish Studies and Integration Research in Essen, the Muslim population in Germany was of predominantly Turkish origin. Now, he says, around 2.1m Muslims in the country have roots in Syria, Iraq and other places that are hostile to Israel. They brought their views of the conflict with them—shaped, says Mr Ulusoy, by a sense of solidarity with the <i>ummah</i> , or global Muslim community.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Awareness of Nazism and the Holocaust, which for decades coloured German attitudes to Israel and antisemitism, is waning. Some Muslims, says Professor Julia Bernstein of the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences, think this awful past “is not our history”, and that they are now the real victims of prejudice in Germany.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> France, notes Dominique Moïsi, an eminent French commentator, is home to both the largest Muslim population in western Europe and the biggest Jewish one. It has a traumatic recent history of Islamist terrorism, and a more distant one of collaboration with the Nazis, both of which tend to bolster support for Israel. But it also harbours contrary strains of anti-Americanism and guilt over French colonialism in the Arab world. The result, says Mr Moïsi, is a “conflict of memories” that plays out in politics and on the streets.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In America, the most influential depiction of Israel in popular culture is probably “Exodus”. A novel by Leon Uris published in 1958, it dramatises the birth of the state and became a film starring Paul Newman. (“As a piece of propaganda,” said David Ben-Gurion, Israel&#39;s first prime minister, “Exodus” was “the greatest thing ever written” about the country.) Overall, Americans remain much more supportive of Israel than are Europeans. Polls conducted since October 7th show a hardening of support for it among Democrats in particular. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_IRC194.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_IRC194.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_IRC194.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_IRC194.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_IRC194.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_IRC194.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_IRC194.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_IRC194.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_IRC194.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_IRC194.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_IRC194.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_IRC194.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_IRC194.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_IRC194.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_IRC194.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_IRC194.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_IRC194.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">But there is an important demographic wrinkle. As Tim Malloy, a polling analyst at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, says, younger Americans are much less inclined to back Israel than are their elders. They also think more favourably of the Palestinian people.<b> </b>According to surveys by Pew, this gap in sympathy between American generations is widening (see chart).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Many young voters do not have direct memories of the attacks of September 11th 2001, a calamity which shaped older Americans&#39; views of Islamist terrorists such as Hamas. Their diverging outlook also reflects the third force swaying Western attitudes: a binary ideology that emerged from American universities to win converts far and wide.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Beyond good and evil</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Seeing the world in Manichean terms can be comforting. It turns confounding issues into simple clashes of good and evil, conferring a halo of virtue on those who pick the right side. As Yascha Mounk, author of “The Identity Trap”, argues, the emerging ideology offers just this form of comfort, sorting the world into opposing categories—coloniser and colonised, oppressors and oppressed—often along racial lines. In essence it transposes the terms of American debates over race onto other places and problems. “The American brand of anti-colonialism”, quips Mr Mounk, “is astonishingly colonialist.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In a polarised age, lots of people infer their opinions from their political allegiance rather than the other way round. This, thinks Mr Mounk, is part of the new ideology&#39;s appeal: it furnishes an all-purpose vocabulary to apply to any conflict. In this schema, the powerless can do no wrong, least of all to the powerful—and nobody can be both. Liberation movements of all kinds are linked, as communist insurgencies purported to be during the cold war. As flares in the colours of the Palestinian flag were set off at Piccadilly Circus, a protester in London holding a<b> </b>“Queers for Palestine” sign explained that “All the struggles are connected.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This philosophy is tailor-made for the posturing and character-limits of social-media posts, perhaps one reason it is gaining adherents. But it prohibits the balance and nuanced judgments that intractable real-world hostilities demand.特别是，由于巴勒斯坦人被认为是无能为力的，而以色列被认为是强大的，因此以色列人不能成为受害者。 Never mind the exile of Mizrahi Jews from Arab countries to Israel. The Holocaust is ancient history.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The schema shows up glaringly in references to Hamas&#39;s crimes as a form of “resistance” or “decolonisation”, and in the statement by some Harvard students that held Israel “entirely responsible” for the slaughter of its own citizens. Many Jews, in Israel and the diaspora, perceive a wider disregard for Israel&#39;s suffering—not just less sympathy than it received during, say, the<b> </b>Entebbe hostage crisis of 1976, but a void. If the issue is morally simple, meanwhile, for many Western activists the remedy is blunt and drastic: not the two-state solution of yore, but a Palestine that stretches “from the river to the sea”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the left-leaning political elite, the picture is starkly different. Both Mr Biden and Sir Keir Starmer, leader of Britain&#39;s opposition Labour Party, have offered Israel staunch support. All the same, the escalation in some rank-and-file attitudes to the war may have a lasting fallout—both in the Middle East and in the West. Mr Biden, Sir Keir and other leaders have been lambasted by some in their parties for declining to call for a ceasefire. This disapproval—often motivated by natural compassion for Palestinian civilians rather than ideology—may cost them votes, Muslim and otherwise, in what may be tight elections next year. (Mr Biden may have weighed that risk against the potentially higher cost of supporting a ceasefire.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That may not be the only form of political blowback. Plenty of liberal voters are dismayed by the responses of people with whom, in the past, they felt broadly aligned. Their coalition with more radical voters was already under pressure; for some liberals, the bedrock of common values that they thought underpinned it seems to have crumbled. If the debate over Gaza has been a symptom of polarisation in the West, it may yet prove to be a cause of realignment, too.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The consequences for Israel and the Middle East are unpredictable. At least in the short term, revulsion for Hamas seems to outweigh any qualms Americans might have had before the war over Israel&#39;s rightward lurch under Binyamin Netanyahu. Most Americans, including most Democrats, tell pollsters that supporting Israel is in American interests. How far and how long that remains the case depends on a series of unknowns—starting with the conduct and outcome of the ground invasion of Gaza, and the new dispensation that may follow. Developments in domestic politics will matter, including the fervour of the Republican embrace of isolationism.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> From an Israeli point of view, though, the long-term trajectory of opinion in America is worrying. And in Europe, as the second world war recedes from living memory and the clout of Muslim voters grows, support for Israel may continue to soften, especially on the left.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even as the disaster in Israel and Gaza unfolds, one of its morals is already clear. Amid the unchecked flow of images and ideas, Western public opinion and geopolitical conflicts are entangled in new and explosive ways. Culture wars and real wars are no longer separate struggles. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 10:58:23 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/v6svr34ra6fpdvv1nv6lk5u38149sk9b</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/28/the-culture-war-over-the-gaza-war </item><item><title><![CDATA[The three steps on America’s ladder of military escalation]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-aasbfu e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>O PARAPHRASE AN</small> observation attributed to Leon Trotsky, you may not be interested in the Middle East but the Middle East is interested in you. After a decade of tapering down its military presence in the region, <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/09/hamass-carnage-upends-joe-bidens-plans-for-the-middle-east">America is back</a> with a huge display of force. In the past few days two fighter squadrons have flown in. They follow the deployment of two aircraft-carrier strike groups, multiple air-defence systems and much aid to Israel. More units have been told to prepare to deploy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <a href="https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2023/10/13/what-should-americas-middle-east-strategy-be-now">America&#39;s goal</a> is to deter attacks on American interests, on Israel and to a degree on its Arab allies. But what if deterrence fails? The daunting possibilities range from attacks against American soldiers to strikes on shipping in the Persian Gulf and rocket attacks that overwhelm Israel&#39;s air defences. Under what circumstances would America&#39;s forces then be used? And could it be dragged into a deeper Middle East war of the kind its leaders hoped would never happen again after the hell of the forever wars in Iraq and Afghanistan?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Those questions are both uncomfortable and all too real. Attacks on American interests have been proliferating even as Israel&#39;s invasion of Gaza has been delayed. Between October 17th and 24th there were 13 strikes on American and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria by drones and rockets, the Pentagon says. They came from “Iranian proxy forces and ultimately from Iran”. Such activity has been fairly common in recent years. But these strikes are significant because they break an informal truce that had held in recent months.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America&#39;s verbal warnings have become fierce. “If Iran or its proxies attack <small>US</small> personnel anywhere, make no mistake: we will defend our people, we will defend our security, swiftly and decisively,” Antony Blinken, secretary of state, told the UN on October 24th. A day later leaders from the militant groups Hamas, Hizbullah and Islamic Jihad met in person in Beirut, pledging to “achieve a real victory for the resistance”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> If America has to use force it has a wide range of options. The <i><small>USS</small> Gerald R. Ford</i> , in the Mediterranean, is its most advanced carrier, commissioned only six years ago. With more than 75 aircraft and electromagnetic launch gear it can maintain a high tempo of sorties. The Nimitz-class <i><small>USS</small> Dwight D. Eisenhower</i> , steaming to the Gulf, carries a similar range of air assets. Both carriers are escorted by up to five destroyers with Aegis air-defence radars and missile interceptors that could be used to protect Israel and the Gulf states.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> They augment some 30,000 American military personnel in bases in the region, which are being bolstered by 2,000 marines. More marines may come. Bahrain is the home of the Fifth Fleet, and the biggest air base is at Al Udeid in Qatar. America is supplementing its ground-based air defence with Patriot and <small>THAAD</small> missile batteries. The latter have a long-range radar system that can peer deep into hostile territory.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> How might these forces be used? There are probably three sequential rungs on America&#39;s ladder of escalation: intelligence-gathering, defensive action and offensive action. Start with intelligence-gathering, which is already under way. The carriers are massive information-collecting platforms. The <i>Gerald R. Ford</i> has four <small>EA-18G</small> Growler electronic-warfare planes, four early-warning <small>E-2D</small> Hawkeyes and various helicopters and drones. Just as <small>NATO</small> aircraft are active in the Black Sea, hoovering up intelligence <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/24/can-america-handle-two-wars-and-maybe-a-third">for Ukraine</a> , American planes are probably flying up and down the coasts of Lebanon, Israel and Gaza, gathering signals that are then relayed to the Pentagon, the Israel Defence Forces and, perhaps, Arab allies.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> If deterrence fails, the next rung on America&#39;s ladder of escalation is defensive action, which is still relatively easy to justify to the American public. There is already one example: On October 19th a navy destroyer intercepted missiles fired from Yemen, apparently by Iran-backed Houthi rebels targeting Israel. The Pentagon revealed at a press conference on October 24th that it has assessed these missiles as having ranges in excess of 2,000km.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America is already augmenting Israel&#39;s Iron Dome air-defence system, which faces the threat of between 130,000 and 150,000 Hizbullah rockets and missiles. On October 24th America said it would send two more Iron Dome batteries to Israel. Were Israel&#39;s own air-defence systems to be overwhelmed it is likely America would augment them with its own carrier-based and land-based interception systems, though these would only be economical against larger and longer-range missiles, rather than against short-range rockets which can be brought down more cheaply using other means. America&#39;s navy could accompany commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf, and if necessary defend it against missile or drone attacks.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> After defensive action comes the third rung of the ladder, offensive action, a bigger and much more controversial step to take. The White House and Pentagon will be keen to avoid this, but their hands may be forced: having signalled it will respond to attacks, America may need to follow through to maintain a reputation for delivering swift retribution. Offensive action taken in retaliation for attacks on American forces is the easiest kind to justify. There are 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 Americans embedded with Kurdish fighters in Syria. In 2021 American fighter-bombers hit facilities used by Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria in retaliation for drone strikes on American personnel.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is fairly easy, however, to envision scenarios in which American offensive action goes further to respond to attacks on allies rather than on Americans. If Israel&#39;s air defences were overwhelmed it is possible that America might attack Hizbullah positions in Lebanon. America could also retaliate against attacks on Gulf allies. After Iran-backed attacks in 2019 on Saudi Aramco, an oil firm, which briefly shut down 5% of world oil production, Saudi Arabia was outraged that America did nothing. This time might be different.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There are more rungs on the ladder beyond intelligence, defence and basic offence. But they are ones that America will be even more reluctant to climb. Most experts believe that Iran does not want a direct war with America. Emile Hokayem of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank, reckons that assuming Iran does not see the current situation as “the Big One”—an existential fight for the Iranian regime—it will calculate that Hizbullah is too valuable an asset to waste when any element of surprise has been lost. America will probably avoid direct attacks on Iran (unless Iran enters the conflict directly itself) in order to keep further escalatory options in reserve. If American forces were to strike first, the Iranian regime might believe it had nothing left to lose.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> By deploying so much force America hopes it will be able to avoid using it. Yet, as Mr Hokayem puts it, deterrence is difficult if you do not know exactly where the red lines are of the people you are trying to deter. Those of Iran and Hizbullah are the hardest to spot. Would Israel be crossing an Iranian red line if it carried out a protracted ground offensive in Gaza? And might there be a level of Israeli strikes on targets in southern Lebanon that would provoke Hizbullah to respond more fully?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is a measure of Joe Biden&#39;s concern for how quickly things could spiral out of control that the White House has demanded a “contingency” plan for evacuating up to 600,000 American citizens living in Israel and Lebanon. The American public, still traumatised by the deaths of thousands of Americans in campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, will dislike one thing more than anything else: sending large numbers of soldiers to the Middle East. The odds of that are low but not zero. It turns out there may yet be another chapter in the forever wars. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 25 Oct 2023 18:23:43 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/3nqjbripntdt4c079lhuckl9bnkk8i55</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/25/the-three-steps-on-americas-ladder-of-military-escalation</item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel needs to resist irrational retaliation]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-aasbfu e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>“W</span> <small>E WILL OBLITERATE</small> Hamas. We will triumph. It might take time, but we will end this war stronger than ever.” The words of Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel&#39;s prime minister, are intended not only to convey resolve, but also to signal that <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/11/netanyahu-wages-war-and-fights-for-his-own-survival">his war in Gaza</a> is different. No longer is Israel aiming to punish and deter <a href="https://www.economist.com/films/2023/10/13/what-is-hamas">Hamas</a> . Now it wants to destroy it altogether.</p><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Read more on the war between Israel and Hamas</p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That is a tall order. Hamas is at the same time a religious idea, a social movement, a political party, a government and a hybrid militia wedded to terrorism. Whatever happens in Gaza, Hamas remains a powerful political force in the West Bank. In private conversations, Israeli military officials are defining the objective more narrowly: to seize the main urban centre, Gaza City; wipe out Hamas&#39;s top political and military leadership in the territory; and destroy as much of its military capacity as possible.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That might take weeks or even months of house-to-house fighting, given the extensive tunnel network beneath Gaza. In Iraq and Syria local forces backed by Western air power and thousands of Western troops spent 277 days in the streets of Mosul, and 90 in Raqqa, fighting the jihadists of Islamic State in 2017.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/15/ehud-barak-blames-binyamin-netanyahu-for-the-greatest-failure-in-israels-history">Ehud Barak</a> , a former Israeli prime minister, argues that Israel faces four constraints. Three are about the war: how to fight despite the presence of hostages, how to avoid a two-front war that draws in Lebanon&#39;s Hizbullah militia, and how to manage time given the inevitable erosion of international support as Palestinian suffering grows. A fourth concern is about the day after the fighting: “To whom can we pass the torch?” asks Mr Barak.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The last question is a fiendish problem to which Mr Netanyahu offers no answer. Hamas&#39;s onslaught on October 7th shows that Israel&#39;s policy of controlling the territory from the outside, by sealing its perimeter on land and at sea, is perilous. Yet in the past the occupation of Gaza, which is home to more than 2m people, proved too costly to maintain. Under pressure of violence from Hamas and other militias, Israel withdrew the last of its military forces and Jewish settlers from the territory in 2005.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Without a workable security and political strategy for the “day after”, any military victory may unravel. “记住阿富汗。 Remember Iraq. Remember Lebanon,” warned Mr Barak on a recent webinar by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, an American think-tank. He was referring to Israel&#39;s invasion of Lebanon in 1982, and America&#39;s invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and of Iraq in 2003. All three were provoked by acts of terrorism. All three were marked by great initial military successes. And all three turned into grave political debacles.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “The Israelis are in the same state that we Americans were in right after 9/11,” argues Kenneth Pollack of the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank in Washington, DC. “We were so angry and so frightened. All we really focused on was destroying anyone who threatened us, and there wasn&#39;t nearly enough attention paid to what comes next.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <b>What wars on terror wrought</b></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America&#39;s “global war on terror” started triumphantly. Just two months after al-Qaeda&#39;s attacks on America in September 2001, American-led forces were in control of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. The Taliban government was gone. Al-Qaeda was hounded. Its leader, Osama bin Laden, was tracked to Pakistan and killed in 2011. But the Taliban fought a growing insurgency. Having lost more than 2,400 military personnel, America left in 2021. The Afghan government collapsed almost immediately and the Taliban returned to power. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_EPC052.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_EPC052.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_EPC052.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_EPC052.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_EPC052.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_EPC052.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_EPC052.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_EPC052.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_EPC052.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_EPC052.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_EPC052.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_EPC052.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_EPC052.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_EPC052.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_EPC052.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_EPC052.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231021_EPC052.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">The war in Iraq was inglorious, too, and far bloodier. Once again, American forces quickly took the capital, Baghdad, in April 2003. President George W. Bush strutted on the flight deck of the <i>USS Abraham Lincoln</i> , an aircraft-carrier, under the sign: “Mission Accomplished”. In fact, the country was about to slip into civil war. American forces captured Saddam Hussein, Iraq&#39;s dictator, but soon faced bloody insurgencies by both Sunni and Shia militias. American forces withdrew in 2011 but returned in smaller numbers in 2014 to help beat back Islamic State after it captured swathes of Iraq and Syria (see chart). All told, America lost some 4,500 service members, not to mention some 300,000 Iraqis who died, most of them civilians.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For Hussein Ibish of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, an American think-tank, the lessons are clear. Terrorist and insurgent groups, he argues, resort to spectacular violence to provoke an irrational response: “They know that the harm that they can do to the dominant power is limited. They understand that the harm that the dominant power can do to itself is infinitely greater.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israel&#39;s own history offers similar warnings. In June 1982, during a tense ceasefire in artillery exchanges across Israel&#39;s northern border and amid a series of other attacks by the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( <small>plo</small> ), the Palestinian umbrella group, gunmen shot and wounded Israel&#39;s ambassador in London. The Israeli government took the attack as a <i>casus belli</i> to invade Lebanon and dismantle the <small>PLO</small> , even though the hit was attributed to its rival, the Abu Nidal group. Israeli forces besieged the <small>PLO</small> in west Beirut, forcing its leader, Yasser Arafat, and thousands of fighters, to sail away into exile. Israel&#39;s Christian ally, Bachir Gemayel, was elected Lebanon&#39;s president.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Then it all fell apart. Gemayel was blown up. In sight of Israeli forces, his Phalangist fighters exacted revenge by killing Palestinians in the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps. An Israeli commission of inquiry found that Ariel Sharon, Israel&#39;s defence minister, was indirectly responsible, and he was demoted. Within a year, under pressure from anti-war protests, Menachem Begin, the prime minister, announced his resignation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One effect of the Lebanese imbroglio was that the <small>PLO</small> was replaced by Hizbullah, a more formidable Shia militia, which succeeded in pushing Israel out of Lebanon in 2000. Another impact was on Palestinians within the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Their first intifada, or “shaking off”, a stone-throwing uprising that started in 1987, set the stage for the Oslo accords between Israel and the <small>PLO</small> of 1993. Arafat made a triumphant return to Gaza the following year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Hamas emerged as the main force of violent rejectionism. Copying Hizbullah&#39;s suicide tactics, it did much to destroy the Oslo accords. It forced Israel out of Gaza in 2005 and won the Palestinian legislative elections in 2006. The following year it pushed out the Palestinian Authority ( <small>PA</small> ), the administration created by the <small>PLO</small> . Bereft of Arafat, who died in 2004; stuck in parcels of autonomous territory in the West Bank; and unable to make progress towards statehood by negotiation, the <small>PA</small> was rapidly discredited as it sank into autocracy and corruption.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <b>Deterrence theory</b></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Since 2006 Israel&#39;s wars have been based on punishment and deterrence, seeking not to destroy its enemies but to inflict such a heavy price as to dissuade the likes of Hamas and Hizbullah from attacking Israel.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Deterrence, though, is hard to measure. In the case of Hizbullah, it has generally held since the last big war in Lebanon in 2006, sparked by a cross-border Hizbullah raid that captured two Israeli soldiers. The fighting led to widespread destruction, notably in Dahieh, a Shia neighbourhood of Beirut. Hizbullah&#39;s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, later admitted he would not have ordered the raid had he known Israel&#39;s reaction would be so severe.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In Gaza, though, periods of calm have been shorter. Israel has engaged in what some call “mowing the grass”, ie, periodically beating down Hamas to weaken it. In response to Hamas rocket fire, Israeli forces have relied mostly on retaliatory bombardment, and the protection of its Iron Dome air-defence system. Ground units have entered Gaza only reluctantly.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Deterrence holds until suddenly it doesn&#39;t. Hamas&#39;s bloodlust on October 7th was “perhaps the most cruel action in 100 years of conflict between Israel and Palestinians”, notes Mr Ibish. Yet Israel is falling into Hamas&#39;s “trap” in the ferocity of its retribution. The fighting will turn international sympathy from Israel to the Palestinians, allow Hamas to claim leadership of the Palestinian cause and wreck prospects for rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, contends Mr Ibish.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israel is in no mood for restraint. Forget mowing the grass; it wants extirpation. But such uprooting creates a new problem. “If you are going to eliminate Hamas it&#39;s a political issue, not a military one,” says Lawrence Freedman of King&#39;s College London. “You have to establish something, or else Hamas is going to come back.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Israelis in Lebanon in 1982, and the Americans in Afghanistan and Iraq after 2001, had allies on the ground and day-after plans of sorts, flawed as they turned out to be. In Gaza today, Israel is acting alone. The <small>PA</small> is weak and cannot be seen to return to Gaza on Israeli tanks. Most Arab governments have little love for Hamas, but little courage to be seen conspiring with Israel against it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “I don&#39;t care what happens next,” says Eitan Shamir, director of the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, an Israeli think-tank. “Whatever it is, it starts with destroying Hamas.” The Allies went to war against the Nazis and only later developed a plan to run post-war Germany, he notes. In his view, America&#39;s and Israel&#39;s misadventures began when they started to meddle in local politics instead of leaving promptly. Moreover, America&#39;s experience has little relevance to Israel, says Mr Shamir. It was involved in expeditionary wars, and could bring troops home: “Israel is completely different. We are fighting for our homes. We have no other choice.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For the many Israelis who, like Mr Shamir, think peace is out of reach for the foreseeable future, the only option is to keep hitting foes hard, until they disappear or change. If the current war brings Israel some years of quiet, they say, that is good enough.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Israel, though, does not have a free hand. International law and sometimes domestic opinion limit how harsh its response can be. It relies on the West, especially America, to fend off international pressure, but its support is not unlimited. The promise that America “has Israel&#39;s back” risks making it complicit in Israel&#39;s actions, to the detriment of its interests in the region and elsewhere. To take one example: Arab commentators are already drawing comparisons between America&#39;s denunciations of Russia&#39;s atrocities in Ukraine and its forbearance of Israel&#39;s bombardment of Gaza.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such concerns explain why Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, has been shuttling across the Middle East seeking to open a humanitarian corridor, allowing vital supplies into Gaza and at least some people out to Egypt. For now, though, Mr Blinken&#39;s thinking about a post-Hamas world is mostly one of platitudes: “a region that comes together, integrated, normalised relations among its countries, people working in common purpose to common benefit.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A solution will not be easy. That is all the more reason to think about it now. Jay Garner, the American general charged with setting the new administration in Iraq in 2003, complained that George Marshall, the American army chief during the second world war, had enjoyed more than two years to plan for post-Hitler Germany, whereas he was being given just a few months to prepare for post-Saddam Iraq. Israel and the world may have even less time to prepare for what comes after Hamas in Gaza. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Correction (October 17th): This article was amended to correct the order in which events occurred leading up to Israel&#39;s invasion of Lebanon in 1982.</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 19:52:41 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/sdbm3j34bgsjiqq7jdmt62bfbqgiddag</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/16/israel-needs-to-resist-irrational-retaliation </item><item><title><![CDATA[The global backlash against climate policies has begun]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-aasbfu e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/055%20International%20-%20Green%20policymaking-b2c00e6bdaca2cdf65cd4e977644cd86-2.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>“W</span> <small>e need to</small> be good stewards of our planet. But that doesn&#39;t mean I need to do away with my gas vehicle and drive an electric vehicle with a battery from China,” said Kristina Karamo, the chair of the Republican Party in Michigan, on September 22nd. America&#39;s Democrats, she warned, are trying to “convince us that if we don&#39;t centralise power in the government, the planet is gonna die. That seems like one of the biggest scams [since] Darwinian evolution.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It would be tempting to dismiss Ms Karamo as an irrelevant crank, but she is not irrelevant. She represents an extreme wing of a movement that is gathering pace around the world: a backlash against pro-climate policies. One of its more familiar cheerleaders could be America&#39;s next president. On September 27th Donald Trump said: “You can be loyal to American labour or you can be loyal to the environmental lunatics but you can&#39;t really be loyal to both…Crooked Joe [Biden] is siding with the left-wing crazies who will destroy automobile manufacturing and will destroy our country itself.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> On September 20th Rishi Sunak, Britain&#39;s prime minister, announced a weakening of net-zero targets, including a five-year delay of a ban on the sale of new petrol cars. Two weeks earlier, Germany kicked a proposal for stringent green home-heating rules years into the future. France has seen huge protests against high fuel prices, and could one day elect as president Marine Le Pen, who deplores wind farms and thinks the energy transition should be “much slower”. In America climate change has become a culture-war battleground: at a recent debate for Republican presidential candidates, only one admitted that man-made climate change is real.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> How serious an obstacle is all this to curbing global carbon emissions? Michael Jacobs of the University of Sheffield in Britain sees reasons for cautious optimism. The world&#39;s biggest emitter, China, understands the need to decarbonise and is investing massively in solar and wind. The second-biggest emitter, America, has taken a green turn under Mr Biden. Brazil has sacked a rainforest-slashing president; Australia has ditched a coal-coddling prime minister. Nearly a quarter of emissions are now subject to carbon pricing. And the pace of innovation is impressive. Two years ago the International Energy Agency, a global body, estimated that nearly 50% of the emissions reductions needed to reach net zero by 2050 would come from technologies that were not yet commercially available. In September it said that number had fallen to 35%. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC016.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC016.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC016.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC016.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC016.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC016.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC016.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC016.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC016.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC016.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC016.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC016.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC016.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC016.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC016.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC016.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC016.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">The political undercurrents are less reassuring. Voters are realising that remaking the entire global economy will be disruptive. Some—a minority—dispute that man-made climate change is under way. Others object to certain policies deployed to tackle it, because they impose costs on ordinary citizens, or add hassles to their overstretched daily lives. Some, particularly the elderly, do not like change at all, especially when it means fuss today in return for benefits they may not live to see. Even among those who accept that action is needed, views differ as to who should shoulder the burden. Many would prefer it to fall on someone else.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Awareness of the dangers of climate change seems to have risen over the past wildfire-charred decade. In polls of 12 rich countries by Pew, an American think-tank, the share of respondents who said it was a “major threat” rose in every country except South Korea, where it was already high (see chart 1). Clear majorities everywhere bar Israel agreed with this description. Yet this does not mean they are willing to pay more taxes to help prevent climate change (see chart 2). In a survey of 29 countries by Ipsos, a pollster, only 30% of respondents said they would be willing to cough up.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Crowding out</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Perhaps most alarmingly, a partisan gap has opened even on scientific questions. In all of the 14 rich countries surveyed by Pew in 2022, people on the political right were less likely to see climate change as a major threat than those on the left (see chart 3). In Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden the gap was very large: between 22 and 44 percentage points. In America it was a gobsmacking 63 points. And a new poll by YouGov for <i>The Economist</i> found that whereas 87% of Biden voters believed that climate change was caused by human activity, only 21% of Trump voters agreed. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC020.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC020.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC020.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC020.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC020.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC020.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC020.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC020.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC020.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC020.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC020.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC020.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC020.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC020.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC020.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC020.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC020.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">In democracies such divisions have consequences. (Public opinion matters in dictatorships, too, but that is beyond the scope of this article.) In rich democracies, especially, divisions over climate are aggravated by populist politicians, who take real problems (such as cost and disruption) and exaggerate them, while claiming that the elite who impose green policies don&#39;t care about ordinary motorists because they cycle to work.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Populism tends to undermine effective climate policy in several ways. First, populists are often sceptical of experts. When people say “trust the experts”, suggests Ms Karamo, they really mean: “You are too stupid to make decisions about your life.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Second, populists are suspicious of global institutions and foreigners. “Every subsidy we award to an electric-vehicle manufacturer is really a subsidy to the [Chinese Communist Party], because we depend on them, like a noose around our neck, for the batteries,” says Vivek Ramaswamy, a Republican presidential candidate. Such attitudes are bad for climate mitigation, argues Dan Fiorino of the American University in Washington, <small>DC</small> , because “climate policy is as much a matter of foreign relations as it is of economic policy.” </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC018.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC018.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC018.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC018.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC018.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC018.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC018.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC018.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC018.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC018.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC018.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC018.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC018.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC018.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC018.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC018.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231014_IRC018.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Third, populists encourage people to believe that the elite are plotting against them, thus adding paranoia to public life and making compromise harder. Mr Trump frames policies to promote electric cars as a threat to the American way of life, and does so in ways that make his fans bristle with rage and laugh out loud.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “They say the happiest day when you buy an electric car is the first ten minutes you&#39;re driving it, and then, after that, panic sets in because you&#39;re worried. Where the hell am I gonna get a charge to keep this thing going? Panic!” he told workers in Michigan. “If you want to buy an electric car that&#39;s absolutely fine...But we should not be forcing consumers to buy electric vehicles…There&#39;s no such thing as a fair transition to the end of your way of life.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> If Mr Trump is re-elected in 2024, he would once again pull out of the Paris Agreement on climate change. He would also roll back executive orders on such things as methane emissions. He would probably not be able to repeal Mr Biden&#39;s big climate law (misleadingly called the Inflation Reduction Act), which involves huge subsidies that are popular with recipients in red states as well as blue ones. But he would appoint bureaucrats who could obstruct its implementation. At a minimum, America would cease to offer leadership on climate change at a crucial moment, says Mr Markey. “You cannot preach temperance from a barstool. You cannot tell other countries to do the right thing if you as a country are not.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Similar arguments against greenery have taken root in Europe, too. Even where populist parties are not in government, they can influence it. In Sweden, where only 4% of people say climate change is “not a threat”, the centre-right ruling coalition has nonetheless cut taxes on fossil fuels several times in the past year. One reason is that it cannot pass a budget without support from the populist Sweden Democrats, who have 20% of parliamentary seats. The populists want cheaper fuel. So do lots of Swedish voters.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Fuel Rebellion”, a Swedish Facebook group, boasts 600,000 members. Peder Blohm Bokenhielm, one of its leaders, says cars “have always been a big part” of his life. His father imported American Mustangs and Corvettes to Sweden. His first word as a child was “car”. And he has practical reasons for objecting to high fuel taxes, too. In a small Swedish village “there are no shops, and just two buses a day,” he says. “If you want to buy groceries, you need a car.” Charging points are not yet everywhere, and a car&#39;s range matters in a country where journeys are long and getting stranded in the snow is hazardous. And don&#39;t get people started on the cost of home-heating. Politicians who keep high fuel prices in place are “making it harder for people to live where they want to live”, Mr Bokenhielm says.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The right way?</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In Germany this year the hard-right Alternative for Germany ( <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ) has risen in the polls—and did well in state elections on October 8th—by lambasting the energy policies of the ruling coalition, which includes the Green Party. It says they will “impoverish” the country. The <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> is ostracised by mainstream parties, but the centre-right borrows its talking-points.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Greens hurt their own cause with a plan to make green home-heating almost mandatory before there were enough skilled installers to install heat pumps. Householders struggled to book tradesmen. The government backed down in September and extended the deadline—but the political damage had been done.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Now in Germany it is not just the hard right that bashes the Greens. Their rallies have been pelted with stones, eggs and insults. Martin Huber of the Christian Social Union ( <small>CSU</small> ), the main centre-right party in Bavaria, told <i>The Economist</i> that all the Greens do is make <i>Verbotsgesetze</i> (laws that forbid things). At a rally in Andechs, a pretty village 40km from Munich, the head of the <small>CSU</small> , Markus Söder, drew guffaws from a beered-up Oktoberfest crowd with a series of jabs. When the lights suddenly brightened he quipped: “So at least they are still sending us electricity from Berlin.” An elderly supporter said: “I heat my house with wood. How can I afford to change this, and why should I in my old age?”</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Not their cup of tea</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In Britain, the Conservative prime minister has adopted the main populist themes. In a speech last month, Mr Sunak stressed that he favours curbing emissions, but decried the way Britain&#39;s climate goals had been set “without any meaningful democratic debate about how we get there”. (His party has been in power since 2010.) He also lamented that green policies “will impose unacceptable costs”. He named specific, frightening sums. “For a family living in a terraced house in Darlington, the upfront cost [of a heat pump] could be around £10,000 ($12,200).”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> He vowed to scrap plans that have never seriously been considered: “taxes on eating meat…compulsory car-sharing [and] a government diktat to sort your rubbish into seven different bins”. And he played the nationalist card. “When our share of global emissions is less than 1%, how can it be right that British citizens are...told to sacrifice even more than others?” (Brits are less than 1% of the global population.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Rishi is playing with fire,” says Michael Grubb of University College London. Businesses crave predictable policies in order to plan for the long term. “Making climate change part of a culture war will undermine investor confidence.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> James Patterson of Utrecht University in the Netherlands argues that anti-green backlashes sometimes occur when environmentalists overreach; for example, by enacting policies so coercive that many people deem them illegitimate. This has happened in the Netherlands. A new populist party, the BoerBurgerBeweging (Farmer-Citizen Movement), shot to prominence when the government began to penalise farms emitting too much nitrogen.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nitrogen is not a greenhouse gas; the problem is that big intensive Dutch farms produce enough of it (from fertiliser and cowpats) to threaten important nature reserves. The government wants to buy out farmers, leading to a reduction in the number of livestock of between a fifth and a half. Such bossiness has provoked rustic rage, with tractor protests and farms across the country flying the national flag upside down. The Farmer-Citizen Movement took 20% of the vote in provincial elections this year—in a country where only 2.2% of people farm. At a general election on November 22nd the more eco-friendly parties are expecting a thumping.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For the most part in developing countries, climate change is a less divisive topic in domestic politics than it is in rich ones. The elite discuss it—governments want to be compensated for the industrialised world&#39;s past emissions and to attract investment for the energy transition. But during elections in India or Africa the topic is barely mentioned.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> However, voters in developing countries are even more sensitive to rises in the cost of living than those in rich countries. So they often resist policies that they think will batter their budgets. Hence the difficulty of cutting fossil-fuel subsidies, which were a staggering $1.3trn (1.3% of global <small>GDP</small> ) in 2022, according to the <small>IMF</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such handouts are so popular that the harm they do to the environment is seldom motive enough for governments to get rid of them. Nigeria&#39;s new president, Bola Tinubu, scrapped a fuel subsidy this year not because it encouraged people to burn carbon, but because selling petrol at below-market prices was bankrupting the treasury. In 2022 it cost $10bn, leaving the state oil firm with nothing left for the federal government, of which it is usually the biggest bankroller. Abolishing the subsidy frees up billions for public services, with the happy side-effect of reducing emissions. However, there is pressure to reinstate it. As oil prices rise, some fear a subsidy will be quietly reintroduced.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Several middle-income countries, such as Indonesia and India, are burning more fossil fuels even as they try to reinvent themselves as green powers. India&#39;s government plans to triple renewable-electricity-generation capacity by the end of the decade. It has also declared a moratorium on new coal plants and aims to become a big producer of green hydrogen. This is good news, but seems to be driven at least as much by worries about energy security as climate change: last year&#39;s green-hydrogen strategy mentions a plan to be “energy independent” by 2047 before the target to achieve “net zero” by 2070. And despite the moratorium on new coal plants, Indian coal production grew by 14.8% last year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> National-security arguments can be a spur to green investment. Building wind farms can reduce dependence on energy imports, which is a point that many politicians emphasise. But if such arguments also spur governments to erect barriers to foreign inputs, it will make the energy transition more costly.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> From a green perspective, the big middle-income country that has improved the most in the past year is probably Brazil. Yet it, too, is complicated. Under President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who took office in January, deforestation in the Amazon in the first eight months of the year fell by a cumulative 48% compared with the same period in 2022, when his logger-loving predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, was in charge. However, Lula also supports a push by Petrobras, the state oil firm, to increase output from 2.9m barrels a day to 5.2m by 2030. And his green plans have met resistance. In Congress 347 out of 594 lawmakers belong to the agri-business caucus, whose members fret that greens block development. Congress has curbed the powers of the environment ministry.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Sowing discontent</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In most developing countries, net-zero targets are far in the future and voters have not yet been asked to make big sacrifices to reach them. For many, the harm wrought by climate change itself is a bigger worry. A massive 74% of Indians, for example, say they have experienced the effects of global warming, up from 50% in 2011, according to a survey by Yale University. “We&#39;ve lost crops because of extreme heat and rains and it has got worse in the past few years,” says Shiv Kumari, a farm labourer in Delhi whose fields were flooded this summer. Such trauma translates into greater support for green policies: 55% of Indians say India should reduce its emissions immediately without waiting for other countries to act, up from 36% in 2011.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Globally, innovation will eventually ease the grumbles that drive so much of the anti-climate backlash. “The clean is already cheaper than the dirty in many parts of the economy, and those parts will just get bigger and bigger,” says Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics. But it matters immensely how fast this happens. Many green technologies require hefty upfront investment, which is harder when interest rates are high. This particularly affects the poor world. “Look at Africa. If you pay 15% interest, wind and solar are not cheaper than fossil fuels for generating electricity, though they are cheaper at 7% or 8%,” says Professor Stern. He suggests supercharging multilateral lenders to crowd in other sources of finance. “The most unrealistic and dangerous thing of all would be to go slow,” he says. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>For more coverage of climate change, sign up for the <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-climate-issue">Climate Issue</a> , our fortnightly subscriber-only newsletter, or visit our <a href="https://www.economist.com/climate-change">climate-change hub</a> .</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 18:05:06 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/b06prptev1l4v7gag2jtec7qt3bj8prj</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/11/the-global-backlash-against-climate-policies-has-begun </item><item><title><![CDATA[Africa’s coups are part of a far bigger crisis]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-aasbfu e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/055%20International%20-%20The%20coups%20will%20continue-13f53d6bb9ccb6ccc21260a76bf88d9c.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>F</span> <small>OR MANY</small> years, coups in Africa seemed a thing of the past.

It is possible, if inadvisable, to walk some 6,000km from the Atlantic coast of west Africa to the shore of the Red Sea and stride only through countries where there have been coups in the past three years (see map). The trek from Guinea to Sudan would cross the Sahel, the region south of the Sahara where there have been two coups each in Mali and Burkina Faso since August 2020, and one in Niger in July.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Africa—which covers an area larger than America, China, India, Japan and western Europe combined—is more than its coup belt. Yet the takeovers are part of a broader political crisis. The most recent surveys by Afrobarometer, a pollster, find that in 24 of 30 countries approval of the idea of military rule has risen since 2014. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC789.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC789.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC789.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC789.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC789.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC789.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC789.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC789.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC789.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC789.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC789.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC789.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC789.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC789.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC789.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC789.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC789.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Contingent support is higher. On average across 36 countries more Africans (53%) would be willing to consider a military government than would rule it out (42%) “if elected officials abused their power”—which they often do (see chart 1). Just 38% expressed satisfaction with “democracy”, the lowest share since at least 2014. The backing for potential strongmen or deep dissatisfaction with democracy was common across the coup belt, but also in relatively stable places, including Botswana and South Africa (see chart 2). Afropopulism, for want of a better phrase, is an increasingly potent force.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Why is there such widespread discontent? Africans are frustrated with the sham that passes for “democracy” in most countries. They are also fed up with flimsy states that provide neither security nor prosperity. Around two-thirds of them, as well as majorities in 28 of 36 polled countries, feel their countries are heading in the wrong direction. Should this continue, many Africans, especially younger ones, may be tempted to reconsider shabby social contracts—and look for radical change. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231007_IRC788.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">The most important failure is the provision of security. African states are often strong in areas where they ought to be weak and weak where they ought to be strong. Many regimes are adept at beating or locking up opponents, but inept at stopping their citizens from being robbed or killed. As a consequence, those promising to restore security, however ruthlessly, can gain support from ordinary citizens.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Although some African wars in the late 20th century were much deadlier, the overall number of African conflicts is rising, according to a paper published last year by the Peace Research Institute Oslo. It noted that small conflicts caused more deaths in 2021 than at any point since its data began in 1989. The number of conflicts in which at least one side is a state was higher in 2021 than a decade earlier.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Mounting chaos</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Since 2021 things have become only bloodier. In Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, a trio of countries where jihadists linked to al-Qaeda and Islamic State run riot, deaths in conflict have risen from under 800 in 2016 to over 10,000 in 2022. It is no coincidence that all three have gone from being largely democratic to suffering coups in the 2020s. Putschists have sought to justify their takeovers and gained support by pointing to insecurity under democracy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As the jihadist chaos spills into coastal states, political chaos could follow. Togo, for example, has a dynastic dictatorship like the one recently toppled in Gabon: the Gnassingbé family has run the country for 56 years. And it faces growing jihadist insecurity—at least 140 people have been killed since July 2022.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In Nigeria, Africa&#39;s most populous country, jihadists terrorise the north-east, gangs kidnap hundreds at a time in the north-west and armed separatists pillage the south-east. Clashes between farmers and herders in the centre add to the bloodshed. More than 10,000 people died in conflict in the country in both of 2021 and 2022. This year will be almost as bad. <small>ACLED</small> , a conflict-tracking group, rates Nigeria as having the fifth-most extreme violence globally, behind Ukraine.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nigeria&#39;s political class, lounging in well-guarded mansions, is out of touch. Turnout in this year&#39;s election was 29%, the lowest ever. More than 40% of Nigerians think it would be legitimate for the armed forces to take over in the event of abuses of power by elected leaders. Before the election senior Nigerian political figures told <i>The Economist</i> they had heard of coup-plotting. That is a troubling development, given that the country was run (abysmally) by military dictators for much of the second half of the 20th century.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Harsh ingredients</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Other large countries are riven with conflict. Though the civil war centred on Ethiopia&#39;s Tigray region may be over, clashes in Amhara and Oromia spiral on. Resurgent violence in the east of Congo has caused almost 3m people to flee from their homes since March 2022. In April 2023 Sudan plunged into civil war. All three countries are among Africa&#39;s ten most populous. In every place people will seek protection where they think they can find it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Insecurity is felt beyond war zones. In a poll of 30 countries around the world released last month by Open Society Foundations, an <small>NGO</small> network, four of the five countries with the highest share of respondents fearing political violence were African: Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa. The latter&#39;s murder rate, among the highest in the world, is rising again. Lawlessness increases support for populists and vigilantes. And 72% of South Africans would swap elected governments for a crime-bashing strongman. One former cabinet minister, who campaigned against apartheid, praises Paul Kagame for Rwanda&#39;s apparent lack of crime (but says less about its abuses of human rights). “Kagame has the right idea: sometimes you need to crack the whip.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Economic stagnation compounds the political crisis. From 1990 to 2018 the number of people living in extreme poverty in sub-Saharan Africa rose from 284m to 433m, as population growth often outstripped the economic sort. The region has lost another decade: real <small>GDP</small> per person was lower in 2022 than ten years earlier.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Households and governments are also facing a tightening financial squeeze. The median inflation rate in sub-Saharan Africa has more than doubled since the start of the pandemic. In a region where food makes up 40% of consumption, there is double-digit food-price inflation in 80% of countries. Some 17% of government revenues will be spent on servicing external debt this year, the highest share since 1999.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Job creation” is by far the most-cited priority by 18- to 35-year-olds in Afrobarometer polls. The Mo Ibrahim Foundation, a British <small>NGO</small> , reckons that 18m formal jobs must be created annually to absorb the numbers entering the labour force; the current figure is 3m. Almost half of 18- to 24-year-olds in 15 countries surveyed last year by the Africa Youth Survey, a poll by a South African charity, said they were thinking of emigrating. Young Nigerians talk of “adulthood na scam” and hunt ways to <i>japa</i> , Yoruba slang for to emigrate.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Earlier this year Hakainde Hichilema, whom the West sees as a rare liberal on the continent, warned his outside champions that African democrats need to secure material results or they will face political consequences. “[Y]ou can&#39;t eat democracy,” argued Zambia&#39;s president in an opinion piece urging foreign creditors to speed up debt restructuring. “Human rights may sustain the spirit, but not the body.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The desperation to meet basic needs partly explains why Africans may be relatively willing to consider strongmen. The Open Society poll asked whether authoritarians would produce better results in ten policy areas, such as creating jobs and fighting crime. In eight cases the sub-Saharan African average was higher than the global one. “Invariably, juntas that promise better material conditions will show up and win enough people&#39;s hearts and minds,” notes Ken Opalo of Georgetown University in America.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nevertheless, Africans&#39; faith in what passes for democracy is plummeting not just because of the insecurity and poverty their governments deliver, but also because of the nature of politics itself. In the 1990s and 2000s most African countries ditched one-party systems and embraced multi-party elections. The pageantry of elections, however, obscures the fact that much of Africa has only the patina of democracy. <small>EIU</small> , our sister outfit, classifies just one African country (Mauritius) as a “full democracy” and six as “flawed”. Between 1990 and 2019 sitting presidents won 88% of the 112 elections they ran in.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nine leaders have kept power for more than 20 years. These include Uganda&#39;s Yoweri Museveni; Cameroon&#39;s Paul Biya, who spends much of the year in a Swiss hotel; Equatorial Guinea&#39;s Teodoro Obiang, the longest-serving president of any country; and Mr Kagame. All fear fair elections; all may be grooming a son for office.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even relative newbies abuse the law, entrenching frustration. In August Zimbabwe&#39;s main opposition party did not contest yet another dubious election because it sees the courts as biased. A month earlier the Central African Republic&#39;s president won a referendum he rammed through the courts that will end term limits. In 2020 Alassane Ouattara, president of Ivory Coast, won a third term after controversially tweaking the constitution so he could get around the two-term limit. Senegal&#39;s Macky Sall this year opted against a similar move after violent protests. But any goodwill earned was undermined by the arrest of hundreds of opposition-party members, including a presidential candidate.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> On average in Afrobarometer polls only 13% believe that no one in their country&#39;s presidency is corrupt. Transparency International ( <small>TI</small> ), a watchdog, finds that sub-Saharan African countries are on average seen as less clean than El Salvador, where graft is so endemic that a millennial authoritarian has promised to build a huge jail specially for white-collar criminals. On average, perceptions of corruption in sub-Saharan Africa were slightly worse in 2022 than they were a decade earlier, reckons <small>TI.</small></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Open Society poll found that corruption was the gravest national issue for voters in Ghana and Nigeria. Voters also fret about it in South Africa, where “state capture” became ubiquitous under Jacob Zuma, president from 2009 to 2018. The looting of state institutions remains a problem in South Africa today—and in many other countries. “The capture of democratic political systems by private power networks is arguably the greatest threat to civil liberties and inclusive development in Africa,” argues Nic Cheeseman of the University of Birmingham in Britain.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Youth and experience</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Putschists exploit anger at graft—and it works, at least initially. In a poll before the first coup in Mali, 58% of people thought most or all the people in the presidency were corrupt. Two years and a second coup later, just 25% did. In Guinea the share before the coup was almost 50%. After it the share fell to 28%.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Why doesn&#39;t dissatisfaction with sham democracy spur Africans to try to obtain a better version of it? There are several reasons. For a start it is fiendishly difficult to oppose dictatorships. The bad guys usually have the guns. Ruling parties also often co-opt <small>NGO</small> s<small> </small>and youth groups. Many activists have tried to improve democracy and to vote out authoritarians.然而，在经历了数十年的失败之后，一些人可能会得出这样的结论：只有更激进的方法，甚至政变，才能结束停滞和国家夺取。 Guinea&#39;s main opposition leader, for example, told <i>The Economist</i> of his “relief” immediately after the coup that ousted Alpha Condé, then president, in 2021.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Second, there is reason to believe that support for liberal democracy is softer than its champions would wish. In Mali, for example, support for the idea of military rule had been flat for years at just under 30% before the first coup. Now almost 80% of Malians say they approve or strongly approve of rule by military men.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Although outsiders may point out that liberal democracy has never really been tried in Africa, that is not always the view of Africans. Last month Olusegun Obasanjo, a former Nigerian president, said: “We have seen that the liberal type of democracy as practised in the West will not work for us.” Mr Kagame has argued similarly. (“The West does not define democracy in Africa.”) In the Africa Youth Survey just 39% of respondents said that Africans should emulate “Western democracy”; 53% said Africa needed to find its own version.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Indeed, too much is often expected of young Africans. Many of them are apathetic when confronted with the façade of democracy. They are more than twice as likely to say they did not vote in the last election as the over-56s. In Nigeria&#39;s election this year young voters helped Peter Obi to the best-ever result for a third-party candidate but he still came only third. In South Africa&#39;s last general election only 30% of eligible 20-somethings voted—from apartheid to apathy in a single generation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Support for military rule if elected leaders abuse power is highest among the young. On average 56% of 18- to 35-year-olds would contemplate it, versus 46% of those aged 56 and older. It is young men who rally in support after coups, complicating potential efforts by African countries or the West to reverse takeovers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Not that outsiders&#39; commitment to African democracy is especially strong—the third reason for its feebleness.非洲联盟这个大陆组织很弱，最终是其大多数独裁成员的产物。 Regional hegemons such as South Africa carry less weight: economic stagnation means it has less hard power, while endorsing rigged elections in Zimbabwe and elsewhere means it has less soft power. Meanwhile, China skews aid towards corrupt autocratic regimes, as the Chinese Communist Party preaches its model to Africa&#39;s ruling parties. Russia, whether through the notorious Wagner Group or via arms sales, props up juntas and authoritarians. Newer players such as Turkey and Gulf countries will not promote democratic norms.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The West offers half-hearted help and hypocrisy. It sometimes speaks out when elections look sketchy, as was the case this year in Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone. But America decided to whitewash dodgy results in mineral-rich Congo in 2018. Britain is unlikely to criticise Mr Kagame given that it wants to fly asylum-seekers to Rwanda. France rails against coups in countries where it stands to lose influence, such as Niger, but says little when the putschists are in tune with Paris, as was the case with Chad&#39;s coup in 2021.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Françafrique—the term given to how France has maintained influence in former colonies by propping up autocratic elites—is coming back to bite Paris. In Mali a survey in 2021 found that more than a fifth of Malians believed that France&#39;s armed forces in the country were in league with jihadists or separatists. In Burkina Faso the new president, 35-year-old Captain Ibrahim Traoré, says that he is restoring sovereignty. It is the free choice of his junta, like Mali&#39;s, to ask Russia for help. After Niger&#39;s coup, the junta quickly scapegoated France, which had troops fighting jihadists in the country. Crowds waved Russian flags and decapitated a rooster painted in French colours. In Senegal, protesters against Mr Sall&#39;s flirtation with a third term burned down French-owned supermarkets and petrol stations. Half of Ivorians say that France is the country they trust least, according to Premise Data, a pollster.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Winter of discontent</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> So long as Africans see—and experience—“democracy” as a charade played by corrupt elites with the help of foreigners, then many will consider other options. What those look like will vary depending on the context. In South Africa frustration at meagre progress since apartheid is opening up space for Julius Malema, a hard-left black nationalist, and for ethnic-based parties. In Nigeria the efforts of Nnamdi Kanu, a separatist, to resuscitate the dream of an independent Biafra rely on charisma, populism, disregard for the truth and violence.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Elsewhere populist military men may prove appealing, at least temporarily. In Burkina Faso Captain Traoré chooses deliberately to mimic Thomas Sankara, a revered former socialist leader often referred to as Africa&#39;s Che Guevara. He came to power in a coup in 1983 aged 33 before being gunned down four years later. France has been a butt of both men.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is a well-intentioned desire to see Africans, especially younger ones, as a latent progressive force. But it is also patronising to deny, given the present circumstances amid what passes for democracy on the continent, that many Africans will be tempted by authoritarians. They are no more immune to populism than Americans are to Donald Trump, or Turks are to Recep Tayyip Erdogan. They will gravitate to those who seem to meet their needs—or at least offer a change from those who manifestly do not. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 18:51:15 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/7fied3rvfpciktgotman52rbdsobkjfe</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/03/africas-coups-are-part-of-a-far-bigger-crisis </item><item><title><![CDATA[States are becoming more brazen about killing foes abroad]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-aasbfu e1ey6m752"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/058%20International%20-%20Political%20murder-c0f96e8683974cc2a381bd6e1d44124d-2.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>he murder</small> of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist activist who was shot in Canada in June, has caused <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/20/if-india-ordered-a-murder-in-canada-there-must-be-consequences">an explosive row</a> between Canada and India. It has also brought into sharp relief an incendiary facet of the new world disorder: assassinations. Killings of dissidents and terrorists, and of political or military figures, are as old as politics itself, but their incidence may be rising. Ukraine targets occupiers and collaborators; Russia has tried to kill Ukraine&#39;s president. On September 25th Ukraine claimed to have killed the head of Russia&#39;s Black Sea Fleet, only for him seemingly to appear in a video a day later.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Beyond the war in Europe a new cohort of rising powers, including India and Saudi Arabia, are projecting force abroad. They resent what they view as Western double standards on state-sponsored killings. New technologies make it easier than ever for governments to strike their enemies with precision, even from great distances.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet even as assassinations are becoming easier, and perhaps more frequent, the world has not yet figured out how to respond to them. You only need to look at the West&#39;s response to such killings. Russia&#39;s assassination of Alexander Litvinenko, a former <small>KGB</small> agent, in Britain in 2006 caused an outcry and led to sanctions. After <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/02/26/the-cia-blames-mbs-for-the-murder-of-jamal-khashoggi">the gruesome murder</a> in 2018 in Istanbul of Jamal Khashoggi, an exiled Saudi journalist living in America, Joe Biden said Saudi Arabia should be treated as a pariah. Yet last year he<a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/07/05/what-mbs-wants-from-joe-biden">fist-bumped</a> Muhammad bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince and de facto ruler, and is <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/09/24/an-israeli-saudi-pact-could-upend-the-middle-east">seeking to coax him</a> into making peace with Israel. Meanwhile India denies involvement in Mr Nijjar&#39;s death and may avoid any serious consequences relating to it. The world&#39;s most populous country is important to the West, both as an economic partner and a geopolitical counterweight to China. These inconsistencies reflect a longstanding moral and legal maze over state-backed killings.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Bible may extol the Israelite Ehud for killing Eglon, the oppressive and “very fat” Moabite king. Yet it also commands obedience to authority, “For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.” Assassination, in the sense of killing a prominent person for a political motive with no legal process, carries the connotation of perfidy. Dante placed Julius Caesar&#39;s killers in the deepest circle of hell, alongside Judas, their bodies gnawed on by Satan. Yet states kill prominent foes abroad—for different reasons and with varied methods. A paper in 2016 by Warner Schilling and Jonathan Schilling lists 14 possible objectives, from revenge to weakening an enemy or destroying a rival state.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Reliable data on the patterns of assassinations and their causes are hard to come by, given the problems of identifying killings and culprits. Some 298 assassination attempts on national leaders were reported between 1875 and 2004, according to a paper by Benjamin Jones and Benjamin Olken published by the <i>American Economic Journal</i> in 2009. Since 1950, they find, a national leader has been assassinated in nearly two out of every three years.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> War by other means</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For Rory Cormac of the University of Nottingham in Britain, the shooting in Canada is evidence of a weakening of international norms against assassination: “With every high-profile killing, the taboo erodes a bit,” he says. He offers two big reasons: authoritarian regimes “are becoming more brazen” about challenging liberal norms; and democracies&#39; resort to targeted killings has “emboldened other states”. Other factors, such as ease of travel and drones that make possible long-distance surveillance and strikes, probably worsen the problem. Over the years America has killed thousands of suspected jihadists—and many civilians, too—with drones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Assassination has never changed the history of the world,” the British politician Benjamin Disraeli remarked, after Abraham Lincoln&#39;s killing. Yet some murders can have a dramatic impact. A bullet fired by a Serbian nationalist, killing Austria&#39;s Archduke Franz Ferdinand in June 1914, detonated the first world war. And assassination risks retaliation: both Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, respectively a former American secretary of state and national security adviser, have allegedly been the targets of an Iranian assassination plot. Britain&#39;s domestic-intelligence service, <small>MI5</small> , says Iran has “ambitions to kidnap or even kill British or <small>UK</small> -based individuals perceived as enemies of the regime”.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Cloaks and daggers</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> When it comes to methods, Russia likes poison. Its agents murdered Litvinenko using radioactive polonium. They nearly killed another former spook in Britain, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter Yulia with Novichok, a nerve agent, in 2018. North Korea favours poison, too. It killed Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of the country&#39;s leader, Kim Jong Un, by smearing him with <small>VX</small> , another nerve agent, at Kuala Lumpur&#39;s international airport in 2017.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America prefers bombs and bullets. 2011 年，美国特种部队突袭了巴基斯坦的一处安全屋，击毙了基地组织领导人奥萨马·本·拉登。2022 年，美国无人机袭击在喀布尔打死了他的继任者艾曼·扎瓦希里。另一架无人机击毙了基地组织领导人卡西姆·苏莱马尼。 2020 年，伊朗的对外行动机构圣城旅在巴格达机场。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管事实上，1961 年约翰·肯尼迪总统（他本人后来被暗杀）告诉一名助手，他不赞成这种做法：“我们不能卷入这种事情，否则我们都会成为目标”。然而，早在冷战初期，美国就肯定热衷于这类事情。其暗杀古巴菲德尔·卡斯特罗（未成功）和多米尼加共和国拉斐尔·特鲁希略（成功）等领导人的秘密行动的曝光引起了强烈反对。 1976 年，杰拉尔德·福特总统发布了一项行政命令，规定美国政府任何成员“不得参与或密谋参与暗杀”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">国外的杀戮仍在继续。威尔士斯旺西大学的卢卡·特伦塔表示，如今，独裁政权利用秘密行动来给予他们看似合理的——或者往往是难以置信的——否认。但美国等民主国家却试图给“定点清除”（尤其是针对恐怖分子嫌疑人）披上看似合法的面纱。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 《<small>联合国宪章</small>》责成所有成员国“在国际关系中不得以武力相威胁或使用武力侵犯任何国家的领土完整或政治独立”。但与此同时，它承认“如果发生武装袭击，个人或集体自卫的固有权利”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">国际人权律师持限制性观点。在和平时期，暗杀和定点清除是非法的。在战时，如果符合战争法，它们可能是被允许的。 1943 年，盟军在所罗门群岛上空击落了一架载有日本海军上将山本五十六的飞机时，乌克兰就瞄准了俄罗斯高级指挥官。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">那么似乎介于普通治安和战争之间的国际恐怖主义又如何呢？美国圣母大学的玛丽·艾伦·奥康奈尔认为“不存在灰色地带”。她说，根据国际法，各国必须通过执法手段应对恐怖主义，包括国际合作和引渡；致命行动相当于“法外处决”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管如此，美国尤其寻求更大的法律行动自由。其中一条途径就是确定主权的资格。它认为，如果一个国家“不愿意或无法”阻止恐怖主义行为，则可以采取军事行动。它还有时将海外领土指定为“活跃敌对行动地区”，武装部队可以在那里更自由地行动。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure

e190yofl0">另一条途径是扩大自卫权。第一步是宣布它包括对非国家行为者和国家的攻击做出反应。接下来是主张“预期自卫”的权利，允许一个国家使用武力来阻止“迫在眉睫”的攻击威胁。最广泛接受的定义是，威胁应该是“即时的、压倒性的、没有手段可供选择、也没有审议的时间”。但这也被拉长了。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 2001年，乔治·W·布什总统走得更远，甚至在威胁“完全形成”之前就开始采用先发制人和预防的思想来证明使用武力的合理性。巴拉克·奥巴马政府还重新定义了“迫在眉睫”的含义。他的总检察长埃里克·霍尔德表示，不仅要考虑威胁的接近程度，还要考虑“采取行动的机会之窗”。这种想法大部分借鉴自以色列，以色列最高法院在 2006 年裁定，就恐怖分子而言，“敌对行动之间的休息只不过是为下一次敌对行动做准备”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">特伦塔博士表示，美国的榜样鼓励了英国、澳大利亚和法国也放松了类似的规定。但对奥康奈尔教授来说，这一切都等于西方授予自己不适用于其他国家的权利，“违反国际法的基于规则的秩序”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">印度完全可以像亲政府报纸那样辩称，尼贾尔被杀符合西方的反恐理念。锡克教分离主义曾导致过流血事件，尤其是 1984 年总理英迪拉·甘地 (Indira Gandhi) 被暗杀，以及次年印度航空 (Air India) 一架从蒙特利尔飞往伦敦的飞机被爆炸事件。尽管锡克教暴力事件已经大大减弱，但它可能会再次爆发。印度声称尼贾尔是一名恐怖分子，并悬赏抓捕他；他的支持者称他是一名和平活动家。在印度看来，西方拒绝镇压锡克教分裂分子构成了威胁。不过，政府更愿意说这与尼贾尔先生的死无关。至于执法方面，印度越削弱民主自由，合作就越困难。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">杀手本能</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">开发用于秘密行动的长臂并不容易。它需要资源和专业知识来跟踪目标、组织打击并避免被捕。印度的间谍可能认为他们正在效仿美国和以色列的间谍，成为必然严厉的民主捍卫者。有些人甚至谈论印度外国情报部门研究与分析部门（ <small>RAW</small> ）的“以色列化”。但如果人们认为它从减轻明显的安全威胁转向打击政治敌人，那么<small>RAW</small>将成为国内镇压的阴暗外表，就像俄罗斯或沙特阿拉伯的间谍一样。暗杀可以让世界警惕下令暗杀的政权的残暴行为。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 26 Sep 2023

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 9 月 13 日，朝鲜胖乎乎的领导人<span>金正恩</span>(Kim Jong Un) <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/13/the-dangers-posed-by-a-deal-between-russia-and-north-korea">与弗拉基米尔·普京 (Vladimir Putin)</a><small>握手</small>，当时他正乘坐火车前往俄罗斯远东的一个太空港，讨论向其独裁者出售一批朝鲜武器。自己的条款以及关于出售武器业务的说法。世界五个最大的军火销售国（美国、俄罗斯、法国、中国和德国）占出口额的四分之三以上。但崭露头角的武器生产商正在与守旧派展开竞争。他们正在充分利用地缘政治变化所创造的机会。他们还从俄罗斯入侵乌克兰中受益。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">金正恩访问俄罗斯之前，俄罗斯国防部长谢尔盖·绍伊古 (Sergei Shoigu) 于 7 月访问了平壤，绍伊古希望了解朝鲜能否提供装备来帮助该国摇摇欲坠的战争努力。朝鲜很乐意为其装备寻找买家。很少有政权愿意向俄罗斯出售武器。 <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/03/02/chinese-arms-could-revive-russias-failing-war">到目前为止，</a>中国只提供了两用芯片（尽管它还可以通过朝鲜输送更多致命的东西）。只有伊朗履行了义务，出售了约 2,400 架<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/19/iranian-drones-pose-a-fiendish-military-problem-for-ukraine">Shahed“神风”无人机</a>。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">朝鲜可以提供更广泛的东西。除了无人机和<small>KN</small> -23（几乎是俄罗斯伊斯坎德尔弹道导弹的复制品）等导弹外，它还可以提供自行榴弹炮和多管火箭系统。据美国情报部门消息称，朝鲜在一年中的大部分时间里一直在向俄罗斯运送152毫米炮弹和喀秋莎型火箭弹。俄罗斯之所以在平壤和德黑兰进行采购，是因为这两个政权已经成为国际制裁的重点目标，与普京政府做生意对他们来说没有什么可失去的，而且会获得很多好处。与其说它们是“邪恶轴心”，不如说它们是贱民的市场。

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果说朝鲜的军火工业因乌克兰战争而得到提振，那么其南方敌人的表现甚至更好。韩国的武器出口商甚至在冲突发生前就已经开始清理工作。截至 2022 年的五年里，该国在智库斯德哥尔摩国际和平研究所 ( <small>SIPRI</small> ) 编制的武器销售商排名中上升至第九位（见图表）。政府希望到 2027 年使韩国成为世界第四大武器出口国。去年韩国出售了价值 170 亿美元的武器，是 2021 年的两倍多。其中约 145 亿美元来自对波兰的销售。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">韩国与波兰达成的协议的规模和范围令人瞠目结舌，波兰将自己视为欧洲防御复仇主义俄罗斯的前线国家。该交易包括 1,000 辆<small>K</small> 2 黑豹坦克，其中 180 辆是从陆军自己的库存中快速交付的，另外 820 辆将在波兰获得许可生产。这比英国、法国、德国和意大利军队的坦克数量总和还多。它还包括672门<small>K</small> 9 Thunder自行榴弹炮； 288 <small>K</small> 239 Chunmoo 多管火箭发射器；以及 48 架金鹰<small>FA</small> -50，这是一种廉价的第四代战斗机。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">伦敦智库国际战略研究所的汤姆·瓦尔德温表示， <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/02/12/south-korea-wants-to-become-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-arms-exporters">韩国在军火业务上的成功</a>取决于具有竞争力的成本、高质量的武器和快速的交付。其价格反映了韩国的高效制造。其质量源自韩国与美国最好的武器合作的经验，以及韩国自己的高科技民用部门。快速交货是可能的，因为韩国面临着北部边境的重大威胁，他们运行的热生产线也可以迅速增加。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>SIPRI</small>武器转让项目研究员西蒙·韦泽曼 (Siemon Wezeman) 表示，政府的全力支持和有吸引力的信贷安排对于韩国的成功也至关重要。亚洲客户喜欢这样一个事实：它与美国有着密切的联系，但又不是美国，而美国常常被视为不可靠的盟友。这也可能有助于韩国达成价值 450 亿美元的加拿大潜艇舰队更新协议。未来的问题包括韩国将在多大程度上向其客户转让技术——这对波兰来说是一个至关重要的问题，波兰将自己视为韩国的出口伙伴，在欧洲市场与德国和法国竞争。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果说韩国是新兴武器出口国中无可争议的领头羊，那么第二名就是土耳其。自2002年执政的<small>正义与发展</small>党上台以来，它向国防工业投入了大量资金。面对美国和欧洲的制裁，实现武器生产近乎自给自足的目标变得更加紧迫——前者是在<small>北约</small>成员国土耳其购买俄罗斯<small>S</small> -400地空导弹后于2019年实施的。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">火箭燃料</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><small>SIPRI</small>认为，2018年至2022年间，土耳其武器出口较前五年增长了69%，其在全球武器市场的份额翻了一番。根据当地行业机构7月的一份报告，2022年其国防和航空航天出口额较上年增长38%，达到44亿美元。今年的目标是 60 亿美元。巴基斯坦正在从土耳其接收现代化潜艇。土耳其向巴基斯坦海军出售的四艘护卫舰中的最后一艘已于上个月下水。可能会向其他国家进行更多销售，这既是因为土耳其船舶的价格具有竞争力，也是因为土耳其对于将其出售给谁没有任何疑虑。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，土耳其的出口业务主要由武装无人机主导。 7 月 18 日，土耳其与沙特阿拉伯签署了价值 30 亿美元的协议，供应 Akinci 无人机（ <small>UCAV</small> ）。它由 Baykar 制造，该公司还生产 Bayraktar <small>TB</small> 2，这是一款曾在阿塞拜疆、埃塞俄比亚、利比亚和乌克兰的战斗中使用的无人机。在美国拒绝向土耳其出售“捕食者”无人机后， <small>TB</small> 2 的开发目的是追捕库尔德武装分子。超过 20 个国家排队购买它，因为它比美国的替代品更便宜、更容易获得，而且比以前主导非西方市场的中国<small>无人战斗机</small>更可靠。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Akinci（右图， <small>TB</small> 2 旁边）更强大。它可以携带大量大型武器，包括空对空导弹和射程250公里的隐形巡航导弹<small>SOM</small> - <small>A</small> 。它将在阿曼、卡塔尔和<small>阿联酋等其他几个海湾国家中找到买家，</small>这些国家热衷于通过减少对美国武器的依赖来对冲与美国关系恶化的风险。这些国家也有建设自己的国防工业的雄心；他们将土耳其视为愿意的合作伙伴和值得效仿的榜样。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">土耳其的雄心从正在酝酿的其他项目中可见一斑。其新海军旗舰<i>阿纳多卢号</i>是一艘 25,000 吨级两栖攻击舰和轻型航空母舰，将搭载 Bayraktar<small>无人</small>战斗机。据说至少有一个海湾国家正在就购买一艘类似的船只进行谈判。巴基斯坦和阿塞拜疆是土耳其第五代战斗机<small>“KAAN”</small>的合作伙伴，预计将于今年年底前试飞。 <small>KAAN</small>在英国<small>BAE</small> Systems 和劳斯莱斯的帮助下开发，可以被视为对土耳其被逐出<small>F</small> -35 合作伙伴计划（作为购买<small>S</small> -400 的惩罚）的回应。土耳其将向美国不向其出售<small>F</small> -35 的任何人或对条件犹豫的人推销这款飞机。海湾国家可能再次排在第一位。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">韩国和土耳其从主要竞争对手的困境中受益。 <small>SIPRI 的数据</small>显示，2018 年至 2022 年间<a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/23/russian-arms-have-fewer-takers-in-south-east-asia">，俄罗斯的武器出口</a>量比前五年下降了 31%。由于侵略战争给国防工业带来的压力、地缘政治的孤立以及印度和中国这两个主要客户为减少对俄罗斯武器的依赖而做出的努力，它正面临着进一步的大幅下滑。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">此前俄罗斯最大的客户印度在2018-22年期间将俄罗斯武器采购量减少了37%。它可能希望能走得更远：俄罗斯主要由国家控制的军火工业不得不将本国军队的需求置于对客户的承诺之上。印度空军的骨干力量——272 架 Su-30 <small>MKI</small>中的许多都因俄罗斯无法供应零部件而报废。与<small>北约</small>装备相比，俄罗斯的一些武器在乌克兰的表现较差。对俄罗斯的制裁限制了微芯片、滚珠轴承、机床和光学系统等产品的贸易，这将阻碍俄罗斯销售战斗机、攻击直升机和其他致命装置的能力。乌克兰战争持续的时间越长，俄罗斯就越难以夺回其在全球军火市场的地位。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">潮湿的爆管</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">至于中国，2018-22年期间其武器出口的一半以上仅流向一个国家：巴基斯坦，中国将巴基斯坦视为对抗印度的盟友。据<small>SIPRI</small>称，巴基斯坦近80%的主要武器需求由中国满足。其中包括战斗机、导弹、护卫舰和潜艇。北京对其客户的人权记录、他们计划如何使用中国发送的信息或他们是否受到西方制裁不感兴趣。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但中国的军工工业也有其问题。瓦尔德温表示，一个挑战是，尽管中国十年前就开始主导军用无人机市场，但其客户已经厌倦了低劣的质量和更糟糕的支持，这为土耳其打开了大门。韦泽曼表示，第二个原因是，除了与泰国达成的一项假定的潜艇协议和为缅甸提供的一揽子武器之外，东南亚国家已经厌倦了中国的欺凌行为，“不会碰他们”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">至少中国不用担心来自印度的竞争。尽管付出了很多努力，印度作为武器出口国的增长仍然缓慢。纳伦德拉·莫迪政府列出了大量必须在印度制造的武器零部件；它希望国产轻型坦克和火炮能够在本世纪末投入使用。但印度长期以来一直依赖俄罗斯根据飞机、坦克和军舰的生产许可协议转让技术，但这些技术未能交付。投资通过国有机构进行浪费。繁文缛节扼杀了主动性。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">光辉轻型战斗机等项目花了数十年时间才投入生产，但仍然充满问题。 Dhruv轻型直升机于2002年推出，已坠毁数十次。经过数十年的发展，Arjun Mk-2 坦克被证明太重，无法部署在巴基斯坦边境。本地制造的装备经常被印度自己的武装部队拒绝。 “如果他们不想要，出口就不可能，”韦泽曼先生说。韩国和土耳其展示了各国如何建立利润丰厚的军火业务来支撑国内安全。尽管印度夸夸其谈，但它给我们上了一个教训，告诉我们如何不这样做。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 17:09:42

e190yofl0">乌克兰外交部长米特罗·库莱巴 ( <span>D</span> <small>MYTRO KULEBA)</small>是一位圆滑、和蔼可亲的外交官，对最棘手的问题泰然自若。但8月31日，他的耐心崩溃了。他对记者说：“批评反攻步伐缓慢就等于……向每天牺牲生命的乌克兰士兵脸上吐口水。” “我建议所有批评者闭嘴，到乌克兰来，尝试自己解放一平方厘米。”这次爆发是由美国媒体连续几周的报道引发的，其中匿名官员对乌克兰在战场上<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/08/16/ukraines-counter-offensive-is-making-progress-slowly">进展缓慢</a>提出了质疑，并质疑其军事策略。排的很不体面。但乌克兰的做法有效吗？</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">同盟国关于战略的争论并不罕见。在乌克兰于六月发动反攻之前的几个月里，美国和英国官员与乌克兰密切合作。他们提供情报和建议，进行详细的战争游戏以模拟不同的攻击可能如何发挥作用，并帮助设计和训练获得大部分西方装备的旅。即便如此，乌克兰——因四月份发现的美国情报文件大泄露而感到刺痛——仍然保留了自己的立场。它推迟了进攻的开始，并将计划牢牢地藏在心里。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">争论的一大焦点是乌克兰在今年上半年做出的继续争夺巴赫穆特的决定，<a

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">即使反攻开始后，争吵仍然持续。美国官员鼓励乌克兰将兵力集中在南部攻击的主轴上，即亚速海。相反，乌克兰将其兵力分散，目的是将俄罗斯人拉向更长的战线。最有经验的旅，大部分装备较旧的装备，被留在巴赫穆特，他们正在该镇的侧翼取得适度进展。一位消息人士称，政治在军事战略中发挥着无益的作用，巴赫穆特周围人脉广泛的旅获得的稀缺弹药份额比单纯的军事考虑所保证的要多。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">与此同时，乌克兰在更重要的南轴部署了经验不足的旅，装备了较新的装备。他们很快陷入了俄罗斯大炮、无人机和直升机覆盖的密集雷区。未经考验的指挥官犯了一系列错误，例如撞上友军地雷和错误地发动攻击。俄罗斯武装部队专家迈克尔·科夫曼（Michael Kofman）和罗布·李（Rob Lee）在《岩石战争》上发表的一篇文章中写道：“如果经验丰富的乌克兰旅配备了新装备，他们可能就不会犯新旅所犯的许多错误。”一本在线日记。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">早期失误的部分责任应归咎于那些帮助策划反攻的人。伦敦智库皇家联合服务研究所 ( <small>RUSI</small> ) 的杰克·沃特林 (Jack Watling) 和尼克·雷诺兹 (Nick Reynolds) 在最近发表的一篇论文中认为，这次攻击在一定程度上依赖于过时的假设，这些假设没有考虑到新型传感器和传感器带来的威胁。无人机。他们的结论是：“支持乌克兰国际合作伙伴试图训练乌克兰军队采用的战术的大部分数据都是基于 20 世纪的作战分析，而这些分析与乌克兰使用的一系列技术并不相抗衡。”俄罗斯的防御工事也比西方规划者想象的<a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/07/03/how-ukraines-enemy-is-also-learning-lessons-albeit-slowly">要坚固得多</a>。 </p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JtVE4Wp5Z1A?enablejsapi=1" class="css-wc7bct e1wp1ol0"></iframe><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">无论哪里出了问题，很明显哪里出了问题。 “基辅似乎没有可以在袭击停止的情况下迅速实施的应急计划，”穆兹卡先生指出。最终，乌克兰指挥官决定保留重型装甲，转而采用更简单的方法。 <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/07/09/sappers-risk-their-lives-to-win-ukraine-back-inch-by-inch">成群结队的工兵</a>通常用肚子爬行，现在用手清理雷区。排和连，而不是旅，在林线之间作战，徒步前进，以达到较小的目标。 <small>RUSI</small>论文指出，这有助于限制人员和装备的损失，但每五天只能前进 700 至 1,200 米，让俄罗斯军队有时间“重置”他们的防御（这一速度最近可能有所回升） 。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这引发了两场争论。一是乌克兰指挥官是否过于规避风险。一些西方官员认为，如果乌克兰按照计划进行更大胆、更大规模的袭击，他们一开始的伤亡会更大，但突破俄罗斯防线的运气会更好，从而缩短攻势并减少总体伤亡。乌克兰官员反驳说，这只会导致更多流血，军官们不能指望一支严重耗尽的公民军队会模仿俄罗斯的人海袭击。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">第二个争论是乌克兰应该效仿西方的战争方式还是开辟自己的道路。西方武装部队推崇联合兵种机动的理念，即装甲部队的行动与步兵、炮兵、防空以及（越来越多的）电子和网络攻击同步。乌克兰军队在德国接受的五周进攻前训练还不足以让他们精通此类战争。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “乌克兰人仍然受苏联教义的束缚，”一位美国官员抱怨道。重型炮火取代了更明智和精确的攻击，是紧张局势的根源之一，尤其是因为美国在为乌克兰枪支采购弹药方面发挥着主导作用。这位官员表示：“他们的心态……和策略需要时间来改变。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><small>美国海军陆战队</small>退役炮兵军官、军事战术书籍作者 BA Friedman 表示，事实上，乌克兰的做法是符合目的的。 1918 年春，经过第一次世界大战西线多年的僵局，德国军队意识到大型部队太容易受到炮火的攻击。他们的解决方案是规模更小、更灵活、训练有素的“冲锋队”，他们可以越过敌方防线并夺取领土，重型部队随后上前。 “由于乌克兰没有能力在任何相关规模上使用<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/08/22/how-soon-will-ukraine-be-able-to-use-its-f-16s">空中力量</a>，因此按照空中力量成熟之前的方式解决问题是完全有意义的，”弗里德曼先生说。许多欧洲军官承认，他们自己训练有素、装备精良的军队很难突破苏罗维金防线。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">关于战斗的战斗</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">弗里德曼表示，美国官员没有能力提供有关战术最佳实践的经验教训。他们最近的大部分战斗经验都是在山区或沙漠地区进行的，这些地区的小部队无法利用掩护以这种方式前进。他指出，美国地面部队的两个主要训练中心，即位于欧文堡的陆军训练中心和位于二十九棕榈村的海军陆战队训练中心，都位于加利福尼亚州的沙漠环境中。 “无论是在战斗中还是在训练中，<small>美军</small>在面对乌克兰所面临的情况时都缺乏经验。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">问题是：乌克兰也没有。沃特林和雷诺兹认为，过去 18 个月里军官的减员和乌克兰军队的急剧扩张意味着乌克兰缺乏足够的具有进攻行动专业知识的初级领导人。他们说，结果是决定被交给了更高级的军官，这让已经有很多事情要做的旅指挥部不堪重负。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img width="608" sizes="300px"

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">他们举了今年夏天早些时候乌克兰袭击顿涅茨克省里夫诺波尔村的例子。攻击者应该释放烟雾来掩盖他们的行动并迷惑敌人。但乌克兰的炮火任务中只有 3% 涉及烟雾，部分原因是高级指挥官不想让盘旋的无人机遮蔽他们对战斗的看法。教训是，乌克兰需要更多值得信赖的下级军官，即使他们的老板无法从远处观看，他们也能采取主动。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">培训质量也很重要。沃特林和雷诺兹认为，西方训练设施受到“<small>北约</small>安全文化”的阻碍。无人机是乌克兰战术的核心，它可以让炮兵部队发现目标，让步兵进行侦察。然而，大多数<small>北约</small>训练区对无人机的飞行时间和方式实行严格限制，担心它们会偏离航线。安全规则还意味着炮兵技能通常是在课程后期教授的。但在乌克兰，“没有准备好应对火炮的部队就没有做好战斗的准备，” <small>RUSI</small>分析师写道。欧洲的健康和安全规则不太适合国家生存之战。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这些问题大部分不会在当前的反攻中得到解决。如果乌克兰想要取得任何突破，最终将需要重新引入机械化和装甲部队。这可能会变得更容易：第一道防线之外的雷区密度较小。人们认为它有足够的弹药来度过整个秋天。但9月10日，美国最高将领马克·米利表示，乌克兰可能还剩下30到45天的战斗时间，之后<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/10/the-particular-problems-of-fighting-in-the-ukrainian-autumn">雨水和泥浆</a>将使车辆难以前进。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最近几周，乌克兰在南部取得了更快的进展，突破<a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/06/how-the-pentagon-assesses-ukraines-progress">了俄罗斯在扎波罗热的Robotyne村周围三道防线中的第一道</a>，通过向东推进到Verbove，然后向Novoprokopivka村进攻，扩大了由此产生的突出部（见地图）。 9月13日，它用导弹袭击了俄罗斯黑海舰队使用的克里米亚造船厂，导致船只起火。俄罗斯不得不从其第76空中突击师中调出后备力量；但它之所以能够做到，是因为乌克兰在八月份投入了自己的力量。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">目前尚不清楚双方还剩下多少新鲜人力。消耗率似乎有利于乌克兰而不是俄罗斯，但消息人士表示，俄罗斯可能仍然可以筹集足够的储备来填补漏洞。穆齐卡先生总结道：“除非俄罗斯防线崩溃，否则我们在过去三个月中看到的战斗很可能会在未来几个月继续看到。”他认为，只有部署更大规模的编队，超出乌克兰的能力，会加快速度。 <i>《经济学人》</i>咨询的数十名西方官员也对冬季之前能否取得重大突破表示怀疑。 “我们必须延长我们的时间表，”其中一位说道。 “这可能是一场非常漫长的斗争。” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 12 Sep 2023 17:29:33 GMT</pubDate><guid
