class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"><span data-caps="initial">最近</span><small>几天，</small>佛罗里达州州长罗恩德桑蒂斯和唐纳德特朗普共和党提名的主要竞争对手选择通过推特宣布他竞选白宫。由社交网络所有者埃隆·马斯克主持的现场音频活动因 Twitter 的服务器难以应付收听的数十万听众而陷入闹剧。德桑蒂斯先生说，当他能听到他的声音时，他决定宣布平台，因为与“传统媒体”不同，Twitter 是“言论自由的灯塔”。</p><p class="article__body-text">关于谁可以在网上说什么的争论在全球再次升温。推特是政界人士和媒体青睐的网络，由马斯克先生善变的新管理层负责，马斯克先生自称是<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/12/19/elon-musks-44bn-education-on-free-speech">言论自由的绝对主义者</a>，他恢复了特朗普先生等之前被禁用户的账户。据报道，更大的竞争对手 Meta 正准备在今年夏天推出自己的基于文本的网络。随着美国总统大选的临近，社交媒体平台将在未来 18 个月内面临考验，这是世界上最大的网络愤怒和错误信息盛会之一。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">提出监管建议的政客和法官也加入了这场争论。由于国会陷入僵局，美国的州立法机构及其法院正在围绕言论限制划定新界限。在欧洲，立法机构走得更远。这些举措正在激励世界上民主程度较低地区的政府制定自己的新规则。可以在网上说和听到的内容受到审查。</p><p class="article__body-text">监管在线公共广场是一项艰巨的任务。尽管自特朗普先生卸任和 covid-19 平息（以及相关的错误信息浪潮）以来情况有所平静，但去年全球三大社交媒体平台——Meta 旗下的 Facebook 和 Instagram，以及 YouTube 旗下的 YouTube Google 删除或屏蔽了 114 亿条帖子、视频和用户评论。自动过滤器消除了大部分内容，但 Meta 和 Google 还雇用了 40,000 多名内容审阅者。 </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url"

class="article__body-text">大多数此类管理工作都没有争议：最大的网络 Facebook 去年删除的帖子中有 90% 只是垃圾邮件。但许多剩余的适度决定是艰难的（见图表）。在最近一个季度，Facebook 删除或屏蔽了 1070 万条它认为是仇恨言论的帖子和 690 万条它认为是欺凌行为的帖子，这两个概念都存在分歧空间。就最近的一个困境而言，Meta 最近下令审查它是否对阿拉伯语单词<i>shaheed</i>的监管过于热心，该词通常被翻译为“烈士”，但其含义在不同的上下文中可能会发生变化。这些平台大多只能自己解决这些难题。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而现在，政客们正在介入。在美国，民主党人和共和党人一致认为社交网络在节制方面做得很糟糕，现在是时候修改《通信规范法》第 230 条，该条保护在线平台免受内容责任用户发布（与性交易相关的内容除外）。但他们完全不同意如何处理它。</p><p class="article__body-text">指责科技亿万富翁煽动愤怒和误导点击的民主党人希望平台删除更多内容。认为醒来的加州爱管闲事的共和党人正在扼杀保守派，希望他们减少罢工。 （根据美国智库皮尤研究中心的数据，选民怀疑科技公司支持自由主义观点的比例超过保守派观点的比例为三比一。）结果是国会陷入僵局。</p><p class="article__body-text">最高法院有机会修改第 230 条。但在 5 月 18 日，在对 YouTube 和 Twitter 这两个托管恐怖分子上传内容的类似案件的裁决中，最高法院拒绝改变现状，否认在线平台对其用户犯下的罪行负有责任。科技游说团体 NetChoice 将这一决定描述为“互联网言论自由的巨大胜利”。第 230 条目前看来是安全的。 </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">由于联邦层面运气不佳，左翼和右翼的改革者都将注意力集中在各州。去年加州通过了一项法律，强制科技公司减少收集儿童数据等。几个州已经通过或提议法律要求 18 岁以下的人在使用社交媒体之前获得父母的许可。 5 月 17 日，蒙大拿州完全禁止 TikTok，因为它在中国的所有权（TikTok 正在起诉并有望胜诉）。</p><p class="article__body-text">最具争议的是，共和党控制的佛罗里达州和德克萨斯州在 2021 年通过了限制社交网络缓和政治言论能力的法律。法院维持了得克萨斯州的法律并推翻了佛罗里达州的法律，为重返最高法院奠定了基础，预计最高法院将在今年晚些时候审理这些案件。斯坦福大学的 Evelyn Douek 说：“如果法院为这个领域的监管打开大门，许多 [州] 就会抓住这个机会。”</p><p class="article__body-text">他们将在大西洋上空有两个模型可以效仿。 2022 年 7 月通过的<small>欧盟</small><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2022/04/30/free-speech-idealism-will-clash-with-laws-and-reality">数字服务法案</a>( <small>DSA</small> ) 将于明年生效。英国制定了四年的<a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/05/25/britains-online-safety-bill-could-change-the-face-of-the-internet">在线安全法案</a>，预计将于今年晚些时候颁布。两者都采取了与美国不同的方法。他们没有改变谁对在线内容负责（第 230 条辩论的核心问题），而是迫使平台进行某种尽职调查，以将不良内容降至最低。</p><p class="article__body-text">欧洲的<small>DSA</small>要求在线平台设置投诉处理流程，并要求他们告诉用户他们的算法是如何工作的，允许他们更改收到的建议。较小的平台，即在<small>欧盟</small>拥有少于 4500 万用户的平台，将免除其中的一些义务，以防止它们淹没在繁文缛节中（一些较大的竞争对手警告说，这可能使它们成为有害材料的避风港）。律师事务所 Clifford Chance 的弗洛里安·赖林 (Florian Reiling) 表示，对于那些足够大、有资格接受全面监督的公司来说， <small>DSA</small>代表着“巨大的财务负担”。华盛顿方面抱怨称，迄今为止，在<small>欧盟</small>指定进行最严格审查的 19 个平台中，只有一个——德国电子商务网站 Zalando——是欧洲平台。</p><p class="article__body-text">自马斯克去年 10 月上任以来，Twitter 已裁员约 80%，它可能是难以满足<small>DSA</small>要求的公司之一。在一些人眼中，马斯克似乎已经接替了 Meta 的老板马克扎克伯格，成为社交媒体上最大的反派。 5 月 26 日，欧盟专员蒂埃里·布勒东 (Thierry Breton) 发推称，推特已经脱离了<small>欧盟</small>的自愿性反虚假信息行为准则。 “你可以跑，但你不能躲，”他补充道。</p><p class="article__body-text">英国的平行立法努力正在形成更加深远的影响。在线安全法案是在 2019 年一名 14 岁儿童因大量使用算法推荐的抑郁材料自杀后构想出来的。四任总理之后，该法案的文本长度几乎翻了一番。一家美国科技公司称其为“我们在世界任何地方面临的最复杂的账单之一”。</p><p class="article__body-text">它对平台主动筛选材料的措辞宽松的要求比<small>欧盟</small>走得更远。较大的社交网络已经检查视频是否与已知的虐待儿童内容相匹配。但更微妙的犯罪，如煽动暴力，更难自动检测。一些平台的规模——YouTube 每分钟上传 500 小时的视频——意味着对预先筛选内容的严格要求可能会限制上传的新材料的数量。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">与美国一样，英国保守派担心右翼观点过度温和。因此，该法案规定了确保适度“以同样的方式[适用于]广泛多样的政治观点”的义务。同样，作为即将出台的《欧洲媒体自由法案》的一部分，<small>欧盟</small>已承诺“保护媒体免受不正当的在线内容删除”，这是对匈牙利和波兰等成员国打击新闻的回应。</p><p class="article__body-text">英国法案中最具争议的部分，要求平台识别“合法但有害”的内容（例如，鼓励饮食失调的材料）已在涉及成年人的地方被删除。但仍有责任限制其对儿童的可用性，这反过来意味着需要进行广泛的年龄检查。科技公司表示，他们可以从用户的搜索历史和鼠标移动等方面猜测用户的年龄，但严格核实用户年龄的义务会威胁到匿名性。</p><p class="article__body-text">有些人怀疑他们真正反对的是价格。 OnlyFans 的首席运营官 Keily Blair 说：“我不认为‘这很花钱而且很难’是一个借口，这是一个以色情为中心的平台，它会检查用户的年龄，但不明白为什么其他人不应该这么做。”不要这样做。然而，一些平台态度坚决：运营维基百科的维基媒体基金会表示，它无意验证用户的年龄。</p><p class="article__body-text">英国或<small>欧盟</small>等司法管辖区的规则越严格，科技公司就越有可能在那里提供不同的服务，而不是在全球范围内应用相同的规则。有些人甚至可能会退出。 WhatsApp 是 Meta 拥有的消息应用程序，它表示不愿意打破其端到端加密以满足英国法案中公司扫描私人消息是否存在虐待儿童行为的要求。它可能不会这样：该法案将允许 Ofcom 只有在它确定这种措施是相称的情况下才要求提供数据。尽管如此，对大棒的威胁正变得越来越普遍。 5 月 24 日，OpenAI 负责人 Sam Altman 表示，如果<small>欧盟</small>对人工智能的监管走得太远，他将考虑离开欧盟（他后来又收回了自己的言论）。</p><h2>网络效应</h2><p class="article__body-text">无论英国或<small>欧盟</small>是否充分利用其新权力，它们都为可能自由使用这些权力的国家树立了一个方便的先例。根据公民自由组织电子前沿基金会的说法，英国的法案建议对违反规则的公司高管进行监禁，这是“全世界镇压的蓝图”。一位美国高管嗤之以鼻，英国声称在科技领域“世界领先”的说法只有在英国为非民主国家通过自己的压制性法律开辟道路的情况下才是真实的。</p><p class="article__body-text">他们几乎不需要鼓励。土耳其在最近的选举中命令 Twitter 审查信息；言论自由狂热者马斯克先生照办了。巴西提出了一项“假新闻法”，该法将惩罚未能识别错误信息的社交网络。它以欧洲立法为蓝本，被称为“热带地区的<small>DSA</small> ”。印度将于 6 月发布一项互联网监管法案，据报道，如果平台不同意在收到指示时识别和追踪这些用户，则该法案将对用户的内容负责。</p><p class="article__body-text">英国和<small>欧盟</small>提案的国际影响正在为美国的辩论提供信息。美国网络公司 Cloudflare 的负责人马修·普林斯 (Matthew Prince) 说：“无论你认为社交网络如何腐蚀美国政治，它们对其他违背美国利益的政权都造成了令人难以置信的破坏。 ” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 29 May 2023 17:48:03 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

class="article__body-text">过去十年，中国国防预算实际增长了约75%。它希望到 2035 年“基本完成现代化”，到 2049 年成为“世界级”军事强国。美国认为中国希望最早在 2027 年拥有入侵台湾的能力。</p><p class="article__body-text">美国的一些人质疑它的做法在一个充满竞争的世界中是否足够。尽管最近有所增加，但美国的国防预算自 2012 年以来已经缩减了约 5%。2007-09 年金融危机之后出现了支出紧缩。然而，甚至在当今时代出现严重紧张局势之前，国会就授权一个委员会考虑美国的国防开支。 2018 年，该机构建议至少五年内每年实际提高 3% 至 5%。美国战略家安德鲁·克雷皮涅维奇 (Andrew Krepinevich) 认为，在过去的一个世纪里，美国相对于其竞争对手的整体优势已经减弱。在第一次、第二次和冷战期间，美国的对手的经济规模比美国小得多。不再。今天，仅中国的<small>GDP</small>就接近美国的 80%。</p><p class="article__body-text">在冷战后的几十年里，人们的想法是，减少军队开支意味着增加基础设施和公共服务开支，并降低债务或税收。自 1960 年代以来，全球每年以当前价格“释放”约 4 万亿美元的支出，相当于全球政府用于教育的预算。现在，和平红利正在变成“战争税”。会有多重？</p><p class="article__body-text">准确计算出谁在花什么可能很困难。为了进行国际比较，国防开支通常按市场汇率计算为占<small>国内生产总值</small>的份额。按照这一衡量标准，全球军费开支似乎接近冷战后的低点，约为 2.5%。但市场汇率大大低估了中国和俄罗斯等国家国防机构的真实规模，在这些国家，一美元的军费开支可以购买更多的武器和士兵。如果大国竞争像预期的那样加剧，未来几年这一比例也将增加。在一个更加不安全的世界中，各国会武装自己，因为他们的邻国正在这样做，或者因为他们的盟友鼓励他们这样做。</p><p class="article__body-text">在武器上投入更多资金会引发几个问题。各国将购买什么，资金是否会被浪费，全球经济是否会受到损害？</p><p class="article__body-text">迄今为止，美国是世界上最大的国防开支国，它正在投入越来越多的资金用于研究和开发未来的武器。这包括高超音速导弹，赶上中国和俄罗斯； “定向能”，例如用于击落无人机和导弹的强大激光；以及人工智能和机器人技术。它还购买了其工厂生产的尽可能多的弹药——从 155 毫米炮弹到反舰导弹。乌克兰战争暴露了冲突所需的大量弹药，以及和平时期生产线无法满足这种需求的问题。</p><p class="article__body-text">中国正在全方位投资，去年支出实际增长了 4.2%。它的预算细目是不透明的，尤其是因为技术发展中的“军民融合”。它开发了一系列反介入/区域拒止 ( <small>A2/AD</small> ) 武器，其中的对地攻击导弹和反舰导弹能够深入太平洋。它还在某些类型的高超音速导弹（比弹道导弹更难拦截）方面处于领先地位。它的海军规模已经超过美国。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">美国、俄罗斯和中国也在投资于他们的核武库。美国正在升级其地面、空中和潜射核武器“三位一体”的所有支柱。俄罗斯正在研究深奥的武器，例如远程核动力波塞冬鱼雷，旨在引发水下核爆炸，宣传者吹嘘说，这种爆炸会引起破坏性的海啸。据五角大楼称，中国正在迅速扩大其核武库，到 2035 年将从数百枚核弹头增加到 1500 枚。</p><p class="article__body-text">设备也是许多较小国家的购物清单的首位。德国正在购买隐身的新型<small>F-35</small>喷气式飞机以及指挥和控制系统。波兰在陆军方面投入巨资——从美国和韩国购买坦克、榴弹炮、精确火箭等——以及战斗机。日本正在寻求远程“反击”导弹来反击中国和朝鲜。</p><p class="article__body-text">这种购物狂潮伴随着多种风险。考虑到瓶颈，一个危险是成本上升，在一个价格可能难以控制的行业，因为漫长的开发过程、不断变化的需求以及国防公司处于技术优势，以及所有相关的管理费用。</p><p class="article__body-text">美国的国防预算可能会受到政客为其选区谋取利益的一时兴起的影响。例如，国会一直拒绝让空军退役过时的飞机。就欧洲国家而言，他们在协调大规模采购方面表现不佳。咨询公司麦肯锡指出，他们使用的武器型号比美国多得多：15 种主战坦克，而美国只有一种； 20 架战斗机对 7 架，等等。</p><p class="article__body-text">更糟糕的是，国防工业特别容易贪污，反腐败组织透明国际的乔西·斯图尔特指出。这是因为围绕其许多交易的保密性、它对国家安全的重要性以及精通其技术细节的专家的“旋转门”。资金的涌入可能会使一切变得更糟。</p><p class="article__body-text">更广泛的担忧是，大型国防机构及其供应行业将通过引发通胀或放缓增长，或两者兼而有之，从而拖累全球经济。哈佛大学的肯尼斯·罗格夫 (Kenneth Rogoff) 指出，“需要提前承担大量临时支出很容易推高借贷成本”。</p><h2>通胀预期？</h2><p class="article__body-text">某些恐惧可能是错误的。以美国的国防通胀为例——军事装备买家面临的价格上涨。它的年增长率约为 5%，是几十年来的最高水平。在以前的军事集结中，这种国防膨胀急剧增加。在 20 世纪 80 年代初期，罗纳德·里根 (Ronald Reagan) 建立了美国的军事能力，它轻松地超过了整个经济范围内的价格上涨。在越南战争中，它每年一度达到 48%。</p><p class="article__body-text">即便如此，也没有什么理由相信新冷战会导致严重的通货膨胀。即使是最激烈的鹰派也没有要求国防开支（作为<small>国内生产</small>总值的一部分）回到 1960 年代或 70 年代的水平。除非大国之间发生热战，否则全球国防开支的增长不太可能超过全球<small>GDP</small>的低个位数——这意味着它对全球总需求的影响，以及对通货膨胀的影响，将同样很小。</p><p class="article__body-text">支出可以保持在历史低位，这在很大程度上是因为国防比过去更有效率。现代军队需要的人越来越少——允许军事规划者裁员（尽管服役人员的费用可能会更高）。巴西将 78% 的预算花在了人身上，而西方国家这一比例不到 50%。你有更好的机器代替人。许多规划人员哀叹每个平台的成本不断增加，但他们会随着每次迭代而改进。 “现在你可以用一架轰炸机击中几十个目标，而不是反之亦然，过去是这样，”退休空军上校 James Geurts 说，他是风险投资公司 Lux Capital 的顾问。</p><p class="article__body-text">来自美国的官方数据表明，一旦针对质量改进进行调整，导弹的名义价格自 1970 年代后期以来已下降约 30%。军机价格基本持平。今天，一个国家可以花费相对适度的资金来获得可怕的能力。因此，国防开支相对于<small>国内生产总值</small>往往会下降，特别是在和平时期。</p><p class="article__body-text">由于将军出身的总统德怀特艾森豪威尔所称的“军工联合体”的性质发生了变化，相对而言，国防可能会继续变得更好、更便宜。过去，国防部门向平民出口技术——想想全球定位系统和互联网。相反的情况越来越多，军事工业从外部引进技术。</p><h2>技术轨迹</h2><p class="article__body-text">网络安全、无人机和卫星技术横跨民用和军用领域。由埃隆·马斯克 (Elon Musk) 创立的 SpaceX 发射了美国军用卫星。乌克兰战士广泛使用他的 Starlink 卫星星座。美国国防部确定了 14 项被认为对国家安全至关重要的关键技术。这些领域中可能有 10 或 11 个正在商业化。谷歌和微软等科技公司在网络安全、数据处理和人工智能方面提供帮助。几家公司提供云计算。</p><p class="article__body-text">这一切都相当于科技公司的文化思维方式发生了变化，这些公司曾经因道德败坏而回避防御。国防技术生态系统在美国如雨后春笋般涌现，在科罗拉多州拥有大量工程专业知识；华盛顿<small>特区</small>的监管专家；洛杉矶的航空航天类型；和旧金山的投资者。但这不仅仅是美国现象。在过去十年内成立的最大的国防和航空航天公司中，大约有一半的总部设在世界其他地区。 “创始人不再想做下一个社交媒体创业公司，”美国投资公司 General Catalyst 的 Paul Kwan 说。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">硅谷的大投资者，包括 General Catalyst 和风险投资机构 Andreessen Horowitz，对广义上的国家安全越来越感兴趣。科技公司嗅到了机会。专门从事大数据分析的 Palantir 最近发布了一个由<small>AI</small>提供支持的新防御平台，以加快决策制定。国防是 2022 年风险投资交易数量超过 2021 年的少数几个行业之一。</p><p class="article__body-text">还有越来越多的努力为国防公司自身注入技术的活力。英国最近的一份议会报告指出，“旧的‘遗留’系统使任务变得像订购一双靴子一样复杂”。生产一架新飞机可能需要 10 到 20 年的时间。但是，全球最大的国防承包商洛克希德·马丁公司的老板吉姆·泰克利特说，与其每十年左右开发一次新飞机，他的公司旨在模仿硅谷，每 6 到 12 个月提供一次软件升级以提高性能。</p><p class="article__body-text">如果该行业变得更有效率，新的国防热潮对财政的影响可能不大。在过去的几十年里，防御与其他一切的权衡是尖锐的：1944 年，美国将其<small>GDP</small>的 53% 用于军事力量。但今天情况有所不同。如果世界在一夜之间将军费开支翻番（假设不增加税收或债务），则公共开支将需要削减约 5% 才能平衡收支。不容易，但也没那么难。</p><p class="article__body-text">对成长有何影响？许多历史学家认为，国防开支是对其他经济领域的消耗。确保一个国家的安全具有巨大的经济价值。但是，比如说，一旦你买了一枚导弹，它往往会被存放起来而不是投入生产使用。在第二次世界大战期间，美国的生产率增长放缓，因为人们被从田野拉到军火厂和军事单位。相比之下，战后日本和西德强制限制军费开支的同时，两国的生产率也出现了巨大的提高。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，这只是部分故事。以色列和韩国等国家将充满活力的经济与庞大的国防部门结合在一起。我们分析了世界银行从 1960 年代到 2021 年的数据，探索军费开支与<small>GDP</small>增长之间的关系。无论是在一个国家内部多年，还是国家之间在一年内，我们发现两者之间几乎没有相关性。简而言之，更多的枪支并不意味着更少的黄油。</p><p class="article__body-text">更多与国防相关的<small>研发</small>可以促进更广泛的创新。对国防能力的更多投资也可能对其他经济领域产生积极的溢出效应。加州大学伯克利分校的恩里科·莫雷蒂 (Enrico Moretti) 及其同事最近发表的一篇论文发现，“政府资助的一般<small>研发</small>——尤其是<small>国防研发——</small> [有效]提高了一个国家在特定行业创​​新方面的总支出。”</p><h2>税收和坦克</h2><p class="article__body-text">各国政府对其现金有大量相互竞争的需求：其中包括照顾老龄化人口、应对气候变化和支付更高的债务利息。一些人担心更高的税收是不可避免的，或者成本会以借贷的形式转嫁给子孙后代。许多政府将面临取消增加军费开支承诺的压力。根据最近泄露的一份情报报告，加拿大总理贾斯汀·特鲁多告诉<small>北约</small>领导人，他的国家永远不会达到 2% 的目标。目前尚不清楚日本或波兰将如何为国防的大幅提升买单。</p><p class="article__body-text">最重要的是，华盛顿的动向将决定繁荣的规模和持续时间。主流仍然希望美国保持主导地位，同时抵御俄罗斯和中国。但“美国优先”民粹主义派系的许多人希望削减对乌克兰的支持，在某些情况下，甚至是五角大楼。第三组赞成将军费开支从欧洲和中东转移到中国。第四个包含来自左翼的人物，他们希望减少国防支出，更多地用于社会事务。第一类，国际主义鹰派，似乎占了上风。对抗美国的对手是少数两党支持的问题之一。</p><p class="article__body-text">有几件事可能会推高支出。危机可能会升级——甚至将美国卷入直接战斗——迫使增兵。例如，哈里·杜鲁门 (Harry Truman) 在朝鲜战争期间监督了一位总统。如果没有冲突，未来的总统可能会选择扩军。许多人认为里根增加国防开支的决定对于使苏联破产和赢得冷战至关重要。</p><p class="article__body-text">不管怎样，一个重新武装的新时代在召唤。正如美国参谋长联席会议主席马克·米尔利将军最近对参议院说的那样：“通过战备和威慑来防止大国战争的成本非常高，但并不像打一场战争那么昂贵。”正如他解释的那样，唯一比这更昂贵的是失去一个。 <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p

“就中国而言，俄罗斯入侵乌克兰对欧洲产生了分类效应，”智库欧洲外交关系委员会的扬卡·厄特尔说。东方人士似乎对莫斯科和北京之间“无限制”的友谊持怀疑态度，就像他们对马克龙先生所说的美国“战略自主”一样持怀疑态度。与此同时，众所周知，中国仍然热衷于利用跨大西洋的分歧。</p><p class="article__body-text">找到共同的原因是繁重的，因为很难说出美国想要什么。乔·拜登总统的国家安全顾问杰克·沙利文和财政部长珍妮特·耶伦最近都让拜登政府远离“脱钩”的强硬言论，转而支持“去风险化”——过去几年也使用过这个词几个月前，欧盟委员会主席乌尔苏拉·冯德莱恩 (Ursula von der Leyen)。 （她曾打算将欧洲的风险管理政策与美国似乎更加强硬的经济离婚政策区分开来。）然而， <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2023/02/09/tensions-will-linger-over-a-chinese-balloon-downed-by-america">间谍气球事件发生</a>后不久，<small>美中</small>关系跌至 30

年的数据，这是可获得数据的最后一年。服务和子公司数据包括香港。我们将欧洲定义为其六个最大的经济体，包括英国。我们将每个国家的风险敞口作为其本国经济的一部分来衡量。</p><p class="article__body-text">欧洲六大巨头在中国的总敞口已达到其总和<small>GDP</small>的 5.6%，高于 2011 年的 3.9%。高于美国的 4.2%。范围很大：意大利和西班牙仅为 1-2%，法国和英国为 4-5%。德国是一个巨大的异常值，为 9.9%。欧洲六大巨头三分之二的风险敞口来自中国子公司的销售，而不是来自欧洲的出口。这些通常是大众汽车和<small>巴斯夫</small>等工业巨头在中国的分支机构。</p><p class="article__body-text">如果供应链出现“刚性”分裂，欧元区的国民总支出将下降 2% 以上；根据欧洲中央银行的数据，大约是美国的两倍。德国的跌幅可能会更大。同样，国际货币基金组织 4 月份的<small>一项</small>研究发现，如果西方和中国之间出现投资分歧，欧洲的<small>GDP</small>将下降 2%，是美国受到的打击的两倍多。此外，分拆将在一些依赖中国的领先欧洲公司引发危机，包括德国汽车制造商、法国奢侈品帝国和两家英国银行。</p><p class="article__body-text">新兴的去风险化政策指的是有针对性地减少与中国的联系，而不是大规模的经济脱钩。即使这与十年前的情况也有很大的不同。当时，欧洲企业仍在用中国合同塞满订单，压抑着对行业竞争加剧的疑虑。 2002 年至 2019 年，中国与<small>欧盟</small>之间的整体贸易增长了 428%。</p></div><p

2002 年的 2% 和 2012 年的 52% 上升到 2022 年的 85% 的新高（见图 2）。</p><p class="article__body-text">如果这些中国子公司完全自给自足，那么在极端情况下，它们可以与欧洲母公司分离，同时两支子公司都能继续运营：想想<small>大众</small>德国和<small>大众</small>中国。结果将是欧洲大公司（其中许多实际上不是欧洲人）股东的巨大财富损失，但对欧洲经济的损害较小。实际上，这种向“一个公司，两个系统”的转变才刚刚开始，对于许多大公司来说，脱钩将造成严重的破坏。</p><p class="article__body-text">去风险化的最后一个要素是对进入欧洲的中国投资进行更严格的审查。随着对欧洲的外来投资进行安全风险筛查，战略基础设施越来越成为中国投资者的禁区。根据纽约咨询公司<small>merics</small>和 Rhodium Group 的一项研究，去年中国对欧洲的整体投资降至 2013 年以来的最低点。荣鼎咨询估计，中国在欧洲的对外直接投资早在 2016 年就达到顶峰。</p><p class="article__body-text">去风险化的出现无可厚非，但欧洲的中间道路却坑坑洼洼。仍然热衷于中国梦的大公司可能会拒绝搭顺风车。一位欧洲资深实业家表示：“中国在技术上存在某些禁区，但在其他方面我们并没有脱钩；一切如常，越多越好。”马克龙先生在北京时，欧洲飞机制造商空中客车公司同意在天津扩建装配线，并确认向中国出售 160 架飞机的订单。

Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania&#39;s foreign minister, retorted tartly that, at a time when Europeans depend on America&#39;s backing of Ukraine, they should be trying to preserve transatlantic unity rather than “begging for dictators to help secure peace in Europe”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Officials in Paris note, as Mr Macron eventually did, that it is official French policy to support the status quo over Taiwan. With naval bases and territories in the Indo-Pacific, France has direct interests in the region. “The problem isn&#39;t French policy but the disconnect between what we do and what Macron says, which creates unnecessary doubts among our partners,” notes Antoine Bondaz, at the Foundation for Strategic Research, a French think-tank. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> One virtue of Mr Macron&#39;s comments, notes a Scandinavian minister, is that they have prompted Europeans to talk more about China. Many on the continent fret about escalatory American rhetoric. On May 12th the <small>eu</small> ’s foreign ministers managed to agree to a set of principles for future dealings with the country. It will be discussed at the <small>eu</small> ’s next summit in June.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The bloc&#39;s deliberations in the coming months will depend heavily on France and Germany, which are its two biggest economies, and among the most exposed to China, and some of the least keen on cutting commercial ties. Mr Macron has long pushed Europe to become more self-reliant. Mr Scholz, faced with divergent views in his coalition government and a strong industry lobby, is still working on a national strategy that will shape Germany&#39;s approach to China (which keeps on being delayed). He is expected to host a bilateral summit with the country next month.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Much of eastern Europe seems wary of Chinese influence. The country&#39;s <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/01/22/what-chinas-bullying-of-lithuania-reveals-about-europe">bullying of Lithuania</a> in recent years over a Taiwanese diplomatic office in the country disgusted many. That is in spite of the fact that central and eastern Europe received some €3.8bn through China&#39;s clubby “16+1” initiative between 2000 and 2017. Comments made last month by Lu Shaye, the Chinese ambassador to France, helped focus minds. He appeared to dispute the legal status of all former Soviet countries (even if China later corrected his remarks).</p><h2> The end of the affair?</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Europe needs a measured debate about what to do next. France and Germany both have reservations about Mrs von der Leyen&#39;s de-risking measures, but they back the principle. Outward investment screening is under discussion, though will be difficult to put into practice. Inward investment screening is up and running, although Europeans disagree on how much to tighten the rules.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Beyond de-risking, collective <small>eu</small> policy has not been thought through. That is in spite of the fact that de-risking doesn&#39;t provide an answer to a scenario in which relations between America and China were to rupture. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, the transatlantic alliance has stood remarkably firm. A Chinese move on Taiwan would prove an even more dangerous, and far more difficult, test. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 15 May 2023 19:59:43 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/3ot5roakj7ad6okvm2jegeip06cjm00d</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/05/15/europe-cant-decide-how-to-unplug-from-china </item><item><title><![CDATA[After 12 years of blood, Assad’s Syria rejoins the Arab League]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Syrian President Bashar al-Assad President al-Assad performs Eid al-Fitr prayers at President Hafez al-Assad mosque Syrian President Bashar al-Assad President al-Assad performs Eid al-Fitr prayers at President Hafez al-Assad mosque in Damascuss, on April 21, 2023.

Syria has been suspended from the league since 2011, when Mr Assad began a brutal crackdown on anti-government protests that plunged the country into civil war (see map). On May 7th, however, the body agreed to readmit Syria and said it would invite Mr Assad to a summit in Saudi Arabia on May 19th.</p><p class="article__body-text"> An invitation from a dull talking shop crammed with dictators may seem hollow. For Mr Assad, though, it is the culmination of a long effort to end his Arab isolation—and, he may hope, another step towards <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/05/11/the-rehabilitation-of-syrias-dictator-raises-awkward-questions-for-the-west">acceptance in the West</a> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> His regime has done nothing so far to merit a renewed embrace: neither making concessions towards political reform nor taking accountability for war crimes, nor trying to bring home Syria&#39;s 6m refugees, most of them in neighbouring countries. Before the war the country had some 22m people; roughly half of them had to flee either abroad or elsewhere in Syria because of it. He rules a kleptocracy that floods the Gulf with illicit drugs and maintains close ties with Iran, an arch-rival to some Arab states. Poverty is widespread. Yet even the bloodiest dictator, it seems, can find a road to diplomatic redemption—if he simply causes enough problems for others.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That is one lesson from his return to the world stage. Another is that the autocrats and warlords who court Russian support are likely to end up disappointed. Mr Assad needs the Arab world—and the wealthy Gulf states in particular—because Russia cannot rebuild his ruined country. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Better still, for him, would be a rapprochement with the West, which has placed his regime under sanctions meant to deter reconstruction. Those on the energy sector, for example, bar firms from building new power plants or supplying equipment. Would-be investors in the Gulf are even jittery about small-scale solar-energy projects, fearing they might run afoul of the measures. So a rapprochement seems unlikely. But talk of one raises an unsavoury question, one that has echoes from Venezuela to Zimbabwe: if a regime endures and sanctions fail to force change, should they be maintained despite their toll on civilians?</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Assad was never entirely a pariah in his own region. Algeria declined to cut ties with his regime. Egypt briefly did, under its short-lived democratic government, but restored them after a military coup in 2013. Still, the past decade was lonely. When Mr Assad arrived in the United Arab Emirates ( <small>uae</small> ) for an official visit last year, it was his first trip to an Arab country in 11 years.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The <small>uae</small> was among the first to break his isolation when it reopened its embassy in Damascus in 2018 and urged allies to do the same. The massive earthquakes that struck Syria (and Turkey) in February gave a larger jolt to <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/02/16/bashar-al-assad-does-not-want-to-let-a-calamity-go-to-waste">Syria&#39;s diplomatic standing</a> . Many Arab leaders had wanted to reach out to Mr Assad; the disaster gave them an excuse, as they called to offer condolences and co-ordinate aid.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There are several reasons why they sought normalisation. One is a broader spirit of detente. The Saudis struck a deal in March with Iran to restore diplomatic ties and reopen embassies. After years of proxy wars in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere, both sides were keen to lower tensions and shore up their positions at home. Turkey and Egypt, mired in mutual economic crises, are trying to end a decade of animosity. Gulf states have ended their embargo of Qatar, their tiny, wayward neighbour on the Arabian peninsula, which accomplished little. Old foes across the region are keen to pretend they are friends. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> When it comes to Syria, however, they want something bigger in return. Its neighbours hope to get rid of millions of Syrian refugees. The <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/04/lebanons-government-is-squeezing-out-syrian-refugees">2m or so in Lebanon</a> , with a population of just 5m, are seen as a burden, blamed unfairly for the country&#39;s economic collapse. In Turkey the mood has also turned hostile. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the main opposition candidate in the election on May 14th, vows to <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/03/02/syrian-earthquake-survivors-in-turkey-have-nowhere-to-go">send Syrians packing</a> within two years if elected.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some also wager that closer ties with Mr Assad could peel him away from Iran. After relying for years on Iranian military support, his country is now a base for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hizbullah and other armed groups linked to Iran. Their presence is unsettling for countries including Saudi Arabia and Jordan, which see Iran as a menace.</p><p class="article__body-text"> No one should be too hopeful. Some in the sprawling Syrian diaspora have built decent lives in their adopted countries, although others are consigned to squalor, living in tents and surviving on handouts. Few, however, wish to return to Syria. They are unlikely to—at least not by choice—unless the regime makes both political reforms and progress on reconstruction.</p><p class="article__body-text"> As for Iran, it is hard to imagine Mr Assad booting out the forces that kept him in power. When Ebrahim Raisi, the arch-conservative Iranian president, visited Damascus this month, he was treated to a musical number extolling Iran. Many Syrians doubt that their president, whose capital is ringed by Iranian militias, would even have the power to push them out.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Still, Syria may make a few gestures. It has become the world&#39;s leading producer of Captagon, an amphetamine that is a popular recreational drug in the Gulf. Authorities in the <small>uae</small> seized almost 36m tablets in 2020, hidden inside a shipment of electric cables. The following year Saudi customs officials found 20m pills in a cargo of grapefruit. Jordan says it intercepted 17m pills in the first four months of 2022, up from 15m in all of 2021 and just 1.4m in 2020. Border guards have been killed in shoot-outs with armed smugglers.</p><p class="article__body-text"> For every high-profile bust, many shipments go undetected. The <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/07/19/syria-has-become-a-narco-state">scale of the Captagon trade</a> is often exaggerated. The British government put its annual value at $57bn, a patently absurd figure, larger than the <small>gdp</small> of Jordan or the combined annual revenue of Mexico&#39;s drug cartels. The real figure is probably an order of magnitude smaller—but that is still large enough to make it Syria&#39;s top export. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230513_IRC123.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> The past 12 years have been good for the small clique of drug dealers and war profiteers around the president. For everyone else in Syria, they have been miserable. The Syrian pound, stable at around 50 to the dollar before the war, now trades at around 6,500 according to an official rate published by the country&#39;s central bank (see chart) and at 8,700 on the black market. Official statistics are unreliable, but annual inflation is probably above 100%. Syria exports just $1bn-worth of licit goods a year, down from $11bn before the war. The government is able to provide only a few hours of electricity a day.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Assad owes his survival partly to Russia, which in 2015 sent thousands of troops and dozens of warplanes to back his regime. What it helped destroy, though, it has done little to rebuild. In 2019 and 2020, with much fanfare, Russian officials announced projects worth billions of dollars for Syria: a modernised electricity network, a grain hub at the port of Tartus, a cross-country railway. Years later the country still endures blackouts and wheat shortages; its trains sit idle.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Lately Russia has stopped making even empty promises. Bogged down in Ukraine, mired in its own sanctions, it has little to offer. Vladimir Putin has secured his own narrow interests in Syria: a naval base at Tartus and some phosphate-mining concerns, among other things. Those interests do not extend to providing homes and jobs for impoverished Syrians.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Other aspiring presidents-for-life should take note. The Wagner Group, a mercenary outfit that fought in Syria, also has a presence in Sudan, where it oversees a gold-mining operation. It works closely with <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/05/11/what-the-west-gets-wrong-about-peacemaking-in-sudan" data-tegid="r2qgo30vrm2vvubej1e0i7mrifjskmp6">Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo</a> (known as Hemedti), a warlord whose paramilitary Rapid Support Forces are now fighting the Sudanese army for control of the country. Russia has been happy to send men and munitions to support his fighters; it is unlikely to kick in much for reconstruction. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> If Syria is to be rebuilt, the money will have to come from elsewhere. Western governments, understandably, are loth to foot the bill. The Gulf states might be more willing—if it wins them either political influence or economic returns.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Officially, America opposes this: it wants Mr Assad to remain a pariah. Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, called his Jordanian counterpart on May 4th and reiterated that America would not recognise the regime and “does not support others normalising”. The <small>eu</small> has also maintained a tough line, even though some countries in central and southern Europe would prefer to restore ties (in the hope of getting rid of their Syrian-refugee populations). In private, though, Arab diplomats say the Americans gave them a “yellow light” to reach out to the Assad regime. Try it, they were told—but make sure you get something out of it.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The Captagon crisis shows why this is a fraught endeavour. Western officials make a straightforward argument: since Mr Assad created the problem, restoring ties with his regime would reward him for flooding the region with drugs. Arab leaders think the diagnosis is correct but the prescription is not. If Mr Assad is using drugs as leverage, they say, the only solution is to work with him. They risk endless blackmail. Perhaps Mr Assad will stem the flow—but he can easily turn it back on when he wants further concessions.</p><p class="article__body-text"> At the same time, though, Western policy is fanciful. America wants Mr Assad to abide by <small>un</small> Security Council resolution 2254, which calls for a ceasefire, a new constitution and free elections in Syria. A less odious Syrian government would probably not want the country to be a narco-state. Unsurprisingly, though, Mr Assad has shown no interest in such reforms in what has been a hereditary dictatorship since 1971. Arab states are probably too optimistic about what their outreach can achieve—but shunning him has already failed. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 09 May 2023 18:53:32 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/p74kr1mrd9ro58nqm3l8lbg62a7vmovt</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/05/09/after-12-years-of-blood-assads-syria-rejoins-the-arab-league </item><item><title><![CDATA[The 2023 crony-capitalism index]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230506_IRD001.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">O</span> <small>ver the</small> past 20 years, Britain&#39;s capital was so welcoming to oligarchs that it became known as <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/03/05/the-rise-and-fall-of-londongrad">“Londongrad”</a> .

Some 65% of the increase has come from America, China, India and Russia. Overall 40% of crony-capitalist wealth derives from autocratic countries and amounts to 9% of their <small>gdp</small> . There are hundreds of billionaires around the world whose riches are largely believed to derive from sectors which often feature chummy dealings with the state.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The way we estimate all this is to start with data from <i>Forbes.</i> The magazine has published an annual stock-take of the world&#39;s wealthy for nearly four decades. In 1998 it reckoned that there were 209 billionaires with a total worth of $1trn, equivalent to 3% of global <small>gdp</small> . This year the publication details 2,640 billionaires worth $12trn or 12% of <small>gdp</small> . Most of those listed do not operate in rent-seeking sectors. Adjusting for rising prices—$1bn in 1998 is now equivalent to $3.3bn—there are 877 billionaires (at 1998 prices) with a collective worth of $9trn.</p><p class="article__body-text"> We classify the source of wealth into rent-seeking and non-rent-seeking sectors. An economic rent is the surplus remaining once capital and labour have been paid which, with perfect competition, tends towards zero. Rent-seeking is common in sectors close to the state, including banking, construction, property and natural resources. It can sometimes be possible for rent-seekers to inflate their earnings by gaining favourable access to land, licences and resources. They may form cartels to limit competition or lobby the government for cosy regulations. They may bend rules, but do not typically break them. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/967/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/967/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/318/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/477/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/636/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/954/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1018/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1272/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1590/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2036/90/media-assets/image/20230506_IRC015.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Russia is, once again, the most crony-capitalist country in our index (see chart 2). Billionaire wealth from crony sectors amounts to 19% of <small>gdp</small> . The effects of the Ukrainian war are clear, however. Crony wealth declined from $456bn in 2021 to $387bn this year. Only one-fifth of Russian billionaires&#39; wealth is derived from non-crony sectors, which shows just how distorted the economy is.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In March last year, the <small>g7</small> , the <small>eu</small> and Australia launched the Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs ( <small>repo</small> ) Task Force to “isolate and exert unprecedented pressure on sanctioned Russian individuals”. A year later it announced that it had blocked or frozen $58bn of assets. But <small>repo</small> admits that in some cases oligarchs have found it easy to evade sanctions by using shell companies, passing assets to family members or investing in property. Wealth is increasingly stored in manicured lawns and marble columns.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Pressure on the oligarchs comes from Russia, too. In March Mr Putin chastised them for becoming “dependent on foreign authorities” by hiding their assets offshore. Mr Putin is a hypocrite. By one estimate he has stolen more than $100bn from Russia—which has helped pay for a compound on the Black Sea estimated to cost $1.4bn and a $700m yacht impounded by the Italian authorities last year. But he is not on the <i>Forbes</i> billionaires&#39; list.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Our index illuminates other trends among the mega-wealthy. Many of America&#39;s 735 billionaires have been hit by the crash in tech stocks last year; three-fifths of global tech-billionaire wealth originates there. The country&#39;s <small>nasdaq</small> composite, a tech-tilted index, lost about a third of its value between November 2021 and December 2022. We reckon American tech billionaires saw their riches decline by 18%. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Overall crony-sector wealth amounts to around 2% of <small>gdp</small> in America, whereas non-crony-sector wealth is 15%. But tech exhibits some crony characteristics. America&#39;s 20 biggest tech companies raked in half of all the industry&#39;s sales in 2017, making it the country&#39;s most concentrated sector. Tech firms are among the biggest lobbyists in Washington, with eight firms collectively spending $100m last year. Reclassify tech as a crony industry in our index and America&#39;s crony wealth increases to 6% of <small>gdp</small> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> Meanwhile, Chinese billionaires continue to struggle with the vagaries of their government. Since Xi Jinping launched a crackdown on private capital, crony wealth has fallen sharply, from a peak of 4.4% of <small>gdp</small> in 2018 to 2.5% now. Tycoons of all stripes operate only with the consent of the state. In 1998 there were just eight billionaires in the country (including Hong Kong and Macau), with a total worth of $50bn. Now its 562 billionaires command $2trn.</p><p class="article__body-text"> By our measure crony capitalists account for about one-quarter of that total. A recent working paper published by the Stone Centre on Socio-Economic Inequality, part of the City University of New York, finds that between 83% and 91% of corrupt senior officials were in the top 1% of the urban income distribution because of their illegal incomes. Without that money, just 6% would be in that bracket.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Since Mr Xi came to power in 2012 over 1.5m people have been punished in an ongoing anti-corruption drive. High-profile tycoons also face more scrutiny. When Jack Ma, a co-founder of the tech giant Alibaba, disappeared in late 2020 after criticising the authorities, he was worth nearly $50bn. He recently re-emerged worth half of what he had been. Bao Fan, a billionaire banker, was whisked away in February to help with an investigation. He has not been seen since.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Official talk of “common prosperity” has created a cottage industry for getting money out of China. Singapore is a prime destination for it. In 2019 the country had just 33 Chinese family offices—firms which manage a family&#39;s assets. There were perhaps 750 by the end of 2022.</p><p class="article__body-text"> India&#39;s leader, Narendra Modi, has favourites among the country&#39;s corporate captains. Over the past decade, wealth from crony-capitalist sectors has risen from 5% to nearly 8% of its <small>gdp</small> . Gautam Adani, the owner of the conglomerate of the same name, was briefly the world&#39;s third-richest person in September. But in January his company was accused of fraud and stockmarket manipulation by Hindenburg Research, an American short-seller. It denies all accusations. His wealth has fallen from $90bn to $47bn.</p><h2> Don&#39;t take a slice of my pie</h2><p class="article__body-text"> What happens when cronyism gets completely out of control? If elites so enrich themselves that they impoverish a country, a “kleptocracy” forms, declared Stanislav Andreski, a Polish sociologist. He warned against such regimes and their effects in the late 1960s. It has taken more than 50 years for Western countries to heed him.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Identifying kleptocracy is more art than science. Our findings correlate only somewhat to indices of democracy and corruption. And in any case, at what level does corruption destroy the functions of the state? <small>usaid,</small> America&#39;s agency for international development, issued an 84-page “dekleptification” guide last year. After studying 13 countries including Brazil, Malaysia and Ukraine, it recommends breaking up corrupt monopolies and digitising ownership registries, among other important measures. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> America is also trying to whip up international fervour for a crackdown. In March it hosted its second “summit for democracy”. Seventy-four countries representing two-thirds of global <small>gdp</small> declared that, among other things, they would work to “prevent and combat corruption”. Russia and China were understandably missing. Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa were among those less understandably so.</p><p class="article__body-text"> At the summit Janet Yellen, America&#39;s treasury secretary, pointed out that “kleptocrats launder kickbacks through anonymous purchases of foreign real estate”. So starting next year America will require firms formed or operating in the country to reveal their real, or “beneficial”, owners. Another 36 countries have signed up to America&#39;s declaration to make concealing identity more difficult. But transparency is not a silver bullet. Last year a new law in Britain required foreign businesses that own property assets to register themselves and disclose their true owners. A report in February by an anti-corruption watchdog found that the owners of 52,000 of the 92,000 properties subject to the new rule remained undisclosed. Shady owners skirt rules and registries often lack the resources to police them.</p><p class="article__body-text"> America also frets about “golden” visas, which sell citizenship for a chunk of cash. Five Caribbean tax havens sell passports which provide visa-free travel to around 150 countries for $100,000-150,000 each. Britain&#39;s tier-one visa scheme, launched in 2008, gave permanent residency within five years to foreigners who could prove they had £1m ($1.25m) to invest in British bonds or shares. It closed a week before the war in Ukraine started because of fears about Russian money (talk about closing the stable door once the thoroughbred has bolted). Of the 13,777 visas issued, a fifth went to Russians (including ten to oligarchs now under sanctions), a third to Chinese.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Back in London, a warning lies in Highgate cemetery. There you can find the grave of Alexander Litvinenko, not far from oligarch mansions (and also Karl Marx&#39;s tomb). He was murdered in 2006 by Russian agents with a dose of polonium-210 after making lurid allegations about Mr Putin&#39;s circle. Litvinenko is buried in a specially sealed lead-lined casket to prevent radiation leaking out. Now Western authorities need to prevent hazardous assets seeping into their countries. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 02 May 2023 20:15:51 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/1s4o191p8p5afdmfjvr07lkppo064kml</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/05/02/the-2023-crony-capitalism-index </item><item><title><![CDATA[How the war split the mafia]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230429_IRD001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230429_IRD001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230429_IRD001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230429_IRD001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230429_IRD001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230429_IRD001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230429_IRD001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230429_IRD001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230429_IRD001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230429_IRD001.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p class="article__body-text"> <i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-war">Ukraine war</a></i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 24 Apr 2023 18:31:13 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/n1e3pr79tdd2bp67pd0c9bhkg56bjb6m</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/04/24/how-the-war-split-the-mafia </item><item><title><![CDATA[The world’s deadliest war last year wasn’t in Ukraine]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="KHARTOUM, SUDAN - APRIL 18: A view of vehicles of RSF, damaged after clashes between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Khartoum, Sudan on April 18, 2023.

The army&#39;s head is battling a militia boss for control of Africa&#39;s third-largest country. General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudan&#39;s de facto ruler, runs a military junta that keeps delaying a promised handover of power to civilians. Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo (better known as “Hemedti”), leads paramilitaries called the Rapid Support Forces, which in an earlier guise committed genocide in Darfur.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Both sides have the kind of ambition that often leads to bloodshed in countries with few checks and balances. They crave unaccountable power and the perks that come with it. The army already has a vast, shady business empire; Hemedti has reportedly made a fortune from gold mines and selling military services abroad. Neither man seems willing to share power. Each calls the other a “criminal”. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Yet Sudan&#39;s misfortunes are not simply the fault of these two odious men. The country has been tormented by civil war for most of the time since independence in 1956. It is an example of a global problem: the increasing persistence of conflict.</p><p class="article__body-text"> As attention is focused on great-power rivalry between America, Russia and China, conflicts in the rest of the world are getting worse. The number of people who have been forced to flee their homes has doubled in the past decade, to roughly 100m. Even as global poverty has retreated, the number of desperate people needing emergency aid has doubled since 2020, to 340m. Some 80% of this is driven by conflict, estimates the International Rescue Committee ( <small>irc</small> ), an <small>ngo</small> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> Since 1945, conflicts have come in three overlapping waves. First, people in European colonies struggled for independence. Then, rival groups fought for control of these newly independent states. The cold war raised the stakes: the West backed insurgencies against governments that professed to be Marxist, from Angola to Nicaragua. The Soviet Union supported anti-capitalist guerrillas and revolutionary regimes on every continent.</p><p class="article__body-text"> After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the number of wars fell sharply. So, too, did the estimated number of deaths in battle. But after 2011 came a third wave. Both the number of wars and their deadliness increased, as the Arab spring led to conflagrations in the Middle East, a new form of jihadism spread across the Muslim world and Vladimir Putin resurrected old-fashioned Russian imperialism. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRM985.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Putin&#39;s invasion of Ukraine is unusual: a straightforward attempt by one state to conquer another and steal its territory. Most modern armed conflicts are harder to understand. They are usually civil wars, though many involve foreign meddling. They are largely in poor countries, especially hot ones like Sudan. (Indeed, they form a belt of pain around the equator—see map) They cause millions of deaths, but exactly how many is hard to estimate. Far more perish from war-induced hunger or disease than from bullets or shrapnel. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC744.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Fighting makes poor places rapidly poorer. A typical five-year civil war reduces income per head by a fifth, estimates Christopher Blattman of the University of Chicago in his book “Why We Fight”. So it is alarming that wars are lasting longer (see chart 1). The average ongoing conflict in the mid-1980s had been happening for about 13 years; by 2021 it was nearly 20 years.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There are several plausible reasons for this. First, global norms are eroding. When Russia, a permanent member of the <small>un</small> Security Council ( <small>unsc</small> ), brazenly violated the <small>un</small> ’s founding charter by invading Ukraine, murdering civilians and kidnapping children, it showed how much taboos have weakened. When China, another permanent member of the <small>unsc</small> , called Mr Putin a “dear friend” despite his indictment for war crimes, it confirmed that for some world powers, might makes right. This emboldens smaller bullies. </p></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC761.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> In Sudan, for example, hardly anyone has been held to account for mass slaughter during the country&#39;s various wars, nor for mass rape, nor the widespread enslavement of black Africans by the country&#39;s Arabic-speaking elite. General Burhan and Hemedti pretended to listen to popular demands for justice after the overthrow of a former dictator, Omar al-Bashir, who has since been convicted of corruption. But it seems unlikely that they ever planned to hand over the reins to civilians, as they were supposed to do last week.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Impunity is not the whole story, however. Other factors are causing conflicts to burn for longer. Climate change is fuelling fights over water and land. Religious extremism is spreading. Organised criminals are making the world&#39;s most unstable states even more so. And conflicts are growing more complex.</p></div><h2> The stuttering rifles&#39; rapid rattle </h2><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230422_IRC755.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Between 2001 and 2010 around five countries each year suffered more than one simultaneous war or insurgency. Now 15 do (see chart 2). Sudan has conflicts in the east, west and south. Complex wars are in general harder to end. It is not enough to find a compromise that satisfies two parties; a deal may need to please dozens of groups, any one of which may cock its Kalashnikovs again if unsatisfied.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Civil wars are also becoming more international. In 1991 only 4% of them involved significant foreign forces. By 2021 that had risen 12-fold to 48%, reckons the Uppsala Conflict Data Programme, a research project. In the past decade this process has been driven partly by America&#39;s retreat from its role as global policeman, and mid-sized powers filling the vacuum. Russia and Turkey spar over Libya and Syria; Saudi Arabia and Iran have fought a proxy war in <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/04/20/a-prisoner-swap-is-a-symbolic-step-towards-ending-the-saudi-led-war-in-yemen" data-tegid="oe3vok961gt6t55s94312flc6g08p7ev">Yemen</a> . In Sudan, Egypt supports General Burhan while Hemedti is pals with Russia.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Foreign meddling can be benign, as <small>un</small> peacekeeping operations generally are, even if they often blunder. But interventions by external powers with selfish agendas tend to make civil wars last longer and cost more lives, finds David Cunningham of the University of Maryland. The costs for external actors are lower—their own cities are not being destroyed—so they have less incentive to make peace.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Climate change is aggravating the mayhem. It does not directly cause conflict, but when pastures dry up, herders drive their hungry cattle farther afield, often encroaching on land claimed by rival ethnic groups. A review of 55 studies by Marshall Burke of Stanford University and others found that a one-standard-deviation increase in local temperature raises the chance of intergroup conflict by 11% compared with what it would have been at a more normal temperature.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> Globally, some 24m people were displaced by extreme weather in 2021, and the <small>un</small> expects that figure to soar. In Sudan, some 3m people were displaced by conflict and natural disasters even before the current round of fighting began. </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VqR021m9OTs?enablejsapi=1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text"> The bloodiest war in the world last year was not in Ukraine but in Ethiopia, notes Comfort Ero, the head of Crisis Group, a think-tank. Olusegun Obasanjo, a former president of Nigeria who helped broker a peace deal in November between the government and the Tigray region, has put deaths at 600,000 between 2020 and 2022. No estimate for Ukraine is as high.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mohammed Kamal, an Ethiopian farmer, was ploughing his fields when he heard shooting. Returning to his village, he found that gunmen had murdered 400 people, mostly women and children. “Only a small number survived,” he says. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Even if the peace deal holds, which is uncertain, it will not help Mohammed. For the massacre he witnessed was part of an entirely separate conflict, which is still blazing. While government troops were distracted by the war in Tigray, members of Ethiopia&#39;s largest ethnic group, the Oromo, revived an old insurgency, and are trying to drive other ethnic groups out of their home region. Mohammed says the gunmen who killed his neighbours were from the Oromo Liberation Army ( <small>ola</small> ), a rebel group; their victims were from the Amhara ethnic group. (The <small>ola</small> denies involvement.)</p><p class="article__body-text"> If that sounds complicated, it is actually much more so. Ethiopia has more than 90 ethnic groups, many of whose leaders are tempted to stir up hatred to win control of one of the country&#39;s 11 ethnically based regions. It hosts hundreds of thousands of refugees from four turbulent neighbours (Eritrea, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan). The dictatorship next door (Eritrea) has sent armies to fight against a previous Ethiopian government, and arm-in-arm with the current one.</p><p class="article__body-text"> War creates a vicious circle. As droughts and floods have devastated rural areas, young men with no prospects feel more tempted to pick up a gun and grab land or loot. Rebel recruiters understand this only too well. Facebook accounts linked to <small>OLA</small> show videos of young fighters celebrating with stacks of cash they have liberated from banks. With so many fighters lurking in the bush, kidnapping shopkeepers and murdering officials, businesses flee the area and public services get even worse. Locals then grow even more frustrated and angry, especially when the state responds with repression, which it often does.</p><h2> The holy glimmers of goodbyes</h2><p class="article__body-text"> To countries destabilised by bad governments and climate change, extremism adds gelignite. Consider the Sahel, a vast arid area below the Sahara desert. Five countries—Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Niger and (northern) Nigeria—suffered droughts in 2022 and the most severe food crisis in 20 years. Nearly 6m people were also hit by floods. Some 24m in these five countries are “food insecure” (meaning they struggle to feed themselves). In just one sub-region of Mali, the <small>irc</small> found no fewer than 70 conflicts in late 2021. Half were about land; a third were about water. A seventh resulted in lots of people being driven from their homes.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Into this desperate environment have stepped jihadist groups. Since the Arab spring affiliates of al-Qaeda and (later) Islamic State have spread across the Middle East, Africa and beyond. They promise justice—such as the restoration of stolen grazing land—in countries where formal courts barely function. Once they have gained a foothold, they accelerate the collapse of state authority. Between 2020 and 2022 in the five countries mentioned above, the number of schools that were closed due to violence trebled, to 9,000. Half the region&#39;s children do not feel safe in school.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In Burkina Faso rival jihadist groups have made much of the country ungovernable. Towns are besieged. The government&#39;s efforts to vanquish the jihadists often make matters worse. Trucks carrying goods to jihadist-controlled areas must have a military escort, which may or may not be available. Jihadists block roads and plant bombs on bridges. All this gums up trade and makes remote areas even poorer. The government&#39;s inability to beat the jihadists infuriates nearly everyone: the country suffered two coups in 2022.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A similar dynamic afflicts the whole of the Sahel. Instability is infectious. Farmers displaced by climate change cross unmarked borders and spark clashes. Jihadists seek havens in neighbouring countries. Their ideas spread rapidly online and in radical madrassas.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Western powers have tried to help, but failed. In November 2022 France gave up on Operation Barkhane, a military intervention to help the governments of Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger suppress jihadists. Earlier that year Mali&#39;s new military regime ordered French troops out and welcomed help from Russia&#39;s Wagner mercenary group, which has already been accused of massacring civilians.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Sebastian von Einsiedel of the United Nations University in Tokyo argues that the spread of jihadist groups makes it harder to end wars. Their demands are often impossible to meet, their footsoldiers are fanatical, and external mediators hate dealing with terrorists.</p><p class="article__body-text"><br><br></p><p class="article__body-text"> For rebel groups with no religious inspiration, mammon provides motive enough to take up arms. A study by James Fearon of Stanford University finds that civil wars in which a major rebel force earns money from illicit drugs or minerals tend to last longer. And the globalisation of crime has made it “easier than ever before” for such groups to get their hands on guns and cash, notes Mr von Einsiedel.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Government forces are often greedy, too. Among the reasons why Congo&#39;s war is “self-perpetuating”, argues Jason Stearns in his book “The War That Doesn&#39;t Say Its Name”, is that officers are paid a pittance but can make fortunes from embezzlement and extortion when deployed to combat zones. Locals complain about the “pompier-pyromane” (firefighter-pyromaniac) problem: regional strongmen who start a fire so the central government has to negotiate with them to put it out.</p><p class="article__body-text"> An extreme example of the links between crime and conflict is Haiti. In 2021 its president, Jovenel Moïse, was assassinated. No one knows who ordered the hit, but many suspect a link to the drug trade. The country has been in chaos since. Gangs that once dominated only slums now control much of the capital, Port-au-Prince. They have seized roads, market places and anywhere convenient for extorting money from terrified civilians. Joe, a school director who prefers to stay anonymous, describes how his school received a bullet in an envelope, with a demand for $50,000 protection money to keep classes open. “On the spot, we had to close the school until further notice,” he sighs. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Haiti&#39;s prime minister, Ariel Henry, is begging for a foreign military intervention to help the police restore order. Many locals would welcome it. Ralph Senecal, the boss of a private ambulance firm, who was kidnapped in October, says that only American troops can restore order. However, opposition groups fear that such an intervention would only prop up Mr Henry, who seized power after Moïse&#39;s death and is widely regarded as illegitimate.</p><p class="article__body-text"> One country in Asia illustrates all the ills that make civil wars endure. In an old wooden farm house near the Thai-Myanmar border, Ko Khaht is boiling chicken and rice. When it is cooked, he liquidises it, sucks it up with a syringe and feeds it to his injured comrade, who is missing part of his skull and cannot move or speak.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Myanmar is home to some of the world&#39;s oldest insurgencies, and some of the newest. Ko Khaht belongs to the People&#39;s Defence Force ( <small>pdf</small> ), which was set up after a military junta seized power in 2021. It is the armed wing of the National Unity Government, a parallel state of activists, politicians and ethnic leaders that aims to restore democracy. He joined it after he saw soldiers murder a man in front of his home. He packed a small bag and fled to the Thai border, where he worked in a bomb-disposal unit. He has lost his right hand, and his skin is pockmarked by shrapnel.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Myanmar&#39;s strife is staggeringly complex. Perhaps 200 armed groups control slices of territory or are fighting to overthrow the government. Some are armies seeking autonomy for large ethnic groups; others are local militias trying to defend a single village. The country has not had a conflict-free year since independence in 1948. Even compared with this violent past, though, norms have atrophied in the past two years. “There&#39;s a new level of brutality, with the tone set at the top,” says Richard Horsey of Crisis Group.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In March a company calling itself the “Ogre column” was dropped into Sagaing, central Myanmar. They went on a killing, raping and torturing spree. But rebels say such atrocities only serve to strengthen their resolve.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Climate change is at work: the insurgency has gained strength in the central dry zone, which has been made poorer by drought. Crime, too, gives many fighters a reason to keep fighting. The army is deeply enmeshed in heroin and jade smuggling, as are some ethnic militias. Mr Horsey expects the war “to grind on for a generation to come”.</p><h2> No prayers nor bells</h2><p class="article__body-text"> The world is not short of ideas for how to end wars. Find a respected mediator. Start unofficial talks long before the belligerents are prepared to meet publicly. Include more women and civil-society groups in the peace process. Accept that any peace deal is likely to be ugly. “Excluding people you don&#39;t like from politics doesn&#39;t work,” notes David Miliband, the head of the <small>irc</small> . Purging the Iraqi army of all supporters of Saddam Hussein&#39;s regime was a mistake, as was trying to build a system in Afghanistan without the Taliban. But the most important measures (build functional states in war-torn countries, curb climate change) could take decades to implement.</p><p class="article__body-text"> And global efforts to promote peace are hobbled by the fact that two veto-wielding members of the <small>unsc</small> are serial human-rights abusers that object to interference in the internal affairs of blood-spattered regimes. Russia has used its <small>unsc</small> veto 23 times in the past decade, scotching resolutions to allow more aid into Syria, investigate war crimes in the Balkans and (of course) to uphold Ukraine&#39;s sovereignty. China has issued nine. America has issued three, mostly to protect Israel; France and Britain, none at all. In 2001-10, when Mr Putin&#39;s imperial ambitions were more limited and Xi Jinping was not yet in power, Russia issued only four vetoes; China, two.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A French proposal to suspend the veto when mass atrocities are occurring passed the <small>un</small> ’s general assembly last year, but has no way past Mr Putin&#39;s veto pen. The world is entering what Mr Miliband calls “an age of impunity”. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i><b>Correction</b> : an earlier version of this article mis-stated the affiliation of Solomon Hsiang and Edward Miguel.

Our sister organisation, <small>eiu</small> , has analysed countries based on their economic and military ties to Moscow, their diplomatic stances including votes at the <small>un</small> and whether they support and implement sanctions. Although 52 countries comprising 15% of the global population—the West and its friends—lambast and punish Russia&#39;s actions, and just 12 countries laud Russia, some 127 states are categorised as not being clearly in either camp (see map). </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRM687.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> To get a handle on what non-alignment really means <i>The Economist</i> has also looked at a narrower panel of the 25 biggest economies that have sat on the fence on the Ukraine war, or wish to remain non-aligned in the Sino-American confrontation, or both. The members of this group—call them the transactional 25 ( <small>t25</small> )—are hugely varied in terms of wealth and political systems, and include giant India and tiny Qatar. Yet they have some common ground. They are brutally pragmatic and have collectively become more powerful. Today they represent 45% of the world&#39;s population and their share of global <small>gdp</small> has risen from 11% in 1992 to 18% in 2023, more than the <small>eu&#39;</small> s <small>.</small> Their strategy of neutrality involves big risks and opportunities. Whether they succeed will influence the world order for decades. And needless to say, both America and China will work to win them over.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In the 20th century non-alignment meant different things to different countries at different times. At conferences in Bandung, Indonesia in 1955 and Belgrade, Yugoslavia in 1961, leaders presented a “third world” apart from the West and the Soviet bloc. From the late 1960s these countries increasingly focused on economic inequality between the “global south” (a less loaded term for the third world) and the industrial north. A formal institution, the Non-Aligned Movement, was joined by nearly every African, Asian and Latin American state. With the end of the cold war it became, in the words of an Indian academic, “a moribund organisation in need of a decent burial”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Today, non-aligned countries are not defined by their membership of an institution, but rather by their characteristics and behaviour. These middle powers are pragmatic and opportunistic. In a recent book Jorge Heine, a former Chilean diplomat, contends that in the 20th century countries often passively drifted into one or other of the superpowers&#39; orbits. Today there is more “active” evaluation of the best means to achieve particular ends, he says. Some call it “minilateralism” (as opposed to multilateralism)—the targeted use of discrete alliances or groupings, rather than lumping your lot in with one bloc.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Non-aligned countries also usually think Western leaders are hypocrites. Some $170bn in aid was pledged to Ukraine in the first year of the war—equivalent to about 90% of spending on all global aid in 2021 by the <small>oecd</small> ’s Development Assistance Committee, a group of 31 Western donors. To the West, such generosity shows solidarity with a fellow democracy; to others it shows that rich countries cough up if it serves their interests. “Europe has to grow out of the mindset that Europe&#39;s problems are the world&#39;s problems, but the world&#39;s problems are not Europe&#39;s problems,” declared Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India&#39;s foreign minister, last year. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Such stances are broadly in line with public opinion. A report by Cambridge University last year found that in liberal democracies 75% hold a negative view of China, and 87% do of Russia. But the picture is almost the reverse among the 6bn people who live elsewhere. A gap is opening up between how the West sees the world and how the rest sees it. In a poll published earlier this year by the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank, a plurality of Indians (48%) and most Turks (51%) said the future world order will be defined by multipolarity or non-Western dominance. Just 37% of Americans, 31% of people in <small>eu</small> states and 29% of Britons agreed. The West thinks it is watching a sequel of the cold war; the rest of the world sees an entirely new film.</p><h2> Wheeling and dealing</h2><p class="article__body-text"> So who makes up the <small>t25</small> ? The diverse group encompasses some of the world&#39;s most populous countries and two of its largest democracies, India and Indonesia, alongside Vietnam, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which are all run by autocrats of various flavours. Large wealth disparities exist, too. In Saudi Arabia <small>gdp</small> per person is more than $27,000, on a par with some European countries, while in Pakistan it still lingers around just $1,600. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1460/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1460/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/480/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/720/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/961/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/1441/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1537/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1921/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/2401/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/3074/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC703.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> As globalisation has spread, the trade pattern of the <small>t25</small> has become multipolar. Some 43% of merchandise trade is with the Western bloc, 19% with the China-Russia bloc and 30% with countries in neither of those camps (see chart). Perhaps unsurprisingly given its location, 77% of Mexico&#39;s total trade occurs with the West; over 60% of Israel&#39;s and Algeria&#39;s trade also does. More than a third of Chile&#39;s is with China, a higher share than any other <small>t25</small> country (but 40% of its trade involves the West). More than half of Argentina&#39;s trade, and almost half of India&#39;s, is with other non-aligned countries.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Arms imports also show a complex mesh of loyalties. India hedges its bets. Between 2018 and 2022 its main supplier was Russia, which provided 45% of its arms, but it got another 29% from Europe and is likely to seek more self-reliance, with help from America. India&#39;s rival China, which supplies its arch-enemy, Pakistan, is out of the question. Israel, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and South Africa look instead to America for the vast majority of their arms imports.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There is no coherent governing body that represents non-aligned countries and their interests. None is expected to emerge. Instead a variety of disparate organisations, such as the <small>g20</small> , provide platforms of varying effectiveness for the major non-aligned countries <small>.</small> The <small>brics</small> group of countries—Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa—is a forum for middle powers that wants to expand: it is discussing whether to let Iran and Saudi Arabia join. At <small>un</small> climate talks a broader group of more than 130 countries, including China, has negotiated together.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Despite their differences, the non-aligned countries share a common aim: to make expedient deals in a fluid environment. For two decades many were able to simultaneously build relations with the West, China and Russia.不再。 The West is imposing sanctions on Russia and restricting Chinese access to technology. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1042/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC690.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1042/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC690.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/343/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC690.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/514/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC690.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/686/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC690.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/1028/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC690.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1097/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC690.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1371/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC690.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1714/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC690.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2194/90/media-assets/image/20230415_IRC690.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> For many this is a grave threat. Sanctions on Russia saw energy and food prices soar globally, prompting a backlash across the non-Western world. More recently Janet Yellen, America&#39;s treasury secretary, has encouraged American companies to move their supply chains into friendly states. Investment shifts are under way (see chart). Beijing and Moscow, meanwhile, are drawing closer together. New research by the <small>imf</small> notes that since 2018 geopolitical alignment, measured by similarity in <small>un</small> voting patterns, has become ever more important in determining the location of foreign direct investment. Under the <small>imf</small> ’s scenarios for fractured trade, the impact in emerging markets could be more than twice as bad as in advanced ones.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But many in the non-aligned world bet that they can win from economic decoupling and political fragmentation, by hedging their relations between the big powers and by influencing other countries themselves. To understand this transactional strategy, look at the approach of some of the big countries caught in the middle. Brazil is a good case study. It opposes what Mauro Vieira, foreign minister, calls “automatic alignments”. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who began his second stint as Brazil&#39;s president in January, sees President Joe Biden as an ally on climate change; at their meeting in Washington, <small>dc</small> , in February they re-established joint environmental institutions abandoned under Jair Bolsonaro, Lula&#39;s predecessor. America classes Brazil as a “major non- <small>nato</small> ally”, a legal status that entitles enhanced co-operation with America&#39;s armed forces.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet Brazil is also hedging between the superpowers. Like others in its region, it has declined Western proposals to give old Russian-made equipment to Ukraine in exchange for new arms. <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/04/10/brazils-foreign-policy-is-hyperactive-ambitious-and-naive" data-tegid="tqfsuih1vhvl930gdrp2bbnhk7rhvokv">Lula&#39;s arrival in Beijing</a> on April 14th will underscore China&#39;s economic importance. Trade between Brazil and China was nearly $153bn in 2022, a 37-fold increase in two decades. Partly this reflects how Brazil took advantage of tit-for-tat <small>us</small> -China tariffs to increase agricultural exports to China at America&#39;s expense.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Brazil is also making forays of its own. Lula will soon visit Africa to revive Brazil&#39;s influence there. During his first stint in office, trade with Africa rose from $6bn in 2003 to $25.6bn in 2012, and South Africa was welcomed into the <small>brics</small> bloc. Then Lula&#39;s predecessor made no visits to Africa. Lula evidently thinks it worthwhile to renew the effort.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> India&#39;s fear of China has pushed it closer to the West in some respects. In March the prime minister of Japan, which like India, America and Australia, belongs to the “Quad”, an Indo-Pacific security forum, visited Delhi in a landmark visit. In the 2021-22 financial year India&#39;s trade with America overtook that with China. Yet India still purchases weapons and cheap oil from Russia and is unlikely to break its longstanding ties unless Vladimir Putin&#39;s regime were to use nuclear weapons.</p><h2> Practical, not partisan</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Like Brazil, India is asserting itself more abroad: only China imports and exports more with sub-Saharan Africa. The average annual stock of <small>fdi</small> from India was $0.8bn in 2004 to 2008 (less than half of Sweden&#39;s) but $31bn a decade later (more than Germany&#39;s and Japan&#39;s combined). Last month India hosted representatives from 31 African countries for war games. India promises to use its chair of the <small>g20</small> this year to be the “voice of the global south”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Turkey also wants more clout across the global south. It has security agreements with 30 African states and its defence exports to Africa rose more than five-fold from 2020 to 2021. Advisers to Turkey&#39;s president say the “New Turkey” can select its partners. That may explain its ostensible neutrality over the war in Ukraine, which Turkey has used to leverage its ties to Russia. Turkish exports to Russia reached $7.6bn in 2022, a 45% increase on the previous year. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Saudi Arabia is reducing its reliance on its historical ally, America, by tilting towards China, which is now the kingdom&#39;s largest trading partner. Consider decisions this month and in October by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which Saudi Arabia dominates, to slash oil production. Last month Saudi Arabia signed a Chinese-brokered deal with Iran and joined the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, a Eurasian talking shop. China says it wants to establish a free-trade deal with the Gulf “as soon as possible”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Gulf countries&#39; relations with Africa were once confined to energy, agriculture and the politics of the Horn of Africa. Today Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates hunt for minerals deals; <small>dp</small> World, a Dubai-based ports operator, is emerging as a critical logistics firm on the continent; and Qatar is playing novel diplomatic roles. Last month it was involved in brokering the release of Paul Rusesabagina, a jailed Rwandan dissident (and the inspiration for the film “Hotel Rwanda”).</p><p class="article__body-text"> African countries have long looked to both superpowers. The West has generally been their preferred source of “software”: support for schooling, health and, should a government want it, human rights. China offers “hardware”: bridges, roads, ports—and the loans to build them. Between 2007 and 2020 America&#39;s main development agency lent less than a tenth of the total of China&#39;s two major development banks ($1.9bn v $23bn) for sub-Saharan African infrastructure projects.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In some parts of Africa the West&#39;s promises to ensure security have rarely seemed as hollow. “Americans need somewhere for their troops and agents to sleep. But the security relationship does nothing for development,” explains a former adviser to an African president. “That&#39;s why we need China.” In August the last French troops left Mali after a nine-year deployment; the Wagner Group, comprising Russian mercenaries, now helps prop up the ruling junta.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The non-aligned countries want to avoid taking sides. But the big powers, America and China, are keen to draw them into their orbit. Beijing sees asserting leadership of the global south as a way of bolstering its resistance to American pressure. It positions itself as a model for others within a broad family of developing countries. It draws a contrast with the West, which it says prefers smaller clubs (like the <small>g7)</small> . “China shows up where and when the West will not,” says Yemi Osinbajo, Nigeria&#39;s outgoing vice-president.</p><h2> Eastern friends, western pals</h2><p class="article__body-text"> China is the main trading partner of around 120 countries and the lender of first and last resort for many. Between 2007 and 2020 it provided more infrastructure financing in sub-Saharan Africa than the next eight lenders combined. It will be pivotal to resolving sovereign-debt crises. Analysis of 73 developing countries by the <small>imf</small> notes that in 2006 China held just 2% of this group&#39;s external debts, with the mostly Western “Paris club” group of creditors accounting for 28%. By 2020 the respective shares were 18% and 10%.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Those in the West have reason to roll their eyes. China&#39;s “win-win” rhetoric masks its ruthlessness. “Banking on Beijing” (2022), by Bradley Parks of AidData, a research outfit, and co-authors, shows how China uses its economic tools for political ends. It often skews its funding towards incumbent leaders&#39; home districts—and is more likely than the West to lend to corrupt and autocratic countries. AidData also finds that a 10% increase in voting similarity with Beijing at the <small>un</small> is associated with an increase in Chinese projects in that country. Chinese loans come with unusually strict clauses on confidentiality and collateral. But Chinese development projects are associated with boosts to <small>gdp</small> per person, notes Mr Parks.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In the face of China&#39;s efforts, America and its allies are trying to recalibrate their message to the non-aligned world. America understands that other countries&#39; consent bestows legitimacy on the international order it leads. “Countries don&#39;t want to choose, and we don&#39;t want them to,” Jake Sullivan, Mr Biden&#39;s national security adviser, told the <i>Washington Post</i> earlier this year. America is pursuing diplomacy in places it has neglected. Kamala Harris, America&#39;s vice-president, Ms Yellen and Antony Blinken, its secretary of state, have all visited Africa in 2023. Mr Biden will soon follow.</p><p class="article__body-text"> America has also bolstered security partnerships with influential non-aligned countries. In November Lloyd Austin, its defence secretary, met his Indonesian counterpart for the fourth time; in January American and Indian officials agreed to deepen co-operation on cutting-edge defence technologies. In total America maintains 88 defence “partnerships” (excluding formal alliances such as its one with <small>nato</small> ), though some are limited in scope.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Though America and the <small>eu</small> have in recent years launched rival schemes to the <small>bri</small> , the perception remains that, if you want infrastructure that can help transform your economy, your first call is to Beijing. After Ms Harris released a soundtrack featuring African artists to accompany her recent visit to the continent, one senior African official noted, dryly, that Chinese visitors bring loans and engineers while Americans bring playlists.</p><h2> A political paradox</h2><p class="article__body-text"> The Biden administration is widely seen as embracing a two-tier foreign policy: first come relations with its core democratic allies in Europe and Asia (which it hopes might one day include India)—and then those with creaking global institutions. These mediate meet the needs of a broader group of countries, including most non-aligned ones, whether on development, debt relief, security or finance.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That presents three challenges. First, Western unity must hold. Yet that is not a given. During his recent visit to China Emmanuel Macron, France&#39;s president, said that Europe&#39;s states should not become “followers” of American policy on Taiwan, nor “adapt to the American rhythm”. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The second is that China can undermine global institutions by, for instance, opting for bilateral debt relief rather than fully participating in co-ordinated efforts. Chinese creditors&#39; obstinacy at the <small>imf</small> is hampering what flexibility it can offer to countries struggling with debt.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The final challenge concerns the mistrust of the West that is fed by its broken promises. Take climate finance, for example. In 2009 rich countries said they would channel $100bn to poorer ones per year by 2020; the annual total has never been higher than $85bn.</p><p class="article__body-text"> By drawing on their liberal values and shared history, America and its allies were able to rally behind Ukraine after Russia&#39;s invasion. They have shown newfound resolve against authoritarian China, too. The risk is that this coming together deepens the estrangement of the global south from the international order. It would be a tragic result if, in uniting the West, America alienates the rest. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i><b>Correction (April 12th)</b> : The map in this piece was changed to sort an error in the categorisation of some countries.</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 11 Apr 2023 20:45:15 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/d94s2un3ibdoij5fo94f5hiititutgf4</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/04/11/how-to-survive-a-superpower-split </item><item><title><![CDATA[Was your degree really worth it?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Male students at the University of Greenwich posing for pictures on graduation day in the grounds of the Old Royal Naval College in London.

In most places, for most learners, the financial returns to higher education remain extremely healthy. Yet undertaking a degree has become riskier. The rewards for the best performers are increasing, but a troublingly high share of students see negative returns from their studies.</p><p class="article__body-text"> New data sets, such as tax records, are illuminating this dispersion like never before. They can track how much students taking specific courses, at specific institutions, earn in later life. In time that detail will help students avoid the worst pay-offs and seize the best. Choice of subject and timely graduation matter hugely; choice of institution somewhat less so. It could also be useful to governments tempted to crack down on “low-value degrees”. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> A boom in graduate earnings began in the 1980s in the rich world. Back then the difference between the salaries of people who gain at least a bachelor&#39;s degree and those who do not—commonly called the “college-wage premium”—began to soar. In the 1970s an American with a university education was earning on average 35% more than a high-school graduate. By 2021 that advantage had risen to 66%. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC611.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC611.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/243/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC611.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/365/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC611.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/486/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC611.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/729/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC611.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/778/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC611.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/972/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC611.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1215/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC611.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1556/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC611.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Recently the wage premium in many countries has either stagnated or begun to fall. And in places that actually charge students for their degrees, costs have gone up (see chart 1). Tuition in England has soared from nothing in the late 1990s to £9,250 ($11,000) a year, the highest in the rich world. In America, the out-of-pocket fee paid by an average bachelor&#39;s-degree student increased from $2,300 a year in the 1970s to some $8,000 in 2018, in real terms, according to Jaison Abel and Richard Deitz at the New York Federal Reserve. (Students at public universities often pay much less; those at private non-profits can pay a lot more.)</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet the average degree remains valuable. In 2019 Mr Abel and Mr Deitz roughly estimated the annual financial return on the money that a typical American invests in a bachelor&#39;s degree. They conclude that the typical rate of return for a bachelor&#39;s degree is around 14%. That has dropped from a peak of 16% in the early 2000s. But it is still a princely sum. And it is well above the 8-9% that American graduates were recouping in the 1970s, before graduate wages, and tuition fees, began to soar. These calculations include not only fees but also the money individuals might expect to earn if they were working full-time instead.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The average hides a very wide range of outcomes, however. Until recently economists seeking to identify the winners and losers were mostly limited to surveys. The trend now is for governments, such as those of Britain and Norway, to proffer hefty, anonymised databases showing actual earnings for millions of university-goers. That makes it much easier to compare people like-for-like. The disaggregated data reveal that a high share of students graduate with degrees that are not worth their cost.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In England 25% of male graduates and 15% of female ones will take home less money over their careers than peers who do not get a degree, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies ( <small>IFS</small> ), a research outfit. America has less comprehensive data but has begun publishing the share of students at thousands of institutions who do not manage to earn more than the average high-school graduate early on. Six years after enrolment, 27% of students at a typical four-year university fail to do so, calculate researchers at Georgetown University in Washington, <small>dc</small> . In the long tail, comprising the worst 30% of America&#39;s two- and four-year institutions, more than half of people who enroll lag this benchmark. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Dropping out without any qualification is an obvious way to make a big loss. Taking longer than usual to graduate also destroys value (because it eats up years that might otherwise have been spent earning full-time). Both these outcomes are common. Across the rich world less than 40% of people studying for undergraduate degrees complete their courses in the expected number of years. About one-quarter still have no qualifications three years after that. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/701/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/701/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/231/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/346/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/461/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/692/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/738/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/922/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1153/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1476/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC619.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Choosing the right subject is crucial to boosting earning power. Negative returns are likeliest for Britons who study creative arts (less than 10% of men make a positive return), social care and agriculture (see chart 2). By far the best-earning degrees in America are in engineering, computer science and business. Negative returns seem especially likely for music and the visual arts. Using America&#39;s available data to guess lifetime earnings by programme is a stretch. But Preston Cooper at <small>freopp</small> , a think-tank, ventures that more than a quarter of bachelor&#39;s-degree programmes in America will lead to negative returns for most enrolled students.</p><p class="article__body-text"> What you study generally matters more than where you do it. That comes with caveats: the worst colleges and universities provide students with little value, whatever they teach. But on average people who enroll in America&#39;s public universities get a better return over their lifetimes than students who go to its more prestigious private non-profit ones, reckon the Georgetown researchers. High fees at the non-profits is one of the reasons why.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Earnings data in Britain call into question the assumption that bright youngsters will necessarily benefit from being pushed towards very selective institutions, says Jack Britton of the <small>ifs</small> . In order to beat fierce competition for places, some youngsters apply for whatever subject seems easiest, even if it is not one that usually brings a high return. Parents fixated on getting their offspring into Oxford or Cambridge, regardless of subject, should take note. But there is also evidence that tackling a high-earning course for the sake of it can backfire. Norwegian research finds that students whose true desire is to study humanities, but who end up studying science, earn less after ten years than they probably otherwise would have.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Men have more reason than women to worry that their investments in higher education will be a bust. That is because they have a higher chance of earning well without a degree. University is a risk for those with mediocre school grades as they often earn less after graduation than better-prepared peers who hold the same degrees.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> In Britain the return from a degree is generally higher for South Asian students than for white ones, as they tend to study subjects such as business, and generally lower for black students (compared with what people of the same race typically earn if they do not go to university). In America, Asian students seem to have the least trouble paying off their student debts, compared with white and black students.</p><h2> Marks and markets</h2><p class="article__body-text"> What are the implications of all this analysis? Already there are signs that the higher-education market is evolving. People are already searching out better returns of their own accord at different educational stages. In America the number of degrees conferred annually in English and in history fell by around one-third between 2011 and 2021. The number of degrees in computer science more than doubled in that time (see chart 3). Others are skipping college altogether. The number of people enrolling has fallen every year since 2011. </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230408_IRC613.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Institutions are also shifting by culling humanities. In February the trustees of Marymount University in Virginia voted to abolish majors in nine subjects including English, history, philosophy and theology. Calvin University in Michigan and Howard University in Washington, <small>dc</small> are among those which have abandoned classics. And archaeology&#39;s future at the University of Sheffield in Britain looks precarious.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Employers are adapting, too. Firms are becoming a bit less likely to demand that job applicants have degrees, according to analysis by Joseph Fuller of Harvard Business School, and others. Tight labour markets and a desire for more diverse workers help explain why. A few years ago some 80% of the jobs that <small>ibm</small> , a tech giant, advertised in America required a degree, says Kelli Jordan, one of its vice-presidents. Now it is about half. “A degree does not have to be the only indicator of skills that someone may have,” explains Ms Jordan.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Should governments amplify these trends? In Estonia one-fifth of an institution&#39;s funding depends on meeting a variety of targets; one relates to the share of students graduating on time. Similar systems exist in Finland, Israel, Lithuania and Sweden.澳大利亚政府正在努力鼓励学习者做出对社会有益的选择。 In 2021 it doubled what undergraduates pay to study social sciences, political science or communications and halved the fee for nursing and teaching. Students do not appear much moved yet, possibly because of the generosity of Australia&#39;s student-debt repayment terms. Britain&#39;s government reckons it can alter behaviour by giving everyone in England an online account listing a maximum cash sum that they are entitled to borrow from the state for studies over their lifetime. The idea is to make school-leavers more parsimonious.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Others still splurge. President Joe Biden hopes that the Supreme Court will soon approve a plan, announced last year, to write off a big chunk of America&#39;s student loans. He also wants a more lenient repayment system. The associated costs could mount to hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade. Mr Biden also promises an official list of “low-financial value” courses. More compelling is talk of preventing feeble programmes from benefitting from federal student loans. But without an act of Congress this would mainly affect for-profit colleges (which enroll only a fraction of America&#39;s learners).</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> To many, a growing focus on the financial returns to higher education is crude. Graduates in public service are bound to earn less than those on Wall Street. Many disciplines are worth studying for their own sake. Yet students frequently tell pollsters that improving their earning power is a priority. Good returns are vital to the poorest learners, for whom the financial burden of degrees is highest. Today bad degrees are surprisingly common. A combination of better information, market forces and smarter policy can reduce their prevalence. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 03 Apr 2023 19:35:32 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/secl4nn7ck4s11bq7n29mjh0mbb312s1</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/04/03/was-your-degree-really-worth-it </item><item><title><![CDATA[Which will grow faster: India or Indonesia?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230401_IRD001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230401_IRD001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230401_IRD001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230401_IRD001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230401_IRD001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230401_IRD001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230401_IRD001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230401_IRD001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230401_IRD001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230401_IRD001.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">I</span> <small>f you are</small> looking for growth opportunities among the world&#39;s 20 biggest economies, two stand out: India and <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/17/why-indonesia-matters">Indonesia</a> .

Move workers from fields to more productive manufacturing jobs in cities, have them make goods for export, and watch the rapid formalisation of the economy. It worked in South Korea and Taiwan. In China it saw 800m people escape poverty. But today this scheme no longer works well. Many countries are <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/02/01/the-worlds-most-and-least-democratic-countries-in-2022">rowdy democracies</a> , not authoritarian states (as South Korea and Taiwan were when they industrialised). Protectionism challenges export-led growth. Factories use more robots.</p><p class="article__body-text"> At first glance, India and Indonesia have much in common. Both are led by charismatic leaders first elected in 2014, and both will hold elections next year. <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/02/28/indias-g20-presidency-will-be-a-win-for-narendra-modi">Narendra Modi</a> , India&#39;s prime minister, and <a href="https://www.economist.com/jokowi-interview">Joko Widodo</a> (widely known as Jokowi), Indonesia&#39;s president, cut their teeth in local politics and have a reputation for getting things done.

Services, not manufacturing, dominate output (see chart). Both are fairly open, with trade at around 40% of <small>gdp</small> and annual inflows of foreign direct investment worth some 1.5% of <small>gdp</small> . Both are largely informal: 90% of India&#39;s workers and 60% of Indonesia&#39;s toil in the grey economy. The state is small by rich-world standards: public spending comes to just 30% of <small>gdp</small> in India and 18% in Indonesia.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Both countries are in the midst of ambitious infrastructure build-outs. Indonesia has built 18 ports, 21 airports and 1,700km of toll roads since Jokowi took office. India is adding 10,000km of highway each year. Yet there is still a huge amount of economic catch-up to exploit. Indonesia&#39;s gross national income per person is $4,180 and India&#39;s is about half that: both are “lower middle-income” economies.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That is where the similarities end. To illuminate this we considered four areas in each country: the leading export sector; industrial policy; their geopolitical stance; and their strategy for pleasing voters. Start with export successes, a reflection of comparative advantage. In India the leading export sector is technology services. Thanks to its ability to crank out half a million new engineers a year, in 2021 India accounted for 15% of global <small>it</small> services spending. <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/01/26/indonesia-embraces-resource-nationalism">Indonesia&#39;s advantage lies in commodities</a> , some of which, such as nickel, are in global demand owing to the energy transition. By 2030 Indonesia will be the world&#39;s fourth-largest producer of the “green commodities” used in batteries and grids.</p><p class="article__body-text"> These industries generate chunky foreign earnings. In 2021 tech services made up about 17% of India&#39;s exports by value, and commodities (excluding fuel) accounted for 22% of Indonesia&#39;s. But these sectors generate few jobs: even India&#39;s <small>it</small> industry has only 5m workers. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/776/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC960.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/776/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC960.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/255/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC960.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/383/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC960.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/511/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC960.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/766/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC960.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/817/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC960.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1021/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC960.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1276/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC960.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1634/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC960.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Both governments want to supercharge the private sector through industrial policy. India has a more auspicious starting-point (see chart two). The <small>msci</small> India index, which covers about 85% of the market, is worth some $830bn, about 24% of <small>gdp</small> . The Indonesia Index is worth just $123bn, or 10% of <small>gdp</small> . India has 108 “unicorn” businesses (ie, valued at over $1bn), more than any other country except America and China. Indonesia has produced fewer than a dozen. Mr Modi is betting on $30bn of “production-linked incentives” to catalyse investment in 14 priority industries, including semiconductors. His pledge to achieve “net-zero” emissions of greenhouse gases by 2070 involves building solar farms, producing batteries and much more. Beyond greenery, the idea is to create jobs and cut the cost of power. India&#39;s energy-import bill is expected to drop from 4% of <small>gdp</small> in 2021 to 2.5% in 2032.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The Indonesian government&#39;s flagship industrial policy, “downstreaming”, is focused on natural resources. It uses sticks more than carrots. It hopes that by banning exports of selected raw materials, it will push multinationals to build refineries locally. Exports of raw nickel, for example, were prohibited in 2014. The number of nickel smelters has grown from two before the ban, to 13 in 2020 and as many as 30 by the end of this year. A ban on bauxite exports will soon take effect. Plans are afoot to shimmy higher up the value chain. Indonesia aims to make electric-car batteries with a total capacity of 140GWh in 2030—almost as much as global production in 2020. Last year Hyundai, a carmaker, started building electric cars in Indonesia.</p></div><h2> A cruel, cruel world</h2><p class="article__body-text"> As Sino-American tensions build, the two countries maintain different geopolitical stances. These will affect foreign investment and trade for decades. Consistent with its long-held policy of nonalignment, Indonesia wants to balance China and the West. Its sovereign-wealth fund, launched in 2021, is expected to receive up to $3bn in investment from China, which is also one of its largest sources of foreign direct investment. The government doesn&#39;t see this as playing countries off against each other. “Indonesia puts Indonesia first,” says Nadiem Makarim, a minister.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Modi&#39;s India is far more wary of China. Amid deadly border clashes with its neighbour, it has joined the Quad, a strategic grouping with America, Australia and Japan. This has implications for the economy. In 2020 India banned TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps. Chinese tech firms, including Vivo and Xiaomi, have faced raids and investigations since. Part of Mr Modi&#39;s industrial strategy is designed to lure Western firms that are diversifying away from China. A unit of Foxconn, a Taiwanese maker of iPhones, recently received approval to build a $1bn facility in the state of Karnataka. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC507.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC507.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC507.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC507.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC507.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC507.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC507.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC507.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC507.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230401_IRC507.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Our final category concerns how the two governments keep voters happy. Both are delivering decent growth, but far too few formal jobs of the kind China and East Asian tigers managed to create. “There are a lot of unemployed youth, which is a waste of [India&#39;s] demographic dividend,” says Raghuram Rajan, formerly the Indian central bank&#39;s governor.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Part of the response involves better redistribution, often using new, digitally enabled welfare states. Indonesia has an enormous cash-transfer scheme. Mr Modi&#39;s “India stack”, a state-sponsored suite of digital platforms, links citizens, armed with an electronic identity, to payments and tax systems, and bank accounts. In the 2022 financial year the state handed over $76.5bn, more than 2% of <small>gdp</small> , through these so-called direct-benefit transfers, reaching around 900m beneficiaries.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet the political differences are stark. Jokowi sits atop a sprawling coalition that includes former opponents and eight of the ten parties in parliament. Part of Jokowi&#39;s “genius” has been to stem Islamist parties through inclusion, writes Kishore Mahbubani, a Singaporean former diplomat. Jokowi is barred from running again in next year&#39;s election, but his pluralist approach is fairly likely to endure.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Modi has gone the opposite way, using anti-Muslim chauvinism to galvanise India. Two-thirds of India&#39;s Hindus now say being Hindu is very important to being “truly Indian”, according to Pew, a research firm. Next year&#39;s elections are likely to see rising religious tensions and a further erosion of liberal norms. Last week <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/27/the-worlds-biggest-democracy-is-becoming-less-free" data-tegid="37aupam5mi6ef5ikeklkvrb9otdr95t7">Rahul Gandhi</a> , the leader of the main opposition party, lost a court case and was disqualified from parliament.</p></div><h2> Getting rich quickly</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Which model will deliver the quickest growth? The countries face some common problems, such as cronyism. Jokowi is surrounded by well-connected tycoons; in India the troubles of the Adani Group, an influential conglomerate, have been national news. Arvind Subramanian, a former economic adviser to the Indian government, points out that the <i>zaibatsu</i> conglomerates in Japan and the <i>chaebol</i> in South Korea operated in tradable sectors, forcing them to compete with international rivals. But Adani and other favourites mainly service the domestic market, leaving them sheltered. This charge may also apply to Indonesian firms.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Ultimately, with its deeper private sector and capital markets India is likely to continue to grow faster. The risk lies in its politics. Both countries&#39; models of development rely on a narrow part of the economy racing ahead; on wealth trickling down through the informal economy or welfare schemes; and on the political system being able to manage the resulting social pressures. In Indonesia the government moulds and placates public opinion; in India it sometimes incites and directs public anger. In the short term that may not matter much. In the long run, it may be a serious problem. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Mar 2023 17:46:27 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/h82goatvlt9kc7bmrigfh0tonil4pklh</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/03/29/which-will-grow-faster-india-or-indonesia </item><item><title><![CDATA[How the Iraq war bent America’s army out of shape]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="CAMP MATILDA, KUWAIT - FEBRUARY 20: A U.S. Marine of the 1st Marine Division walks past 155 mm howitzers that are lined up February 20, 2003 near the Iraqi border in Kuwait.

But in the years that followed, it overwhelmed the American military, too, leaving it bent out of shape for the accelerating competition with China.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The American-led coalition conquered Baghdad in just over three weeks, a remarkable display of raw military power against what was then the world&#39;s fourth-largest standing army. But in the years that followed America was sucked into a campaign of nation-building and counter-insurgency against armed groups, including Sunni jihadists, disaffected members of Saddam Hussein&#39;s Baath Party and Shia militants. Barack Obama, then president, <a href="https://www.economist.com/lexingtons-notebook/2011/10/21/ending-with-a-whimper">pulled American troops out</a> in 2011, only to <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2014/08/14/back-to-iraq">send many back</a> after Islamic State, an al-Qaeda splinter, tore through northern Iraq and Syria in 2014. Around 2,500 American troops remain today. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1451/90/media-assets/image/20230325_WOC441.png"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1451/90/media-assets/image/20230325_WOC441.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/227/90/media-assets/image/20230325_WOC441.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/340/90/media-assets/image/20230325_WOC441.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/453/90/media-assets/image/20230325_WOC441.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/680/90/media-assets/image/20230325_WOC441.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/726/90/media-assets/image/20230325_WOC441.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/907/90/media-assets/image/20230325_WOC441.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1134/90/media-assets/image/20230325_WOC441.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1451/90/media-assets/image/20230325_WOC441.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> These campaigns put an enormous strain on America&#39;s army. For the first six years of the war, the number of American troops in Iraq rarely fell below 120,000 (see chart). At the peak of “the surge” in 2007—a spike in troops to combat a raging insurgency—the number was far higher. And as Iraq wound down, the war in Afghanistan ramped up: 98,000 troops were deployed there at that conflict&#39;s peak in 2011. Mobilisation on this scale required implementing what many soldiers called a “backdoor draft”: a stop-loss policy of forcing soldiers to extend their service. Between 2002 and 2008 more than 58,000 soldiers were affected.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The intense pace of operations had a wider impact on American forces, as a paper published in 2009 by the Centre for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a think-tank, warned. By 2007 the share of <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/11/29/why-has-americas-army-recruitment-plummeted">army recruits</a> with high-school diplomas had fallen to 79%, the lowest level for 25 years. A growing number of volunteers were being given waivers for criminal records, obesity or other issues. In 2006 there were more than 34,000 people with “moral waivers” serving in the American armed forces, more than a fifth of all enlisted soldiers.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Those in the field were run ragged. Instead of deploying one unit in every three, allowing time for recuperation and training, the army was forced to deploy one in every two. Army trucks worked at ten times their peace-time rate, the Abrams tank was flogged six times as hard and the Chinook helicopter three times, all in harsh desert conditions that resulted in frequent breakdowns and shortened the lifespan of the equipment.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Worse still, all of that came at a crucial period for America&#39;s global position. In the decade prior to its invasion of Iraq, <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/05/01/nominal-spending-figures-understate-chinas-military-might">China&#39;s military spending</a> roughly doubled. In the decade that followed, it quadrupled. Meanwhile America frittered away extraordinary resources. The cost of military operations in Iraq since 2003 runs to more than $800bn on a conservative estimate, and into the trillions on more expansive measures. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The problem was not just profligacy. For more than a decade, despite a much-touted effort by the Obama administration to effect a “pivot” of American strategy to Asia and the Pacific, America&#39;s armed forces devoted the bulk of their intellectual and organisational efforts to the irregular warfare they faced in Iraq and Afghanistan. Officers gained combat experience, to be sure. But they were feted for writing manuals on counter-insurgency, rather than pondering tank battles in Europe or naval warfare in Asia.</p><p class="article__body-text"> “A vast number of navy and marine officers could be trusted to explain the intricacies of every street in Baghdad,” says Eric Sayers of the American Enterprise Institute, another think-tank, and a former consultant for Indo-Pacific Command, America&#39;s military command for Asia, “but far fewer came to know much at all about the military and diplomatic geography of maritime South-East Asia.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Special forces prioritised assassination and abduction over traditional sabotage and raiding. Air superiority was taken for granted, and air defences were neglected. The war caused a “crushing aircraft readiness crisis” in the air force “from which it has yet to recover”, says Mark Montgomery, a retired rear-admiral. <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/international/2022/06/15/does-the-tank-have-a-future">Tank skills</a> atrophied. “Over the last nine years of doing irregular warfare we have eviscerated the Armour Corps to the point of its extinction,” lamented Gian Gentile, then a serving army colonel, in 2010, exaggerating only slightly. Mr Gentile questioned whether armour, artillery and infantry could still work together in what America calls brigade combat teams.</p><p class="article__body-text"> China watched and learnt. Though the People&#39;s Liberation Army was awed by the speed and decisiveness of America&#39;s thrust to Baghdad, it carefully noted America&#39;s reliance on large bases, secure logistics and assured access to satellites. It methodically invested in tactics and capabilities—like ballistic missiles, anti-satellite weapons and cyberwarfare—designed to puncture this American way of war. “Many of these reforms have been bred out of the American experience in Iraq,” noted a report by the Centre for a New American Security, a think-tank, in 2008 (one of the authors was Kurt Campbell, who now serves as President Joe Biden&#39;s top Asia official).</p><p class="article__body-text"> Even after Donald Trump&#39;s <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/01/25/the-growing-danger-of-great-power-conflict">national defence strategy</a> of 2018 formally reoriented America&#39;s armed forces to the threat from China, a shift largely endorsed by the Biden administration, the Pentagon was slow to shed this legacy. It had proved unwilling “to fully come to grips with the reality that its principal competitors are no longer regional threats such as the Iraqs and Yugoslavias of the world”, wrote Chris Dougherty, one of the authors of that strategy, in 2019. “The erosion of <small>US</small> military advantage vis-à-vis China and Russia was a symptom of this infection.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> This is slowly beginning to change. The war in Ukraine has sharpened the Pentagon&#39;s focus on high-intensity warfare. It is shifting from brigades to larger divisions, and is now training Ukraine in the sort of combined-arms warfare that was neglected for years. It is also rebalancing resources. On March 14th the Pentagon projected a cut of $5bn to <small>CENTCOM</small> ’s budget and a reduction of more than 6,000 of the command&#39;s troops. A Pacific Deterrence Initiative to bolster bases and air defences in Asia now exceeds $9bn, more than the defence budget of Thailand or Indonesia. American preparations for a possible war over Taiwan look more serious than ever. But these efforts were delayed by years. The “diversion of attention is a cost we are still paying and only time can help resolve”, says Mr Sayers. Many Asian allies remain unconvinced that America can break old habits.</p><p class="article__body-text"> “For much of the past two decades, Washington&#39;s focus on the Middle East has reduced military readiness, distorted force-structure priorities and, until recently, left the joint force ill-equipped and unable to prepare adequately for high-end military competition with a peer adversary,” concluded a scathing assessment of Asian security trends published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank, in June. A war that was waged in 2003 partly to awe adversaries and cement American military primacy has left long-lasting scars on the victor. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 21 Mar 2023 11:12:44 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/pc2f9f1nhvgh4vraeagt848d5sov1h71</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/03/21/how-the-iraq-war-bent-americas-army-out-of-shape</item></channel></rss>
