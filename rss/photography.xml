They beckon your viewers into the scene, providing a near-3D effect.</p><p> So take a moment during your next shoot to scout for these leading lines. Sometimes they&#39;re obvious, like a long, deserted highway. At other times, they might be subtler, like cracks in a dry lake bed or bending reeds in a marsh. Once you begin integrating them, your compositions will become more engaging and visually complex. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photograph-a-subject-in-its-environment"> 3.

They give you the freedom to play with multiple elements within your frame. Instead of settling for one or two features to capture, aim for a multi-layered composition.</p><p>这意味着什么？这很简单。 Use your wide-angle lens to include something interesting in the foreground, a captivating subject in the mid-ground, and a scenic view in the background. Each layer serves a role in creating a sense of depth, offering your viewers a journey through the scene.</p><p> Don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re not sure how to balance these layers. It comes down to practice and a bit of intuition. Look for elements that harmonize, yet stand distinct from one another. A bed of colorful flowers in the foreground, a serene lake in the mid-ground, and a snow-capped mountain in the background – each component contributes to a well-rounded story.</p><p> One word of caution: be mindful of how the layers interact. The last thing you want is for one element to overpower the rest. A foreground that&#39;s too busy or a background that&#39;s too overwhelming can throw off the balance.</p><p> Spending a few moments arranging these layers can be a game changer. Once you master this technique, your wide-angle landscapes will take on a richer, more complete form. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="watch-out-for-distractions"> 6.

Look at the edges of your frame. Are there any stray elements, like tree branches or random objects, poking in? Scan the mid-ground and background too, making sure every element complements, not competes with, your main subject.</p><p> This level of scrutiny may feel tedious and unnecessary. But trust me, investing that time beforehand will save you a lot more time later in editing. You&#39;ll notice your photos emerging cleaner, and more importantly, more impactful.</p><p> Your patience will pay off, not just in the short term but in your long-term growth as a photographer. The more you get into the habit of composing carefully, the easier it&#39;ll become. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="keep-the-camera-level-to-prevent-distortion"> 8.

Landscape photographers <em>love</em> working with polarizers, but when you&#39;re using an ultra-wide lens, you can run into issues.</p><p> For one, depending on the angle of your camera, you may end up with a polarization effect that&#39;s applied unevenly across the scene. This is due to the nature of polarizing filters – they work differently depending on the filter&#39;s angle relative to the sun – and while it&#39;s not an issue on telephoto lenses, it can come into play if you&#39;re shooting at, say, 15mm. When this happens, it&#39;s generally better to avoid a polarizer completely.</p><p> Second, some ultra-wide lenses feature a bulbous front element that simply cannot <em>take</em> a polarizer. So if you&#39;re using an ultra-wide lens, you may need to adjust your compositions or even choose different subjects to prevent unwanted reflections from plaguing your images. If your lens won&#39;t take a polarizer, you may want to consider avoiding waxy leaves, water, and wet rocks, all of which will create reflections and reduce image saturation. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="include-a-human-to-show-scale"> 13.

Often, the background sky will be much brighter than your foreground objects, and this can cause significant exposure problems. Do you expose for the sky and lose detail in the foreground? Or do you expose for the foreground and blow out the sky?</p><p> My recommendation is to use a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/using-graduated-neutral-density-filters-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="graduated neutral density filter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">graduated neutral density filter</a> , which will darken the top portion of your composition while leaving the foreground untouched. You might also consider using a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/getting-real-hdr/" target="_blank" aria-label="bracketing and blending technique (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">bracketing and blending technique</a> , where you capture several images at different exposures, then merge them together in post-processing.</p><p> In truth, both of the above approaches have their merits! Filters do tend to be expensive, but they&#39;ll also save you time behind the computer, while bracketing can be highly effective but takes greater patience when editing. If you&#39;re not sure which technique you like best, rent some filters, try both options, and see what you think! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-forget-about-post-processing"> 15.

But the journey isn&#39;t over. Post-processing is how you transform a good photograph into a great one.</p><p> Think of your camera as an interpreter. It does its best to relay what it sees, but sometimes the essence gets lost in translation. That&#39;s why you need to roll up your sleeves and dive into editing.</p><p> A straightforward place to start is with basic adjustments. Tinker with contrast, brightness, and saturation to get closer to what your eyes saw. You can add vignettes to direct focus, and use dodging and burning to bring out the texture and depth in various areas.</p><p> Remember, post-processing isn&#39;t about altering reality; it&#39;s about making it more perceptible. The goal is to help convey the scene as vividly as you remember. The aim isn&#39;t for over-the-top effects, but subtle improvements that amplify the mood and message of your photograph. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="wide-angle-landscape-photography-final-words"> Wide-angle landscape photography: final words</h2><p> Wide-angle lenses are often the most-used glass in a landscape photographer&#39;s kit.

贡献。</em></p><p>与注重捕捉清晰细致图像的传统摄影不同，印象派摄影挑战我们通过不同的镜头来看待世界，这种镜头不太关心清晰度，更关心情感和视觉影响。印象派照片不仅仅涉及镜头前的事物，还涉及您选择通过颜色、形状甚至模糊来讲述的<em>故事</em>。</p><p>我喜欢捕捉印象派的照片，在这篇文章中，我将分享一些技巧，让您可以用相机进行绘画，这样您就可以创作出能引起内心深处共鸣的艺术品。我的方法鼓励你拥抱运动，专注地玩耍，并庆祝抽象。</p><p>因此，无论您是一位想要打破常规的经验丰富的摄影师，还是渴望探索的初学者，请准备好捕捉一些令人惊叹的图像！ </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-is-impressionist-photography">什么是印象派摄影？ </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img

Polak.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>印象派摄影是一种摄影师试图传达场景的感觉或暗示，而不是字面描述的风格。换句话说，它是通过形状和颜色而不是尖锐、真实的表现来呈现主题的本质，从而捕捉场景的整体氛围。</p><p>在印象派和抽象摄影中，重点是通过纹理、形式和颜色的相互作用来激发情感。这种风格鼓励使用充满活力的色调、独特的形状和线条来制作视觉刺激的作品。</p><p>想象一下，短暂地观察一个场景，然后在你的眼睛完全理解细节之前就转身离开。留下的是对颜色和形式的模糊记忆，是对原始场景的提炼本质——这就是印象派摄影的意义所在。

1.寻找形状、图案和纹理</h3><p>当您进行日常活动时，请注意您周围的形状。即使是标准的房屋或公寓也充满了有趣的形状、图案和纹理，可以用来制作印象派照片。</p><p>仔细观察周围的不同物体，考虑是否有重复出现的形状或主题。然后利用它们来发挥你的优势。</p><p>例如，在照片中可以非常有效地使用线条，因为眼睛会倾向于在整个镜头中跟随它们。看看波浪到达岸边时的起伏图案： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async"

data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>如果您喜欢在城市中漫步，请寻找建筑物形成的图案。</p><p>基本上，您能找到的形式相互作用越多越好！ </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-intentional-camera-movement"> 2. 有意识地移动相机</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4-Pan-you-Camera-Wattle-Bay-Eva-Polak.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Impressionist photography" title="4-潘你相机 Wattle Bay Eva Polak.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>有意识地移动相机是创造印象派风景摄影的绝佳技术，尤其是当您面对突出的线条时，例如水平延伸的海滩或森林中的高大树木。</p><p>该方法需要练习才能掌握，但过程是创作享受的一部分，并且实际上保证每次拍摄都会产生独特的效果。这是我的建议：</p><ol><li>将相机设置为快门优先模式。</li><li>选择 1/20 秒到 1/2 秒之间的慢快门速度。</li><li>将相机对准场景中央，然后半按快门按钮设置曝光。</li><li>平移相机，使其与场景中的任何主导线平行移动。</li><li>平移时，完全按下快门按钮。即使快门关闭后仍继续运动以获得流畅的效果。</li><li>尝试不同的快门速度以获得不同的结果！ </li></ol><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="look-for-reflections"> 3.寻找倒影</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2-Reflection-Seagull-by-Eva-Polak.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Impressionist photography" title="2-反射海鸥，作者：Eva Polak.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>倒影是创作印象派摄影的最佳方式之一——如果你仔细观察，你会发现它们<em>无处不在</em>。</p><p>当你四处走动时，寻找光滑的表面。考虑一下如何使用每个表面来捕捉否则无法拍摄的视点。</p><p>特别注意被雨水浸湿的街道上色彩缤纷的倒影；他们将创造出具有印象派品质的闪闪发光的场景。</p><p>此外，湖泊和河流可以创造出一些美妙的反射表面。</p><p>请始终记住，当表面具有纹理或形状时，可能会出现不寻常且有趣的反射。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-zooming"> 4.尝试缩放</h3><p>变焦连拍或变焦模糊是另一种简单、有趣且易于实现的技术。它涉及在拍照时改变镜头的焦距（放大或缩小），导致照片从中心向外模糊，就好像场景正在向您猛冲过来一样。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5-Zoom-Water-lily-by-Eva-polak.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Impressionist photography" title="5 倍变焦睡莲，作者：Eva polak.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>要使用此技术，您需要一台带有变焦镜头（包含变焦环）的相机。将相机设置为快门优先，并将快门速度拨至 1/10 秒左右。</p><p>像平常一样构图，然后在按下快门时变焦镜头。这项技术成功的关键是获得正确的变焦连拍<em>量</em>。尝试变焦速度和方向，并尝试不同的快门速度。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async"

data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-selective-focus"> 5. 使用选择性焦点</h3><p>选择性对焦涉及隔离画面的一小部分，使其处于清晰焦点，同时让图像的其余部分以柔和、绘画的方式渲染。当使用大光圈（例如 f/1.8 或 f/2.8）镜头时，此技术最有效。</p><p>为了获得最佳效果，请使用长焦镜头放大感兴趣的点，或使用微距镜头靠近拍摄对象。</p><p>将相机设置为光圈优先模式并选择可用的最大光圈。可能需要手动对焦以确保画面的所需区域清晰对焦。</p><p> （专业提示：要获得特别引人注目的效果，请在框架中包含鲜艳的颜色！） </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="deliberately-defocus-your-lens"> 6.故意散焦你的镜头</h3><p>将镜头拉离焦距是让场景呈现印象派外观的快速方法，如下所示： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3-Defocus-Lonly-by-Eva-Polak.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Impressionist photography" title="3-Defocus Lonly by Eva Polak.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>使用<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-priority-and-shutter-priority-exposure-lesson-1/">光圈优先模式</a>并将镜头设置为最大光圈（较小的数字，例如 f/2.4 或 f/4）。这很重要，因为您需要<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/seeing-in-depth-of-field-a-simple-understanding-of-aperture/">非常浅的景深</a>。</p><p>然后将镜头切换到手动对焦并开始通过相机观察事物。转动对焦环，直到一切都变得模糊。</p><p>并尝试改变焦点；这将产生不同程度的模糊，适合不同的拍摄对象。

These are the books, courses, or tools that they swear by. If you&#39;re talking to a professional, don&#39;t forget to ask them about the resources they find indispensable. This can be your shortcut to leveling up your skills.</p><p> Courses, books, documentaries, and workshops come in all shapes and sizes. Some might recommend a YouTube channel that offers quick photography hacks. Others may point you toward a comprehensive online course that dives deep into the technicalities. The point is, each photographer has their own set of recommendations that can offer you unique perspectives.</p><p> And if they&#39;re in the photography education space, don&#39;t be surprised if they recommend something of their own. Many of these photographers create their own courses or write books to share their expertise. This could be your chance to get an insider&#39;s view. Learning from their curated material could provide you with tips that are hard to find elsewhere.</p><p> Bottom line: The right resources can help you refine your craft.

How do you get honest feedback on your work?</h2><p> Feedback is a cornerstone of growth, not just in photography but in any creative endeavor. If you&#39;ve ever wondered where to get an unbiased critique of your work, you&#39;re not alone. Professionals have been through this and can guide you to platforms or communities where you can get constructive criticism.</p><p> Not all feedback is created equal. While friends and family might offer praise, they often lack the expertise to give you a detailed critique. Professionals can point you to online forums, photography clubs, or even specific social media groups where your work can be critically assessed.</p><p> How do you get people to be honest? There&#39;s an art to soliciting constructive feedback, and a professional can teach you how. Maybe it&#39;s about asking the right questions or maybe it&#39;s about creating an environment where people feel comfortable being candid. Learn these techniques to get the most out of your feedback sessions. </p><div class="wp-block-jetpack-send-a-message"></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-gear-do-you-use"> 5.

So, why not ask a professional what to watch out for? The answer might just save you from falling into common traps.</p><p> Let&#39;s talk about composition, for example. It&#39;s easy to get caught up in the moment and snap a shot without properly framing your subject. Another common error is investing too much in gear, without dedicating equal time to learning the craft. This unbalanced approach can stall your progress significantly.</p><p> There are also more nuanced pitfalls. Some photographers get so caught up in achieving technical perfection that they forget to develop a unique style. Other mistakes are conceptual, like taking photos without a clear intent or message. These pitfalls can divert you from your artistic path.</p><p> Being aware of these mistakes isn&#39;t just about avoidance. It&#39;s also about knowing what to focus on for improvement. By asking this question, you&#39;re not just collecting cautionary tales; you&#39;re building your own guidebook for success. You&#39;re armed with the knowledge of what not to do, which is just as valuable as knowing what to do.</p><p> Gathering advice on common pitfalls offers you a fast track to improvement.

Social media has made it easier than ever to seek approval through likes and comments. But is that why you got into photography? If you ask a seasoned photographer, you&#39;ll find they have specific methods to stay focused on their art.</p><p> Personal projects are a great example. These are the endeavors that fuel a photographer&#39;s passion. They are not for likes or follows but for the joy and satisfaction that comes from creating something meaningful. Another strategy might be to set aside “creative time” apart from your regular shooting schedule. This is time reserved purely for experimenting and developing your artistic voice.</p><p> You might also discover that professionals use tangible tools to stay focused. Mood boards, journals, or even a dedicated workspace can serve as daily reminders of what you&#39;re striving for. These aren&#39;t just physical objects but symbols of your commitment to your art.</p><p> By asking this question, you open the door to strategies you might not have considered. These tactics can help you strike a balance between seeking external validation and maintaining your artistic integrity. They remind you why you picked up a camera in the first place. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-do-you-think-about-social-media-for-photographers"> 14.

On one hand, platforms like Instagram or Facebook can get your work out there. On the other hand, they can be massive time sinks. Getting a balance is key, and who better to ask than a professional photographer?</p><p> Different platforms suit different styles. Instagram may be great for portrait photography, while Pinterest could be more suited for showcasing landscapes. Asking a seasoned photographer about their preferred platform can give you a new perspective on where to showcase your work.</p><p> How much time should you spend on social media? The answer varies. But finding out how a professional manages their time online can offer you invaluable insights. Maybe they have a set schedule or perhaps they outsource their social media management. Whatever their strategy, it can serve as a useful reference point for you.</p><p> Of course, the big question: art or likes? Social media can skew your focus towards getting validation rather than improving your craft. It&#39;s important to hear from someone who&#39;s navigated these waters successfully. They can offer advice on how to maintain your artistic integrity while still engaging with an online audience. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="whose-work-has-influenced-you-most"> 15.

In my experience, it&#39;s best to set up near rivers or lakes, because they offer an abundant food source for the birds, and you&#39;ll often be able to move along the water&#39;s edge for different angles.</p><p> You might also try doing a quick search online for the best birding locations near you. Alternatively, you can find a birding forum or a birding blog that lists bird count data; that way, you can head to the locations that interest you based on your target bird species.</p><p> Once you&#39;ve found a location, observe the flying birds for a few moments. Look for a position – on a bank or a hill – that will put you as close to the bird&#39;s level as possible. (In other words, you don&#39;t want to be shooting up at the birds from below or down at the birds from above. You want the most direct, dead-ahead angle possible.)</p><p> And check out the position of the sun, because you should <em>not</em> be shooting into it. Light coming from behind you or from the left or the right of your position is preferred.</p><p> Also, birds will generally take off and land into the wind, so knowing the wind direction will help you predict the flight path of the birds you are photographing.</p><p> Finding the best bird in flight locations will take a <em>lot</em> of trial and error. Many of the locations you check out will be duds – but it&#39;ll be worth it, because very occasionally, you&#39;ll find an area you can return to again and again and again. Scout enough locations, and you&#39;ll end up with a good list of these hotspots! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shoot-during-the-best-light">2.

Really, as long as you shoot in the two hours after sunrise and the two hours before sunset, the light will look great (though remember that you need to carefully choose your position; you want the birds to be illuminated from the front, not the back!).</p><p> Also, because you&#39;re photographing birds in the air, you&#39;ll still get nice lighting on your subject even if you shoot a little before or after the golden hours (just make sure the light doesn&#39;t get too harsh!).</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="make-yourself-invisible">3.

You can also stay low to the ground as you approach a bird hotspot or use natural cover (eg, trees). As you get more serious, you might consider wearing camouflage clothing, using a blind, or even shooting from your car window (birds tend to be less bothered by cars, so you can often drive close to birds that would normally fly away).</p><p> Once you&#39;ve found a nice spot, keep relatively still. Don&#39;t make any sudden movements. Instead, keep everything slow and steady as you set up your camera, then take a seat if you can (I recommend maintaining that low profile).</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-the-right-gear"> 4.

It&#39;ll help you balance your setup while tracking birds (though a less expensive option is a pan head, which can also work well). Finally, while ball heads can be used for birds in flight photography, they&#39;re not a very stable solution for large lenses, so I don&#39;t generally recommend them.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="study-your-subject"> 5.

For instance, many birds, especially the larger species like herons or eagles, will relieve themselves just before they fly. Knowing this can give you a split-second warning that translates into a beautiful takeoff shot.</p><p> Really, a lot of this studying will occur while you&#39;re out photographing. Just by watching the birds, by identifying their behavioral habits, by seeing <em>what</em> they do and <em>when</em> they do it, you&#39;ll accumulate plenty of useful knowledge.</p><p> For instance, did you know that shorebirds tend to run down the beach in a consistent direction? So if you want close-up shots of skittish shorebirds in flight, determine their direction, position yourself down the beach, get on the ground, and wait for them to come to you!</p><p> (That&#39;s the kind of thing you learn after spending hours and hours watching birds on a beach!) </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="get-your-birds-in-flight-camera-settings-right"> 6.

And it can get a little complex.</p><p> However, I do have some recommendations that should simplify the process immensely.</p><p> First, use <a aria-label="Aperture Priority mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Aperture Priority mode</a> ; that way, you have control over your aperture and ISO at all times (and by boosting your ISO or widening the aperture, you can increase the <a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> ).</p><p> Second, set your aperture to around f/8 or so. This is where your lens will be most crisp, plus it will give you enough depth of field to get wingtip-to-wingtip sharpness.</p><p> Third, set your ISO to its lowest value, which is generally around ISO 100. The goal here is to avoid boosting the ISO, which will create <em>noise</em> . That said, when photographing in low light, you&#39;ll need to raise the ISO to increase the shutter speed.</p><p> Now, in birds in flight photography, the shutter speed is probably the most essential setting, because if you get it too slow, the bird&#39;s wings will blur, and this rarely looks good. In general, I&#39;d recommend using a shutter speed of at least 1/1000s, and 1/2000s and beyond is better. (Your minimum shutter speed will change, though, depending on the speed of the bird; large birds in flight, like herons and geese, are slow, whereas small birds in flight, such as wrens, dart through the sky.)</p><p> Anyway, dial in the aperture and ISO, then look at your shutter speed, which your camera will select based purely on exposure considerations. Ask yourself: Is this shutter speed fast enough? If so, then you&#39;re golden – but if not, you&#39;ll need to either raise your ISO or widen your aperture so that your camera has enough light to boost the shutter speed.</p><p> I&#39;d recommend boosting the ISO before you adjust the aperture. But if your ISO is creeping into noisy territory, it might make sense to widen the aperture rather than risk a too-noisy image.</p><p> Once you&#39;ve dialed in all your settings, I&#39;d recommend doing a quick test. Capture a few photos of nearby birds (they don&#39;t need to be well composed – the goal is to make sure your shutter speed is fast enough and your aperture is narrow enough). Zoom in on your camera LCD, make sure everything looks good, then have fun photographing birds in flight! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="learn-good-focusing-technique"> 7.

That way, whenever you half press the shutter button, the focus will engage – then it will <em>refocus</em> as your subject moves. (Nikon and many other manufacturers call this mode “AF-C,” though Canon calls it “AI Servo.”)</p><p> You should set your camera to its fastest <a aria-label="burst mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/burst-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">burst mode</a> , also known as its continuous shooting mode. This will let you capture a series of images in quick succession as a bird flies by.</p><p> Next, you&#39;ll want to engage your camera&#39;s tracking AF-area mode. It&#39;ll tell your camera to track the bird through the frame, even as it flies left and right, up and down, etc. The specifics will depend on your camera, but some form of “tracking” should do the trick. Also, if your camera offers it, try activating your animal Eye AF, which will specifically identify and track birds&#39; eyes through the frame.</p><p> Then, once your camera is set, start focusing on the bird when it&#39;s either a) perching and about to take off, or b) flying far off in the distance. Half-press the shutter button, and keep tracking the bird as it takes off and/or comes closer. Once the bird flies into the prime area, press the shutter button down completely, fire off a burst of shots, and – fingers crossed! – you&#39;ll get a good result.</p><p> A few additional tips:</p><p> When the bird flies by, keep panning even after you&#39;ve stopped shooting. This follow-through motion will keep your last image in focus better than an abrupt stop.</p><p> Also, when panning as the bird flies by, you want to match your panning speed to that of the bird. Even if you&#39;re forced to drop your shutter speed, perfect panning will keep the bird sharp while the background blurs.</p><p> Aim to keep the bird&#39;s eye in focus and sharp; this is key. If you are handholding your setup, try to keep your left hand under the barrel of your lens and your elbows close to your body, as this will help you maneuver the camera as steadily as possible. If you are standing, keep your legs spread out to create a good sturdy base.</p><p> Finally, if you&#39;re planning to hold your location and position for a time, I recommend a tripod. This will help keep your camera steady, especially if you&#39;re using a very heavy lens. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="aim-for-a-powerful-composition"> 8.

/></span></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-keep-your-photos-simple"> 1.让你的照片简单</h2><p>当谈到街头肖像时，<em>简单是你的朋友</em>。力求简单的主题、简单的背景和简单的构图。</p><p>所以在按下快门按钮之前，请仔细观察场景。有没有不必要的元素？背景是否足够简单以突出主题？整个镜头是否感觉平衡且整洁？</p><p>如果您<em>确实</em>注意到构图中不必要的部分，请尝试将其删除。有时，这就像向右或向左移动几步一样简单。其他时候，您可能需要靠近、远离或站到高处。</p><p>专业提示：破坏街头肖像的最快方法之一是添加繁忙、复杂的背景。杂乱的背景会让你的图像看起来很平淡，它会吞噬你的主题，并且会分散观看者的注意力。就我个人而言，我喜欢干净、色彩丰富且强烈的背景，如下所示：</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-109206" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img

将世界分解为元素</h2><p>构图是街头人像摄影的基本组成部分，但它往往是初学者的症结所在。毕竟，如何安排场景元素以获得完美的活力和平衡？</p><p>我的建议？尝试将世界分解为元素。然后告诉自己，你只是<em>以一种有趣的方式组织世界</em>。</p><p>你看，3D 眼睛和大脑让事情变得不必要的复杂，而且——正如我在上一篇技巧中讨论的——最好的街头肖像往往很简单。所以你也需要简单地看待这个世界。</p><p>您可以将世界分解为物体（例如，道路、窗户、门、砖块、屋顶、人等）。或者您可能会更进一步，从几何角度（例如，正方形、圆形、矩形等）来观察世界。两者都可以工作；关键是选择一种方法并坚持下去。</p><p>然后从那里构建你的作品。寻找不同元素之间的关系。考虑如何让他们在整个框架中相互平衡。请记住：您只需要一两个有趣的元素即可制作一张照片。如果您能够识别正确的元素，并以正确的方式将它们组合在一起，您最终会得到一幅美丽的图像。</p><div

Confidently direct your model</h2><p> If you want great fashion photos, you must be prepared to confidently and self-assuredly direct your model.</p><p> Models reflect the direction they&#39;re given, so if you show signs of anxiety or stress – or you give them a lack of direction – this will inevitably come through in the final photos.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236081" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-5.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="fashion photography tips and techniques" class="wp-image-236081" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-5.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-5.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-5.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-5.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-5.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Instead, act confident and personable. At the beginning of the shoot, communicate your agenda. Then, as you work, talk to your subject. Explain what you want to see, and offer plenty of praise when you get the shot you&#39;re after (and even when you don&#39;t!).</p><p> If you&#39;re feeling anxious about the shoot and you&#39;re worried you won&#39;t be able to offer confident direction, then it can help to spend extra time getting prepared. In fact, if you&#39;re nervous, then over-preparedness can be a good thing! Organize a shot list, and mentally rehearse technique and composition for each image. Prepare the location, props, and clothes ahead of time. That way, you&#39;re free to focus on your model during the actual shoot.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236091" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-7.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="fashion photography tips and techniques" class="wp-image-236091" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-7.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-7.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-7.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-7.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-7.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="determine-an-overall-theme"> 2. Determine an overall theme</h2><p> The best fashion photography isn&#39;t just about photographing a fashionably dressed model; instead, it&#39;s about conveying an overall <em>look</em> and a specific <em>mood</em> .</p><p> So before you start shooting, identify the particular effect that you&#39;re after, whether it&#39;s dark and dramatic, bright and airy, or even a specific narrative or concept. Then make sure that <em>everything</em> about the model, the scene, and your photographic approach reflects this.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236083" style="width:511px"><span class="space" style="width:511px; padding-top:117.42%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="511" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=511%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="fashion photography tips and techniques" class="wp-image-236083" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=511%2C600&amp;ssl=1 511w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=256%2C300&amp;ssl=1 256w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=768%2C901&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=717%2C842&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-4.jpg?w=1278&amp;ssl=1 1278w" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Use makeup and hair styling to complement the clothes and the model. If you want a provocative or seductive look, opt for dark, heavy makeup and over-styled hair; if you want an innocent or natural look, choose subdued pastel tones, gentle makeup, and soft, flowing hairstyles.</p><p> You should also light the scene accordingly. Sidelight produces dramatic, moody, three-dimensional images, while <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/front-light-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="frontlight (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">frontlight</a> is eye-catching and energetic but has a flattening effect.</p><p> And you can bring in specific props to add that perfect final touch. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="inspire-yourself-with-sample-poses"> 3.

Fortunately, there&#39;s a simple trick you can use to level up your posing skills, fast:</p><p> Create a file with poses you like, and look at it <em>constantly</em> .</p><p> Start by browsing through the latest fashion magazines, and when you see a pose that fits your style and interests, take a photo (or a screenshot). You can also browse through the portfolios of top fashion photographers, look on Instagram, etc.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236085" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="fashion photography tips and techniques" class="wp-image-236085" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-6.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> As you collect poses, add them to a file on your phone. Then look at them frequently – whenever you get the chance. Study them. For each shot, ask yourself: What makes this pose work? What do I like about it? What would I improve?</p><p> You&#39;ll soon have a mental repository of poses you can draw on during your photoshoots. And if you forget the details of a pose or you&#39;re in need of inspiration during a session, feel free to pull out your phone and swipe through a few collection items!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="work-in-a-studio"> 4. Work in a studio</h2><p> Yes, it&#39;s possible to do outdoor fashion photography shoots. But studios are <em>so much easier</em> to work in because you can easily control the lighting and stabilize the conditions – so unless you&#39;re extremely confident in your skills, a studio is the place to be.</p><p> Prepare the studio ahead of time with the backdrops, props, plenty of space, lights, and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/a-beginners-guide-to-light-modifiers/" target="_blank" aria-label="modifiers (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">modifiers</a> that you anticipate needing.

You might even take a few test shots before your model arrives just to make sure everything is working properly.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236087" style="width:399px"><span class="space" style="width:399px; padding-top:150.38%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="399" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-8-1.jpg?resize=399%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="fashion photography tips and techniques" class="wp-image-236087" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-8-1.jpg?resize=399%2C600&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-8-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-8-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1154&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-8-1.jpg?resize=717%2C1078&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-8-1.jpg?w=998&amp;ssl=1 998w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> While you can rent professional studio space, this isn&#39;t always necessary, especially if you&#39;re just starting out. Instead, create a home studio space – basements are great for this! – and furnish it with a backdrop stand and your lighting kit.</p><p> Professionals tend to use studio strobes, but these can get pretty expensive. Speedlights are a good substitute, and if you&#39;re strapped for cash, you can even create a basic studio setup <em>without</em> any fancy artificial lights; just work in a room with a large window, then hang a white sheet across it.

This should be your main light, or key light, and you should angle it to create the effect you&#39;re after (here, the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-portrait-lighting-patterns-every-photographer-should-know/" target="_blank" aria-label="standard portrait photography lighting patterns (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">standard portrait photography lighting patterns</a> can be helpful!). Don&#39;t be afraid to experiment with different positions and angles until you find one you like.</p><p> Then, once you have your key light in position, go ahead and <em>build</em> the rest of your setup. Take a few test shots, then identify areas that are shadow-heavy and require fill. Move additional lights or reflectors into position, then continue to take test shots so you can gauge the effect.</p><p> Pretty soon, you&#39;ll end up with a result that you like. And pro tip: After each session, draw lighting diagrams to help you remember the setups that worked. That way, you can use them again at your next shoot! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-props-including-a-mirror"> 6. Use props (including a mirror)</h2><p> Props are a great way to create a narrative within a fashion shot, and I highly recommend them. It helps to acquire plenty of props ahead of time, and then – after you identify your shoot theme – you can pick out the props that seem to work best.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236089" style="width:399px"><span class="space" style="width:399px; padding-top:150.38%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="399" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-1.jpg?resize=399%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="fashion photography tips and techniques" class="wp-image-236089" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-1.jpg?resize=399%2C600&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1154&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-1.jpg?resize=717%2C1078&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-1.jpg?w=998&amp;ssl=1 998w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Of course, don&#39;t <em>overdo</em> it. Props should complement the model, but they shouldn&#39;t draw the eye away from the main areas of interest.</p><p> One of my favorite props is the humble mirror, which every fashion photographer should keep on hand. A mirror can tell a story, plus it is an effective way to display the front and back of your model.</p><p> To get the mirror exposure right, you may need to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/bracketing-what-is-it-and-what-to-do-with-the-images/" target="_blank" aria-label="bracket your images (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">bracket your images</a> . You&#39;ll also need to be careful when positioning yourself and your lighting equipment; you don&#39;t want a lighting stand, your computer, or a strobe to be reflected in the final image! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="pick-a-background-to-match-your-theme"> 7. Pick a background to match your theme</h2><p> Beginners often forget to think about the background, but this is a mistake. A <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-types-portrait-backgrounds-creative-images/" target="_blank" aria-label="good background (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">good background</a> can complement the main subject and unify the image, while a bad background will distract the viewer and may feel out of place.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236075" style="width:434px"><span class="space" style="width:434px; padding-top:138.25%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="434" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-10.jpg?resize=434%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="fashion photography tips and techniques" class="wp-image-236075" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-10.jpg?resize=434%2C600&amp;ssl=1 434w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-10.jpg?resize=217%2C300&amp;ssl=1 217w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-10.jpg?resize=768%2C1063&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-10.jpg?resize=717%2C992&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-10.jpg?w=1084&amp;ssl=1 1084w" sizes="(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you&#39;re working in a studio, you can purchase backdrops and hang them behind your model. Solid colors are a good starting point, but as you get more serious, you may want to invest in some quality hand-painted backdrops. (If you&#39;re very artsy, you might try painting them yourself!)</p><p> And if you&#39;re shooting outdoors, make sure you choose your location carefully. If the clothing and styling are edgy, hard, or provocative, an urban setting – with a worn brick wall in the background – will work well. On the other hand, if you want a spring or summer look, you might work in a field, a meadow, a beach, a woodland, or on a river bank. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="experiment-with-different-angles"> 8. Experiment with different angles</h2><p> Your vantage point can make or break a fashion image.</p><p> So when you&#39;re working with your model, be sure to shoot from plenty of different angles.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236073" style="width:401px"><span class="space" style="width:401px; padding-top:149.63%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="401" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=401%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="fashion photography tips and techniques" class="wp-image-236073" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=401%2C600&amp;ssl=1 401w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1150&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=717%2C1073&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-2.jpg?w=1002&amp;ssl=1 1002w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Try getting up high (here, stairs or even a ladder can be helpful!), crouching down low, getting on the ground, moving around the model, and so on. Make sure you always keep your overall theme in mind and consider how different vantage points affect the look of the image.</p><p> Also, once you find an angle you like, spend some time <em>working</em> it. Try a few different compositional variations, move slightly from side to side, take a step forward or back, and so on. That way, you&#39;re guaranteed to get the best possible shot.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="bring-an-assistant"> 9. Bring an assistant</h2><p> Fashion photography can be done on your own…</p><p> …but if you want to <em>really</em> kick your work up a notch, then bring along an assistant to each photoshoot. That way, you have an extra pair of hands to position reflectors, angle and reset lighting equipment, tweak the positions of garments, and clear the scene.</p><p> You can always hire someone, but I&#39;d recommend roping in a friend or family member. Photography students may also be willing to help you out, especially if you&#39;re willing to provide some mentoring.</p><p> Note that you don&#39;t need someone with experience. Working as an assistant isn&#39;t necessarily hard – it just requires a willingness to follow directions and listen closely! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="fashion-photography-tips-final-words"> Fashion photography tips: final words</h2><p> Well, there you have it:</p><p> 9 tips to enhance your fashion photos.</p><p> Remember: Fashion photography doesn&#39;t have to be difficult.

In other words, the light travels over the photographer&#39;s shoulder and impacts the subject head-on.</p><p> Because front lighting hits objects directly, front-lit photos tend to feature limited shadows and eye-catching, in-your-face subjects. Here&#39;s an example front-lit image; pay attention to how the front of the hook is bright and lacks shadows: </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-232477" style="width:1024px"><span class="space" style="width:1024px; padding-top:66.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&#038;ssl=1" alt="crane hook front light photography" class="wp-image-232477" style="width:1024px;height:681px" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?resize=1536%2C1022&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?resize=2048%2C1363&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> <a href="https://geni.us/NikonD800" target="_blank" aria-label="Nikon D800 (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Nikon D800</a> | 105mm | f/8 | 1/100s | ISO 200</figcaption></figure></div><p> Note, however, that front lighting can come from high above the subject, far below the subject, or on a level with the subject.

Use open shade for front-lit portraits</h3><p> As I explained in the previous section, front lighting is great for portrait photography. However, you need to be careful when doing front-lit portraits; unless you&#39;re working on an overcast day or late in the afternoon, a bright sun will produce all sorts of unpleasant shadows. It&#39;ll also cause your subject to squint.</p><p> My recommendation? Maintain the front-lit direction, but move your subject into open shade. Position your subject <em>near</em> the edge of the shade, but don&#39;t let them step over the shadow line; that way, their face will be softly illuminated and they won&#39;t need to squint, but you&#39;ll have plenty of bright light to work with.</p><p> By the way, you should also pay attention to reflective objects. Light can reflect off the ground, nearby cars, or building walls, and by positioning your subject near these reflective light sources, you can get beautiful effects.</p><p> Finally, if you&#39;re stuck shooting with <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/photography-in-harsh-mid-day-light/" target="_blank" aria-label="harsh midday light (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">harsh midday light</a> and you cannot move your subject into a shaded area, I encourage you to bring in some artificial lighting.

Trust your camera&#39;s exposure recommendations</h3><p> As I emphasized above, front lighting is very <em>even</em> – which means that, when you point your camera at a front-lit subject, you&#39;ll generally get a good exposure reading.</p><p> Of course, your camera can still make mistakes, especially when you&#39;re shooting very light or very dark subjects.

Don&#39;t be afraid to turn your subject</h3><p> Front lighting can produce flat images.</p><p> And while flat shots <em>can</em> look interesting, many types of photography thrive off of three-dimensionality and depth.</p><p> Fortunately, there&#39;s an easy solution:</p><p> If your shot is looking a little flat, then just <em>turn your subject</em> . This works great for portraits, and it&#39;s also a good trick for shooting products and certain still-life subjects.</p><p> Of course, you don&#39;t want to turn your subject <em>too</em> dramatically, but go for a subtle turn and see what you think. If you&#39;re working with a portrait subject, ask them to turn slowly, and carefully watch how the light and shadows affect their face. (You may only need a <em>slight</em> turn to create a more three-dimensional photo!)</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="height-of-light"> 4. Pay attention to the light height</h3><p> The height of the light source will dramatically affect your photos, so whenever you&#39;re doing front light photography, you <em>must</em> pay careful attention to the light&#39;s position!</p><p> Note that this is true for natural light <em>and</em> artificial light – though you do have more control over a flash or LED panel. If the sun is positioned too high or too low, you&#39;ll often need to wait a few hours or come back another day, but if you don&#39;t like the height of your off-camera flash, you can simply raise or lower the light stand. Make sense?</p><p> So when you&#39;re using a flash or continuous light, experiment constantly with the light height. And as you work, watch how the light position affects shadows and creates different effects.</p><p> You&#39;ll also need to watch out for unpleasant reflections. When shooting shiny subjects, for instance, a light positioned on a level with the subject will reflect right back into the camera lens, producing a distracting highlight. To avoid these reflections, try moving the light higher, lower, or (slightly) to the side.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-232475" style="width:2500px"><span class="space" style="width:2500px; padding-top:66.56%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2500" height="1664" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/teen-girl.jpg?resize=2500%2C1664&#038;ssl=1" alt="teen girl dressed as the mad hatter front light photography" class="wp-image-232475" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/teen-girl.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/teen-girl.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/teen-girl.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/teen-girl.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/teen-girl.jpg?resize=1536%2C1022&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/teen-girl.jpg?resize=2048%2C1363&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/teen-girl.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/teen-girl.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Nikon D800 | 105mm | f/16 | 1/200s | ISO 200 </figcaption></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="make-the-best-use-of-front-light-during-golden-hour"> 5.

Here&#39;s a quick rundown of some of the technical things you should become familiar with:</p><ul><li> <strong>Understanding the basics:</strong> Get comfortable with your camera and learn about the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/mastering-the-exposure-triangle-for-newbies/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure triangle (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure triangle</a> . In other words, learn how exposure works and know what your setup&#39;s ISO, aperture, and shutter speed do.</li><li> <strong>Composition:</strong> Techniques like the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/" target="_blank" aria-label="rule of thirds (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">rule of thirds</a> and s-curves aren&#39;t just buzzwords; they can make or break a portrait.</li><li> <strong>Lighting and flash photography:</strong> Whether you&#39;re a fan of natural light or prefer the controlled environment of a studio, understanding lighting is non-negotiable. And don&#39;t underestimate the power of flash photography; it can be a game-changer. (I offer several popular resources on lighting, including my course, <a href="https://geni.us/flashphotographycourse" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Flash Photography for Portraits</a> .)</li></ul><ul><li> <strong>Post-processing:</strong> Lightroom and Photoshop are your friends, not foes. You don&#39;t have to be an expert at <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/11-steps-basic-portrait-editing-lightroom-beginners-guide/" target="_blank" aria-label="portrait editing and retouching (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">portrait editing and retouching</a> , but a basic understanding will go a long way.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-art-of-seeing">The art of seeing</h2><p> Developing an eye for what makes a compelling portrait is one of the differences between a snap-shooter and a pro. Here&#39;s how you can cultivate that:</p><ul><li> <strong>Study the masters:</strong> Take some time to analyze the work of great portrait photographers. This can be an education in itself.查看书籍或在线查找他们的作品。 I would focus not only on contemporary artists but also on the work of portraitists from the late 1800s through the 1970s.</li><li> <strong>Practice constantly:</strong> The more you shoot, the better you get. It&#39;s that simple. Over time, you&#39;ll develop a relationship with the art of portraiture that reveals your own unique style.</li></ul><ul><li> <strong>Stay updated but be yourself:</strong> Trends come and go, but your style is your own. Don&#39;t lose it while trying to be someone you&#39;re not. </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="soft-skills-portrait-photography-is-about-people"> Soft skills: portrait photography is about people</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-257494" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/become-portrait-photographer-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to Become a Professional Portrait Photographer (+ Course)" class="wp-image-257494" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/become-portrait-photographer-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/become-portrait-photographer-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/become-portrait-photographer-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/become-portrait-photographer-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/become-portrait-photographer-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/become-portrait-photographer-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Capturing a portrait is more than just clicking the shutter; it&#39;s about creating a connection with the person in front of your lens. I&#39;ve had many sessions that started off with the typical looks, body language, and expressions – elements that would probably fail to make any real connection with the viewer.</p><p> However, given a little time, my clients become so comfortable and have so much fun with the portraiture <em>process</em> that their personalities start to shine through. Authenticity, open communication, and a touch of empathy can go a long way in making your subject feel at ease.</p><ul><li> <strong>Building trust:</strong> The comfort level between you and your subject will be obvious in the final image. Build that trust, and it will naturally reflect in your portraits.</li><li> <strong>Guidance and posing:</strong> You don&#39;t have to be an <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-pose-and-angle-the-body-for-better-portraits/" target="_blank" aria-label="expert in posing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">expert in posing</a> to get a good shot. A few well-practiced, natural poses can make all the difference. Guide your subjects in these poses, and you&#39;ll find the results to be more organic and flattering.</li><li> <strong>Adaptability:</strong> In the world of portrait photography, not everything goes as planned. Being prepared to pivot and tackle unforeseen challenges is just part of the job. This also reassures your subject that they&#39;re in good, competent hands, as you&#39;ll be able to create compelling portraits even when conditions are less than favorable. </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="marketing-and-career-growth-the-other-side-of-the-lens"> Marketing and career growth: the other side of the lens</h2><p> Turning a hobby into a full-time career involves more than just technical skills and an artistic eye; it requires a knack for business. Believe it or not, the business side of photography can be just as creative and fulfilling as the art itself. There&#39;s a lot to learn about going pro and building a thriving portrait business!</p><p> Here are some things that you&#39;ll want to get a handle on:</p><ul><li> <strong>How to curate a portfolio:</strong> Your portfolio is your visual resume. Make it compelling, and you&#39;ll draw in the right types of clients.</li><li> <strong>Networking and collaboration:</strong> The power of a strong network can&#39;t be overstated. Create connections with fellow photographers and potential clients. You never know when a collaboration could lead to your next big opportunity.</li><li> <strong>Pricing and packages:</strong> Know your market and tailor your packages accordingly. Offering value is key to attracting and retaining clients.</li></ul><ul><li> <strong>Client relationship management:</strong> A happy client is not just a repeat customer but also a walking advertisement for your services. Listen to their feedback and aim for excellence in every project you take on.</li><li> <strong>How to master the art of selling:</strong> Let&#39;s face it, many of us aren&#39;t born salespeople.
