You can then check the selected shutter speed and adjust it as needed by raising or lowering the ISO. This method allows for quick adjustments as your subjects move.</p><p> Remember: Wildlife photography often involves unpredictable movements.

Then let&#39;s dive right in, starting with my first tip:</p><h2 data-section id="take-proper-safety-precautions"> 1. Take proper safety precautions</h2><p> First things first:</p><p> Seascape photography can be dangerous. As a seascape photographer, you&#39;ll spend time hiking over slippery and sharp rocks as the tide rises and the waves come closer and closer.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255724" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.2%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="993" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-5.jpg?resize=1500%2C993&#038;ssl=1" alt="Seascape photography" class="wp-image-255724" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-5.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-5.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-5.jpg?resize=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-5.jpg?resize=768%2C508&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-5.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-5.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-5.jpg?resize=717%2C475&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> So always be aware of your surroundings and constantly observe what is happening around you. I&#39;ve been trapped on a rocky outcrop with nothing but a wild sea around me. I&#39;ve also been completely soaked by freak waves, and I&#39;ve almost lost my camera more than once.</p><p> On the other hand, if you take proper precautions, you&#39;ll find that the results of your sea adventures will be well worth it! Wear shoes with plenty of traction, always carry a phone, and keep waterproof bags on hand in case you need to protect your camera. And be mindful of the tide; if it starts to come in, make sure you have a clear exit strategy.</p><p> Finally, shoot with fellow photographers so you can help one other if necessary.</p><h2 data-section id="scout-the-area-and-follow-the-tides"> 2. Scout the area and follow the tides</h2><p> Once you pick a seascape photography location, start with a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/importance-scouting-landscape-photographers/" target="_blank" aria-label="scouting trip (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">scouting trip</a> . Consider possible <a aria-label="foreground elements (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/using-layers-foreground-interest-better-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">foreground elements</a> (such as rocks and sand patterns), look for stunning backgrounds (such as sea stacks), and pay careful attention to water levels.</p><p> Additionally, spend plenty of time researching the tides. Most coastal towns will have a tide table or chart available (you can also simply Google “tide table for [location]”), and I encourage you to study it carefully.</p><p> Now, there is no <em>best</em> tide for seascape photos. The right tide depends on the location, which is why a scouting trip is so critical. As you identify key foregrounds and backgrounds, you&#39;ll need to note the tide – then make sure you plan your photo outing for a time when the essential compositional elements are exposed. (You don&#39;t want to scout at low tide, only to return with your camera at high tide and find that the rock you were planning to photograph is now submerged!)</p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-75766"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-75766" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:56%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="336" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Seascape.jpg?resize=600%2C336&#038;ssl=1" alt="seascape photography" class="wp-image-75766" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Seascape.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Seascape.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> And bear in mind that the tide can affect the water movement and wave size. High tide will often offer lots of wave movement on beaches, but it might restrict water movement in other areas, so pay careful attention and head out when the conditions are right.</p><p> Oh, and always remember to look out for areas where the tide might rise. Little channels and gullies might seem innocuous, but they can be <em>very</em> dangerous at high tide; the water may recede when the tide is out, but as the tide comes in, such areas can become impossible to cross.</p><p> Pro tip: It can be a good idea to chat with local photographers and fishermen when planning a shoot. The locals often possess <em>tons</em> of knowledge you won&#39;t get from tide charts.</p><h2 data-section id="track-the-weather"> 3. Track the weather</h2><p> Do you want soft, serene seascape images? Or intense, dramatic shots with stormy skies? Here, the weather makes a huge difference – so it&#39;s important to plan ahead.</p><p> Unfortunately, the weather in most coastal areas can be pretty unpredictable. A storm can roll in pretty quickly; alternatively, you may find yourself frustrated by clear skies when you were hoping for dark clouds.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255723" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-7.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Seascape photography" class="wp-image-255723" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-7.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-7.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-7.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-7.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-7.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> So be sure to check the weather forecast a few hours before you plan to shoot, and then again right before you head out. I&#39;d also encourage you to frequently watch the skies when you&#39;re shooting. That way, if an unexpected storm whips up, you can be prepared.</p><p> And bear in mind that the weather, and particularly the wind, can make it tough to shoot sharp seascape photos. Heavy winds will shake your tripod and coat you (and your camera) with seaspray – so always carry a towel, and don&#39;t be afraid to quit if the conditions become too rough.</p><h2 data-section id="choose-your-location-and-lighting-in-advance"> 4. Choose your location and lighting in advance</h2><p> Coastal areas offer all sorts of photographic opportunities, and it&#39;s easy to get overwhelmed – so I encourage you to identify your areas of interest in advance. (A scouting trip, as I discussed in a previous tip, is invaluable!)</p><p> Once you&#39;ve picked a location, use an app like <a href="https://www.photopills.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="PhotoPills (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">PhotoPills</a> to determine the location of the sun around sunrise and sunset.

That way, I can give the water a soft, silky effect and create images that look somewhat surreal. To get the look I&#39;m after, I generally need a shutter speed of 1/30s or slower, which is easy to achieve when shooting during the blue hour but tougher to get when the sun is still above the horizon. It&#39;s a good idea to carry a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/neutral-density-filters-landscape-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="neutral density filter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">neutral density filter</a> or two; these simply darken down the scene so that you can use a longer shutter speed even in brighter light.</p><p> Pro tip: Try combining a neutral density filter with blue-hour light. You can <em>really</em> drop that shutter speed and create a fantasy-like effect – with misty water and streaky clouds.</p><p> Note that it&#39;s not always possible to perfectly predict the effect of a slow shutter speed on the water. Different water speeds will produce different types of long-exposure blur, so I&#39;d encourage you to experiment as much as possible and take plenty of images!</p><p> If you&#39;re faced with intense wave action, you may wish to freeze the scene instead.

Depending on your location, marine animals such as dolphins or seals can make surprise appearances and offer truly unique photo opportunities.</p><p> If you&#39;re photographing distant wildlife, a telephoto lens can be a valuable tool – but you can also get great results by simply portraying the wildlife within their natural environment.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255717" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.33%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="995" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-6.jpg?resize=1500%2C995&#038;ssl=1" alt="Seascape photography" class="wp-image-255717" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-6.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-6.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-6.jpg?resize=600%2C398&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-6.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-6.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-6.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-6.jpg?resize=717%2C476&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Overall, consider how the wildlife complements your seascape, and make sure that the various elements work together. Including wildlife requires balance and thoughtful consideration to ensure that the animals enhance, not distract, from the beautiful scenery you&#39;re aiming to capture.</p><h2 data-section id="try-some-aerials"> 12. Try some aerials</h2><p> Over the past few years, drone photography has taken the world by storm. And while drone shots can get a little repetitive, a drone&#39;s view from high above the sea can reveal gorgeous geometric patterns in the features below – the kind that seascape shooters shouldn&#39;t miss! Curves of the coastline, the ebb and flow of waves, and boasts coasting across the waves all come to life from an overhead vantage point.</p><p> So if you have access to a drone, use it! Fly at different altitudes and angles to uncover unique perspectives. Experiment by including or excluding the sky from the shots.</p><p> Also, note that the sea&#39;s grandeur and beauty can be accentuated by the right lighting and time of day. Sunsets, in particular, can cast a magical glow over the waters, while harsh midday light can make for interesting high-contrast shots.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255718" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:71.13%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1067" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-3.jpg?resize=1500%2C1067&#038;ssl=1" alt="Seascape photography" class="wp-image-255718" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-3.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-3.jpg?resize=300%2C213&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-3.jpg?resize=600%2C427&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-3.jpg?resize=768%2C546&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-3.jpg?resize=717%2C510&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Remember, though, to be mindful of the weather conditions. The seaside can be a rough place. Safety should always be your priority; you don&#39;t want to lose your drone to a stray gust of wind! Also, different locations have different drone laws, and respecting these regulations is vital to a successful aerial shoot. Always do your research before sending that drone up into the sky!</p><h2 data-section id="use-intentional-camera-movement-for-creative-abstracts"> 13.

One goal to keep in mind when picking your settings, therefore, is to create an image with plenty of detail in the shadows, highlights, and midtones.</p><p> However, the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO <em>also</em> affect other aspects of each image. The aperture adjusts the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="depth of field of the scene (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field of the scene</a> , the shutter speed determines scene sharpness, and the ISO influences the overall image quality.</p><p> Therefore, you need to choose each setting <em>carefully</em> . Here are my recommendations:</p><ul><li> Pick your aperture <em>first</em> based on your depth of field requirements. If you want an <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-get-shallow-depth-of-field-in-your-digital-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="artistic shallow depth of field effect (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">artistic shallow depth of field effect</a> , then choose a wide aperture, such as f/2.8. If you want a sharper background, go for a narrower aperture, such as f/8.</li><li> Next, choose the slowest shutter speed that&#39;ll get you consistently sharp shots. If your subject is stationary, you might choose 1/160s. If your subject is moving, you might go for 1/500s or higher.</li><li> Finally, dial in your camera&#39;s native ISO value (generally ISO 100) for the highest-quality photos.</li></ul><p> Once you&#39;ve chosen your <em>ideal</em> settings, frame your subject and check the exposure meter. If your image is underexposed, then you&#39;ll need to <em>either</em> increase your ISO <em>or</em> widen your aperture further. Personally, I&#39;m a fan of shallow depth of field portraits, so I don&#39;t mind widening the aperture as far as it&#39;ll go – but if you&#39;re set on a sharp background, then go ahead and boost the ISO until you have a good exposure.</p><p> If your image is overexposed, then simply boost the shutter speed until the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understand-camera-light-meter-desired-exposure/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure meter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure meter</a> is balanced.</p><h2 data-section id="night-portrait-photography-lighting"> Night portrait photography lighting</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255697" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Night photography portraits" class="wp-image-255697" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-5-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Without <em>some</em> form of artificial lighting, you&#39;ll struggle to capture detailed images of your portrait subjects. The shots will turn out either wildly underexposed <em>or</em> very blurry, neither of which is ideal.</p><p> Note that your artificial lighting need not be a flash. It can be a streetlight, a neon sign, a phone flashlight – anything that lights up your subject and provides a bit of illumination for your camera to use. Of course, the light needs to be accessible; if you plan to use streetlights for your next photoshoot, for instance, make sure there are some nearby and on public land!</p><p> That said, I do recommend carrying an off-camera flash for nighttime portraits. This will give you the most flexibility – you can adjust the brightness and the direction – and you can use it to produce beautiful effects.</p><p> I&#39;d also recommend buying a light stand, which you can use to mount your flash. (Alternatively, you can bring an assistant, who can hold the flash and aim it as needed.)

In this section, I offer plenty of techniques to get you started.</p><h3 data-section id="use-a-camera-or-lens-with-image-stabilization"> 1. Use a camera or lens with image stabilization</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255698" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="994" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-7.jpg?resize=1500%2C994&#038;ssl=1" alt="Night photography portraits" class="wp-image-255698" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-7.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-7.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-7.jpg?resize=600%2C398&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-7.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-7.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-7.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-7.jpg?resize=717%2C475&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Shooting in low light often means dealing with slower shutter speeds – and when the shutter is slow, even a slight shake of the hand can result in a blurry shot. This is where image stabilization comes to the rescue. It&#39;s designed to counteract small movements caused by camera shake as well as the vibrations from pressing the shutter button.</p><p> The benefit of image stabilization in night portraiture can&#39;t be overstated. It can truly be the difference between a sharp shot and a blurry one, especially if your subject is stationary. Many lenses come with this feature, and manufacturers give it a variety of names, so keep an eye out for terms like “VR,” “IS,” “OIS,” or “OS” when choosing a lens.</p><p> Also, if you&#39;re considering a new camera, some mirrorless models do offer built-in image stabilization. However, these cameras tend to be quite expensive, so it&#39;s always good to keep lens image stabilization in mind.</p><h3 data-section id="dont-be-afraid-to-use-a-tripod-and-flash"> 2. Don&#39;t be afraid to use a tripod <em>and</em> flash</h3><p> If you photograph portraits with a flash, the subject will turn out nice and bright – but the background will be unaffected (and will therefore remain dark).</p><p> So you have three options:</p><ol><li> You can embrace the black-background effect.</li><li> You can boost your ISO until the background looks decently bright.</li><li> You can mount your camera on a tripod, then capture a long exposure <em>with</em> a burst from your flash.</li></ol><p> A black background can look nice, especially if you&#39;re after a moodier image (see the example below).

I&#39;d also encourage you to grab a remote release, which will let you trigger your camera without pressing the shutter button.</p><p> Set up your image, then choose your exposure settings based on the background, <em>not</em> the subject. To prevent your subject from turning too bright, dial in a shutter speed that&#39;ll keep the background subtly underexposed. Note that your shutter speed should be reasonably long (generally 1/30s or below) in order to bring out detail in the background areas.</p><p> Finally, fire the shutter and the flash. The idea is that the flash will freeze your subject, while the lengthy shutter speed will give the camera enough time to record light from the background. You&#39;ll get a beautiful result, one with a detailed (if slightly underexposed) background: </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-129840 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-129840" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shooting-a-night-portrait-shutter-speed-01.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="night portrait photography" class="wp-image-129840" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shooting-a-night-portrait-shutter-speed-01.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shooting-a-night-portrait-shutter-speed-01.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shooting-a-night-portrait-shutter-speed-01.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shooting-a-night-portrait-shutter-speed-01.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shooting-a-night-portrait-shutter-speed-01.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This image looks just like the one displayed above – except that I used a longer exposure (1/30s) to bring out detail in the background.</figcaption></figure></div><p> If your first shots don&#39;t turn out great, that&#39;s okay!

Pay attention to the background</h3><p> When doing night portrait photography, it&#39;s easy to forget about the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-types-portrait-backgrounds-creative-images/" target="_blank" aria-label="background (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">background</a> . After all, it&#39;s often too dark to see, plus your subject is what&#39;s <em>really</em> important, right?</p><p> Not quite.</p><p> First of all, even in situations where you let the background fade to black, the final image will likely include <em>some</em> background elements, such as car lights, street lights, or lit-up signs.</p><p> And if you use the technique I shared in the previous tip, then the background <em>will</em> be clearly visible in the final photo, even if it&#39;s tough to see through your camera viewfinder.</p><p> In truth, the background is an essential part of every portrait photo, whether you shoot at night or in bright daylight. A good background emphasizes and complements the main subject, while a bad background distracts the viewer and prevents them from fully appreciating the subject. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shooting-a-portrait-at-night.jpg?ssl=1" alt="night portrait of a woman lit by street lamps" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> So if you want great shots, you&#39;ve got to get the background right.</p><p> When preparing for a photoshoot, I&#39;d recommend scouting around for potential backdrops. Search for lots of streetlights – which look stunning when combined with a wide aperture, as I discuss below – as well as simple walls that&#39;ll help your subject stand out.</p><p> And then, when you&#39;re out shooting, always pay careful attention to the area behind your subject. Make sure that it doesn&#39;t distract the viewer. And don&#39;t be afraid to test out different backgrounds by changing your camera angle! </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-129839 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-129839" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Night-portrait-bokeh-03.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Gorgeous night background night portrait photography" class="wp-image-129839" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Night-portrait-bokeh-03.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Night-portrait-bokeh-03.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Night-portrait-bokeh-03.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Night-portrait-bokeh-03.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Night-portrait-bokeh-03.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Here, I used a wide aperture to achieve a nice, bokeh-filled background. </figcaption></figure></div><h3 data-section id="seek-out-spots-of-light-for-exceptional-backgrounds"> 4. Seek out spots of light for exceptional backgrounds</h3><p> My previous night portraits tip was all about enhancing the background. This tip continues in the same vein – but with a focus on one of the most effective ways to create stunning backdrops that complement your subject.</p><p> You see, the night is filled with pockets of light that can bring magic to your portraits. Neon signs glowing in a distant alley, streetlights shimmering on a rain-soaked pavement, or festive decorations twinkling in a park – all these sources of artificial light can look amazing, especially when used to produce gorgeous bokeh.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255683" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-3.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Night photography portraits" class="wp-image-255683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-3.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-3.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-3.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-3.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Here&#39;s what you do: Position your subject so that pinpricks of light are visible in the background, and use a wide aperture to create a shallow depth of field effect. Focus on your subject, then watch as those distant points of light turn into beautiful, soft orbs.</p><p> (Pro tip: Focusing can be more challenging at night, so don&#39;t hesitate to use manual focus or a single-point AF mode to nail the shot.)</p><p> Work with angles and distances to find that perfect composition. Moving closer to your subject will generally increase the presence of the bokeh, while moving away from your subject will minimize it. Give yourself some room to experiment, too. The most obvious shot isn&#39;t always the best!</p><h3 data-section id="start-out-with-continuous-lighting"> 5. Start out with continuous lighting</h3><p> I know I&#39;ve talked a lot about using flash for beautiful night photos, but while flash <em>is</em> very versatile, portable, and powerful, it can be a difficult light source for beginners to handle. You can&#39;t see the effect of the flash until <em>after</em> an image is taken, which means that you&#39;ll spend a lot of time guessing, checking, and adjusting your lights. Plus, getting the exposure right when using flash can be a struggle; you&#39;ll often need to spend long minutes shifting the flash brightness up and down until you get a result you like.</p><p> Fortunately, there is another option: <a aria-label="Continuous lights (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/continuous-lights-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Continuous lights</a> . These will constantly light your subject and therefore allow you to monitor their effects in real-time.</p><p> You can grab portable continuous lights for a reasonable price, and while they aren&#39;t as powerful as flash, they work great for nighttime portraits. Plus, continuous lights often offer color temperature adjustments, which let you match the light color to surrounding light sources for a more natural effect.</p><p> Now, for the best results, you&#39;ll probably need to boost your ISO and/or widen your aperture. I&#39;d suggest setting your exposure based on the background, then ask your subject to step into the frame and make adjustments as required.</p><p> For the image below, I used an LED panel. It produced warm, soft light that looked <em>amazing</em> : </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/shooting-a-portrair-at-night-LED-panel-1.jpg?ssl=1" alt="night portrait photography" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Pro tip: If your continuous lights don&#39;t feature a brightness control, simply move the lights closer or farther from your subject!</p><h3 data-section id="try-shooting-in-black-and-white"> 6. Try shooting in black and white</h3><p> The colors of the night can indeed look stunning, but have you considered the emotive power of black and white? Stripping away color brings out the textures, contrasts, and shadows in a way that can create a moodier and even grittier effect.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255684" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Night photography portraits" class="wp-image-255684" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-4.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-4.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-4.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> High ISO settings – which are sometimes necessary for night portrait photography – often lead to noisy images. While this can be a drawback when shooting in color, noise tends to look much better in monochrome. It can add an appealing grain and texture, reminiscent of traditional film photography.</p><p> Bottom line: Exploring contrasts and shadows with a black-and-white palette can lead to dramatic and visually engaging results.</p><p> Also, I highly recommend working in RAW. That way, you&#39;ll have the flexibility to convert your image to black and white during post-processing, and you&#39;ll have plenty of latitude when testing out various monochrome effects so you can find the look that best suits your creative vision.</p><h3 data-section id="consider-styling-your-subject"> 7. Consider styling your subject</h3><p> When you&#39;re just starting out as a night portrait photographer, you&#39;ll likely photograph your subjects as they are.</p><p> However, as you become more experienced, you may want to get someone to do their hair and makeup.

Night images, in particular, look fantastic with color grading applied.</p><p> I encourage you to spend time experimenting with different colors in your favorite post-processing program. The most popular editors for color grading generally offer color wheels, so you can select your preferred hues with precision.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255685" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Night photography portraits" class="wp-image-255685" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-1.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> One classic combination that rarely fails is adding blue into the shadows and orange into the highlights; it creates a warm and cool contrast that can be visually stunning. Don&#39;t hesitate to try out different color combinations, though. The experimentation phase can lead to beautiful and unexpected results.</p><h3 data-section id="try-adding-props"> 9. Try adding props</h3><p> Props can add depth, context, and a spark of creativity to your night portraits. Selecting the right props is crucial, however, especially when working in low light.</p><p> Go with items that fit that moody nighttime vibe. Reflective objects or those that generate their own light can produce fascinating effects. Large glasses are especially popular in night portrait circles and can catch ambient light in intriguing ways.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255686" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:73.6%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1104" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-8.jpg?resize=1500%2C1104&#038;ssl=1" alt="Night photography portraits" class="wp-image-255686" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-8.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-8.jpg?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-8.jpg?resize=600%2C442&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-8.jpg?resize=768%2C565&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-8.jpg?resize=717%2C528&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Fairy lights are another fantastic option; you can have your subject hold them or drape them around your subject to add a soft glow to the image.</p><p> But make sure to balance your props with the overall theme and mood of the photograph. Avoid props that might feel out of place, like a sunflower, and focus on those that enhance the night ambiance. With the right choice of props and a bit of creativity, you can transform an ordinary night portrait into something truly memorable.</p><h3 data-section id="use-reflective-surfaces"> 10.

They provide intrigue and add another layer of creativity to your shots. If you can find and include some nice reflective elements in your composition, you can easily transform a good photograph into a great one.</p><p> You&#39;ll likely come across plenty of reflective surfaces photographing in urban areas. Windows of cars, shiny metallic railings, and even puddles of water on the street can work great. These reflections can feature neon signs or other colorful lights and produce mesmerizing effects in your night portraits.</p><p> Positioning your subject and your camera to maximize these reflections is essential. Experiment with different angles and surfaces; see if you can find a look that really complements the subject. Sometimes, a subtle reflection can add just the right touch of sophistication, but other times, a bold, mirrored image can make a powerful statement.</p><p> Also, the more creative you can get with your reflections, the better! Keep an eye out for those unexpected reflections that might showcase the glimmer of a streetlamp or the sparkle of traffic lights. And if you&#39;re not sure whether an idea might work, test it!</p><h3 data-section id="capture-beautiful-environmental-portraits"> 11.

But have you thought about environmental portraits? A single subject surrounded by the weight of darkness, illuminated by gentle light, can be <em>breathtaking</em> . In such a case, the extra space around the subject provides context, tells a story, and adds an extra layer of meaning to your image.</p><p> A wide-angle lens or even taking a few steps back can be all it takes to capture a more encompassing frame. Finding an area without a distracting background is key. Look for spaces that allow your subject to stand out, with minimal interference from unwanted elements.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255690" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-12.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Night photography portraits" class="wp-image-255690" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-12.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-12.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-12.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-12.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-12.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/night-portrait-photography-12.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Pro tip: Incorporating negative space in your composition can lead to a minimalistic yet powerful image.

Well, it can! Still life photography is all about transforming ordinary objects into visual art, and it comes with an array of powerful advantages:</p><ol><li> It&#39;s highly accessible (you can do it in your own home!)</li><li> It doesn&#39;t require ultra-expensive gear</li><li> It&#39;s not nearly as hard as it might seem</li></ol><p> I&#39;ve been taking still life images for years, and in this article, I offer everything you need to improve your shots. I cover all the key elements including lighting, composition, and editing – so that, no matter your level of experience, you&#39;ll be ready to shoot some amazing still life photos of your own.</p><p>让我们开始吧。</p><h2 data-section id="what-is-still-life-photography"> What is still life photography?</h2><p> Still life photography is an art form that involves capturing inanimate objects. This can include anything from a bowl of fruit to a carefully arranged collection of antique tools.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255642" style="width:428px"><span class="space" style="width:428px; padding-top:140.19%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="428" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-9.jpg?resize=428%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="静物摄影" class="wp-image-255642" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-9.jpg?resize=428%2C600&amp;ssl=1 428w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-9.jpg?resize=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1 214w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-9.jpg?resize=768%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-9.jpg?resize=717%2C1004&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-9.jpg?w=1071&amp;ssl=1 1071w" sizes="(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The appeal of still life photography lies in its accessibility and its potential for immense creativity. With complete control over all elements, from lighting to composition, you can turn ordinary objects into something extraordinary.</p><p> Seeing everyday objects through an artistic eye is the essence of still life photography. It&#39;s about finding beauty in the mundane and ordinary. Whether you&#39;re a professional photographer or just starting, still life photography invites you to see the world anew, and it&#39;s a wonderful way to explore your creativity!</p><h2 data-section id="essential-still-life-photography-gear"> Essential still life photography gear</h2><p> You don&#39;t need to spend a fortune to get started with still life photography. An entry-level mirrorless camera or DSLR will work just fine. These camera types provide more control and flexibility compared to simple point-and-shoot models. Paired with a <a aria-label="close-focusing lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lenses-for-macro-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">close-focusing lens</a> , they allow you to capture sharp images of your subjects that you can edit, print, and hang on your wall.</p><p> A tripod is another important item, and while not every still life photographer works exclusively with a tripod, it&#39;s a great piece of equipment to obtain. Even a slight camera movement can change the focus and composition, so a tripod will help streamline your workflow. More importantly, it&#39;ll keep your camera steady, which is crucial for achieving clear, sharp images in low light conditions.</p><p> Other useful accessories include reflectors to reduce shadows and diffusers to handle too-harsh lighting.</p><p> That said, you don&#39;t need to go gear-crazy; the key is to understand that quality images don&#39;t necessarily come from expensive gear. With the right basic tools, beautiful still life images are entirely within your reach.</p><h2 data-section id="key-still-life-photography-settings"> Key still life photography settings</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255643" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-5.jpg?resize=1500%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="静物摄影" class="wp-image-255643" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-5.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-5.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-5.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-5.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-5.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-5.jpg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-5.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> is where you want to begin in still life photography. Working in this mode gives you ultimate control over your image, allowing you to fine-tune the aperture, ISO, and shutter speed. With control over these settings, your creativity can truly shine.</p><p> A narrow aperture such as f/8 is a standard choice for still life photography. It keeps the subject in focus, giving you the crisp details that&#39;ll make your still life images stand out. As for the ISO: Keep it low to maintain the best image quality. As long as you&#39;re using a tripod, shutter speed is less critical; you can slow it down without causing blur.</p><p> Understanding these settings is essential to achieving professional-looking photos. While dialing in apertures, ISOs, and shutter speeds may seem technical at first, you&#39;ll find that it quickly becomes second nature!</p><h2 data-section id="basic-lighting-for-still-life-photography"> Basic lighting for still life photography</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255644" style="width:457px"><span class="space" style="width:457px; padding-top:131.29%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="457" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-8.jpg?resize=457%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="静物摄影" class="wp-image-255644" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-8.jpg?resize=457%2C600&amp;ssl=1 457w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-8.jpg?resize=229%2C300&amp;ssl=1 229w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-8.jpg?resize=768%2C1008&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-8.jpg?resize=717%2C941&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-8.jpg?w=1143&amp;ssl=1 1143w" sizes="(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-still-life-lighting-tips-for-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Light is an essential component of still life photography</a> , and many still lifes feature beautiful lighting arrangements (which often create moody, painterly effects).</p><p> But it&#39;s important to realize that <em>you don&#39;t need fancy lighting to create a stunning still life</em> . When you&#39;re starting out, I recommend using whatever light you have available, such as:</p><ul><li> Indirect light from a window</li><li> A lamp</li><li> A flashlight</li><li> A candle</li></ul><p> Don&#39;t just create your setup, take one shot, and call it a day. Instead, try out different lighting effects! Use a curtain to block out some window light, then remove the curtain to let the light stream in. Shine a flashlight at your main subject, then try a second shot where the flashlight is positioned off to the side and shrouds your subjects in shadow.合理？</p><p> Note that, if you&#39;re using lamps, flashlights, or candles, you will definitely need a tripod; indoor lighting won&#39;t get you a fast-enough shutter speed for handheld shots. (This can be a relatively cheap model; as long as it&#39;s positioned on a sturdy surface, it should be able to keep your camera steady.) When you&#39;re ready to shoot, just mount your camera to the tripod, activate the <a aria-label="two-second self-timer (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/remote-shutter-vs-delayed-shutter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">two-second self-timer</a> , and start taking images.</p><h2 data-section id="still-life-photography-composition"> Still life photography composition</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255645" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-11.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="静物摄影" class="wp-image-255645" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-11.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-11.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-11.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-11.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/still-life-photography-11.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Learning to <a aria-label="compose still life photos (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/apply-compositional-theory-to-still-life-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">compose still life photos</a> is often a struggle for beginners. This is understandable, as still life composition brings up a <em>ton</em> of questions, such as: Where should I place all my items? Should they overlap? Should they be close to the background? What camera angle should I use?</p><p> Fortunately, still life composition isn&#39;t as hard as it might seem. I have two main recommendations, and they will take you far:</p><p> First, if you&#39;ve not encountered them before, read about the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/" target="_blank" aria-label="rule of thirds (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">rule of thirds</a> and the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/the-rule-of-odds-in-photography-an-easy-trick-for-better-compositions/" target="_blank" aria-label="rule of odds (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">rule of odds</a> . These will offer a fantastic compositional starting point for beautiful still life shots, plus they&#39;re really easy to use.</p><p> Second, just keep moving your items around.</p><p> This latter recommendation might seem a bit silly, but I promise: If you rearrange your objects enough, you&#39;ll eventually hit on an arrangement that looks great. Don&#39;t just settle for the first composition that you try – instead, test an arrangement, then evaluate it critically. Determine what you like and dislike about it, then make adjustments.</p><p> As you create different compositions, here are a few items to keep an eye on:</p><ul><li> Overly empty gaps (you generally want to keep the entire arrangement balanced!)</li><li> Busy areas (you don&#39;t want to confuse the viewer with <em>too</em> much activity)</li><li> Movement between objects (aim to lead the eye from one object to the next)</li></ul><p> Remember: A tiny tweak can make a <em>huge</em> difference. So if an arrangement doesn&#39;t seem perfect, make a few changes. Chances are that you&#39;ll soon hit upon a better setup!</p><h2 data-section id="tips-and-tricks-to-improve-your-still-life-photos"> Tips and tricks to improve your still life photos</h2><p> Now that you&#39;re familiar with the basics, let&#39;s dive into some of the higher-level aspects of still life photography, including subject selection, different lighting directions, and more!</p><h3 data-section id="look-at-the-work-of-great-still-life-photographers"> 1.

By observing their photos, you can learn about the different ways to arrange elements, and you can even find inspiration for new subjects.</p><p> But don&#39;t limit yourself to photography alone; look at the world of painting as well. Masters like Cezanne offer a treasure trove of lessons on composition, balance, and the use of color. The way these painters arranged objects, used light, and chose colors can translate into unique insights for your photography.

By ensuring that your light source is hitting the subject from the side rather than the front or back, you add shadows that improve a sense of three-dimensionality. The play of light and shadow brings depth and drama to an image, allowing ordinary objects to appear extraordinary.</p><p> A 45-degree angle is often a fantastic starting point for sidelighting. It offers a balanced blend of light and shadow, producing a visually appealing effect. Don&#39;t be afraid to play with different angles and light sources; experimentation is key to finding what works best for your particular setup.</p><p> Realize that the angle of light can drastically change the mood and appearance of your photograph. By embracing the experimentation and understanding how sidelighting works, you add an essential tool to your still life photography toolkit. It&#39;s a step towards creating more engaging, eye-catching images.</p><p> Bottom line: Whether you&#39;re using natural light from a window or an artificial source, sidelighting can become your go-to option for stunning still life shots.</p><h3 id="1-pick-items-that-interest-you"> 3.

But in truth, there are no “best” still life subjects, so there&#39;s no need to stress! Ideal subjects are simply items that interest <em>you</em> , and they can come from anywhere, including:</p><ul><li> Around your house</li><li> Flea markets and thrift stores</li><li> Estate sales</li><li> The grocery store</li><li> The florist</li></ul><p> Of course, the words “still life” generally conjure up visions of vases of flowers, pears on candlelit tables, old paper, and violins. And you can certainly capture beautiful still life shots by obtaining and arranging these “classical” items.</p><p> But you don&#39;t <em>need</em> to spend time pursuing such images if they don&#39;t interest you. Instead, ask yourself: What is meaningful to <em>me</em> ? What objects do I love? Is there a story I would like to tell with my still life?</p><p> Alternatively, you might look for items that simply catch your eye. This next shot contains a piece of dried seaweed on some calico. Was the seaweed meaningful to me? Not really. Did it tell a story? Nope. It simply looked beautiful, so I wanted to capture it! </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-93849 size-post-large-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-93849" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:62.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="467" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-thing2W.jpg?resize=750%2C467&#038;ssl=1" alt="Still life photography piece of curling seaweed" class="wp-image-93849" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-thing2W.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-thing2W.jpg?resize=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-thing2W.jpg?resize=600%2C374&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-thing2W.jpg?resize=717%2C446&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Finally, you can capture “found” still life arrangements – that is, still life arrangements that already exist (in houses, backyards, or on the street).

Then I highly recommend working around a single theme.</p><p> Themes are an essential aspect of still life photography that can add depth and coherence to your images. They help you move beyond randomly selected objects and push you to think about the mood and meaning you want to convey. Whether it&#39;s a color, season, or concept, a unifying theme can drive creativity.</p><p> For example, if you choose a theme around the color blue, you may gather items like blue glassware, a blue scarf, or blueberries. The consistent color palette not only creates visual harmony but also allows you to explore various textures and shapes within a specific color family.</p><p> Themes also help in storytelling. A setup focused on a seasonal theme, like autumn, can evoke feelings of warmth, change, or nostalgia. From leaves to pumpkins, selecting objects that resonate with the chosen theme helps in creating visually compelling stories that speak to the viewer.</p><h3 id="2-carefully-select-a-background"> 5.

If you want great results, you <em>must</em> choose your background with great care.</p><p> Specifically, <em>don&#39;t</em> choose a background that features distracting elements. Avoid eye-catching colors that draw the eye, and if you use fabric, make sure you iron it first (few things are more distracting than a wrinkled backdrop!).</p><p> Instead, keep it simple.

Different background textures and colors can complement your subjects in different ways, so it pays to test out a few options before deciding on a final arrangement.

Studio strobes, speedlights, or continuous LEDs are common options, and each has its advantages.</p><p> For those just starting, speedlights can be an affordable choice. They are portable and easy to use but still deliver excellent results. Strobes, on the other hand, are more powerful and include modeling lights so you can see the lighting effect in advance.</p><p> Whatever your choice, softboxes are essential. A bare flash will result in harsh and unflattering light. Softboxes diffuse the light, making it softer and more pleasing to the eye. They come in various sizes and shapes, allowing you to fine-tune the lighting effect to match your vision.</p><p> Artificial lighting may seem intimidating at first, but with practice, you can use it to create stunning still life photographs. From generating specific effects to offering complete control over the intensity and direction of light, artificial lighting opens up a new realm of creativity. It&#39;s an investment not just in equipment but in expanding your artistic capabilities.</p><h3 id="4-try-plenty-of-compositions"> 8.

While it&#39;s common to start with a standard frontal composition, experimenting with different angles adds richness and variety to your portfolio.</p><p> Moving to the right or the left, shooting from above or below – these choices offer new perspectives on familiar subjects. Even slight adjustments in camera height can change how a setup is captured. Higher angles can amplify depth, making objects appear more spread out, while lower angles can give a greater sense of intimacy or grandiosity.</p><p> Experimentation is key here. There are no rigid rules, so feel free to explore various angles until you find what resonates with your subject and theme. Try photographing a bowl of fruit from directly above to emphasize shape and pattern, or shoot a vase of flowers from below to give it a towering, majestic appearance. The creativity of angles is in your hands.</p><h3 id="5-make-sure-you-spend-time-editing-your-still-life-photography"> 9.

Full-frame models often offer superior image quality, but APS-C or Micro Four Thirds models can be great too. If you&#39;re hiking to different locations, a more compact, mirrorless camera might be a good fit. It&#39;s lighter, and the <a aria-label="electronic viewfinder (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/electronic-viewfinders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">electronic viewfinder</a> allows you to “see” in black and white, providing a preview of the final result.</p><p> Note that most <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-camera-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="cameras that work well for standard landscape photography (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">cameras that work well for standard landscape photography</a> <em>also</em> work great for B&amp;W images, so if you already shoot landscapes in color, you probably don&#39;t need to buy another camera!</p><p> Your choice of lens is equally important. You want <a aria-label="landscape photography lenses (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lens-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">landscape photography lenses</a> that cover a range of focal lengths, such as wide-angle for sweeping scenics and telephoto for capturing tighter details. A <a aria-label="sturdy landscape tripod (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-tripods-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">sturdy landscape tripod</a> is another essential piece of equipment, especially if you&#39;re shooting long exposures or in low-light conditions where stability is key.</p><p> Finally, investing in a <a aria-label="good neutral density filter (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-nd-filters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">good neutral density filter</a> (see Tip #8!) can also come in handy. It lets you control the amount of light entering the lens, providing creative control over exposure times.</p><p> By putting together this gear, you&#39;ll be able to craft beautiful black and white landscape images with the tools that help you realize your vision. Remember, it&#39;s not about having the most expensive equipment but understanding how to use what you have to its fullest potential.</p><h2 data-section id="pick-the-perfect-black-and-white-landscape-settings"> 2.

The first thing you want to do is switch your camera to <a aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> . It gives you full control over every aspect of the image. Don&#39;t worry; it&#39;s easier than it sounds!</p><p> A narrow <a aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> , like f/8 or beyond, ensures that everything from the foreground to the background remains sharp. This is vital if you want to capture all the details in your scene.</p><p> Keeping the <a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> as low as possible is also crucial. Higher ISO levels can cause noise in your images. With a low ISO, your shots will retain plenty of detail and appear crisp and clear.</p><p> Your <a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> is another important setting to consider. This can vary depending on the effect you want to achieve. If you wish to create an ultra-long exposure effect (like a silky water effect in a river or waterfall), you may need to add a neutral density filter. This filter allows you to extend the shutter speed without overexposing the image.</p><p> <a aria-label="Focusing manually (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dont-afraid-manual-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Focusing manually</a> might sound intimidating, but it can offer more precision. Autofocus might not always pick the exact spot you want to be sharp. By setting the focus point yourself – generally at the <a aria-label="hyperfocal distance (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-find-and-use-hyperfocal-distance-for-sharp-backgrounds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">hyperfocal distance</a> , around a third of the way into the scene – you can ensure that the entire shot is crisp.</p><p> Finally, don&#39;t be afraid to experiment. Play with different settings to see what works best for your specific scene. Every landscape is unique, and the more you practice, the more intuitive these settings will become.</p><h2 data-section id="work-with-the-weather"> 3.

Unlike color photography, where sunlight might offer golden hues, black and white photography is more about contrast, texture, and form.</p><p> Clouds, for instance, can be a photographer&#39;s best friend. Textured clouds swirling in the sky can make a dramatic background for landscapes. They provide a natural contrast that enhances the richness of the scene.</p><p> Clear skies and pure white skies, on the other hand, offer a different kind of opportunity. These conditions are better for shots that include a lot of <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/negative-space-in-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="negative space (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">negative space</a> . A clear sky might seem empty and dull in color photography, but in black and white, it can create a powerful, minimalistic image. An overcast sky can provide a soft and even light that reduces harsh shadows, giving you a different aesthetic to play with.</p><p> But how do you know what the weather will be like? Planning is key. Utilize weather tracking apps or websites that provide forecasts tailored for photographers.

In fact, to capture good <a aria-label="color landscape photos (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/colorful-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">color landscape photos</a> , you often need to just find a dramatic scene and <a aria-label="photograph it in beautiful light (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/landscape-photography-about-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">photograph it in beautiful light</a> . (That&#39;s why so many color landscape shots are taken during the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-photograph-golden-hour/" target="_blank" aria-label="golden hour (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">golden hour</a> or just after sunset.)</p><p> But black and white landscape photography is very, <em>very</em> different. Without color, you can&#39;t rely on pure color and light; you have to captivate the viewer by creating strong compositions. Yes, light matters, but composition matters, too. And unless you can really master this technical skill, you&#39;ll struggle to produce compelling images.</p><p> In other words, instead of just chasing great light, you need to learn to look for the building blocks of photographic composition: leading lines, shapes, patterns, tonal contrast, and texture. When you approach a scene, try to ignore interesting colors. Do what you can to <em>see</em> in black and white so that you quickly recognize eye-catching geometry, impressive textures, and more.</p><p> For example, this photo works well in black and white because of the tonal contrast between the twin waterfalls and the dark rocks, not to mention the balanced geometry (two twin rectangles of light on an all-black background):</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-113203" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:80%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-1.jpg?resize=750%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="black and white landscape waterfall" class="wp-image-113203" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-1.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-1.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-1.jpg?resize=600%2C480&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-1.jpg?resize=717%2C574&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Yet the average viewer (or average color photographer) probably wouldn&#39;t notice these features at first glance. Instead, they&#39;d focus on the hues of the pool or the rich green leaves just outside the frame. And until you learn to see in black and white, you probably would, too!</p><h2 data-section id="study-the-work-of-famous-black-and-white-landscape-photographers"> 5. Study the work of famous black and white landscape photographers</h2><p> We don&#39;t naturally see the world in black and white. Therefore, learning to work in monochrome takes some practice. It&#39;s almost like learning a new language; you have to spend time really recognizing what works in B&amp;W photos and what doesn&#39;t (which is often very <em>different</em> from what works in color landscapes).</p><p> Now, you can figure out how to make a great black and white landscape through a lot of trial and error, but why reinvent the wheel? Instead, deepen your understanding of B&amp;W landscape images by looking at the work of masters – the folks who already spent dozens of years perfecting their compositions, lighting, settings, and techniques.</p><p> I recommend starting with <a aria-label="Ansel Adams (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/quotes-from-master-photographer-ansel-adams-and-how-you-to-apply-them-to-your-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Ansel Adams</a> and <a aria-label="Edward Weston (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/lessons-masters-of-photography-edward-weston/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Edward Weston</a> , who shot predominantly in black and white and whose work is closely aligned with contemporary landscape aesthetics. You might also check out Harry Callahan (if you&#39;re interested in more intimate landscape shots) as well as Wynn Bullock (who captured wonderfully atmospheric photos).</p><p> Also, look at what modern-day photographers are doing on <a aria-label="Instagram (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.instagram.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">Instagram</a> and <a aria-label="500px (opens in a new tab)" href="https://500px.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">500px</a> . Some names to search for include Cole Thompson, Rob Dweck, Arnaud Bertrande, Thibault Roland, Joel Tjintjelaar, and Nathan Wirth.</p><p> When you look at the work of B&amp;W landscape shooters, ask yourself: What makes their black and white landscape photos so powerful? What light do they use? What photographic techniques (eg, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/step-by-step-guide-to-long-exposure-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="long exposure (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">long exposure</a> ) do they employ? How do they approach composition?</p><p> The answers will teach you a lot about black and white photography and will help you understand which elements and scenes really lend themselves to a monochrome treatment.</p><h2 data-section id="look-for-tonal-contrast-and-texture"> 6.

Take the photo below as an example; the jetties are dark and the sky is much lighter. <em>That</em> is tonal contrast. <em>And it looks amazing in black and white</em> .</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-113204" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-2.jpg?resize=750%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="lighthouses out at sea in black and white" class="wp-image-113204" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-2.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-2.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-2.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-2.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-2.jpg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-2.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The alternative – low tonal contrast scenes, where the entire shot is covered with, say, midtones – tends to look very mushy and flat. Tones don&#39;t separate out, key elements fade into one another, and the composition loses impact. While color photographers may pursue scenes without tonal contrast, they can rely on changes in color to differentiate key elements. In black and white, however, that&#39;s not an option, and it becomes all about the tones.</p><p> <a aria-label="Texture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-texture-to-improve-your-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Texture</a> (and contrast <em>between</em> textures) looks great, too. If you think about the elements that often appear in B&amp;W landscape photos – cliffs, rocks, grass, trees, mountains, and oceans, along with human-made objects like piers, jetties, and old barns – you&#39;ll notice that they all have distinct textures. Some feature rough, heavy surfaces, while others are intensely smooth.</p><p> In the photo below, the arch, the cliffs in the distance, and the rocks in the foreground are all heavily textured. The sea and the sky are much smoother. There is a strong contrast between the roughness of the rocks and the smoothness of the sea and the sky. And thanks to that textural contrast, the photo is much more impactful!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-113205" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:56.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="423" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-3.jpg?resize=750%2C423&#038;ssl=1" alt="long exposure rock at sea" class="wp-image-113205" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-3.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-3.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-3.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-3.jpg?resize=717%2C404&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="shoot-in-monochrome-mode"> 7.

This makes it easier to imagine how scenes will turn out in black and white if you&#39;re not shooting in monochrome mode (or if you don&#39;t have your camera to your eye).</p><p> Personally, I think that black and white electronic viewfinders are an absolute game-changer. If you&#39;re serious about B&amp;W landscape photography, it&#39;s probably worth switching to a mirrorless camera for that feature alone!

Grab one (or more) of these accessories, and you&#39;ll be able to capture jaw-dropping images beyond your wildest dreams.</p><p> (Am I exaggerating? Honestly, I don&#39;t think so. Neutral density filters are a <em>huge</em> deal.)</p><p> But what makes ND filters so special?</p><p> ND filters are basically dark pieces of glass that go in front of your lens and prevent light from hitting your camera sensor. In other words, ND filters <em>block out the light</em> , which lets you lengthen your shutter speed while retaining a balanced exposure.</p><p> You see, as a landscape photographer without an ND filter, you&#39;ll often be using a <a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> between 1/2s and 1/125s (assuming you&#39;re shooting with a relatively narrow <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> of f/13 or so, which is generally a good idea).</p><p> At times, you may want to lengthen your shutter speed for creative effect – so that you can blur water, stretch clouds, and create a beautiful ethereal look in your photos. But in most situations, dropping the shutter speed beyond 1/2s or so just can&#39;t be done. The light is too strong; if you try it, you&#39;ll end up with an overexposed image.</p><p> Unless you have an item that can block out the light – such as a neutral density filter! The ND filter will keep your camera from overexposing the scene even when you&#39;re dealing with lots of light. That way, you can push out your shutter speed to 5s, 10s, and more, and you can get the stretchy clouds and blurry water that you&#39;re after.</p><p> Check out the photos below. The first was taken at dusk with a shutter speed of 1/5s. This exposure time was slow enough to introduce some blur into the water (look at the foreground wave), but it wasn&#39;t slow enough to really flatten out the water while making the clouds turn into interesting streaks.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-113207" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:56.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="423" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?resize=750%2C423&#038;ssl=1" alt="relatively short seaside rock exposure" class="wp-image-113207" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?resize=717%2C404&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> But I added a neutral density filter and made the next photo using a shutter speed of 180 seconds.

Don&#39;t just take photos like everyone else</h2><p> Black and white landscape photographer Cole Thompson has an interesting idea. He practices what he calls “photographic abstinence,” where he doesn&#39;t look at the work of other photographers before heading to a new location. The idea is that it enables him to see the landscape through his own eyes without being influenced by other people&#39;s photos of the same elements.</p><p> I&#39;ve never taken this idea to its extreme. I believe it&#39;s important to research an area before you go; that way, you can find its most photogenic parts and avoid boring areas. But this does lead to a problem: The most powerful images you see tend to stick in your mind. The natural tendency is to want to create similar images – so if you spend time researching locations, you&#39;ll often end up capturing photos that look like everybody else&#39;s.</p><p> I encourage you to push back against this tendency! Recognize that certain subjects are photographed in particular ways. Use that knowledge to capture images that are different – images that are truly <em>you</em> .</p><p> Let me give you an example. A few years ago, I visited the Playa de las Catedrales (Cathedral Beach) in northern Spain. Search for it on Google or 500px, and most photos will look something like this, showing the cathedral-like arches for which the beach is named:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-113209" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=750%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="arches in black and white" class="wp-image-113209" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Anybody who visits the beach will naturally want to take photos of the arches. They&#39;re the reason the spot is famous, after all. But if you only focus on the arches, you&#39;ll miss other (equally compelling!) possibilities.</p><p> So after traveling to Cathedral Beach and getting my rock arch photos, I really started <em>looking</em> . I saw some rocks in the sea that made an interesting minimalistic composition, and I captured the following photo:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-113210" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:40.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="304" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-8.jpg?resize=750%2C304&#038;ssl=1" alt="long exposure rocks in water" class="wp-image-113210" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-8.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-8.jpg?resize=300%2C122&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-8.jpg?resize=600%2C243&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-8.jpg?resize=717%2C291&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> It doesn&#39;t feature famous arches.

The files don&#39;t include any color information, which means that images can become pretty confusing. Various subjects blend into one another, and the viewer may struggle to understand the scene.</p><p> Now, one way to deal with this tendency is to include plenty of tonal contrast. It&#39;s a good technique, and I highly recommend it. But if you want to <em>really</em> elevate your B&amp;W photos, you should also aim to cut down on extraneous elements in your compositions. That way, the viewer will know exactly where to focus – and they&#39;ll be able to instantly interpret the shot.</p><p> So before capturing a new image, ask yourself: Does the frame include any elements that might distract the viewer? Is the viewer able to clearly identify the main subject? Make sure that every part of the scene contributes to the composition.</p><p> If you come upon a scene that seems a bit cluttered, don&#39;t walk away. Instead, take steps to <em>simplify</em> . Get in closer, use a longer lens, or adjust your angle so that you highlight certain objects and block out others.合理？</p><h2 data-section id="dont-forget-about-the-light"> 11.

And it&#39;s true: Composition makes a huge difference.</p><p> But make sure you don&#39;t fixate so heavily on composition that you forget about other key photographic elements – such as lighting.</p><p> Color landscape photographers love shooting during the golden hours, and this soft-yet-direct light also looks great in black and white. The low sun will create long shadows, which you can use as powerful composition elements (eg, <a aria-label="leading lines (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-leading-lines-for-better-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">leading lines</a> ).</p><p> But as a black and white shooter, you can head out at other times and capture equally compelling images. For instance, overcast days produce soft, intimate light that reveals detail in forest and mountain scenes. And even harsh midday sun – which is hated by most color landscape photographers – can make for interesting black and white shots. The trick is to use the contrasty light to your advantage; let it create shadow geometry, then incorporate the shadows into your compositions.</p><p> <a aria-label="Blue hour (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-quick-tips-for-better-blue-hour-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Blue hour</a> is another great time to shoot black and white landscapes. The light is wonderfully soft, and if you can find a moving subject (eg, ocean waves), you&#39;ll be able to capture ethereal long exposures that look <em>outstanding</em> .</p><h2 data-section id="capture-intimate-landscape-shots"> 12.

Sometimes, the beauty lies in the details, textures, or geometry found within the scene. These intimate landscape shots can tell a different, more personal story.</p><p> Switching from a wide-angle lens to a <a aria-label="telephoto lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tips-shooting-landscapes-telephoto-lens-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">telephoto lens</a> can transform your perspective. It allows you to zoom in on specific elements, such as a lone tree, a winding path, or the intricate pattern of leaves and rocks. The compression effect of a telephoto lens can also create a unique visual relationship between the foreground and background.</p><p> Intimate shots are all about observation and imagination. Look for textures, shapes, and patterns that draw your eye. Experiment with different angles and framing to find the <a aria-label="perfect landscape composition (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/4-rules-of-composition-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">perfect landscape composition</a> . Sometimes, the most compelling images come from the most ordinary subjects, like delicate lines in the sand or the graceful curve of a branch.</p><p> Don&#39;t be afraid to get close and personal with nature. Part of the beauty of black and white photography lies in its ability to reveal the hidden artistry of the landscape.</p><h2 data-section id="travel-when-you-can"> 13.

Photographing in RAW is a wise choice, as it gives you more control and flexibility when editing. Don&#39;t just press the “Convert to Black and White” button; explore various conversion options to see what best fits your vision.</p><p> When converting to black and white, try adjusting individual color channels. This allows you to emphasize or de-emphasize different parts of the image, helping you create a visually engaging photograph. Play with the highlights and shadows, add contrast, tweak clarity, and even apply a vignette to guide the viewer&#39;s eye toward your main subject.</p><p> Editing software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop offers several good black and white conversion methods. Don&#39;t hesitate to experiment and find what works best for your particular shot. Spend time on this. The conversion from color to black and white isn&#39;t just a technical step; it&#39;s an artistic one. This is where your creativity shines, and it&#39;s how you can transform a good photo into a masterpiece.</p><h2 data-section id="black-and-white-landscape-photography-final-words"> Black and white landscape photography: final words</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255630" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/black-and-white-landscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Black and white landscape photography" class="wp-image-255630" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/black-and-white-landscape-photography-202.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/black-and-white-landscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/black-and-white-landscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/black-and-white-landscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/black-and-white-landscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/black-and-white-landscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Black and white landscape photography is an exciting and rewarding pursuit.

First came the <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.tamron-usa.com/news/2023/35150_zmount_develop_jul.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">35-150mm f/2-2.8 Di III VXD (for Nikon Z-mount)</a> , followed by the <a aria-label="upgraded version of the existing 70-180mm f/2.8 Di III VC VXD (for Sony E-mount) (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.tamron-usa.com/news/2023/70180_secondgen_dev_aug.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">upgraded version of the existing 70-180mm f/2.8 Di III VC VXD (for Sony E-mount)</a> .</p><p> While Tamron is primarily known for developing enthusiast lenses that combine excellent optics, compact designs, and reasonable prices, the two just-announced lenses will likely occupy a position in the upper echelons of the company&#39;s lens lineup – assuming earlier versions of the products are indicative of what&#39;s to come.</p><h2 data-section id="the-tamron-mm-f-di-iii-vxd-for-nikon-z-mount"> The Tamron 35-150mm f/2-2.8 Di III VXD for Nikon Z-mount</h2><p> The original <a href="https://geni.us/Tamron35-150dPS" target="_blank" aria-label="Tamron 35-150mm f/2-2.8 (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Tamron 35-150mm f/2-2.8</a> was released back in 2021 for Sony E-mount, and the new product, this time compatible with Nikon&#39;s entire array of <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/use-mirrorless-in-2020/" target="_blank" aria-label="mirrorless cameras (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">mirrorless cameras</a> , appears to match its specifications. Like the E-mount version, the new lens promises outstanding optics, not to mention an incredible focal-length range that&#39;ll instantly take you from a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/7-ways-to-get-more-out-of-a-wide-angle-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="wide-angle view (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">wide-angle view</a> all the way into a tight <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-tips-for-great-telephoto-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="telephoto crop (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">telephoto crop</a> .</p><p> As the Sony version proved, the lens will be useful for a host of photographers. It should be popular among serious portrait snappers (who can use the lens to capture a wide variety of portrait types within a single session), travel photographers (to shoot landscapes, travel portraits, and everything in between), and professional event photographers (who can use the lens to alternate between scene-setting photos and tighter compositions).</p><p> The maximum <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> , which goes all the way to f/2 on the wide end, should appeal to a couple of types of photographers, including shooters who often work indoors and at night as well as portraitists seeking that <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" aria-label="beautiful background bokeh (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">beautiful background bokeh</a> .</p><p> Of course, a do-everything lens like this one does come with drawbacks. The 35-150mm is large, heavy, and expensive. While the MSRP for the Nikon version hasn&#39;t been revealed yet, the Sony version comes with an $1899 price tag.</p><p> As a result, the lens likely won&#39;t see much use from beginners as well as certain minimalistic travel shooters. For others, however, the heft and cost are the sacrifices you make if you want to work with one of the most versatile and effective lenses on the market. Therefore, I recommend Nikon pros and semi-pros take a good look at this lens – especially if you frequently work in low-light scenarios.</p><h2 data-section id="the-tamron-mm-f-di-iii-vc-vxd-g"> The Tamron 70-180mm f/2.8 Di III VC VXD G2</h2><p> Tamron&#39;s more recent announcement, the 70-180mm f/2.8 G2, is arguably even more exciting. It&#39;s not an existing lens with a converted mount but instead comes as the upgraded version of the <a href="https://geni.us/NA1FCD" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">first-generation 70-180mm f/2.8 Di III VC VXD</a> , an E-mount lens that hit the shelves back in 2020.</p><p> The new version of the 70-180mm looks to perfect its predecessor&#39;s <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/gear-review-tamron-70-180mm-f-2-8-for-sony/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">already excellent feature set</a> . Like the original, you can expect outstanding low-light performance thanks to the f/2.8 maximum aperture, an impressively compact design, and a focal-length range that&#39;s already much-loved by landscape photographers, portrait photographers, event photographers, and more.</p><p> Note that the old 70-180mm f/2.8 is only 20mm shorter than the standard 70-200mm f/2.8 lenses offered by Sony. Yet it&#39;s far more compact, making it ideal for travel photography and general walkaround shooting. It&#39;s also available for a much cheaper $1099; as a result, it appeals to serious hobbyists as well as professionals. The upgraded version may cost more, but I doubt the price will rise significantly.</p><p> In addition to the features mentioned above, what will the new lens offer? For one, the 70-180mm will now include image stabilization technology – Tamron calls this “VC,” or “Vibration Compensation” – which should dramatically improve sharpness when handholding at slow shutter speeds. This will be invaluable for wedding and event photographers working in low light and should also come in handy for landscape and wildlife snappers who prefer to capture tighter images without a tripod.</p><p> The lens will boast upgraded autofocus capabilities to ensure even greater speed and accuracy when photographing moving subjects, such as sports and birds in flight; it also sports a “revamped optical design” that “delivers truly superb performance at all focal lengths.” Considering that the original optic lens&#39;s optics were well-received by professionals and critics, this should only serve to improve the lens further.</p><h2 data-section id="tamron-zoom-lens-announcements-final-words"> Tamron zoom lens announcements: final words</h2><p> While we don&#39;t yet know when the new lenses will debut – Tamron&#39;s official press releases only state “Fall 2023” – you shouldn&#39;t have long to wait, and if you&#39;re a Nikon Z-mount or Sony E-mount shooter seeking a highly versatile zoom, these are lenses you don&#39;t want to miss.
