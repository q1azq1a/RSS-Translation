Below, I share all the essential details for anyone hoping to become a silhouette master, including:</p><ul><li> How to choose the right subject and location</li><li> How to handle different lighting scenarios</li><li> How to choose the best settings</li><li> Creative silhouette photography ideas to get you inspired</li><li> Much more!</li></ul><p> So if you&#39;re ready to discover everything you ever wanted to know about photographing silhouettes, let&#39;s dive right in! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-is-silhouette-photography"> What is silhouette photography?</h2><p> Silhouette photography is all about capturing subjects so that they lack detail. The focus is on creating striking black shapes against a beautifully exposed background. It&#39;s a technique that emphasizes the shape and form of the subject, resulting in minimalistic and graphic effects:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253364" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-107.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Silhouette photography" class="wp-image-253364" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-107.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-107.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-107.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-107.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-107.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-107.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Silhouettes also allow you to showcase the vibrant colors of the sky behind your subject, adding an extra level of visual impact. Imagine capturing a stunning sunset or sunrise with the silhouette of a tree or a person standing tall against the vivid hues of the sky.</p><p> The best part? Silhouette photography is accessible to everyone, regardless of the equipment you own. Whether you&#39;re shooting with a high-end mirrorless model or a smartphone, you can try your hand at capturing these compelling shots, making it an ideal creative outlet for photographers of all levels! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="when-should-you-try-silhouette-photography"> When should you try silhouette photography?</h2><p> If you&#39;re looking to add some pizzazz to your portfolio or spice up your social media feed, silhouette photography is the way to go. These graphic, eye-catching shots can truly make your work stand out.</p><p> I talk a lot about light later on in this article, but in general, sunrise and sunset are like magic hours for silhouette photography. The soft, warm light during these times creates the perfect backdrop for your subjects to take center stage as striking silhouettes.

Silhouettes tend to lean towards the artsy side, so if you&#39;re doing more formal photography (eg, a real-estate photoshoot), you might want to opt for more straightforward shots.</p><p> Happily, silhouette photography is not limited to any specific skill level or equipment. Anyone can dive into this captivating genre without breaking the bank or spending hours learning new techniques, so if you&#39;re on the fence about trying out silhouettes, I highly recommend giving it a go. It&#39;s a whole lot of fun, and you never know what magical results you might create.

Get ready to elevate your photography game, starting with: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="find-a-flat-or-raised-location"> 1. Find a flat or raised location</h3><p> When it comes to capturing stunning silhouette shots, the location plays a crucial role. The right environment will help you achieve that captivating contrast between your subject and the sky, while the wrong environment will distract the viewer or even prevent you from creating a crisp silhouette.</p><p> First and foremost, opt for locations that offer a flat or raised vantage point. Why is this important? Well, silhouettes tend to work best when your subject is framed against the sky, with the dark figure standing out against the bright background.</p><p> Beaches are a popular choice for silhouette photography because their flat landscapes make it easy to position your subject against the vast expanse of the sky. The uninterrupted low horizon provides the ideal opportunity to capture the outline of your subject in all its glory. Prairies are another solid option, though you&#39;ll need to be careful to prevent high grasses from obscuring portions of your subject.</p><p> But what if you can&#39;t find a flat location nearby? Don&#39;t worry, you can still create captivating silhouettes in areas where your subjects are raised off the ground. Bridges, hills, boardwalks, mountains, and even parking garage roofs can serve as elevated platforms to showcase your silhouetted subjects against the backdrop of the sky.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253363" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-106.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Silhouette photography" class="wp-image-253363" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-106.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-106.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-106.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-106.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-106.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-106.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Pro tip: Crouching down low to the ground can also work wonders, especially when your subject isn&#39;t already raised above you.

However, some objects work better for silhouettes than others.</p><p> I recommend choosing a subject that has a strong and recognizable shape – one that&#39;ll be interesting in its <em>two</em> -dimensional form. Silhouettes can&#39;t draw on colors, textures, and tones to make themselves appealing, so the shape needs to be distinct.</p><p> Ask yourself: Can you tell what your subject is simply by seeing its shape? Or does it just look like a blob? Does the shape look eye-catching and interesting, or does it feel relatively boring? (Also, sometimes the things that seem boring during the day can make great subjects for silhouettes – remember that it&#39;s about the shape, not the overall look!)</p><p> People make great silhouette subjects, but if they&#39;re doing something interesting – running, jumping, or riding a bike – the shot will look even better. The best silhouette shots often feature props, such as a bike, a basketball, or a skateboard.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-205278" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="silhouette of a biker" class="wp-image-205278" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-4.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-4.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-4.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="find-your-subject-well-before-sunrise-or-sunset"> 3. Find your subject well before sunrise or sunset</h3><p> Preparation is key in silhouette photography. Timing plays a crucial role, especially if you&#39;re looking to capture the rich colors of sunrise or sunset. You&#39;ll want to identify your subject and set up your shot well in advance.</p><p> The sky can change dramatically within a short period. That&#39;s why I recommend being in your chosen location at least 30 minutes before the sun makes its appearance or takes its leave. You should have your camera (and tripod, if you&#39;re using one) set up and ready to go a few minutes before the magic begins, and if you&#39;re working with a model, ask them to arrive a little early and use the extra time to get them prepared for the photoshoot.</p><p> And you should also make an effort to stay <em>after</em> the sunrise or sunset. You might think you can predict when the sky will be at its most vivid, but nature often surprises us. Sometimes the most amazing colors appear when you least expect them. So it&#39;s wise to be present for the whole event – before, during, and after the sun crosses the horizon.</p><p> (How long should you stick around? At least 30 minutes after the sun has risen or set is a good rule of thumb. This ensures you don&#39;t miss out on any late surprises the sky might have for you.) </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="make-sure-your-flash-is-off">4.

Get the light right</h3><p> Silhouette lighting doesn&#39;t work like normal photographic lighting. To capture a conventional shot, you generally want to ensure that your subject is lit from the front (so that the sun is coming from over your shoulder and striking your subject) or the side (so that the sun is off to your right or left and is striking one half of the subject).</p><p> But when you&#39;re shooting silhouettes, you&#39;ll need to reverse this approach. Find the scene&#39;s main light source, then ensure that it&#39;s shining from the <em>back</em> of the subject, not the front. Remember, the goal is to keep the background bright and the subject dark. You don&#39;t need the light to come from directly behind the subject, but the brighter the background, the better.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-205276" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-8.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="silhouette photography statue" class="wp-image-205276" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-8.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-8.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-8.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-8.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-8.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> That&#39;s why it&#39;s easy to create silhouettes at sunrise or sunset; you can position yourself so that you&#39;re shooting into the low sun, and you can frame the dark subject with the bright sky in the background.

You trick your camera.</p><p> Simply set the camera to your shooting mode of choice (Aperture Priority can work great for this, but you can try Auto mode, too). Then point your camera at the brightest part of the scene and press the shutter button halfway. On many cameras, this will set the exposure, and as long as you keep the shutter button half-pressed, it&#39;ll remain locked in.</p><p> Next, while still partially depressing the shutter button, point your camera at your subject and frame up your composition. Finally, press the shutter button the rest of the way.</p><p> With most digital cameras, this will result in a silhouetted subject!

If the image looks too dark, you can always lower the shutter speed, and if the image looks too bright, you can always increase the shutter speed instead.</p><p> (If you&#39;re working with very limited light and your shots are turning out dark, you can also widen the aperture or boost the ISO to increase the exposure, but do so sparingly; widening the aperture will limit the area of the photo that&#39;s in focus, while boosting the ISO will add unwanted noise to the image!)</p><p> I&#39;d also recommend capturing the same shot using a variety of different exposures – just so you have slightly darker and slightly lighter versions as backup files.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-205284" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-12.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="silhouette photography of a person holding a child" class="wp-image-205284" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-12.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-12.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-12.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-12.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-12.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-12.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="take-steps-to-keep-the-subject-sharp"> 10. Take steps to keep the subject sharp</h3><p> The best silhouette photograph tends to feature sharp, in-focus subjects.</p><p> Unfortunately, this can make the automatic metering process – described in Tip 6 – somewhat tricky. You see, pushing your shutter halfway down to get the metering right <em>also</em> means that your camera will focus on a spot in the background rather than on your subject.</p><p> If you&#39;re using the Manual mode shared above, you won&#39;t run into any issues. You can always acquire your exposure settings by pointing your camera at the background, dialing them in, then focusing on your subject. But if you prefer the Auto mode strategy, then you have two options.</p><p> First, if your camera offers <a aria-label="manual focusing (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dont-afraid-manual-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">manual focusing</a> , you can prefocus on your subject. Then, when you meter off the background, the point of focus won&#39;t change. You can effectively frame up your composition before triggering the shutter.</p><p> Second, you can try adjusting the aperture to maximize your <a aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> (ie, the amount of your image that is in focus). For this, you&#39;ll need to set a small aperture (ie, a large f-number, such as f/11 or f/16).</p><p> If the f-number is large enough and your subject isn&#39;t too close to the camera, you&#39;ll end up with a sharp subject and a sharp background, even if your camera is focused on the area <em>behind</em> your subject.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="look-for-action"> 11. Look for action</h3><p> If you&#39;re seeking silhouettes that pop off the screen, think action. A bit of movement can bring a unique layer of interest to your photos. Picture a dancer frozen in mid-leap or a skateboarder executing a trick. These dynamic moments create shapes and lines that captivate your audience.</p><p> The key is <em>timing</em> . You&#39;ll want to be ready to click the shutter at just the right moment. Don&#39;t worry; with practice, you&#39;ll get the hang of it (though burst mode can be helpful, too!).</p><p> Your camera settings are also crucial here. If your subject is moving fast, you&#39;ll need a quicker shutter speed (1/500s is a good starting point, though you can go slower or faster depending on the speed of your subject).</p><p> You don&#39;t always have to plan these action shots, either. Sometimes, the best moments are spontaneous. Keep your camera ready, and keep an eye out. You never know when a cyclist will zoom by, perfectly framed against the setting sun. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="be-aware-of-your-surroundings"> 12. Be aware of your surroundings</h3><p> Now that you&#39;re in your spot and set up, it&#39;s easy to become fixated on the spot where the sun is rising or setting. But don&#39;t let that narrow focus limit your creative vision. The sky is a vast canvas, and sometimes the most extraordinary colors appear where you least expect them.</p><p> Take a look around. Not just left and right, but also behind you. Sometimes, the sky opposite the rising or setting sun takes on hues just as dramatic, or even more so. These moments can be fleeting, and you have to be prepared to capture them.</p><p> If you&#39;re working with a tripod, it should be easy to move. In the rush of capturing a great shot, you might need to pivot quickly to face a different part of the sky. Make sure your tripod and camera setup allow for this.</p><p> Bottom line: Keep your eyes peeled and your camera ready. The sun has a way of illuminating clouds and creating color spectacles in unexpected places. So be aware of your surroundings, and be ready to capture the magic wherever it happens. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="incorporate-reflections-into-your-shots"> 13. Incorporate reflections into your shots</h3><p> One trick that can apply that extra touch of magic to your shots? Adding reflections. Not only do reflections add pizzazz to your images, but they also break up the monotony of an all-black foreground.</p><p> Once you&#39;ve found the perfect location for your silhouette shoot, keep your eyes peeled for a reflective surface in the foreground. Look out for small pools of water or wet areas, especially if you&#39;re shooting by the beach.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253361" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="998" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-102.jpg?resize=1500%2C998&#038;ssl=1" alt="Silhouette photography" class="wp-image-253361" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-102.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-102.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-102.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-102.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-102.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-102.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Once you&#39;ve found a nice surface, don&#39;t just shoot without thinking. Instead, you&#39;ll need to adjust your angle to ensure that your entire subject is reflected. For example, if you&#39;re photographing a graceful jogger against the vibrant sunset, you wouldn&#39;t want the reflection to accidentally cut off their head! Try shooting from higher or lower vantage points until you achieve the best composition.</p><p> Keep in mind that incorporating reflections into your silhouette photography can require some patience. It&#39;s not always easy to stumble upon the perfect combination of a reflective foreground, a compelling subject, and a captivating background. But the reward is well worth the effort. Don&#39;t give up! Keep exploring, keep searching for those hidden gems, and you&#39;ll be amazed at the incredible opportunities that you uncover. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-partial-silhouette-photography"> 14. Try partial silhouette photography</h3><p> While a total silhouette with a crisp, dark subject can be powerful, also consider capturing some partial silhouettes. I&#39;m talking about photos that include some detail on the subject, like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-205291" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-1001.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="silhouette of people on a beach" class="wp-image-205291" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-1001.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-1001.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-1001.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-1001.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-1001.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-1001.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> As you can see, the subjects are dark, but they&#39;re not <em>completely</em> dark, and you can still see a bit of detail in the sand and the subjects&#39; clothes.</p><p> Sometimes, a touch of light makes the subject slightly more three-dimensional and real, which – depending on your goals – can work well. Plus, a bit of extra detail can add to the mysterious feel of the image.</p><p> And if you&#39;re not sure whether to create a full silhouette or a partial silhouette, that&#39;s okay; just bracket your shots! That&#39;s the beauty of bracketing: it will leave you with both total and partial silhouettes to choose from.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="create-a-halo-effect"> 15. Create a halo effect</h3><p> Ever seen those breathtaking silhouettes framed by a heavenly glow? That&#39;s the halo effect, and it&#39;s not as hard to achieve as you might think. This effect adds a radiant outline around your subject.</p><p> Now, to get that glow, you&#39;ll need to position your subject directly in front of a light source. The setting sun is ideal for this, of course – so work hard to get the right angle as the sun lowers in the sky. If you can ensure that your subject is the right size in relation to the sun, and you can position your subject so the sun is almost entirely blocked, you can get a beautiful halo around the subject&#39;s edges.</p><p> Your camera&#39;s exposure settings come into play here. Experiment with different settings. You&#39;ll find that slight adjustments can make your halo more or less pronounced.</p><p> Composition matters, too. Make sure there&#39;s nothing intersecting with your subject&#39;s outline. Random objects or clutter can disrupt the halo. So aim for a clear and unobstructed view.</p><p> If you&#39;re struggling, don&#39;t get discouraged. This technique takes practice. Start with simple subjects and work your way up! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="include-props-for-unique-results"> 16. Include props for unique results</h3><p> Most photographers create candid silhouettes of distant strangers, but if you&#39;re up for a bit of creative experimentation, why not try some posed shots? While I generally wouldn&#39;t recommend capturing only silhouette shots during a portrait photoshoot, incorporating a few well-placed silhouettes can provide your subject with some cool and artistic photos that stand out from the crowd.</p><p> And if you&#39;re <em>really</em> looking to elevate those images, try adding a prop or two. Whether it&#39;s umbrellas, hats, musical instruments, or any other object that catches your fancy, props can inject personality and storytelling into your silhouette images. Just imagine a silhouette of a musician with a guitar, or a dancer with a flowing scarf.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253360" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-104.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Silhouette photography" class="wp-image-253360" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-104.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-104.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-104.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-104.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-104.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-104.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> When adding props to your compositions, keep in mind that they should be highly visible and not overshadow your subject. Also, ensure that the prop doesn&#39;t intersect with your subject in a way that detracts from the clear outline you&#39;re trying to create.</p><p> Remember, incorporating props is all about adding that extra touch of creativity and fun to your silhouette photography. So don&#39;t be afraid to experiment and think outside the box. Let your imagination run wild! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="take-a-storytelling-silhouette"> 17. Take a storytelling silhouette</h3><p> Silhouettes hold the power to tell a story in the simplest sense. Strip away the clutter, the colors, and the chaos, and what you&#39;re left with are raw emotions and actions that speak volumes. Picture a parent stooping to tie their child&#39;s shoelaces, or an elderly couple holding hands while watching the sunset. These moments tell stories that resonate with us all.</p><p> Adding more elements to your scene can make it even more dynamic. Think of a busy marketplace with various vendors and shoppers, all silhouetted against the evening sky. Props can also play a role. Imagine a fisherman with his net, or a musician playing a saxophone. Their outlines not only identify them but also say something profound about their life or passion.</p><p> As I&#39;ve emphasized throughout this article, it&#39;s crucial to keep your subjects&#39; outlines clean. Intersections are the enemy of good silhouette stories! So do your best to avoid these overlaps as much as possible.</p><p> One final tip: the environment can be a supporting actor in your storytelling. A silhouette framed against a stormy sky can add drama, while a peaceful sunrise can impart a sense of hope or a new beginning. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-just-photograph-people">18. Don&#39;t just photograph people</h3><p> Most silhouette photographers focus on people, and people <em>do</em> make great silhouette subjects. But you can also capture beautiful – and original – shots by focusing on other interesting objects.</p><p> For instance, you can create silhouettes of staircases (by getting down low and shooting upward), buildings, pets, planes, cars, and so much more.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253359" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-103.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Silhouette photography" class="wp-image-253359" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-103.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-103.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-103.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-103.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-103.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-103.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Really, whenever you see a subject with a compelling shape, see if you can position yourself so that you have a nice backlighting effect, then try to shoot a clear silhouette.

Try photographing at sunrise</h3><p> There&#39;s no denying the challenge wind can pose in silhouette photography, especially with plant subjects. A slight breeze can introduce unwanted motion, turning what could have been a crisp silhouette into a blurry mess, especially when the light is very low. One way to circumvent this issue is to schedule your shoot for the early morning hours.</p><p> Generally, the wind is much calmer during the sunrise than at sunset. This tranquility allows for steadier shots, particularly if you&#39;re trying to capture delicate subjects like leaves or flowers. The early morning atmosphere tends to be more stable, making it easier to get that perfect shot without any motion blur.</p><p> Now, if you&#39;re not a morning person, don&#39;t fret. There are alternatives. For those instances when you have to shoot later in the day, consider increasing your shutter speed. This will help to freeze any motion, reducing the chance of blur. Of course, this might require adjustments to aperture and ISO settings to maintain proper exposure, so be sure to make any necessary tweaks! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-flash-as-your-main-light-source"> 20. Use a flash as your main light source</h3><p> Throughout this article, I&#39;ve talked about photographing silhouettes using natural light.

One benefit of flash silhouette photography is that you can completely control the light direction and strength, which allows you to achieve all sorts of cool effects.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253358" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:71.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1071" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-101.jpg?resize=1500%2C1071&#038;ssl=1" alt="Silhouette photography" class="wp-image-253358" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-101.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-101.jpg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-101.jpg?resize=600%2C428&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-101.jpg?resize=768%2C548&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-101.jpg?resize=717%2C512&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Working with flash can be a bit intimidating, but the goal is simply to make the background brighter than the subject. Position your subject in front of a light-colored backdrop (such as a white wall), point the flash at the wall, then take some shots, with the goal of overexposing the background while underexposing the subject.</p><p> You might also try positioning the flash behind your subject so that it&#39;s pointed directly at their back; this will create a rim-lit effect, which can look wonderfully artistic. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="spend-some-time-processing-your-silhouette-photos"> 21.

Composition involves the thoughtful arrangement of elements within your frame. For landscape photographers, it&#39;s all about where to place the horizon, what to include in the foreground, and what should occupy your background.</p><p> When determining a landscape photo composition, you&#39;ll often need to ask yourself a handful of key questions:</p><ul><li> What should my main subjects(s) be?</li><li> Where should I position them in the frame?</li><li> Does the scene have plenty of depth?</li><li> Have I removed all distractions from the shot?</li><li> Did I choose a good angle to showcase the landscape?</li></ul><p> When you&#39;re just getting started, it can be helpful to mentally run through a checklist before you capture each shot. Before you know it, however, you&#39;ll be setting up your shots without even having to think twice. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-importance-of-mastering-landscape-composition"> The importance of mastering landscape composition</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256360" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-composition-106.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Landscape photography composition" class="wp-image-256360" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-composition-106.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-composition-106.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-composition-106.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-composition-106.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-composition-106.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-composition-106.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Mastering composition isn&#39;t just for show. It serves a bigger purpose: to create images that captivate your audience. What makes an image engaging? The answer often lies in how well you&#39;ve positioned the different elements within the frame.</p><p> A well-composed landscape shot typically has a balanced feel, and you can frequently <em>sense</em> the depth, almost as if you could step right into the picture. Good compositions often add dynamism to your photos; the arrangements guide the viewer&#39;s eyes, making them linger on the details you want to emphasize.</p><p> The bottom line is that the better your compositional skills, the more striking your photos will be. If you&#39;re just getting started with landscape photography, all this may seem a bit overwhelming, but don&#39;t worry: landscape photographers have developed plenty of easy-to-apply techniques that work great for snappers of all levels, and they don&#39;t require any technical wizardry to pull off! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="tips-to-improve-your-landscape-photography-compositions"> 17 tips to improve your landscape photography compositions</h2><p> You know all about what landscape composition is and why it&#39;s important.

A mountain. A river. A shell on the beach. Waves crashing on the shore. Lightning in the sky.</p><p> The point is to include at least one element in your photo that a viewer can latch onto – something that sucks them into the frame and piques their interest. Otherwise, the viewer will become confused. They won&#39;t know where to focus, so they&#39;ll move on to a different image and never look back.</p><p> Is it okay to include multiple interesting subjects? Absolutely! In fact, many landscape photographers these days like to pack both a foreground subject and a background subject into a single photo.

It&#39;s a great way for beginners to get started with composition, and it gives you an easy way to arrange key elements within the frame (eg, your main subject, your horizon, and other supporting elements).</p><p> If you&#39;re unfamiliar with the rule of thirds, here&#39;s a quick explanation:</p><p> The rule of thirds tells you to split your composition into vertical and horizontal thirds so you end up with a series of gridlines (displayed below). To create the most powerful compositions, you should place compositional elements along those gridlines and at their intersection points. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-158015 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-158015" style="width:1000px"><span class="space" style="width:1000px; padding-top:54.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="545" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rule-of-thirds-black.jpg?resize=1000%2C545&#038;ssl=1" alt="Rule of thirds grid landscape photography composition" class="wp-image-158015" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rule-of-thirds-black.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rule-of-thirds-black.jpg?resize=300%2C164&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rule-of-thirds-black.jpg?resize=768%2C419&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rule-of-thirds-black.jpg?resize=600%2C327&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rule-of-thirds-black.jpg?resize=160%2C88&amp;ssl=1 160w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rule-of-thirds-black.jpg?resize=717%2C391&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Graphic by Jeremy Flint</figcaption></figure></div><p> This often comes into play when working with horizon lines.

You might put the subject along one of the vertical gridlines, or – even better – at an intersection point. In fact, the rule of thirds gridline intersections are sometimes referred to as <em>power points</em> because they create such compelling compositions.</p><p> A quick word of caution, though:</p><p> The rule of thirds is a helpful technique. But despite the name, it&#39;s not a landscape composition rule. Rather, it&#39;s a guideline, so you don&#39;t need to follow it all the time.

Check out the work of popular landscape shooters on Instagram or 500px, and you&#39;ll see thousands of stunning near-far compositions featuring:</p><ul><li> Foreground logs and background waterfalls</li><li> Foreground rocks and background sunsets</li><li> Foreground flowers and background mountains</li></ul><p> And the reason this technique is so popular? It helps create the illusion of <em>depth</em> in a scene.</p><p> For instance, a photo of a distant mountain can look nice, but it often appears <em>flat</em> .</p><p> But add some flowers or grass close to the camera, and the whole composition immediately deepens. The viewer first focuses on the foreground grass, then moves into the midground, and <em>then</em> finally sees the stunning mountain in the background:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-211079" style="width:453px"><span class="space" style="width:453px; padding-top:132.45%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="453" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landscape-photography-composition-123.jpg?resize=453%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="mountain with grasses in the foreground landscape photography composition" class="wp-image-211079" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landscape-photography-composition-123.jpg?resize=453%2C600&amp;ssl=1 453w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landscape-photography-composition-123.jpg?resize=226%2C300&amp;ssl=1 226w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landscape-photography-composition-123.jpg?resize=768%2C1018&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landscape-photography-composition-123.jpg?resize=717%2C950&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landscape-photography-composition-123.jpg?w=1132&amp;ssl=1 1132w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> So the next time you find a beautiful background subject, like the mountain I mentioned above…</p><p> …take a few moments to look for foreground interest.

Try getting down low over a foreground element; it&#39;ll create extra depth, plus it&#39;ll help draw the viewer into the frame.</p><p> Alternatively, find a vantage point and get up high. (A drone can be hugely useful here!) From an elevated perspective, the scene will look far more abstract, and you&#39;ll capture stunning images that convey the incredible scope of the landscape.</p><p> You can also carefully adjust your angle to block out distracting elements and create interesting framing opportunities (see below!). Sometimes, a couple of steps to the right or the left is all it takes to create a stunningly original composition. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photograph-with-a-tripod"> 6.

Commit to sticking around for a few minutes (or even a few hours). Capture that first shot, yes, but then keep going. Adjust your angle. Find different foreground elements that complement the background and lead the viewer into the scene.</p><p> A handy trick here is to walk twenty paces in each direction with your camera to your eye. That way, you can see how the foreground and background elements shift in relation to one another, and you&#39;ll quickly notice other compositional opportunities (such as interesting frames or powerful juxtapositions of foreground and background).</p><p> Then, once you feel satisfied you&#39;ve exhausted all possibilities and captured the best possible image, you can move on!</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-to-portray-scale"> 15.

And this can be a problem; in my experience, the more you can show scale in a landscape image, the better.</p><p> Fortunately, there&#39;s a simple technique that allows you to give your landscape compositions a sense of scale time and time again: include a reference point, something that the viewer is familiar with and can use to gauge the size of the rest of the scene.</p><p> Natural reference points include lone trees, flowers, and branches, while human-made reference points include bridges, cars, roads, barns, houses, or even people standing (or walking) in the vicinity. In a pinch, you can even stand in the scene yourself!</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-forget-about-color">16.

It&#39;s more than just eye candy in your photos; it&#39;s a powerful tool in your composition arsenal. Often, we get so caught up in lines, shapes, and focal points that we forget the role color plays in our landscape shots. The mood, the emotion, the depth – color affects them all.</p><p> As you compose each landscape shot, take a moment to think about the colors present in your frame. Stick with 2-4 main colors to avoid overwhelming the viewer, and when you&#39;re scouting a scene, be on the lookout for complementary colors; think red and green or blue and orange. They sit opposite each other on the color wheel and create a dynamic tension when placed together in a photo. Contrasting colors naturally draw the eye and can make your image pop.</p><p> But don&#39;t exclude analogous color combinations, either! These are the colors that are adjacent on the wheel, like shades of blue and green. They create a sense of peace and can often give your photos a deeply tranquil mood.</p><p> Note that color, unlike framing, is something you can fine-tune during post-processing. Adjusting the hues or ramping up the saturation can enhance the natural color relationships in your scene, and you should always spend a bit of time working with these elements during photo editing. Of course, for the best results, you should always aim to get the colors right in camera and only use post-processing as a last resort.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="break-the-rules"> 17.

You see, cats aren&#39;t exactly known for posing on command or following your carefully crafted shot list. No, they prefer to embrace their independent nature, keeping you on your toes as they pounce, play, or simply stare you down with a look that says, “Who are you to interrupt my nap?”</p><p> Fortunately, while cat photography can be challenging, it&#39;s a passion of mine, and over the years, I&#39;ve developed techniques that produce beautiful results. Below, I share my favorite tips to improve your cat photography, including advice on:</p><ul><li>作品</li><li>Camera settings</li><li> Lighting</li><li> And more</li></ul><p> I also offer plenty of cat photography ideas to help you get inspired!</p><p> So grab your camera and prepare to embark on a whisker-filled adventure that will leave you with an album of cat photos guaranteed to make your friends go “Awww!”</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="cat-photography-tips"> 16 cat photography tips</h2><p> If you&#39;re struggling to capture outstanding images of cats, these techniques will make a <em>huge</em> difference.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-for-the-best-cat-photos-be-patient"> 1. For the best cat photos, be patient </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tips-photos-cats-01.jpg?ssl=1" alt="cat photography cats on the stairs" title="tips-photos-cats-01.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> First things first: When photographing cats, expect a high failure rate. Most of your shots won&#39;t work; after all, cats don&#39;t strike stunning poses for long periods of time!</p><p> (In my experience, they&#39;re likely to walk up to you and sniff your lens <em>just</em> as you hit the shutter button.)</p><p> Instead, you must embrace the randomness and slow progress of a cat photoshoot. Enjoy watching the cat, be patient, and have your camera ready.</p><p> That way, when your cat strikes an interesting pose, you can simply fire off a few frames and get the shot.</p><p> Also, if you&#39;re photographing a cat that lives with you (as opposed to conducting a scheduled photoshoot with a cat), then I highly recommend you always keep a camera handy, even if it&#39;s just a phone. Cats tend to strike funny poses, especially when they&#39;re half asleep, but you <em>must</em> have a camera nearby; otherwise, the cat will hear you digging around for your camera and change positions.</p><p> Similarly, if you&#39;re outside with your cat, keep your camera at the ready for some outdoor action shots. If you need to fetch your gear from inside the house, then you may miss some great opportunities. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tips-photos-cats-04.jpg?ssl=1" alt="cat sitting in terra cotta jar" title="tips-photos-cats-04.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="make-a-shot-list"> 2. Make a shot list</h3><p> One of the best cat photography ideas is to create a shot list. This will serve as a guideline when structuring your session.</p><p> You can also use a shot list to determine the materials you need before heading out to your cat photoshoot.</p><p> I recommend you include a close-up portrait on your list because it&#39;s one of the classic shots that you can&#39;t miss. When the cat&#39;s face fills the frame, it becomes the most important element – no distractions. Like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-204780" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cat-photography-ideas-close-up.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="cat licking face" class="wp-image-204780" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cat-photography-ideas-close-up.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cat-photography-ideas-close-up.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cat-photography-ideas-close-up.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cat-photography-ideas-close-up.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cat-photography-ideas-close-up.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cat-photography-ideas-close-up.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If it&#39;s a frontal portrait, you&#39;ll emphasize the eyes. Here, making eye contact with the cat is key to a successful photo.</p><p> (You can also try a close-up in profile or capture a specific expression.)</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-use-sounds-and-toys-to-get-the-cat-s-attention"> 3. Use sounds and toys to get the cat&#39;s attention</h3><p> As I emphasized in the previous tip, cats love to defy photographers. They&#39;ll turn away just as you frame up your shot, they&#39;ll lie down just as you&#39;re ready to shoot some action, and they&#39;ll sniff the lens right when you <em>know</em> you&#39;ve found the perfect composition.</p><p> Fortunately, cats aren&#39;t totally unpredictable. There are a few easy techniques you can use to get your cat&#39;s attention.</p><p> First, cats are intrigued by rustling noises, so if you crunch a paper bag with one hand while keeping the camera up with the other, your cat will often look over and you&#39;ll be able to nab a few frames.</p><p> An alternative is finger-snapping, where you snap your fingers until the cat turns to investigate. In my experience, this usually works, but only for a time – after a few moments, the cat will recognize what&#39;s going on and get bored.</p><p> Finally, if you prefer <em>livelier</em> photos, consider bringing out a toy. You can shoot with one hand while moving the toy with the other, and while your keeper rate will be pretty low, you&#39;ll certainly get shots of your cat looking engaged.</p><p> Note that all of these methods do involve one-handed shooting (unless you&#39;re working with an assistant). You&#39;ll need to keep your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> fast enough to prevent blur, and while I discuss settings in greater depth later on, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/" target="_blank" aria-label="Aperture Priority (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Aperture Priority</a> is a good mode to use (as it keeps the camera in charge but relinquishes control as needed). </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tips-photos-cats-09.jpg?ssl=1" alt="cat photography posed" title="tips-photos-cats-09.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-get-down-on-your-cat-s-level"> 4. Get down on your cat&#39;s level</h3><p> This cat photography tip is a <em>big</em> one, and it goes hand in hand with a mistake I see all the time from beginner cat shooters.</p><p> You see, most cat (and dog) photographers, when starting out, photograph their animal <em>from human height</em> . And this rarely works well, for two reasons:</p><ol><li> It shows the pet from so high up that the shot loses intimacy.</li><li> It decreases the distance between the cat and the background. The result is generally a cat surrounded by a sharp floor, as opposed to (ideally) a cat in front of a blurry wall or a blurry outdoor scene.</li></ol><p> Instead, it&#39;s important to get down on your cat&#39;s level. Look them in the eye with the camera. This type of photo – where you are part of the cat&#39;s world, not the other way around – tends to have more impact and better show off the animal&#39;s personality.</p><p> If you struggle to get down in such low positions, consider using a camera with a tilting or fully articulating screen. That way, you can compose eye-level shots while remaining comfortably above your camera.</p><p> And by the way, you don&#39;t always need to get on the ground for a good result.

Frame your subject for the best compositions</h3><p> Speaking of composition: in cat photography, it pays to emphasize your main subject as much as possible.</p><p> And one easy way to do this is by framing your cat with other compositional elements.</p><p> For instance, you can shoot through long grass, shrubs, or tree foliage, which will give the cat a nice, natural frame: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tips-photos-cats-02.jpg?ssl=1" alt="creative cat photography shooting-through technique" title="tips-photos-cats-02.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Or you can shoot through human-made objects, such as chair legs, banister railings, towel cupboards, and even windows. It&#39;s a fun technique, and one that comes with endless variations; the key is to get creative!</p><p> You should also experiment with different <a aria-label="apertures (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">apertures</a> as you work. For instance, a wide aperture – such as f/2.8 – is great for creating a blurry foreground frame, which works great when handling more natural elements (like leaves). Whereas a narrow aperture – f/8, for example – will keep the foreground frame sharp and create a completely different effect.</p><p> (The more you test your different camera settings, the more familiar you&#39;ll get – and the more your creative horizons will expand!) </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="choose-the-right-backgrounds"> 8. Choose the right backgrounds</h3><p> When it comes to capturing stunning cat photos, the background plays a major role. You don&#39;t want it to steal the spotlight or distract from your feline subject. Instead, you want a background that complements and enhances the overall composition of the image.</p><p> First off, simplicity is key. A background that&#39;s too busy or cluttered can take away from the main focus of your photo: the adorable cat in front of your lens. Consider opting for a clean and uniform background, like a simple white or black wall. This minimalist approach can help draw attention to your cat&#39;s charming features and personality.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-252889" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cat-photography-tips-447.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Cat photography tips" class="wp-image-252889" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cat-photography-tips-447.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cat-photography-tips-447.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cat-photography-tips-447.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cat-photography-tips-447.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cat-photography-tips-447.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cat-photography-tips-447.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> However, don&#39;t be afraid to get a little creative with your backgrounds. Experiment with different textured surfaces, vibrant patterns, or even natural elements like flowers or foliage. Just make sure that the background doesn&#39;t overpower your furry model. Remember, it&#39;s all about finding the right balance.</p><p> When choosing a background, also consider the mood and theme you want to convey. Is it a playful and lively shot? Then perhaps a bright and colorful background would work best. Are you aiming for a more serene and intimate feel? In that case, a muted or neutral background might be the way to go. In other words, the background should support the overall story you want your photograph to tell.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-nail-focus-on-the-eyes"> 9. Nail focus on the eyes</h3><p> Pet photos <em>must</em> include sharp eyes. This is true of cat photos, dog photos, bird photos, and even wildlife photos, because without sharp eyes, the whole image will feel off-kilter.</p><p> Unfortunately, keeping the eye in focus can be tough, especially if you&#39;re shooting up close or your cat is very active. Here are a few simple tips:</p><ul><li> If your camera has Animal Eye AF, test it out and see whether you like the result.</li><li> If your cat tends to be active for a few moments before becoming motionless, then consider using your camera&#39;s <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/choosing-a-focus-mode/" target="_blank" aria-label="AF-S mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">AF-S mode</a> . Wait until the cat is still, use a single AF point to lock focus on the eyes, then recompose and take your shot.</li><li> If all else fails, switch over to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dont-afraid-manual-focus/" target="_blank" aria-label="manual focusing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">manual focusing</a> . It might seem unwieldy, but if you can learn to accurately focus manually, you&#39;ll easily increase your keeper rate.</li></ul><p> By the way, if you&#39;re struggling to get an eye in focus, feel free to narrow the aperture (assuming you have sufficient light). Narrowing the aperture will increase the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> so that a larger portion of the image is sharp, which will in turn give greater leeway when focusing on the cat.</p><p> And one more thing: If you&#39;re taking a cat photo from an angle, aim to keep the nearest eye in focus, as it looks unnatural to feature a blurry near eye and a sharp far eye. Whereas if you&#39;re photographing the cat from the front, as I did in the photo below, make sure that <em>both</em> eyes are tack sharp: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tips-photos-cats-10.jpg?ssl=1" alt="cat close-up photo" title="tips-photos-cats-10.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-shooting-during-the-golden-hours"> 10.

Try shooting with the light directly hitting the front of your cat, showcasing its every adorable detail. Then play with sidelight, allowing the sun to create beautiful shadows and highlight the contours of your feline model.</p><p> Finally, test out some backlighting approaches. You might even try to capture a silhouette or two! (To achieve this effect, deliberately expose for the bright sky and let the cat turn dark.)</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-try-an-off-camera-flash-for-the-best-lighting-effects"> 11. Try an off-camera flash for the best lighting effects</h3><p> Most beginner cat photographers shoot in natural light, and that&#39;s completely fine. In fact, natural light – as discussed in the previous tip – can look <em>incredible</em> in cat shots.</p><p> But if you want to increase your flexibility as a cat photographer, I do recommend you <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/starting-with-off-camera-flash-techniques/" target="_blank" aria-label="learn how to use flash (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">learn how to use flash</a> ; it&#39;ll let you take photos even when the light is low or isn&#39;t cooperating, and the more flexible your approach, the better, right?</p><p> To get started with flash, I encourage you to purchase an adjustable speedlight. You can mount this to your camera <em>or</em> use it off-camera on a lighting stand, which makes for a versatile shooting setup. Plus, a speedlight lets you avoid the dreaded red-eye effect (just make sure you&#39;re not shooting <em>directly</em> into the eyes of the cat but are instead working from an angle).</p><p> Once you get a speedlight, add a small softbox or diffuser, which will soften the light to avoid harsh shadows and that unpleasant deer-in-the-headlights look.</p><p> Then just play around with different angles and approaches. You might try to bounce the flash off walls to create interesting sidelighting, or you might mount the flash on a stand at a 45-degree angle to create a dramatic effect.</p><p> Of course, you&#39;ll need to pay careful attention to the compositions of your photos, and good lighting doesn&#39;t necessarily guarantee great shots – but if you can master flash cat photography, then you&#39;ll be <em>miles</em> ahead of the game. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tips-photos-cats-06.jpg?ssl=1" alt="cat in beautiful lighting" title="tips-photos-cats-06.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-use-plenty-of-focal-lengths-for-a-variety-of-shots"> 12. Use plenty of focal lengths for a variety of shots</h3><p> You can shoot cats with a single prime lens – but if you want to capture a variety of photos that really tell a story, then I highly recommend you work with multiple focal lengths.</p><p> Here, a handful of primes is a decent option, though a zoom – such as a 70-200mm lens – will give you lots of flexibility and won&#39;t need to be swapped on and off your camera over the course of the photoshoot.</p><p> Personally, I&#39;m a fan of portrait-type lenses in the 85mm to 130mm focal-length range for cat photos, as these lenses let you shoot without getting in the cat&#39;s face, while <em>also</em> allowing you to get reasonably close (which is important if you plan to photograph indoors).</p><p> A good beginner cat photography lens is a macro option, like a Canon 100mm f/2.8 or a Nikon 105mm f/2.8. You can use it to capture beautiful portraits, then you can move in for some close-ups of the eyes and paws: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tips-photos-cats-12.jpg?ssl=1" alt="cat's paws on a red carpet" title="tips-photos-cats-12.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> I&#39;d also encourage you to invest in a wider lens, such as a 24-70mm zoom or a 35mm prime; a wide-angle lens is great for grabbing full-body and environmental shots of your cat, and while it probably won&#39;t see as much use as a short telephoto lens, it&#39;ll still be nice to have around. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tips-photos-cats-07.jpg?ssl=1" alt="cat lying down and stretching" title="tips-photos-cats-07.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> You can also photograph a cat with a smartphone camera. No, it won&#39;t offer the same level of image quality or settings flexibility as a dedicated DSLR or mirrorless body, but it&#39;s an easy way to get started with the equipment you have. Use your wide-angle lens to get environmental cat shots, and use the telephoto lens for headshots and standard portraits.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-use-the-right-cat-photography-settings"> 13. Use the right cat photography settings</h3><p> You can do cat photography with your camera set to Auto mode, but you&#39;re bound to get frustrated pretty quickly. Auto mode doesn&#39;t let you adjust exposure variables, which means that you&#39;ll be unable to control the shutter speed (which affects sharpness), the aperture (which affects depth of field), and the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> (which affects <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-avoid-and-reduce-noise-in-your-images/" target="_blank" aria-label="noise levels (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">noise levels</a> ).</p><p> Instead, most cameras offer several better options.</p><p> First, you might try Aperture Priority mode, which allows you to set the ISO and aperture while your camera selects the shutter speed. I generally recommend you set the ISO to its lowest value, then select the aperture for the depth of field effect you&#39;re after (remember, a wide aperture, such as f/2.8, will limit depth of field to create a very blurry background, while a narrow aperture, such as f/8, will increase depth of field to keep everything sharp). If your camera sets a too-slow shutter speed, you can always increase the ISO or widen the aperture further (this, in turn, will force the camera to increase the shutter speed).</p><p> If you&#39;re already familiar with basic camera settings or you want to dive straight into the deep end, then you can try shooting in <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> . Here, you pick your shutter speed, aperture, <em>and</em> ISO; the goal is to choose the three settings so your exposure bar (generally present in the camera viewfinder) is balanced.</p><p> I think Manual mode is good for slower-paced photoshoots with consistent lighting, whereas Aperture Priority mode does well when the cat is moving and/or the light is changing rapidly. Both options are great, however, so I suggest you pick one, start learning, and stick with it! </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tips-photos-cats-03.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Cat sitting and watching birds" title="tips-photos-cats-03.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-burst-mode-and-a-fast-shutter-speed"> 14. Use burst mode and a fast shutter speed</h3><p> If you want to capture those split-second moments of your feline friend in action, I recommend you unleash the power of <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/burst-mode/" target="_blank" aria-label="burst mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">burst mode</a> <em>and</em> dial in a fast shutter speed. These settings will ensure you don&#39;t miss stunning shots while your cat is on the move.</p><p> Burst mode, also known as continuous shooting mode, is your best friend when it comes to capturing those dynamic images. Once you activate burst mode on your camera, you can simply hold down the shutter button; your camera will then fire off a series of shots in quick succession. That way, you can capture moments that move faster than your shutter finger – for instance, you can capture your cat&#39;s acrobatics mid-air or their lightning-fast sprint across the room. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tips-photos-cats-05.jpg?ssl=1" alt="cat standing on two legs" title="tips-photos-cats-05.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Note, however, that just shooting in burst mode alone isn&#39;t enough. You also need to pair it with a fast shutter speed to avoid any blurriness in your action shots. A minimum shutter speed of 1/500s is a good starting point, but you may need to increase it further depending on how speedy your feline companion is.</p><p> I&#39;m not saying that you should use burst mode for the entire session; this will result in an enormous amount of pictures to cull and edit. If you&#39;re photographing a slower-paced scene, such as a cat sitting or sleeping, you can dial down the shutter speed.</p><p> However, if you&#39;re looking to capture the action, make sure to keep burst mode activated and the shutter speed cranked up!</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-203533" style="width:1125px"><span class="space" style="width:1125px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1125" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cat-photography-ideas-burst-mode.jpg?resize=1125%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="cat jumping up cat photography ideas" class="wp-image-203533" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cat-photography-ideas-burst-mode.jpg?w=1125&amp;ssl=1 1125w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cat-photography-ideas-burst-mode.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cat-photography-ideas-burst-mode.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cat-photography-ideas-burst-mode.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cat-photography-ideas-burst-mode.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cat-photography-ideas-burst-mode.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by Ana Mireles </figcaption></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-pay-attention-to-cat-tones-and-exposure"> 15.

Have some fun with editing</h3><p> Many beginners don&#39;t edit their photos, but in my view, adding final touches to your cat photos can make a massive difference. Even the best shots can use a bit of processing to make them truly stand out.</p><p> Start off with basic edits in your favorite post-processing program. Adjust the white balance to ensure the colors look natural and true to life. Tweak the exposure to bring out the right amount of brightness and contrast. Sharpen up those details to make the fur look oh-so-crisp.</p><p> As you gain more experience, don&#39;t be afraid to get a little more adventurous with your editing. Add a subtle vignette to help highlight your cat as the star of the show. Experiment with color grading to infuse your photos with mood and emotion.</p><p> Remember, there&#39;s no right or wrong way to edit your cat photos. It&#39;s all about finding your own style and experimenting with different techniques. Play around with the sliders and see what kind of effects you can produce. When you stumble upon an editing look you love, make a mental note – or create a preset – so you can recreate it in the future. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="cat-photography-ideas-for-inspiration"> 6 cat photography ideas for inspiration</h2><p> In this section, I share a few quick ideas to get you inspired when capturing photos of your feline friend:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photograph-the-details"> 1.

That&#39;s deep depth of field. It&#39;s perfect for highlighting the environment your cat is in, so if you want to showcase your cat surrounded by a picturesque garden or cozy living room, it&#39;s the way to go.

A darker approach can turn an ordinary dish into a mysterious masterpiece.</p><p> Start with your backdrop. A piece of dark fabric or painted wood can work great; just place it behind your food setup and make sure it&#39;s not lit too heavily. Make sure your surface is dark as well (here, dark wood or slate looks amazing).</p><p> Lighting comes next. Natural light from a window is ideal, as long as you position your setup so that the light falls across the food, creating shadows. You see, with dark food photography, shadows are your allies. They add depth, texture, and a touch of drama to each shot.</p><p> If you&#39;re shooting indoors without good natural light, don&#39;t worry. A strobe or speedlight positioned to the side can mimic that natural window-lit effect. Use a softbox or stripbox to diffuse the light, which will soften any harsh shadows to give the scene a more natural look.</p><p> Finally, play with the lighting angles. Each angle will give you a different shadow, a different mood. Experiment to find the look that makes your food come alive!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="go-minimalistic"> 2.

With minimalism, less really <em>is</em> more. The focus is solely on the food, with no distractions. It&#39;s just you, the camera, and a tantalizing dish (or food item) that demands attention.</p><p> To get started, you need a clean background. A simple white or black backdrop works wonders here, though solid colors look nice, too. Place your subject – maybe a single strawberry or a beautifully plated dessert – against this backdrop. Ensure the food is the most vibrant element in the composition. Make it the star of the show.</p><p> Then adjust its positioning. While composition may not seem hugely important in food photography, it really, <em>really</em> matters, and if you can place your food item in the right part of the frame, you&#39;ll end up with some artistic fireworks. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-different-points-of-view"> 3. Try different points of view</h2><p> Here&#39;s a simple yet effective food photography idea:</p><p> Change your perspective.</p><p> You see, most people view their food from a sitting position. And that&#39;s how many casual food photographers <em>approach</em> their food.</p><p> But if you adjust your angle, you&#39;ll capture food in a very different way.</p><p> Here are some perspectives you could try:</p><ul><li> <strong>Bird&#39;s-eye view:</strong> Aim your camera directly down at the food from above.</li><li> <strong>Plate level</strong> : Get down on the same level as your plate and photograph across it.</li><li> <strong>Wider scene</strong> : It&#39;s tempting to focus only on the food. Instead, use a wider lens to show the scene <em>around</em> the food (plus the food itself, of course!).</li></ul><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-200414" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Creative-food-photography-idea-01.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="shooting a plate from above Food photography ideas" class="wp-image-200414" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Creative-food-photography-idea-01.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Creative-food-photography-idea-01.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Creative-food-photography-idea-01.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Creative-food-photography-idea-01.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Creative-food-photography-idea-01.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Creative-food-photography-idea-01.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The bird&#39;s-eye view angle is an effective one!

Great painters like Cezanne and Caravaggio elevated everyday items into works of art, including plenty of food!</p><p> To get started, try looking at some great still-life paintings created by the masters. Then think about your arrangement. You&#39;ll need a main subject – the food – but what else should you include? Plates, silverware, and linens can all add layers and depth to each shot.</p><p> Select a variety of these elements. Mix and match. Maybe a vintage spoon next to a pale blue linen, a cracked cup next to a white plate. It&#39;s all about balance and harmony.</p><p> As for the food: Fruit is a fantastic place to start. A bowl of vibrant oranges or a spread of pears and apples can capture the eye. If you&#39;re more adventurous, consider adding multiple dishes. A loaf of bread, a slice of cheese, and some wine can be wildly captivating.</p><p> Take your time with composition. Arrange and rearrange. Move the items around until your eyes can dance effortlessly from one part of the frame to another! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="think-about-the-background"> 8.

You&#39;ve seen them in cookbooks, on social media, and in advertisements. But how do you achieve that luminous, high-key look?</p><p> In high-key shots, the background is almost as important as the food itself. Aim for a white, uniform background – a sheet or a piece of white poster works great – and make sure that it&#39;s well-lit. It can often be a good idea to light the background and the food separately, or to simply shine a light on the backdrop while leaving the food in shadow.</p><p> The next step is setting up your camera. Opt for settings that lean toward overexposure, but remember: while you want to overexpose the background, the food should remain detailed. Striking this balance can be a bit of a dance, so don&#39;t hesitate to take multiple shots to get it right.</p><p> Editing is the final frontier in high-key food photography. Open up your editing software and boost the brightest tones until the background becomes a pure white canvas. However, keep an eye on the food.

But if you are overwhelmed by the options and aren&#39;t sure where to start, my list of the nine best ND filters should help point you in the right direction.</p><p> Now, before we get into my recommendations, know that there are many ND filter varieties and options to suit your needs. <a aria-label="ND filters (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/neutral-density-filters-landscape-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ND filters</a> perform a specific task, but they go about it in different ways – and what works for one person might not always work for another. So this article is designed to help you determine the best ND filters for specific needs, budgets, and quality levels.</p><p> Note: ND filters come in many sizes, and compatibility tends to be <em>very</em> limited. Most lenses have a screw-on thread size (you can find this printed on the lens itself). When purchasing an ND filter, you&#39;ll need to ensure that the filter thread size matches your lens thread size. To facilitate easier pricing comparisons, many of the filters here are 77mm, but don&#39;t just buy a 77mm filter (or any other size) without checking your lens first.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-best-nd-filter-for-new-users-tiffen-nd-filter-kit"> 1.

Neewer is well-known in the photographic community for producing decent-yet-inexpensive gear, and this filter set is no exception.</p><p> The Neewer ND Filter Kit won&#39;t win any awards for quality, but the variety of filters included in the kit leaves room for a great deal of experimentation. Also, you can stack filters to produce even longer exposures; simply put one on your lens, then screw another onto <em>that</em> filter. This lets you test out <em>very</em> long exposures in bright light, with the significant caveat that your image quality will take a big hit (expect your pictures to take a major dip in sharpness and have a deep green or red color cast when stacking).</p><p> However, for budget-conscious photographers, these tradeoffs might be worth it – and if you&#39;re interested in capturing more abstract, artistic images, the loss of image quality might be a help rather than a hindrance.</p><p> <strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul class="is-style-default"><li> Very inexpensive</li><li> Kit includes four filters, which is great for learning and experimenting</li><li> Filters can be stacked to block out even more light</li></ul><p> <strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul class="is-style-default"><li> Subpar image quality</li><li> Average build quality</li><li> Stacking filters results in a severe loss of sharpness</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-best-midrange-nd-filter-hoya-3-stop-nd-filter"> 3.

Why purchase a single ND filter when you can grab multiple filters for an equivalent price?</p><p> The answer really comes down to two things: image quality and construction quality. When you purchase a neutral-density filter kit, you&#39;ll have a range of filters to use, <em>but</em> you&#39;ll be compromising on image sharpness, image color casts, and filter construction. A single filter that costs just as much as a filter kit tends to offer much better performance all around, and that&#39;s why I recommend the <a aria-label="Hoya HMC NDx8 filter (opens in a new tab)" href="https://geni.us/Hoya-58mm-NDx8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Hoya HMC NDx8</a> for intermediate photographers.</p><p> <span class="dPS-amended-link">This Hoya filter</span> is only three stops, so it won&#39;t let you get super long exposures in bright daylight, but you can use it to control your shutter speed when shooting golden-hour (or blue-hour) landscapes; it&#39;s also a solid pick if you&#39;re looking to widen your aperture when photographing brightly lit portrait subjects.</p><p> But what the Hoya HMC NDx8 lacks in versatility, it makes up for in quality. The construction is solid – you won&#39;t have to worry about a couple of knocks damaging the filter forever – and the optics are superior to some of the less expensive options on this list. The filter also has a special coating to reduce glare and other image artifacts, plus it undergoes a higher level of quality control to minimize problems more common in cheaper filters.</p><p> <strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul class="is-style-default"><li> Good image quality</li><li> Great build</li><li> Negligible color cast in final images</li></ul><p> <strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul class="is-style-default"><li> Coating does not resist dust and scratches as effectively as more expensive filters</li><li> Can be difficult to attach and remove if not careful</li><li> Not as versatile as a filter kit</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-best-semi-professional-nd-filter-b-w-6-stop-nd-filter">4.

You see, purchasing several neutral-density filters (and then switching them in the field) can be both expensive and inconvenient, so variable ND filters let you turn a ring on the filter itself to adjust its light-blocking power. That way, there&#39;s no need to buy multiple filters or attempt filter stacking.</p><p> The <span class="dPS-amended-link"><a aria-label="Bower Variable ND filter (opens in a new tab)" href="https://geni.us/TH9UA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Bower Variable ND filter</a></span> is a great entry point for people who want to use this type of filter without spending much money. It blocks between 2 and 8 stops of light, and it&#39;s ridiculously easy to use: simply screw it onto your lens, twist until you get the desired strength, and start shooting.</p><p> Image quality on variable ND filters like this one is not as good compared to a solid ND filter, but if you value convenience over sharpness, then the tradeoff is worth it.

The market is flooded with options, each promising to be the “best” choice for your camera. Fortunately, I&#39;m here to streamline this process for you.</p><p> I&#39;ve based my top picks on four key criteria: filter strength, construction, optics, and price. Below, I delve into each factor and why it matters.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="filter-strength"> Filter strength</h3><p> Filter strength is measured in <em>stops</em> of light (which refers to the halving or doubling of the amount of light hitting your camera sensor).</p><p> If you&#39;re into long-exposure shots that make rivers look like silk and clouds like cotton candy, you&#39;ll need a filter that blocks out a lot of light – think 10+ stops. This allows you to use a slower shutter speed without overexposing your images.</p><p> On the flip side, maybe you&#39;re more into shooting longer exposures during the magical blue hour, or perhaps you enjoy taking well-lit portraits and want to use a wider aperture. In such scenarios, a filter in the 2-stop to 5-stop range would be more effective.</p><p> Understanding your specific photography need is crucial here. If you&#39;re just starting out or still exploring your style, it might be a good idea to opt for a versatile kit that offers a range of filter strengths.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="filter-construction"> Filter construction</h3><p> Now let&#39;s talk durability. A filter&#39;s build can make a huge difference to your experience. Not only is a poorly constructed filter prone to breaking, but it can also cause other problems: it can get stuck on your lens, and you can damage the lens treads or even the lens glass trying to get it off.</p><p> Materials are key. Filters with glass elements and metal (especially brass) frames are your best bet. These stand up well to the elements and tend to be more reliable.</p><p> But strength isn&#39;t just about materials. Design counts, too. Some brands have a reputation for well-designed filters, such as LEE and B+W; if you can afford products made by these companies, I highly recommend investing.</p><p> By the way: Handling your filters well is also crucial. They might be tough, but a hard knock can still damage them. So always use protective cases or pouches, especially when traveling.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="filter-optics"> Filter optics</h3><p> Anytime you add glass over a lens, you degrade the image quality – but with the right ND filter, this degradation will be essentially imperceptible. Therefore, a good ND filter should be invisible to the naked eye; it should neither degrade your clarity nor alter the colors.</p><p> Sharpness is paramount. A poor filter can make your photo look soft or even blurry, and as I mentioned above, some filters leave a color tint on your photos. This can be corrected with standard editing software, but it can be a real annoyance, and it&#39;s not always easy to get great results.</p><p> Also, consider each filter&#39;s coating. Filters sometimes have multiple coating layers designed to reduce reflection and prevent scratches, which can make a big difference to the final image quality.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="filter-price"> Filter price</h3><p> Quality often comes with a cost, but that doesn&#39;t mean you have to break the bank to get a good ND filter. Your budget should play a significant role in your choice.</p><p> There <em>are</em> budget-friendly filters that offer good quality. These are sensible picks when you&#39;re just starting out. Just be cautious. Ultra-cheap options might disappoint you with poor optics or fragile construction.</p><p> On the other end of the scale, premium filters can set you back quite a bit. These are typically aimed at professionals or serious hobbyists. If you&#39;re in this for the long haul, consider these as a worthwhile investment.</p><p> It&#39;s all about balance. You want a filter that meets your quality requirements without going overboard on the price. Always check if the higher cost comes with benefits that you actually need. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-can-you-use-a-neutral-density-filter-for"> What can you use a neutral density filter for?</h2><p> Landscape photography is where ND filters truly shine; by allowing you to lower the shutter speed, an ND unit can transform a crashing wave or a rushing waterfall into a silky, ethereal flow of white. ND filters can also enhance skies by producing streaking clouds that add a dreamy quality to your images.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-210083" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/best-nd-filters-milford-lake.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="long exposure sunset with ND filter" class="wp-image-210083" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/best-nd-filters-milford-lake.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/best-nd-filters-milford-lake.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/best-nd-filters-milford-lake.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/best-nd-filters-milford-lake.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/best-nd-filters-milford-lake.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/best-nd-filters-milford-lake.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The setting sun combined with a 3-stop ND filter made it possible for me to shoot a long exposure and smooth out the surface of the water while capturing motion in the clouds.<br /> <span class="dPS-amended-link">Fuji X100F</span> | 23mm | f/16 | 30s | ISO 200</figcaption></figure></div><p> Street and cityscape photographers also find ND filters invaluable; they often use them to create compelling compositions of static buildings with blurred pedestrians and moving clouds. The contrast creates an intriguing snapshot of city life, and the result tends to be both artistic and breathtaking.</p><p> Finally, if you&#39;re into portrait photography or videography, ND filters can be a big help.

Can I use that instead of buying a separate ND filter?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> You can, of course, use the ND filter that is built into your camera, but these typically only block 2-3 stops of light. That&#39;s enough to do some experimenting, but you won&#39;t be able to get ultra-long exposures in broad daylight. For that, you will need a separate ND filter such as one of the options on this list.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1622046254607"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">When are the best times to use an ND filter?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> This is really a matter of personal preference, but I like to use ND filters to get smooth motion with water. Some people use them to remove moving objects when shooting static subjects, like a monument or a sculpture. Another great option is to use them when shooting portraits in bright light; you can then work with wider apertures without reaching the limit of your camera&#39;s shutter speed.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1622046416315"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Will an ND filter protect my lens?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> Yes, but that&#39;s not their primary purpose. If you want to shield your lens from dirt and scratches, look into a UV filter or a clear filter. You can then attach an ND filter on top, though image sharpness will decrease just a bit as a result.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1622046483990"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Do I have to shoot in RAW when using ND filters?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> No, but I do recommend it. Shooting in RAW makes it easy to adjust the exposure of your image, fix green or magenta color casts, and clean up spots from dust on the lens. The latter is usually not visible with larger apertures, but when shooting long exposures it&#39;s common to stop down your lens, which makes small imperfections on your lens easier to see in the final image.</p></div></div><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-nd-filters/">The 8 Best ND Filters You Can Buy in 2023</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com">Digital Photography School</a> .

It was a revelation! Here was a way to bring together my favorite images in a single frame. (So trust me: once you start, you won&#39;t be able to stop!)</p><p> Below, I share the exact method I use to create my own Photoshop collages. You&#39;ll find it&#39;s incredibly straightforward. And the best part? You don&#39;t need to be a Photoshop expert to get started. Simply follow my instructions carefully, and you&#39;ll end up with a result that looks like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-209028" style="width:994px"><span class="space" style="width:994px; padding-top:137.02%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="994" height="1362" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-1001-1.jpg?resize=994%2C1362&#038;ssl=1" alt="final collage" class="wp-image-209028" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-1001-1.jpg?w=994&amp;ssl=1 994w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-1001-1.jpg?resize=219%2C300&amp;ssl=1 219w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-1001-1.jpg?resize=438%2C600&amp;ssl=1 438w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-1001-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1052&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-1001-1.jpg?resize=717%2C982&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 994px) 100vw, 994px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="why-are-photoshop-collages-so-great"> Why are Photoshop collages so great?</h2><p> Before we delve into the step-by-step collage-making process, I&#39;d like to explain <em>why</em> you&#39;d want to create a collage in the first place.</p><p> For one, collages are incredibly versatile. You can use them to make just about any visual display look better Want to make your social media profile pop? A colorful collage could be your new Facebook header. I frequently use collages to give my own Facebook profile a personal touch.</p><p> But collages aren&#39;t just about looks. They can also tell a story in a way that a single photo can&#39;t. Think of a collage as a visual narrative that conveys a theme or captures a special moment. The best ones convey a message or create a real emotional impact.</p><p> Relatedly, think about special occasions – and how collages can do a great job of telling the story of an event. How perfect would a collage be for a wedding album? Imagine compiling the best moments from the big day into a single, awe-inspiring frame. Collages also make fantastic holiday gifts and cards. Picture your favorite memories from the year, printed and framed, gracing the walls of your family and friends.</p><p> Plus, as I emphasized above, making a collage in Photoshop is fast and easy. There&#39;s no need to spend hours fussing with complicated settings. You can craft something beautiful in a short amount of time. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-the-step-by-step-process"> How to make a Photoshop collage: the step-by-step process</h2><p> In this section, I take you through each step I use to create my collages – and I share clear examples along the way. It&#39;s an easy process, I promise! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="step-choose-your-collage-photos"> Step 1: Choose your collage photos</h3><p> Before you actually <em>create</em> the collage, you&#39;ll need to pick your collage photos – and you&#39;ll need to do this carefully.</p><p> I recommend selecting images connected by a theme (such as a location, an event, or even a concept). Include a mix of subjects at different scales; for instance, pick some wide shots that show the entire scene, as well as some detail photos that show lots of texture and personality. Without one or the other, the story won&#39;t be complete. And it won&#39;t carry the level of emotion that you&#39;re after.</p><p> Speaking of <a aria-label="storytelling (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/8-tips-storytelling-images/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">storytelling</a> : It often does help to focus on the story you&#39;re trying to tell. Do you want to offer a narrative surrounding an event? Do you want to clearly convey a meaningful concept? Make sure to take this into account when picking photos!</p><p> One more tip: If possible, include at least three photos and no more than eight. Too few photos, and you won&#39;t be able to tell the full story. Too many photos, and you&#39;ll confuse the viewer with clutter (plus, it&#39;ll be tough to show off individual details). </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="step-open-the-selected-images-in-photoshop"> Step 2: Open the selected images in Photoshop</h3><p> Once you&#39;ve picked your photos, open them all in Photoshop.</p><p> To do this, you can drag and drop files directly onto the document window, or you can select <strong>File>;Open</strong> and click on the relevant images.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-209030" style="width:570px"><span class="space" style="width:570px;

Include spooky or atmospheric Halloween props</h2><p> Halloween features plenty of objects, from pumpkins and costumes to skeletons, bats, and ghosts.</p><p> So <em>use</em> them. If you&#39;re doing a Halloween photoshoot, bring in a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/using-props-in-portraits-make-them-interesting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ek-link">prop or two</a> . Have the kids hold a ghost; have your spouse peek through a skeleton; have your pet wear a pumpkin costume and photograph them up close. You can work with scarier props (eg, fake blood), you can stick to cuter props (eg, pumpkins), or you can combine the two for cute <em>and</em> scary images.</p><p> This photo uses a creepy-looking jack-o&#39;-lantern to add plenty of atmosphere:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-136112" style="width:1200px"><span class="space" style="width:1200px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&#038;ssl=1" alt="person carrying jack-o'-lantern as a prop" class="wp-image-136112" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Sometimes, as with the image above, the props alone can make great photos. You can capture beautiful shots of Halloween gravestones, houses decked out in bats and ghosts, and more.</p><p> Don&#39;t just take snapshots, though. Make sure you pay careful attention to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/composition-in-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="composition (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">composition</a> (see the tips below) and lighting (again, see my additional tips), and do what you can to tell an interesting story with your camera. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="highlight-a-relevant-point-of-interest"> 2. Highlight a relevant point of interest</h2><p> If you&#39;re after great Halloween photography – spooky, cute, or anything in between – you should generally include a focal point, some key “hero” element that the viewer immediately prioritizes.</p><p> For instance, if you&#39;re photographing your child in their costume, make them the center of attention. Ensure you&#39;re working with a clean background (with no distractions whatsoever!) and a bare foreground. Adjust your camera settings to make your child&#39;s face sharp and well-exposed.</p><p> Of course, you can always include secondary subjects or items in a photo. But they shouldn&#39;t be the priority, and as soon as they begin to distract from the main subject, you should exclude them from your compositions.</p><p> Check out this next spooky Halloween photo; the woman is the main subject, and the wine glass acts as a secondary subject:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-136113" style="width:1200px"><span class="space" style="width:1200px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-1-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&#038;ssl=1" alt="spooky witch photoshoot idea" class="wp-image-136113" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-1-1.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-1-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-1-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-1-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-1-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The background is relatively clean, there are no distractions, and the viewer&#39;s eye travels straight to the woman&#39;s face, to the cup, and back. The image is also wonderfully Halloween-esque; check out the dark background, orange colors, and wonderfully scary atmosphere!</p><p> Bottom line:</p><p> Before hitting the shutter, ask yourself, “What is the focal point of this photo?” And do everything in your power to emphasize it.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="find-the-right-location">3. Find the right location</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-243776" style="width:480px"><span class="space" style="width:480px; padding-top:125%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="480" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/halloween-photography-104.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Trees in misty forest" class="wp-image-243776" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/halloween-photography-104.jpg?resize=480%2C600&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/halloween-photography-104.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/halloween-photography-104.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/halloween-photography-104.jpg?resize=717%2C896&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/halloween-photography-104.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> While you can technically do Halloween photography <em>anywhere</em> , it often pays to find a location that matches the mood you want to create.</p><p> If you want to capture cute Halloween photos, for example, consider shooting:</p><ul><li> Among the leaves in your backyard</li><li> In your kitchen</li><li> At a Halloween party</li></ul><p> If you want to capture scary Halloween photos, try shooting:</p><ul><li> In a basement</li><li> In the middle of a forest</li><li> In a neighborhood at night</li></ul><p> (Of course, you should always make safety a priority; never put yourself in an uncomfortable situation simply to capture a scary photo.)</p><p> When planning a Halloween photoshoot, I encourage you to sit down and consider different location ideas. I&#39;m betting you&#39;ll come up with plenty of places to take Halloween pictures nearby – you simply need to do a bit of brainstorming! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="fill-the-frame-with-halloween-spirit"> 4. Fill the frame with Halloween spirit</h2><p> Halloween is a time of drama. And you can convey this in your images by getting in nice and close so that you fill the frame with your subjects.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-221890" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-2-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="skeleton on Halloween" class="wp-image-221890" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-2-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-2-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-2-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-2-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-2-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you&#39;re photographing your child in a costume, make sure there are no boring, empty edges around the frame. Instead, zoom on in (or get in close) so every little detail is captured by your camera.</p><p> No need to go overboard, though. Don&#39;t go in so far that your lens can&#39;t focus, and don&#39;t get so close that the viewer doesn&#39;t understand what the photo is about, either. Instead, identify your subject (see the previous tip!), make it the center of attention, and zoom on in.</p><p> One more thing: If your main subject doesn&#39;t look Halloween-esque enough, consider spicing them up with additional decorations, costumes, trinkets, and the like. More Halloween is usually better! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="give-subjects-space-to-look-into"> 5. Give subjects space to look into</h2><p> Here&#39;s a quick Halloween portrait photography tip that&#39;ll ensure better compositions:</p><p> Before you take your images, note the direction of your subject&#39;s face and eyes. Then adjust your camera framing until the subject has substantial room in front of their line of sight.</p><p> It might seem weird, but it actually helps balance out the composition. It also adds a sense of dynamism, where the viewer is compelled to follow the subject&#39;s gaze throughout the shot. (In fact, the approach even has a name: the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-space-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ek-link">rule of space</a> .)</p><p> Here&#39;s a nice example:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-136115" style="width:1200px"><span class="space" style="width:1200px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&#038;ssl=1" alt="kids carving pumpkins" class="wp-image-136115" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-2.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The two boys are looking downward, and the framing includes plenty of room near the bottom of the scene (note how their eyes have lots of space to look into!). </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="find-unconventional-angles-and-foregrounds-to-add-spookiness"> 6. Find unconventional angles and foregrounds to add spookiness</h2><p> Looking to do some spooky Halloween photography? Pay careful attention to this next tip.</p><p> You see, a great way to create that sense of holiday chill is via <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/perspective-photography-dont-just-stand-move-feet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ek-link">perspective</a> . By getting down low – down in the dirt, in fact! – you&#39;ll make your subject loom large over the viewer. The effect is especially powerful if you shoot with a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/7-ways-to-get-more-out-of-a-wide-angle-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="wide-angle lens (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">wide-angle lens</a> .</p><p> Of course, you&#39;ll also want to include scary props, such as bats, cauldrons, and ghosts. That way, you can create a creepy Halloween image, with your subjects appearing to emerge from the ground and stand high above the viewer.</p><p> Another quick tip:</p><p> Try backing up to put an interesting foreground element in front of your subject. You don&#39;t want to add anything distracting, of course. But a dark branch or two in front of the subject can do a lot to enhance the atmosphere. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photograph-the-little-details"> 7. Photograph the little details</h2><p> It&#39;s easy to get distracted by the flashy parts of Halloween. But it&#39;s often when you take a step back, look around, and notice the smaller details that you&#39;ll find the money shots.</p><p> Halloween is <em>filled</em> with interesting little moments worthy of capture. There are:</p><ul><li> Decorations</li><li> Pumpkin-carving fun</li><li> Actual carved pumpkins</li><li> People getting dressed up in costumes</li><li> Lots of candy at the end of the night</li><li> Sleeping kids at the end of parties and/or trick-or-treating</li><li> Close-ups of food</li></ul><p> Don&#39;t let these moments pass you by. Instead, keep an eye out – and when you see a memory worth recording, do it. A few years from now, these intimate images will tell the real story of Halloween, and you&#39;ll be so glad you captured them.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-221897" style="width:418px"><span class="space" style="width:418px; padding-top:143.54%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="418" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-3-2.jpg?resize=418%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Happy Halloween cookie" class="wp-image-221897" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-3-2.jpg?resize=418%2C600&amp;ssl=1 418w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-3-2.jpg?resize=209%2C300&amp;ssl=1 209w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-3-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1102&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-3-2.jpg?resize=717%2C1029&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-3-2.jpg?w=1045&amp;ssl=1 1045w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-forget-the-group-photos"> 8.

You simply need to use a low-light <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-photograph-silhouettes/" target="_blank" aria-label="silhouette technique (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">silhouette technique</a> , which will get you images like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-136116" style="width:1200px"><span class="space" style="width:1200px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="1200" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-3.jpg?resize=1200%2C1200&#038;ssl=1" alt="silhouette of a cat" class="wp-image-136116" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-3.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-3.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-3.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-3.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-3.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-3.jpg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-3.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Here&#39;s how it works:</p><p> First, find a subject that makes a good silhouette. It should have clearly defined edges and should ideally be recognizable, like the cat in the photo above.</p><p> Then wait until the sun has gone down and you have an orange, red, or yellow sky. Position yourself between the subject and the sunset, then crouch low until the subject is framed against the beautiful background.</p><p> You&#39;ll want to keep your flash deactivated, and I recommend underexposing the image for a darker effect. Here are two ways you can do it:</p><ul><li> Increase your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> , taking test shots as you go. You&#39;ll probably want to start around 1/100s, depending on the level of darkness, then increase to 1/250s, 1/500s, and beyond. (Remember: Review each image immediately after hitting the shutter button!)</li><li> Narrow your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> (again, take plenty of test shots along the way). This will darken your photo, but it will also increase the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> , consequently sharpening the background, which can be good or bad, depending on your goals.</li></ul><p> Anyway, the idea is to get a relatively dark, moody image, so don&#39;t worry about the shot looking too underexposed. Simply aim for a little bit of silhouette detail with a medium-bright background, and the results will look great. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-flash-gels-for-atmospheric-halloween-photography"> 10. Use flash gels for atmospheric Halloween photography</h2><p> Here&#39;s a clever Halloween photography idea that past readers have suggested:</p><p> Find some sort of colored cellophane (orange, yellow, and red all work well), then place it over your flash. When you take a shot, the cellophane will act as a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/colored-gels-creative-off-camera-flash-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ek-link">flash gel</a> , changing the light color for a beautiful effect.</p><p> (If you can&#39;t find colored cellophane, just draw on clear cellophane with an orange marker!)</p><p> If you have a planned Halloween photoshoot, you&#39;ll probably want to test this one ahead of time because you need to carefully apply the right density of cellophane (one sheet versus two or three, etc.). But when done right, the effect is absolutely marvelous and makes for some amazing Halloween photos.</p><p> By the way, it doesn&#39;t matter if you have a camera pop-up flash, a handheld off-camera flash, or a full studio setup. You can use this tip no matter your equipment; you&#39;re bound to get gorgeous results! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photograph-the-jack-o-lanterns-too"> 11. Photograph the jack-o&#39;-lanterns, too!</h2><p> Jack-o&#39;-lanterns are Halloween classics, and there&#39;s nothing quite so satisfying as capturing a beautiful shot of a glowing pumpkin. So make sure to spend a little time with your camera pointed at a jack-o&#39;-lantern or two!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-221894" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-1-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="jack-o'-lanterns glowing at night" class="wp-image-221894" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-1-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-1-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-1-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-1-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-1-2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/halloween-photography-tips-1-2.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Now, photographing jack-o&#39;-lanterns can be tricky, because you need to capture both the pumpkin exterior and the interior glow, which is a bit of a tightrope walk between overexposure and underexposure. If you can, take a few photos with varying shutter speeds. And consider <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/bracketing-what-is-it-and-what-to-do-with-the-images/" target="_blank" aria-label="bracketing your exposures (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">bracketing your exposures</a> and blending using <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/getting-real-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ek-link">high dynamic range techniques</a> in post-processing.</p><p> (If you <em>do</em> decide to use an HDR technique, I encourage you to mount your camera on a tripod; it&#39;ll make the blending process far easier.) </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-some-levitation-photography"> 12.

Capture a photo with your subject in a spooky pose. Then remove the stool, have your subject stand off to the side, and capture a second (stool-free) image featuring only the background.
