It&#39;ll support your camera just a few inches from the ground, thus offering some protection from water splashes or sand/mud while also allowing easy movement in all directions. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-45076 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-45076" style="width:550px"><span class="space" style="width:550px; padding-top:66.18%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="550" height="364" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Ground-Pod-Photo-2.jpg?resize=550%2C364&#038;ssl=1" alt="A completed DIY ground pod" class="wp-image-45076" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Ground-Pod-Photo-2.jpg?w=550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Ground-Pod-Photo-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Ground-Pod-Photo-2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Ground-Pod-Photo-2.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> My completed ground pod.

Therefore, I decided to make my own!</p><p> I&#39;m certainly not the first person to do this, but I wanted to share how it is done to illustrate how easy it is to make your own low-level camera support.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-materials">材料</h3><p>As I said above, materials for a DIY ground pod shouldn&#39;t cost you much at all.你会需要：</p><ol><li> <strong>A cheap frying pan</strong> , approx 10-12 inches in diameter. You can choose whatever diameter frying pan suits you, but a wider pan will offer more support, especially if you use a bulkier telephoto lens. The pan should be approximately 1-1.5 inches deep – any deeper will make adjusting your tripod head more awkward, but any shallower will offer less protection from water splashes, mud, and sand.</li><li> <strong>A 3/8” socket head bolt</strong> , approx 0.5 inches in length. A round-headed or truss-headed bolt is preferable. If the pan is thick enough, a countersunk head is ideal; however cheap pans are normally too thin to make this practical. Note: Imperial-sized bolts are difficult to come by in some international hardware stores, so if you&#39;re located outside the US, this might involve some internet searching.</li><li> <strong>A tripod head</strong> . This is technically optional. You can attach your camera directly to the ground pod, but it&#39;ll limit your shooting motions, and you may also run into issues when trying to ensure your lens clears the pad lip. Therefore, I like to use a tripod head (and I&#39;m writing this article with the use of a tripod head in mind). If you don&#39;t already have a tripod head, a cheap ball head can be found on eBay and will be a good compromise between size and flexibility. You don&#39;t want anything too tall (it&#39;ll defeat the point of trying to get so low), and you also don&#39;t want anything with ultra-wide levers (it&#39;ll be an awkward fit inside the pan). If you don&#39;t have a tripod head to use and you don&#39;t want to buy one, you could try using a couple of blocks of wood to act as a riser to ensure the lens clears the edge of the pan). I&#39;ll also point out that the price for commercially available ball heads that I mentioned above (around $100) does <em>not</em> include a tripod head, so even if you choose to go the non-DIY route, you&#39;ll still need to source a头。</li><li> <strong>A power drill</strong> to make a hole large enough for the 3/8” bolt.</li><li> <strong>A hex key/Allen key</strong> of the same size as the socket in the hex bolt.</li><li> <strong>A wing nut</strong> to screw onto the bolt when the pan is not in use so you do not lose the bolt. Any kind of nut will work, but a wing nut is large enough to be difficult to lose and easy to use with cold hands! </li></ol><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="making-the-ground-pod"> Making the ground pod </h3><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-45027 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-45027" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:49.83%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="299" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/groundpod_1.jpg?resize=600%2C299&#038;ssl=1" alt="Ground pod image 1" class="wp-image-45027" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/groundpod_1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/groundpod_1.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Left: My frying pan with the handle removed, showing the riveted bracket. Right: A 3/8″ hex bolt.</figcaption></figure></div><p> The construction of the pod is very simple:</p><ol><li> First, remove the handle from the frying pan. It should be easy to unscrew from the pan, and removing it will make the pan a less awkward shape to store. You may well be left with a small, riveted bracket that the handle was screwed to (see my image above!); however, this is a convenient little place to hook the frying pan onto your camera bag using a carabiner so you don&#39;t have to carry it around by hand.</li><li> Next, turn the pan upside down, and use the power drill to make a hole in the pan&#39;s center. Don&#39;t apply too much downward force when drilling; otherwise, you&#39;ll end up deforming the center of the pan, meaning your tripod head will not fit flush to the pan base.</li><li> Once the hole is drilled, turn the pan back around, and use the hex key to screw the bolt through the pan and into your tripod head.</li></ol><p> And that is it!简单的。</p><p> Just make sure that the pan actually supports your camera and lens <em>without</em> toppling over before putting it to use. If you chose a wide enough pan, this should not be a problem, but test your camera with all your wildlife photography lenses to be safe. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="capture-some-low-angle-wildlife-photos"> Capture some low-angle wildlife photos!</h2><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-259600" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="998" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DIY-ground-pod-photography-3.jpg?resize=1500%2C998&#038;ssl=1" alt="Low-angle sanderling" class="wp-image-259600" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DIY-ground-pod-photography-3.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DIY-ground-pod-photography-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DIY-ground-pod-photography-3.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DIY-ground-pod-photography-3.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DIY-ground-pod-photography-3.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DIY-ground-pod-photography-3.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@rayhennessy?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">Ray Hennessy</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/selective-focus-photography-of-brown-bird-walking-on-shore-BR2rEWcQQJQ?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div><p> Well, there you have it!

Should you trust it when shooting in the field, or should you work with a different setting instead, even if it takes more effort?</p><p> That&#39;s what I aim to answer in this article.

Your eyes are much better at processing color than a digital camera. Thus, a white object will always appear white to you – whereas a white object in different types of light will <em>not</em> always look white to your camera, resulting in unnatural color casts.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-259582" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:70%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1050" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/auto-white-balance-photography-100.jpg?resize=1500%2C1050&#038;ssl=1" alt="Auto White Balance" class="wp-image-259582" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/auto-white-balance-photography-100.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/auto-white-balance-photography-100.jpg?resize=300%2C210&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/auto-white-balance-photography-100.jpg?resize=600%2C420&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/auto-white-balance-photography-100.jpg?resize=768%2C538&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/auto-white-balance-photography-100.jpg?resize=717%2C502&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Objects look different depending on the lighting! Certain types of light produce warm color casts, while others produce cooler color casts. White balancing is all about handling these color casts to keep your photos looking natural.</figcaption></figure></div><p> (These color casts generally exist along a blue-yellow spectrum in nature, though artificial lights can also create green and purple casts.)</p><p> Now, white balance is the process that the camera uses to remove these problematic color casts. When you set your camera to a white balance setting, you&#39;re ensuring that it effectively counteracts unnatural temperatures and tints – so that your images more closely reflect what you see with your eyes. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-is-auto-white-balance-awb"> What is Auto White Balance (AWB)?</h2><p> Auto White Balance (AWB) is a camera setting that tells your camera to “guess” the best white balance option. In other words, when you set your camera to AWB, it analyzes the scene and tries to pick a white balance that&#39;ll make your photos look natural.</p><p> (This is analogous to your camera&#39;s automatic exposure settings, where your camera tries to determine the ideal aperture, shutter speed, and ISO values to create a tonally detailed image.)</p><p> In my experience, Auto White Balance can work, but it&#39;s often much more effective when you&#39;re outdoors dealing with natural lighting, and it tends to struggle when you&#39;re dealing with complex lighting situations. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-129488 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-129488" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Drive_AWB.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Auto White Balance: Yay or Nay?" class="wp-image-129488" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Drive_AWB.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Drive_AWB.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Drive_AWB.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Drive_AWB.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Drive_AWB.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Auto White Balance sometimes gives close results to what you see with your eyes.

These can vary depending on the camera brand, but they generally include Daylight, Cloudy, Shade, Tungsten, and Fluorescent. Added to these are Flash, Kelvin, and Custom White Balance.</p><p> Note: The <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/setting-your-white-balance-with-a-gray-card-a-tip-from-phil-steele/" class="ek-link">Custom White Balance mode</a> should be used when you have especially challenging lighting conditions and need to nail the white balance perfectly. It lets you point your camera at a neutral portion of the image, then creates a custom white balance effect that counteracts any color cast in the scene. It is an underused option that gives great results, so check your manual and experiment with it sometime. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-129487 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-129487" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Arches__AWB.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Auto White Balance: Yay or Nay?" class="wp-image-129487" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Arches__AWB.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Arches__AWB.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Arches__AWB.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Arches__AWB.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Arches__AWB.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> I used my camera&#39;s AWB setting to capture this image of Delicate Arch in Utah. </figcaption></figure></div><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-129486 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-129486" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Arches__.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Auto White Balance: Yay or Nay?" class="wp-image-129486" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Arches__.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Arches__.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Arches__.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Arches__.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Arches__.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Then I edited the image by applying a custom white balance effect.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Now, the Auto White Balance setting assesses your scene and chooses the brightest part of your image as the white point.

For this reason, it&#39;s a bad idea to use Auto White Balance when shooting panoramas; if your camera changes the white balance in the middle of your panorama series, the results will look very strange! </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-129490 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-129490" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:24%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="180" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Boats_Pano_DaylightWB.jpg?resize=750%2C180&#038;ssl=1" alt="Auto White Balance: Yay or Nay?" class="wp-image-129490" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Boats_Pano_DaylightWB.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Boats_Pano_DaylightWB.jpg?resize=300%2C72&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Boats_Pano_DaylightWB.jpg?resize=600%2C144&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Boats_Pano_DaylightWB.jpg?resize=717%2C172&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> I photographed this panorama using a Custom WB. If you use AWB to capture a panorama, the white balance can vary from shot to shot.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Auto White Balance comes with another issue: Your camera can lock onto an area of the shot that&#39;s <em>not</em> meant to be neutral (eg, a yellow wall), and then try to balance it. When this happens, instead of neutralizing the color casts, your camera will create some of its own!</p><p> Here&#39;s the good news: While Auto White Balance isn&#39;t perfect, significant improvements have been made to AWB systems, and the results are getting better. Still, it&#39;s difficult for Auto White Balance to handle certain kinds of lighting (eg, artificial or combination lighting setups).</p><p> It&#39;s also worth mentioning that you can sometimes run into a different problem, where AWB removes color casts you wanted to keep. This can happen when you&#39;re shooting a sunset, or any scene where the color of the light is essential to the image.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="raw-power">原始力量</h2><p>If you shoot in RAW, you are probably aware that RAW files retain all the color data captured by your camera. This retention comes with a huge benefit: It allows you to change or choose a different white balance setting while post-processing your RAW files.</p><p> For this reason, many photographers argue that, as long as you shoot in RAW, you can use Auto White Balance without issue. (Though others argue that even when shooting in RAW, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-auto-white-balance-can-hinder-your-photography/" class="ek-link">AWB does not give you the best colors</a> .) </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-129495 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-129495" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:68.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="516" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ShotvsPS_WB.jpg?resize=750%2C516&#038;ssl=1" alt="Auto White Balance: Yay or Nay?" class="wp-image-129495" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ShotvsPS_WB.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ShotvsPS_WB.jpg?resize=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ShotvsPS_WB.jpg?resize=600%2C413&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ShotvsPS_WB.jpg?resize=717%2C493&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Shot with Daylight WB (camera) vs processed Daylight WB (Photoshop). The two results aren&#39;t the same!</figcaption></figure></div><p> Even if we grant that RAW files can be effectively white balanced during post-processing, I still don&#39;t think you should use it all the time.</p><p> Setting the white balance in-camera ensures that color rendition is consistent across all your shots (eg when <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/overcome-difficult-lighting-weddings/">shooting a wedding</a> ), and it makes post-processing a lot easier, especially if you have a lot of files to edit.</p><p> Also, AWB can give you different results even when photographing the same scene. If you&#39;re using a zoom lens, you might end up with one set of colors in your wide-angle shot – and then, when you zoom for a telephoto close-up, you end up with a different set of colors. Sure, you can correct everything when post-processing the files, but it&#39;s often easier to just get the white balance right from the start. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="take-control-of-your-cameras-white-balance-settings"> Take control of your camera&#39;s white balance settings!</h2><p> You may want to use Auto White Balance because it is easier to let the camera figure out the right settings based on the scene in front of you. However, as I explained above, this isn&#39;t always the best approach. Sometimes, you can save yourself a lot of frustration later on by nailing the white balance in the field. (And if you&#39;re ever shooting JPEGs, you definitely want to make sure you get the white balance right; they don&#39;t offer the same flexibility as RAWs.)</p><p> Fortunately, setting white balance is not as daunting as it sounds. And when the lighting conditions are unchanging, you only need to set your white balance once (for those conditions). Here are a few quick recommendations:</p><p> If you are outdoors on a sunny day, set your white balance to Daylight or Sunny. If it is cloudy, choose the Cloudy white balance. Similarly if you are in shade, choose Shade. These are very easy to remember based on their names!</p><p> When indoors, choose Tungsten (or Incandescent) for incandescent lights. And when shooting an area with fluorescent lights, choose Fluorescent.</p><p> This is simply setting your white balance to match your shooting conditions.</p><p> You can also set your white balance to modify your existing conditions. Once you start experimenting with white balance and understand how it <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/guide-creative-white-balance-landscape-photography/">affects your images</a> , you can use it to get creative and make your shots look warmer or cooler. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-129491 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-129491" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="501" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Miser_Flourescent.jpg?resize=750%2C501&#038;ssl=1" alt="Auto White Balance: Yay or Nay?" class="wp-image-129491" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Miser_Flourescent.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Miser_Flourescent.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Miser_Flourescent.jpg?resize=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Miser_Flourescent.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Miser_Flourescent.jpg?resize=717%2C479&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Here, I deliberately adjusted the white balance to make the image look cooler.</figcaption></figure></div><p> As long as you shoot in RAW, you can always make adjustments in Lightroom, Capture One, or another editor.

If you shoot in <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-landscape-images-raw/">RAW</a> , you can easily change your White Balance after the fact to find the best option. AWB can also be useful when you&#39;re photographing in rapidly changing lighting conditions, or if you simply don&#39;t mind carefully adjusting the white balance when post-processing your photos.</p><p> However, if you want more control of your results, choose one of the camera white balance presets, already tailored for specific conditions, or use Custom White Balance to customize the setting for your specific scene. Setting your white balance in the field will eliminate that extra post-processing step of fixing it from scene to scene and give you more consistent results.</p><p> What is your go-to white balance?

However, in my experience, the absolute <em>best</em> best way to get amazing macro photos with your phone is to invest in an inexpensive lens (or set of lenses) that clip over your phone camera.</p><p> When I first explored phone macro photography, I purchased the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?fst=as:off&amp;rh=n:15124502011,k:olloclip+4-in-1+photo+lens,p_89:Olloclip&amp;keywords=olloclip+4-in-1+photo+lens&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477009568&amp;rnid=2941120011&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=dpstester-20&amp;linkId=af4be715acce328d2a821aaefe9ccb3b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenersponsored nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="ek-link">Olloclip 4-in-1 set</a> , which included several clip-on lenses, including two macro models: a 10x and a 15x.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-259560" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:60%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="900" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mobile-phone-macro-photography-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C900&#038;ssl=1" alt="Mobile phone lens for macro photography" class="wp-image-259560" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mobile-phone-macro-photography-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mobile-phone-macro-photography-1.jpg?resize=300%2C180&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mobile-phone-macro-photography-1.jpg?resize=600%2C360&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mobile-phone-macro-photography-1.jpg?resize=768%2C461&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mobile-phone-macro-photography-1.jpg?resize=717%2C430&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Phone macro lenses are tiny, so they&#39;re easy to carry around. They&#39;re also inexpensive (compared to a conventional macro lens, at least!).</figcaption></figure></div><p> I quickly discovered the 10x macro lens was my personal favorite since it suited most of my subjects. So I also got the Olloclip Macro 3-in-1 set, which has lenses offering 7x, 14x, and 21x magnification, as well as a couple of special hoods that diffuse the lighting and make getting a good shot a bit easier.</p><p> Over time, I&#39;ve discovered that the 7x lens is my go-to for nearly all of my macro photos since it can capture a large enough area while still getting lots of detail. You might feel differently, so invest in a few different clip-on lenses for your smartphone, then experiment with different magnifications until you find one that you love!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-259569" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-7.jpeg?resize=750%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="Smartphone macro photography" class="wp-image-259569" title="prairie.jpg" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-7.jpeg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-7.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-7.jpeg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-7.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-7.jpeg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-7.jpeg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Unfortunately, Olloclip has paused its operations, so finding these lenses has become tougher. If you specifically want to purchase Olloclip products, you can look around on Amazon or eBay – though there are plenty of other great phone macro lenses available on Amazon. (You also have to be mindful of phone compatibility; since Olloclip no longer makes its products, some of the more recent phone models might not work well with older Olloclip macro lenses.)</p><p> Anyway, there are definitely other brands and magnifications available, but make sure that the lens you buy fits with your phone and won&#39;t get in the way of taking photos. Note that most lenses slip over your phone, so you cannot typically use them with a phone case. Some companies offer special cases with openings around the camera area for easy access, though certain mobile macro accessories will need to be used without a case.</p><p> You never know when you might come across a great macro subject, so I&#39;d suggest taking your lenses with you (they fit in a pocket), especially when you go outside. This is a good habit to get into, and when you&#39;re just starting out, it&#39;ll let you experiment with different subjects.</p><p> (A garden or another area with flowers or insects is a great place to try out your new lens. Or, if it&#39;s winter, you can use your lens as an excuse to buy a bouquet of flowers!)</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-259566" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:75.07%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="563" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-4.jpeg?resize=750%2C563&#038;ssl=1" alt="Smartphone macro photography" class="wp-image-259566" title="花园.jpg" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-4.jpeg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-4.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-4.jpeg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-4.jpeg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="get-your-lighting-right"> Get your lighting right</h2><p> As with all forms of photography, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/lighting-for-macro-photography/" class="ek-link">lighting is critically important for taking good macro pictures</a> .

When you get close to your subject using a macro lens, the background light will often turn into a lovely addition to your photos in the form of bokeh, or out-of-focus areas that make your pictures appear to glow:</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-259572" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-10.jpeg?resize=750%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="Smartphone macro photography" class="wp-image-259572" title="bokeh.jpg" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-10.jpeg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-10.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-10.jpeg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-10.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-10.jpeg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-10.jpeg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> These flowers looked nice on their own – but thanks to some beautiful background light, my phone camera managed to create something spectacular! </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="carefully-focus-and-frame-your-macro-shots"> Carefully focus and frame your macro shots</h2><p> With macro photos, there are endless ways to frame your subject, but you will have a very limited depth of field to work with (ie, the area of the photo that will remain in focus).</p><p> I generally want the subject to remain (mostly) in focus, but the extent of the depth of field depends on the lens magnification. The larger the magnification, the smaller the area of exact focus in your pictures.

One consequence is that your intended subject can be too large to capture in its entirety, even with a lower-magnification macro lens (eg, the 7x Olloclip).</p><p> You may have to focus on a part of the subject – the center of the flower or a few petals, for instance. That&#39;s the fun part of macro photography! You can shoot the subject from directly above, from the side, or even from below.

Even slight movement while shooting will result in blurriness. You will need to remain very still, and you&#39;ll also need to do everything you can to keep your subject from moving.</p><p> A tripod for your phone can help, but it isn&#39;t necessary. Just find a position that&#39;s comfortable, stay as still as possible, and steady your phone with two hands.</p><p> Sometimes, like on a breezy day, it&#39;s impossible to keep your subject in one place. You can sometimes hold your subject still (eg, when shooting flowers), but other times you can&#39;t (eg, when shooting insects). One helpful tip for these situations is to use the burst mode on your phone&#39;s camera, which takes many shots in rapid succession.</p><p> On an iPhone, you can hold down the camera button on the side of the phone or on-screen to shoot multiple photos very quickly. Android phones usually have a way to do this, too. If you don&#39;t have built-in burst most, just take many photos while staying as still as possible. It&#39;s how I get most of my insect photos: by being patient, and by taking many shots. I weed out the blurry photos later.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-259575" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-13.jpeg?resize=750%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="Smartphone macro photography" class="wp-image-259575" title="beebalm.jpg" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-13.jpeg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-13.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-13.jpeg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-13.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-13.jpeg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-13.jpeg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="enhance-your-images-with-editing"> Enhance your images with editing</h2><p> Once you capture a nice macro photo on your phone, you can share it directly on social media. But a little bit of editing can go a long way! To get that polished look, I encourage you to spend a couple minutes post-processing your phone shot before sharing.</p><p> Since many people who use their phones for macro photography share them on Instagram, I&#39;ll focus on the Instagram app in my discussion. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="you-dont-need-to-use-instagrams-filters-to-make-great-macro-photos"> 1. You don&#39;t need to use Instagram&#39;s filters to make great macro photos</h3><p> Instagram&#39;s filters are often too heavy-handed for my tastes; while they might look cool at first, the result is rarely very natural.</p><p> So instead of using filters, try adjusting the color or warmth of your image just <em>slightly</em> to make your photos look more like real life.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="turn-up-the-lux"> 2.

I&#39;ve used the effect on my sample image above to create this result:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-259567" style="width:338px"><span class="space" style="width:338px; padding-top:177.51%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="338" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-5.jpeg?resize=338%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Smartphone macro photography" class="wp-image-259567" title="lux.jpg" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-5.jpeg?w=338&amp;ssl=1 338w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-5.jpeg?resize=169%2C300&amp;ssl=1 169w" sizes="(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Note how my slight adjustment gave the petals greater three-dimensionality!</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="add-a-little-sharpening">3.

If you&#39;ve been shooting professionally for any period of time, you already know (I hope) that securing a model release from the people you photograph is absolutely essential.</p><p> What you may not be aware of, however, is <em>why</em> it is so important. It is an unfortunate reality that most people neither completely read nor understand the legal documents they sign or have prepared for them. You may have an iron-clad model release in your bag of tricks, but you may not understand what exactly it&#39;s releasing or the significance of the language.</p><p> Having a fuller understanding of the basics will help you greatly in the long run, particularly when assessing whether you even need a model release, and convincing your subject to sign one if you do. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-is-a-model-release-and-why-is-it-important"> What is a model release, and why is it important?</h2><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/001-model-release.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-58477"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-58477" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:63.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="382" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/001-model-release.jpg?resize=600%2C382&#038;ssl=1" alt="A sample model release" class="wp-image-58477" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/001-model-release.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/001-model-release.jpg?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Model releases are an essential part of the business of photography, and if you don&#39;t understand exactly what you&#39;re working with, it could come back to haunt you.</figcaption></figure></div><p> At its most basic, a model release is a contract: a written and signed agreement between you and the person you are photographing.</p><p> The purpose of a model release is to protect – ie, release – you from liability in future lawsuits that your subject/model might file against you for legal claims like invasion of privacy, defamation of character, etc.</p><p> The document stipulates the terms under which one party may use photos taken of another party. Model releases are usually brief – no more than a paragraph – but they can get quite long, especially if the model wants to add additional conditions to the release (eg, no Photoshop).</p><p> We&#39;ll get into the specific contents of the model release in a bit. For now, though, know that a model release is a crucial piece of paper for any photograph that&#39;s used commercially. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-do-i-know-if-i-need-a-model-release"> How do I know if I need a model release?</h2><p> Not all photoshoots that include people require model releases, so it&#39;s important to start by understanding whether a release is necessary for the type of photography you&#39;ll be doing.</p><p> You should always start with a basic premise:</p><p> Whether you need a model release does <em>not</em> primarily depend on the content of the image. Rather, it depends on the image&#39;s <em>use</em> .</p><p> When you start with this premise – that the need is primarily dictated by the use and not the content – you are left with a pretty basic set of questions: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="question-will-the-photo-be-used-commercially"> Question 1: Will the photo be used commercially?</h3><p> The first question you should ask when determining the importance of a model release is “Will this photo be used commercially?” If the answer is “Yes,” you need a model release. If the answer is “No,” you do not need a model release.很简单，对吧？不完全的！ （继续阅读。）</p><p> Just because an image is published does not, in and of itself, automatically mean that the use is commercial. For instance, work that will only appear in newspapers, educational books, and consumer or trade publications does not need a model release because it is editorial use, sometimes referred to as “fair use.”</p><p> Commercial usage, on the other hand, can include advertisements, brochures, web use, greeting cards, catalogs, newsletters, etc. For commercial, licensed use, you absolutely, positively <em>must</em> have a model release.</p><p> What is and isn&#39;t commercial use can sometimes be confusing. Assume that you have taken a photo of a popular local chef, but you haven&#39;t obtained a signed model release. Your friend is the publisher of a local newspaper and he pays you for the photograph for use in an article they are running about the restaurant. Because the photo is being used as part of a news story, this constitutes editorial use. The fact that money changed hands does not automatically render it a commercially used photograph, and the lack of a model release isn&#39;t a problem.</p><p> If, however, the restaurant&#39;s PR agency wants to use the same photo as part of an ad campaign, you will need a model release. Remember, whether a model release is necessary depends on the use, not the content – here, we&#39;re talking about the same photo, but with two different uses. One needs the release and one does not. Ultimately, there is no way of knowing whether you need a model release until you can answer the question of <em>how the photo will be used</em> .</p><p> The examples below illustrate the importance of the intended use when determining whether you need a model release. The protest image (on the left) was taken as part of a news story about cuts to the state budget for publicly funded art programs. It was editorial use, and therefore no model release was required. The chess game photo (top right) was for a commercial publication on local tourism. It required a model release for its original use, though it does <em>not</em> require a model release for its editorial publication here on dPS. The crowd shot at the bottom appeared in a news article about public education, which, as you now know, requires no model release.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/002-model-release-examples1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-58471"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-58471" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:71.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="429" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/002-model-release-examples1.jpg?resize=600%2C429&#038;ssl=1" alt="The intended use determines whether you need a model release." class="wp-image-58471" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/002-model-release-examples1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/002-model-release-examples1.jpg?resize=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The intended use determines whether you need a model release!

But just like the shifting boundaries mentioned above, what does and does not constitute “uniquely identifiable” is not always cut and dry. Remember, there are ways to identify or recognize someone in a photo other than just their face. Sometimes a silhouette, a tattoo, a uniform, or even a location can identify a person without necessarily showing their face – and in those situations, you&#39;ll still need a model release.</p><p> At first glance, the three photos below appear to have no recognizable subjects, which might lead you to think that model releases wouldn&#39;t be necessary, regardless of whether the image use was commercial or editorial.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/003-model-release-examples2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-58472"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-58472" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:71.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="429" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/003-model-release-examples2.jpg?resize=600%2C429&#038;ssl=1" alt="Are your subjects identifiable?

As far as the Parkview High School students (the top image) are concerned, let&#39;s face it: parents and friends can identify each student easily, body paint, wigs, and sunglasses notwithstanding.</p><p> Tattoos (bottom left) are also fairly distinctive, rendering it a moot point that you can&#39;t see the tattoo artist&#39;s face in the photograph. The ink on her arms could be enough for someone to recognize her.</p><p> Finally, the artist in the park can theoretically be recognized, not because of anything distinctive about her from this angle, but because of the distinctive nature of her painting.</p><p> In other words, all three of the example images will require a model release, plain and simple (assuming they&#39;re going to be used commercially). </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="question-how-and-where-was-the-photo-taken"> Question 3: How and where was the photo taken?</h3><p> At first glance, it doesn&#39;t seem like this question should make a difference, but it does. This is where things like travel, candid, and street photography come into play. Photos I take in public places – streets, fairs, parks, festivals, etc. – generally do not require model releases, especially if they&#39;re destined to reside only in my portfolio or on my walls.</p><p> Again, however, if I think there&#39;s even a <em>chance</em> that I might someday want to use that photo commercially (see the first question!), I have to get a model release. That&#39;s why I always suggest that photographers play it safe and get a model release whenever someone is recognizable and clearly the subject of the photo. You just never know what money-making images might be lurking in your archives until someone comes looking for them. It&#39;s always easier to get the model release first rather than to retrace your steps later and hope for the best.</p><p> In this final set of examples, we see how photos taken in public places may or may not require model releases. As noted, street photography – regardless of recognizable faces – will not require releases unless they are intended for commercial use. From a legal standpoint, you can photograph anyone in a public setting, as long as you are not violating any other laws by doing so. That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s always a good idea, but that doesn&#39;t make it illegal.</p><p> (Note: This does vary by location, and while it&#39;s legal to photograph in public settings within the United States, it may not be true in other parts of the world – so always check the local laws before doing people photography in an unfamiliar location. ）</p><p> When photographing children under the age of 18 for commercial purposes, however, a parent or legal guardian must sign the model release. Getting the minor&#39;s signature doesn&#39;t count.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/004-model-release-examples3.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-58473"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-58473" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:71.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="429" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/004-model-release-examples3.jpg?resize=600%2C429&#038;ssl=1" alt="004-model-release-examples3" class="wp-image-58473" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/004-model-release-examples3.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/004-model-release-examples3.jpg?resize=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Be aware of special considerations for candids, children, and public places. </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-is-commercial-use-a-simple-definition"> What is commercial use? A simple definition</h2><p> Simply put, commercial use is that which is intended to enhance a business interest. I listed some common commercial uses earlier, but it all boils down to whether someone&#39;s use of the photos in question is aimed at generating revenue.</p><p> When I photograph an author for their book cover, it is clearly commercial. In addition to appearing on the back of the book, the photo may appear in advertisements for the book. It might also appear in bookstore windows promoting the book, the author&#39;s appearance at signings, and other promotional events. All of this activity is clearly aimed at making money, so identifying commercial use is pretty simple.</p><p> What complicates the issue, however, is the photo you take for no reason other than to post it in one of the galleries on your professional website. Clearly, you&#39;re not selling the actual image, so no money is changing hands. You are, however, using that person&#39;s likeness as an example of the type of work you do in order to hopefully bring in more business. Your interest in using the photo is clearly commercial in nature.</p><p> There is no actual monetary gain from the image itself in this context, so the lines are blurred, but you do have a commercial goal in featuring it on your website. The same reasoning applies to hanging client photos in your studio. There is a commercial benefit to the extent that displaying samples of your work will encourage other potential clients to hire you. It is much better to err on the side of caution and have your subject sign a model release than to spend your time defending against lawsuits and cease &amp; desist letters. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-should-a-model-release-say"> What should a model release say?</h2><p> This is where a bit of a disclaimer is in order:</p><p> A model release is a contract. Most of the applicable principles are widely accepted, but laws do vary from state to state and from country to country. There are many excellent resources for creating model releases out there, so I strongly caution against simply writing your own document. Why reinvent the wheel if you don&#39;t have to? If you have questions or are unsure about any aspect of this, play it smart and consult with an attorney.</p><p> The most basic tenet of contract law is that there must be a “meeting of the minds.” In other words, a valid contract is a two-way street, obligating each party in some way. Hand in hand with this requirement is that of “consideration.” In a legal context, “consideration” simply means something of value. As the photographer, you are asking the person you are photographing to surrender any right or claim they may have to how, where, and when these photos are used. That can be a big deal, and you should be prepared to offer them something of value in return. It can be a nominal sum of money, it can be prints, or it can be something else to which the two of you can agree. Contracts have been upheld for consideration as low as one dollar. The model release must acknowledge this consideration.</p><p> It is also important to remember that the photographer is hardly ever the actual publisher of the photo. The model release must therefore indicate that the subject is not only consenting to your use of the photos, but also that of whomever you authorize to use the photos.</p><p> Let&#39;s go back to our example photo of the chef. Assume that the chef&#39;s agent or publicist hired you to photograph the chef for the cover of their upcoming cookbook. Obviously, you are not the publisher. You will, however, be licensing the photo for use by the publisher. The only way you can do so is to make sure that the model release authorizes you to grant usage rights to a third party.</p><p> As noted, a model release can – and should – be short, sweet, and to the point. I keep a stack of <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Model-Release-Update.pdf" class="ek-link">this model release</a> printed on 3″x5″ card stock in my camera bag. It&#39;s short enough to be effective and valid, and it doesn&#39;t confuse the subject to the point that they refuse to sign it. I rely on this short release for more spur-of-the-moment photography, whereas I use <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Model-Release-Long.pdf" class="ek-link">this longer version</a> for commissioned work.</p><p> One additional note on the paperwork: keep it forever. Model releases aren&#39;t records you can throw out after a certain amount of time. You will need the release if you ever want to license the image. And more importantly, you&#39;ll need to release to defend yourself if you are ever sued.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="model-releases-matter"> Model releases matter!</h2><p> Some people may be hesitant, or even unwilling, to sign a model release. <em>You have to be prepared to respect that decision</em> . It is certainly easier to get a person to sign a release when you have been hired to take their photos, rather than when you are roaming the streets, just shooting what interests you.</p><p> I always make sure that my clients sign the release before we start the shoot – assuming that a release is needed in the first place! Keep in mind that what can seem like a complicated process can be easily broken down into a fairly quick analysis. Ask yourself if the photo is going to be used commercially in any way. If the answer is “No,” the inquiry stops right there and you are free to hang that photo as big as you want on your living room wall. If you think, though, that there is any chance that you might one day want to license the photo for commercial use, obtaining a signed model release is an absolute necessity.</p><p> And once again, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Model-Release-Update.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">here is my “quick” model release</a> , which I use for spur-of-the-moment photography.</p><p> And <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Model-Release-Long.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="here is my longer model release (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">here is my longer model release</a> , which is used for commissioned work.</p><p> Hope that helps, and good luck!</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/model-releases-need-know/">Model Releases in Photography: What You Need to Know (With Samples)</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com">Digital Photography School</a> .

Indeed, all the time and all over the world, professional photographers are asked to immortalize the happiest times of people&#39;s lives: beginnings of families and lives, important rituals, celebrated accomplishments. Photographing a funeral is very different – on many levels.</p><p> Although a funeral may not seem like the kind of event people would seek to remember, it often is. After all, it&#39;s an important ritual, a celebration of a life, and a gathering of people who may not know each other well, but who are united in their mourning.</p><p> In my experience, many people find it important to have their loved one&#39;s funeral documented, even though it&#39;s a photography service that isn&#39;t advertised or discussed as much or in the same way as others (eg, senior portraits, family photoshoots, etc) 。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photographing-a-funeral-what-you-need-to-know"> Photographing a funeral: what you need to know</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133505" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-01.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to do Photography of a Funeral Tastefully and with Respect" class="wp-image-133505" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-01.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-01.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-01.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-01.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-01.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> <strong>Note:</strong> <em>All the images in this article have been approved for use here by the families.

But there are obviously some unique considerations, and in this article, I&#39;ll discuss both the similarities and the important differences.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133506" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-02.jpg?resize=750%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to do Photography of a Funeral Tastefully and with Respect" class="wp-image-133506" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-02.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-02.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-02.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-02.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-02.jpg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-02.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> One thing I want to emphasize:</p><p> Don&#39;t photograph a funeral as your first photography job, or even as your second. Funeral photography requires a professional and calm attitude, a lot of experience, and high-quality work. It&#39;s important that it&#39;s done correctly – so if you&#39;ve been asked to document a funeral and you&#39;ve never really done any serious <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/organize-photograph-events-like-pro/" target="_blank" aria-label="event photography (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">event photography</a> before, you should gently encourage the client to ask someone with more photoshoots under their belt. (At the very least, emphasize that you&#39;ve never done something like this before; you want to make sure they know what they&#39;re getting.)</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="before-the-funeral"> Before the funeral</h3><p> The funeral is a foundational life-cycle event, and for the person looking to hire you, it undoubtedly brings up a lot of emotions.</p><p> Funeral photography isn&#39;t discussed as much as other types of photography – there are no magazines or fairs about it, and there&#39;s little sharing of funeral photos on social media. Therefore, good communication with the client is even more important than usual. Remember that the person you&#39;re dealing with may not be able to express exactly what they&#39;re looking for, and that they will naturally be stressed and upset.</p><p> So make sure you ask lots of questions, and try to offer input and advice if the client seems to be struggling. Of course, you should do all this with the utmost sensitivity; the goal isn&#39;t to show off your professionalism or expertise but to understand what to expect and what the client wants. </p><figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133507" style="width:500px"><span class="space" style="width:500px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="500" height="750" data-id="133507" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-03a.jpg?resize=500%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to do Photography of a Funeral Tastefully and with Respect" class="wp-image-133507" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-03a.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-03a.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-03a.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133508" style="width:500px"><span class="space" style="width:500px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="500" height="750" data-id="133508" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-03b.jpg?resize=500%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to do Photography of a Funeral Tastefully and with Respect" class="wp-image-133508" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-03b.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-03b.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-03b.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></figure><p> <em>If possible, take some photos before the mourners enter. That way, you can capture the wider scene. Always ask before entering, though.</em></p><p> Here are the most important things to find out before the day of the funeral:</p><ul><li> When and where will the ceremony take place? If possible, visit the place beforehand to familiarize yourself with the venue. (When you&#39;re there, scope out the light situation. Think about how the lighting might change depending on the weather and the time of day, especially if the venue includes large windows.)</li><li> What kind of ceremony will it be? If you&#39;ll be photographing a ceremony that&#39;s unfamiliar to you, make sure you learn all you can about it. This is for a few key reasons: so you can have a better sense of what will happen on the day, so you can know which elements of the ceremony are most important (and should therefore be most carefully documented), and so you can avoid doing anything inappropriate or disrespectful while photographing. Also, if you feel you can&#39;t confidently photograph a certain ceremony by the date of the funeral, communicate that to your client right away so they can find someone else instead. As I emphasized above, funeral photography must be done well, and if you&#39;re not sure you&#39;re up to the task, it&#39;s not the time to shrug and say, “Well, I&#39;ll do my best!”</li><li> What specific photographs are particularly important to the client?

Also, wear shoes that will let you move around without causing a disturbance.</p><p> Naturally, be sure to be at the venue on time, greet your client, and offer your condolences. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photographing-the-ceremony"> Photographing the ceremony</h3><p> The biggest challenge when photographing a funeral is finding the right balance between getting beautiful photos and not disturbing the ceremony. Make sure to be quiet and to avoid blocking the mourners&#39; view, but remember that you&#39;re being paid to capture the event. Your client has asked you to help family and friends remember a momentous day and the life of a loved one, so you must do your job, and you must do it well.</p><p> Look for areas of the space that allow you to create meaningful images while staying out of people&#39;s way – this is another way that visiting the venue in advance can be a big help – and whatever you do, <em>don&#39;t</em> work with a flash. Also, if your camera has a silent or electronic shooting mode, then use it; most <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/use-mirrorless-in-2020/" target="_blank" aria-label="modern mirrorless cameras (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">modern mirrorless cameras</a> offer this option, and it&#39;ll often make your shutter imperceptible. Keep noisy adjustments (like lens changes) to an absolute minimum – if you want to switch between focal lengths, carry two cameras, or use a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/zoom-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="high-quality zoom (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">high-quality zoom</a> .</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133511" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-05.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to do Photography of a Funeral Tastefully and with Respect" class="wp-image-133511" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-05.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-05.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-05.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-05.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-05.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The photos you absolutely <em>must</em> capture depend on the kind of ceremony in question, and they also depend on the client&#39;s desires. However, here are a few general types of images that you should strive to take:</p><ul><li> Mourners paying their respects</li><li> The essential parts of the religious (if it is religious) ceremony</li><li> The burial and final goodbyes</li></ul><p> You&#39;ve been asked to photograph a very intimate event, so remember that photographing the guests should be done discreetly and with respect. To many, images of the guests are some of the most important that you&#39;ll capture: they signify different parts of the deceased person&#39;s rich life and represent the people in whose memories the deceased will continue to live on. Some might want a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-take-great-group-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="group photo (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">group photo</a> of all the guests (if you&#39;re not sure whether this is of interest, ask in advance).</p><p> The details and specific parts of the ceremony are also important to photograph: the flower arrangements, the lowering of the coffin, and the priest or leader of the ceremony. </p><figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133513" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" data-id="133513" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-06b.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to do Photography of a Funeral Tastefully and with Respect" class="wp-image-133513" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-06b.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-06b.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-06b.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Details and important moments matter a great deal when photographing a funeral.</figcaption></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133512" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" data-id="133512" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-06a.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to do Photography of a Funeral Tastefully and with Respect" class="wp-image-133512" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-06a.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-06a.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-06a.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Again, don&#39;t overlook those details – but make sure that you focus on the big picture, too. </figcaption></figure></figure><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="after-the-funeral"> After the funeral</h3><p> When the ceremony (or the part of it you have been asked to photograph) is over, let your client know you&#39;re leaving, offer your condolences once again, and compliment them on how beautiful the event was.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133514" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-07.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to do Photography of a Funeral Tastefully and with Respect" class="wp-image-133514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-07.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-07.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-07.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-07.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-07.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Immediately afterward, go home, and back up your photos.

Even better is seeing those little round red stickers underneath the prints to indicate that the work has been sold.</p><p> For most artists, exhibiting work is a driving force – and that&#39;s especially true of photographers who make images intended for walls and gallery displays.</p><p> But putting together a photography exhibition can be harder than you think. You have to consider an array of questions, such as:</p><ul><li> Where should you exhibit your work?</li><li> How do you submit photos?</li><li> How do you price your work?</li><li> Do you purchase insurance?</li><li> How should you frame your photos (if at all)?</li></ul><p> Exhibiting your work can also be very expensive, so it&#39;s important to understand the basic costs before you take the leap.</p><p> In this article, I aim to answer all of these questions (and more!). That way, if you <em>do</em> decide to move forward with an exhibition, you know how to make it as successful as possible. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="why-do-a-photography-exhibit"> Why do a photography exhibit? </h2><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-114435 size-large is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114435" style="width:398px"><span class="space" style="width:398px; padding-top:150.75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="398" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-24.jpg?resize=398%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114435" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-24.jpg?resize=398%2C600&amp;ssl=1 398w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-24.jpg?resize=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1 199w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-24.jpg?w=498&amp;ssl=1 498w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> If I were to do an exhibit today, I would include this image!</figcaption></figure></div><p> Artists have been exhibiting their work for centuries, and today is no different – though some of the reasons for displaying your photos have changed.</p><p> Before the internet, exhibitions were one of the best ways to showcase your work, and artists used them to make money. They would invite special clients or benefactors to the openings, hoping they would buy one or a few pieces.</p><p> Selling art is harder these days, so if your sole reason for exhibiting is to sell your photos, then you may be very disappointed. However, if your goal is to put your work up on a wall to show people what you are capable of as an artist, then an exhibition can be very rewarding. Take it from me: Having all your best work up for everyone to see can feel like quite an achievement.</p><p> Another reason many artists exhibit is to put the exhibitions down on their artist&#39;s CV. The CV (or curriculum vitae) is a list of all your exhibitions, as well as your education and a few other things, similar to a résumé. It&#39;s what galleries look at when considering whether they&#39;ll show your work. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114442 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114442" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="501" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-31.jpg?resize=750%2C501&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114442" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-31.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-31.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-31.jpg?resize=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-31.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-31.jpg?resize=717%2C479&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> If I were to have an exhibit of only my macro photography, this image would be an ideal choice. </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="costs-and-budgeting"> Costs and budgeting</h2><p> Exhibitions are not cheap! Therefore, before you decide to go all-in on an exhibit, there are many factors you&#39;ll need to consider, including:</p><ul><li> What sort of space will you exhibit in and how much will access cost?</li><li> What other expenses will there be?</li><li> How many images will you prepare for the exhibit, and what will the reproduction outlays cost?</li><li> Should you have a solo exhibition or start with group shows?</li></ul><p> These are all questions you need to think about, and that I address in greater detail below.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="group-vs-solo-exhibits"> Group vs solo exhibits</h2><p> Solo shows are fantastic, and they&#39;re ultimately what every artist wants. (Imagine having an entire show dedicated to just your images!) But solo shows are also very expensive, especially because you won&#39;t have anyone with whom you can share the expenses.</p><p> Therefore, instead of diving headfirst into solo exhibiting, most artists start with group shows. Then, if they have some success, they move up to solo shows.</p><p> Group shows are a good way to get your feet wet and start building your artist&#39;s CV. There are a handful of different ways to get started with group shows, but I&#39;d encourage you to find some friends who are also interested in exhibiting, then apply together to galleries to see if you can get an exhibition.</p><p> Many galleries also hold group shows of their own, and they&#39;ll often advertise for artists to participate – so you can often look out for those and apply! </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114450 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114450" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:94.93%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="712" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-39.jpg?resize=750%2C712&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114450" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-39.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-39.jpg?resize=300%2C285&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-39.jpg?resize=600%2C570&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-39.jpg?resize=717%2C681&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> I exhibited this framed image in a group show for street photography. </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="where-to-exhibit-your-photos"> Where to exhibit your photos</h2><p> Honestly, you could probably create an endless list of exhibition possibilities, but the most common places are galleries that specialize in the type of work you create.</p><p> However, there are other places, like cafes or restaurants, that like to have exhibitions featuring different artwork on their walls. There are benefits and disadvantages to each of these approaches: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="exhibiting-at-cafes-restaurants-and-foyers"> Exhibiting at cafes, restaurants, and foyers</h3><p> These places often allow you to exhibit for free, and they don&#39;t always have schedules, so you can sometimes have your work up for longer than you could in a gallery.</p><p> Cafes and restaurants may not want a commission from the sale of work, but they may want you to handle all the sales, so you would need to leave contact information. And they usually won&#39;t take any responsibility for your art pieces, so be aware of that (in other words, loss and damage won&#39;t be covered). </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114446 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114446" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-35.jpg?resize=750%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114446" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-35.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-35.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-35.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-35.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-35.jpg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-35.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This is one of two images that I exhibited in a cafe down near the coast.</figcaption></figure></div><p> When exhibiting at one of these places, you won&#39;t have access to a mailing list, and you&#39;ll have to do all the advertising yourself. People generally don&#39;t just wander in to look at the work; sure, the customers will see your images, but they&#39;re there for specific reasons (eg, to eat lunch), and buying images isn&#39;t one of them. While you can sell pieces from a cafe exhibit, your audience isn&#39;t there to buy what you are selling, which makes this type of show a bit more passive.</p><p> Your work will most likely need to be framed for hanging, and you will probably have to install it yourself at the exhibit space. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114445 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114445" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-34.jpg?resize=750%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114445" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-34.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-34.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-34.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-34.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-34.jpg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-34.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The other image that I exhibited in the cafe by the coast! </figcaption></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="exhibiting-at-galleries"> Exhibiting at galleries</h3><p> There are many different types of galleries, and it&#39;s up to you to decide which type will work best for your photography. Here are the basic gallery categories to keep in mind:</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="artist-run-spaces"> Artist-run spaces</h4><p> The cheapest spaces to use are generally artist-run. You pay less to show your work, but you are expected to “sit the exhibition.” That means you have to be there when the gallery is open to watch your work and manage any sales.</p><p> Attending the entire time the gallery is open can be time-consuming. Many artists will get together for a group show, split the costs of renting the space, and draw up a roster to sit the exhibition. For artists starting out, this can be a much better option. If you want to do a group show with a split schedule but don&#39;t know anyone to exhibit with, try contacting the gallery; they may know some artists looking to share a show.</p><p> While artist-run spaces don&#39;t come with hefty upfront fees, you&#39;ll need to take on most of the remaining expenses. The cost of the opening is covered and organized by you. You must also pay for most of the advertising, though some galleries will have a mailing list for you to use. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114449 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114449" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:78.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="590" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-38.jpg?resize=750%2C590&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114449" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-38.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-38.jpg?resize=300%2C236&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-38.jpg?resize=600%2C472&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-38.jpg?resize=717%2C564&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> One of my images, still packaged from when it returned from an exhibition last year. </figcaption></figure></div><h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="staffed-galleries"> Staffed galleries</h4><p> Staffed galleries are the next level. They cost more, but you are relieved of the burden of having to sit the exhibition.</p><p> There are two types of staffed galleries – commercial and non-commercial – and they often work in different ways. </p><h5 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="non-commercial-galleries"> Non-commercial galleries</h5><p> These are often smaller galleries that charge you for renting the space and to sit the photography exhibit for you. They are often the most expensive galleries to use for an exhibition. Non-commercial galleries will help advertise the opening, but they are generally not interested in promoting you and your work beyond the exhibition; in other words, the relationship is short-term.</p><p> Non-commercial galleries make their money from your rental fee. They also take a commission from any work you sell (usually around 30%). These galleries are a good way to start getting work on your CV. Some also do a lot of group shows, so I&#39;d recommend seeing if you can get work into them.</p><p> Non-commercial galleries aren&#39;t typically picky about what they exhibit, as long as the quality of work is good. They won&#39;t mind if one exhibition is all abstract paintings and the next is all landscape photographs. It can be a lot easier to get a show at one of these galleries than at the commercial galleries. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114439 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114439" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-28.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114439" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-28.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-28.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-28.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-28.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-28.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Another great photo for a future macro exhibition! </figcaption></figure></div><h5 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="commercial-galleries">商业画廊</h5><p>Commercial galleries are a lot harder to get exhibitions with. They have many artists to choose from and usually have a particular type of artist in mind. They&#39;re less interested in a short-term relationship, and are more interested in helping you establish yourself as one of their artists – in other words, they want to represent you.</p><p> Commercial galleries will keep some of your work in a stockroom and advertise what you do. They try to get collectors to view your work (so the collectors will begin collecting and supporting you, as well).</p><p> Commercial galleries usually represent a niche market. If you send your photos to a gallery that only deals with Indigenous art, they are <em>not</em> going to be interested. Therefore, when approaching these galleries, you need to do your research. Make sure your work fits in with the other artists they represent. At the same time, if they have another artist who does work that is almost the same as yours, then they&#39;re not going to be interested, either. The trick is to find galleries where your photos fit but are <em>also</em> somewhat unique.</p><p> Commercial galleries often cost a lot less for an exhibition. However, they are harder to get shows in and will take a higher commission. (Here in Australia, that rate is usually around 40%, compared to the 30% taken by non-commercial galleries.) </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114441 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114441" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="501" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-30.jpg?resize=750%2C501&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114441" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-30.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-30.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-30.jpg?resize=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-30.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-30.jpg?resize=717%2C479&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Another image that I would include in an upcoming exhibition of my work. </figcaption></figure></div><h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="submitting-your-work-to-galleries"> Submitting your work to galleries</h4><p> Most galleries advertise when it&#39;s a good time to submit proposals. While you can send inquiries at other times, it is best to check their websites for submission dates (ie, times when they are <em>asking</em> people to send in exhibition proposals). </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="commissions-and-pricing-your-work"> Commissions and pricing your work</h2><p> All galleries charge a commission, and some cafes do, too. When pricing your work, you need to consider this amount. Make sure you find out the commission percentage when first inquiring about exhibiting in the space.</p><p> Also, when it comes to pricing, you should be realistic. If you are new to the art world, charging thousands of dollars for your work isn&#39;t feasible. Only established artists can command prices like that. To get an idea of what you can realistically charge, look at the space in which you&#39;ll be exhibiting and see how much previous artists have charged for similar work. If you are happy with the prices, you could try charging the same.</p><p> As your reputation grows and more people start buying your work, then you can consider charging more. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114447 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114447" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:81.6%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="612" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-36.jpg?resize=750%2C612&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114447" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-36.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-36.jpg?resize=300%2C245&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-36.jpg?resize=600%2C490&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-36.jpg?resize=717%2C585&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This framed piece is from an solo show I had in the foyer of a theater company. </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="handling-loss-due-to-damage-or-theft"> Handling loss due to damage or theft</h2><p> When you rent a space to show your work, you also take on the responsibilities of it as well. Even galleries are unlikely to cover any theft or damage to your artwork.</p><p> This is often in the contract or terms. Make sure you are aware, and if you&#39;re worried, then insurance could be an option.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="insuring-your-work"> Insuring your work</h3><p> As I said, most places will not cover your work if it&#39;s damaged or stolen. Therefore, insurance is something you need to consider when displaying your art. Do you <em>need</em> to purchase insurance? In truth, most artists don&#39;t worry about it, but that doesn&#39;t mean you should do the same. I&#39;d recommend doing some research; see how much it will cost and if it feels worth it.</p><p> Now, if the work has cost you a lot of money to produce, then insurance is more important. You can also talk to the gallery and see if they have had problems in the past, especially with theft.</p><p> Also, if the work is going into a high-traffic zone, like a walkway, where it can be damaged or someone could walk off with it, then it&#39;s definitely worth considering.</p><p> At the end of the day, whether you get an insurance policy should depend on the work itself, but also on the exhibition space. If your work is displayed in a cafe, then the staff may not have the time to watch the work at all, especially during busy periods. A gallery is going to be in a better position to watch – but only if they have the staff. If you have to sit the space yourself, can you watch everything? </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="should-you-frame-your-work"> Should you frame your work? </h2><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114448 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114448" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:68.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="514" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-37.jpg?resize=750%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114448" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-37.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-37.jpg?resize=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-37.jpg?resize=600%2C411&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-37.jpg?resize=717%2C491&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> I was testing out a framer and had this macro image printed on canvas.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Many places will answer the question of framing for you: They will either say the work has to be framed or that it can be pinned to the wall.</p><p> If the work has to be framed, then you must decide if that is something you can afford. Getting work custom-framed can be very expensive. For this reason, a lot of artists make all their work the same size (or use the same size frames and just alter the mat sizes according to the images). They then go to a place like Ikea and buy cheaper frames. If you do the framing yourself, then you can reuse the frames every time you want to do a show.</p><p> If you don&#39;t have to frame your prints and can pin the images on the wall, that doesn&#39;t mean you <em>can&#39;t</em> get the work framed. Again, you&#39;ll want to take your budget into account. However, if you choose to pin your images on the wall, you need to figure out the best way to do this. If the purpose of the show is to sell your work, then pinholes in your photos might not be desirable to potential buyers. Also, unframed prints don&#39;t look as professional or finished (the buyer can&#39;t just take home an unframed print and hang it on the wall). </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-many-images-should-you-exhibit-and-at-what-sizes"> How many images should you exhibit, and at what sizes? </h2><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114436 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114436" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-25.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114436" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-25.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-25.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-25.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-25.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-25.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Another photo that I would include in an upcoming exhibit!</figcaption></figure></div><p> Determining how much work to prepare and how big to print comes down to price and space. Your exhibition budget can only be determined by you – and how many pieces you can make, and the size at which you can get your work reproduced, is going to be determined by your budget.</p><p> It is also important to know how much space you have available for the exhibit. If the space has only 3 m (10 ft) of wall space, then putting up three images that are one meter (39 in) across will make it crowded and not allow enough space between each photo. However, if you have 10 m (33 ft) of space, and you put up four images that are only 50 cm (20 in) across, that will give you too much space between them.</p><p> Consider the space carefully. If you think your work looks great when enlarged, then perhaps having fewer, large pieces is better. But the larger they are, the more they will cost.</p><p> The same goes for the number of images. You don&#39;t want to completely fill the space – giving each image room will allow them to be shown better. Just because you paid for the space doesn&#39;t mean you have to fill it up. And if you choose to frame, consider the size of the frames, as well! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="editioning-your-photography">Editioning your photography </h2><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114444 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114444" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:74.93%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="562" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-33.jpg?resize=750%2C562&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114444" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-33.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-33.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-33.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-33.jpg?resize=717%2C537&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> I tried out different papers to see which one would work best for this image.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Editioning is also referred to as “limited editions” and is something to consider with photography. Printmakers have been doing this for centuries. It means that you&#39;re promising your potential clients that only a certain number of those images (prints) will be available for sale.</p><p> Editions can be a good way to make your work more valuable. If you have an image and do an edition of 20, then you need to make sure that the buyer knows what number in the edition they are receiving (8/20, for example). You need to keep records of this so you know how many prints of the image you&#39;ve sold. Once you&#39;ve sold 20, you can&#39;t sell anymore. You made a promise to those who bought the first 20 that you would only sell 20 of them. Think about how many prints of a photo you might sell from the start, and be realistic.</p><p> Another thing you need to be careful about with editioning is making sure the photos are all printed exactly the same. They all have to be consistent. If you put a piece in a show and sell it a few times, people won&#39;t be happy if the image they receive is not the same as the one they saw in the exhibition. You don&#39;t have to get them all printed at the same time, but make sure you use the same printer for all of them and that the printer knows how to replicate them identically. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="selecting-a-printing-medium">Selecting a printing medium</h2><p> The medium you choose for printing should be determined by your budget – but you should also consider how to make your work look its best. Do you want prints in frames? Or is canvas better for the type of image you&#39;ll be printing? Getting work printed on metal is becoming popular now as well, though it is also very expensive and (arguably) only suits some styles of photography.</p><p> Whatever you choose, you need to be careful. <em>You want to show off your work in the best way possible</em> . Consider printing some of your images a few different ways, then deciding which you like the best. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114443 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114443" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:75.07%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="563" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-32.jpg?resize=750%2C563&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114443" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-32.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-32.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-32.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-32.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> My new printer did lots of tests so I could see which of my images would work the best on what medium. </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="choosing-which-images-to-exhibit"> Choosing which images to exhibit</h2><p> Choosing the images to include in the exhibit is the hardest part for most people. How do you know what images will be the best to show? There is no real way to tell.</p><p> If you are working with a gallery that employs a curator, you can likely get a lot of help from them; they can use their experience with the gallery and what sells to give you advice. If a curator isn&#39;t available, you might have to enlist the help of friends. Ask them to identify their favorite pieces. Perhaps your social media sites will also help you see the images that were most popular online.</p><p> When it comes to curating the show, there should be a cohesiveness to the work and to the final exhibition. Make sure all the work fits together and flows well. Be clear on your vision for the exhibition. The better your images look on the walls, the more you could sell. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-114440 size-large is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114440" style="width:466px"><span class="space" style="width:466px; padding-top:128.76%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="466" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-29.jpg?resize=466%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114440" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-29.jpg?resize=466%2C600&amp;ssl=1 466w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-29.jpg?resize=233%2C300&amp;ssl=1 233w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-29.jpg?w=583&amp;ssl=1 583w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Another image that I&#39;d include in an upcoming exhibition. </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="start-planning-your-photography-exhibition"> Start planning your photography exhibition!</h2><p> Hopefully, this article answered many of your questions about exhibiting photos, and explained some of the ways that galleries work.</p><p> There are a <em>lot</em> of decisions that need to be made, and before you start preparing, it is good to have a plan of what you want to do, why you want to do it, and how you will pay for it.</p><p> Have you done a photography exhibit before?
