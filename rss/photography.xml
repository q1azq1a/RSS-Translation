(opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">三脚架</a>。相信我，如果没有瀑布摄影，你一定不想冒险！</p><p>为什么三脚架如此重要？那么，为了在保持清晰背景的同时实现美丽的水模糊，您需要放慢快门速度。如果没有三脚架，您的图像最终会显得柔和且模糊。</p><p>但你不能只选择任何三脚架。拍摄瀑布时，您可能会发现自己将三脚架直接放置在水中以获得完美的角度。这意味着您的三脚架需要相当稳定并且能够处理水流。寻找还提供低角度定位的三脚架，因为通过将三脚架定位在前景上方，可以大大增强图像的效果。</p><div

new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">远程快门释放</a>。它允许您在不触摸快门按钮的情况下拍照，否则会产生振动并导致照片模糊。通过远程快门释放，即使延长快门速度，您也可以捕捉清晰的图像。</p><h2 data-section id="choose-the-right-waterfall-photography-settings"> 2.选择合适的瀑布摄影设置</h2><p>拍摄华丽的瀑布照片在很大程度上取决于关键的相机设置：快门速度。您可以用它来精确确定水的外观，也可以用它来确定其他相机设置。</p><p>瀑布摄影的最佳<a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">快门速度</a>是多少？一般来说，你会想要使用更长的曝光时间，但我认为确切的答案会有所不同——就像人们对快餐的口味一样。就我个人而言，我将瀑布分为两个不同的类别。有些瀑布的强度如此之大，足以让你喘不过气来。还有那些精致细腻的瀑布。</p><p>一般来说，我不希望我的瀑布变成一团白色的水，如果你把快门速度拉得太长就会发生这种情况。所以我相应地设置了快门速度。</p><p>对于汹涌的大瀑布，我会尽量将曝光时间控制在一秒以内。 1/4 秒到一整秒之间的任何时间都可以显示水的运动，并且仍然保留大量细节。</p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-36268"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-36268" style="width:600px"><span

600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>细小的瀑布喜欢用较长的曝光时间来呈现。如果你能走得尽可能远，这些瀑布看起来就很棒。如果您需要缩小<a aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">光圈</a>以获得较长的快门速度，那也没关系；不要害怕失去清晰度。摄影总是需要妥协，在这种情况下，捕捉水的运动将大大抵消清晰度上最轻微的损失。对于较小的瀑布，我建议曝光时间为一到四秒，因此如果需要，请停止到 f/22。</p><p>当您拨入相机设置时，我建议您首先将相机设置为手动模式。然后选择快门速度（基于您想要水的外观），并选择相机提供的最低<a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> （通常为 ISO 100）。最后，设置光圈以确保图像曝光良好。</p><p>然后退后一步，从整体上考虑您的设置。一切看起来怎么样？如果您努力将光圈缩小到足以获得曝光良好的图像，则表明光线过多。您需要加快快门速度或使用中性密度滤镜（稍后会详细介绍！）。</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span

data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>另一方面，如果光圈非常大，则表明光线不足。理想情况下，您的光圈应在 f/11 左右，否则您将没有足够的景深来保持整个镜头的锐度，因此不要害怕延长快门速度或提高 ISO，直到获得您想要的结果！</p><p>请记住，您的目标是创造良好的曝光度，<em>同时</em>确保美丽的水景。调整所有三个曝光设置，不要害怕拍摄测试照片，让一切看起来都很完美！</p><h2 data-section id="use-a-neutral-density-filter-to-capture-longer-exposures"> 3.使用中性密度滤镜捕捉更长的曝光时间</h2><p><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/neutral-density-filters-landscape-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="Neutral density filters (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">中性密度滤镜</a>并不是瀑布摄影的绝对要求。在某些情况下，当照明条件较低时，例如在雨天的茂密森林深处，您也许可以减慢快门速度，而不必担心曝光过度。然而，当阳光更亮时，实现完美的慢快门速度就成了一个挑战。</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure

data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>这就是 ND 滤镜的用武之地。这些滤镜旨在阻挡光线，使您即使在明亮的条件下也能降低快门速度，而不会有图像曝光过度的风险。通过延长曝光时间，您可以创造出令人惊叹的效果，湍急的水流变成了柔和、飘逸的水流。</p><p> ND 滤镜具有不同的强度，但首先，我建议使用 3 级滤镜和 10 级滤镜。即使在较亮的光线条件下，这两个滤镜也能让您灵活地捕捉所需的运动模糊。尝试不同的滤镜组合，以实现曝光时间和所需效果之间的完美平衡。</p><p>使用合适的 ND 滤镜，您可以将普通的瀑布变成迷人的杰作。它为您的图像增添了迷人的元素，增强了流水的宁静和动态本质。因此，请务必在您的摄影套件中加入 ND 滤镜，并释放瀑布摄影的真正潜力。</p><h2 data-section

毫米，对于初学者来说更容易，专业人士也可以依靠它们进行瀑布摄影。</p><p>为什么广角镜头非常适合拍摄瀑布？嗯，它们提供了广阔的视野，使您可以在构图中包含前景元素和远处的背景元素。这种组合有助于创造具有深度和宏伟感的图像。</p><p>此外，广角镜头可以放大照片中的前景元素，例如引导线，并且它们可以很好地让这些主题真正吸引观众的注意力。</p><p>当然，随着您经验的增加，您可以探索使用更长的焦距来捕捉更大瀑布中更私密的细节。但从广角镜头开始将使您走上正确的道路，拍摄令人惊叹的瀑布照片，让您的观众惊叹不已。</p><h2 data-section id="take-a-second-exposure-to-keep-the-foliage-sharp"> 7.进行第二次曝光以保持树叶清晰</h2><p>您是否曾经尝试过长时间曝光拍摄瀑布，并注意到树木和植物上的叶子会随着微风而移动？然后变成一片混乱的模糊？</p><p>这种情况经常发生，而且并不理想。所以这就是你要做的：</p><p>拍摄完瀑布的主要照片后，请查看照片的边缘。看看植物是否柔软、毛茸茸的。如果是，请将快门速度提高到 1/100 秒或更快（目标是冻结移动的植物）。为了保持良好的曝光，您可以打开光圈，但要确保不会失去最大焦点。如果您的快门速度<em>仍然</em>不够快，请提高 ISO，直到获得您想要的结果。</p><p>回到家，拍摄两次曝光并<a aria-label="blend them back together using layer masks in Photoshop (opens in a new tab)"

Instagram 等平台上拍摄的图像。这些视觉效果可以帮助您了解访问每个地点的最佳时间。</p><p>对于秋季摄影来说，时机至关重要。密切关注树叶颜色的变化，因为它们因地区而异。秋天树叶的鲜艳色彩通常只持续几周，然后就会转变为不太吸引人的棕色色调。及时了解色彩预测并做好抓住机会的准备将有助于您拍摄出最佳的秋季照片。</p><p>专业提示：在秋天拍摄时，请考虑将落叶融入到你的构图中。它们可以作为引导线，将观看者的注意力吸引到主要主题上，并为您的照片增添额外的兴趣。探索不同的角度和视角，在流水和生动的树叶之间找到完美的平衡。</p><h2

Lightroom 中的流程，但这些工具在整体上非常相似。</p><p>你知道很多人忽视的是什么吗？白平衡。是的，没错 - 即使在灰度中，色温也会产生影响。暖色温可以让您的照片显得更明亮，而冷色温则可以让照片显得更柔和。</p><p>一旦你完成了排序，就可以使用白人和黑人滑块了。使用白色滑块调整图片中的最白点，使用黑色滑块调整图片中的最暗点。很简单，对吧？但我们还没有完成！</p><p>阴影和高光滑块将帮助您调整剩余的色调，但尽管它们是一个很好的起点，但使用色调曲线更加精确，这也是我喜欢使用 Lightroom 的原因。</p><p>找到色调曲线后，您可以使用参数曲线来处理区域。在这里，您可以调整中间色调，这是基本滑块无法做到的。为了获得更高的精度，您可以使用点曲线。</p><p>当然，您也可以使用Masking功能进行局部调整！</p><h2 data-section id="experiment-with-monochrome-adjustments"> 7.尝试单色调整</h2><div

href="https://digital-photography-school.com/lets-talk-light-3-types-of-lighting-conditions-use/" target="_blank" aria-label="lighting (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">灯光</a>、 <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-elements-of-composition-in-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="composition (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer

noopener" class="ek-link">相机设置</a>非常重要。但是，一旦您熟悉了这些关键概念，下一个合乎逻辑的步骤是什么？如何才能吸引人们超过几秒钟的时间？</p><p>评书。</p><p>在本文中，我分享了十四个技巧，帮助您开始讲故事摄影，并附有大量示例图像来帮助说明要点。这些照片可能是在遥远的地方拍摄的，但我向你保证：我提供的技巧可以应用于地球上的任何地方。</p><h2 data-section id="what-is-storytelling-photography">什么是讲故事的摄影？</h2><p>讲故事摄影就是捕捉讲述引人入胜的故事的图像。它不限于特定的流派；它可以是纪实的、坦率的、摆拍的，甚至是抽象的。讲故事摄影的美妙之处在于它能够吸引观众并使他们与所描绘的故事产生联系。</p><p>当您遇到一张有说服力的讲故事的照片时，当您探索其复杂的细节时，它可以吸引您几分钟的注意力。这些图像具有激发您想象力的非凡能力，让您思考接下来可能发生的事情或反思所传达的情感。</p><p>值得注意的是，讲故事的摄影可以通过单个图像或一系列图像来实现。一些摄影师擅长将整个故事封装在一个框架中，而另一些摄影师则选择创建一组图像，将这些图像组合在一起，形成一个全面的叙述。</p><p>对于街头摄影师、野生动物摄影师和鸟类摄影师来说，拍摄一张讲述故事的照片通常是常态。另一方面，美术摄影师和摄影记者通常倾向于创作一系列图像，这些图像在排序后可以传达一个更大、更复杂的故事。</p><p>无论采用哪种方法，讲故事的摄影都可以让您在更深层次上吸引观众，使他们成为您所呈现的叙事的积极参与者。它是一个强大的工具，可以让您唤起情感、激发思考，并将观众带入一个全新的世界。</p><h2 data-section id="storytelling-photography-tips">讲故事的摄影技巧</h2><p>在镜头中加入故事是吸引观众并吸引观众的好方法。但你要怎么做呢？如何拍摄出充满叙事性的镜头？这里有很多提示可以帮助您：</p><h3 data-section id="try-to-understand-the-story-from-all-angles"> 1.尝试从各个角度理解故事</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-254557" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px;

data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>如果您要拍摄具有新闻价值的事件（例如抗议、仪式甚至派对），那么在到达现场之前做好功课并从各个角度了解事件至关重要。了解所有主要参与者、了解预定的活动并了解活动的目标。</p><p>到达那里后，请花时间与参与该活动的各种人员进行交流。进行对话，倾听他们的想法，并获得不同的观点。有了这些有价值的信息，就可以指导您的摄影从各个角度讲述故事。确保它不是片面的，捕捉必要的元素，并努力创建一系列呈现中立叙述的图像。</p><p>底线：从多个角度理解故事使您能够创建与观众产生共鸣的全面视觉叙事。</p><h3 data-section id="decide-if-you-want-to-capture-a-single-image-or-multiple-shots"> 2. 决定是要拍摄单张图像还是多张照片</h3><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tell-stories-images-07.jpg?ssl=1" alt="讲故事 图像 河滨驳船" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">我试图通过缩小并包含多个主题（孟加拉国达卡）来讲述这个混乱的河滨的整个故事。</figcaption></figure></div><p>现在到了有趣的部分——决定如何通过摄影讲述你的故事。您有两种选择：捕捉包含整个叙述的单个图像，或创建一系列将故事编织在一起的镜头。</p><p>如果您选择单一图像方法，则需要专注于捕捉能够传达整个故事的完美镜头。这就像一枪击中靶心一样——具有影响力且直接。当你的故事有一个清晰而直接的信息，并且你想要做出强有力的陈述以留下持久的印象时，这种方法很有效。</p><p>另一方面，创建一系列镜头可以让你一点一点地逐步展开故事。每张照片都增加了一层深度，揭示了叙事的不同方面。这就像组装一个拼图，每一块都很重要。这种方法非常适合具有多个角度、主题和细微差别的更复杂的故事，这些故事需要更广泛的背景才能充分理解。</p><p>两种方法都有其优点，选择取决于您想要讲述的故事以及您想要产生的影响。只需决定哪种风格最适合您的视觉，并准备好通过您的镜头捕捉这个故事！</p><h3 data-section id="include-small-details-to-tell-a-story-in-a-single-frame"> 3. 包含一些小细节，在一个框架中讲述一个故事</h3><p>想象一下你的任务是讲述一个人的故事。父母，甚至你自己。</p><p>你会怎么做？</p><p>标准肖像无法讲述完整的故事。一个人的完整故事往往体现在细节中：一张他们办公桌的照片、散落在卧室地板上的旅行书籍、他们在花园里干活而弄脏的手的特写镜头、一张他们被几张照片包围的广角肖像。他们最喜欢的东西。</p><p>因此，下次您拍摄人物时，请尝试<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shooting-details-tell-visual-story/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">添加一些小细节</a>来丰富他们的故事。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tell-stories-images-01.jpg?ssl=1"

data-section id="give-yourself-plenty-of-time"> 4.给自己充足的时间</h3><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async"

data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>有时，您确切地知道要捕捉什么故事，但将其变成令人惊叹的照片需要时间 - 这不是一个即时的过程！所以这就是交易：不要着急。事先花时间研究你的主题，然后给自己足够的时间来实际拍摄你的图像。</p><p>听着，让我们面对现实：讲故事的摄影不是你可以仓促完成的事情。它需要耐心和奉献精神。你猜怎么着？有时，您可能会在一个项目上花费几天甚至几周的时间而没有完成它。完全没问题！罗马不是一天建成的，对吧？</p><p>这里有一个小提示：尝试估计您认为讲故事的项目需要多长时间，然后将其加倍。这样，如果事情花费的时间比预期长，您就不会措手不及并感到沮丧。</p><h3 data-section id="aim-for-variety-in-a-series-of-shots"> 5. 力求一系列镜头的多样性</h3><p>这个讲故事的技巧与最后一点相关：</p><p>您必须针对单一情况拍摄<em>多种</em>不同的图像。无论您想拍摄印度的骆驼市场、芝加哥郊区的农贸市场，还是您侄女的生日派对，仅创建一种类型的照片并不能讲述全部故事。</p><p>相反，您需要肖像、广角拍摄、高处拍摄、低处拍摄、动作拍摄、放大细节等等。所有这些<a

class="ek-link">观点</a><em>结合起来</em>讲述了整个故事。</p><p>在下面的图像系列中，我试图讲述日出热气球在缅甸蒲甘古老、寺庙遍布的平原上空飞行的故事。捕捉各种图像是我成功的关键。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async"

data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 data-section id="take-control-of-the-entire-frame"> 6. 控制整个框架</h3><p>既然您正在考虑讲故事，那么您不仅仅是一名摄影师；您还是一名摄影师。你也是一个讲故事的人。这个角色涉及控制整个框架。</p><p>换句话说：</p><p>不要只考虑你的拍摄对象、他们的灯光、他们的位置。注意你面前的整个场景，包括周围的细节、背景、阴影、明亮区域等。</p><p>有时，我<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/get-down-low-for-a-unique-perspective/" target="_blank" aria-label="flat on the ground with my camera (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">拿着相机平躺在地上</a>。为什么？我想在画面中加入环境细节，通过讲故事来改善镜头。我收到奇怪的目光，但我不在乎；这是讲述真实故事的代价。 </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async"

提前计划拍摄清单</h3><p>无论您是前往家乡进行街头摄影还是前往埃菲尔铁塔进行度假摄影，为什么不创建一个拍摄列表呢？我正在谈论特定镜头的想法、您想要尝试的角度以及您可能在画面中包含的人物。</p><p>研究其他摄影师在您的目的地拍摄的照片类型。寻找新的角度，即使在知名地点也能产生新鲜的故事讲述。 </p><div class="wp-block-image

data-section id="dont-be-afraid-to-start-without-a-plan"> 8. 不要害怕没有计划就开始</h3><p>我知道我知道;我刚刚解释了使用镜头列表的所有价值 - 虽然镜头列表非常有帮助，但您并不总是需要一个细致的计划才能开始。有时，放开缰绳并跟随自己的直觉是一种解放。</p><p>不要对每一个镜头都考虑太多，而是拥抱自发性。带着你的相机出发，保持开放的感官，让你的好奇心引导你。捕捉任何吸引您眼球的内容，并相信故事会自然展开。</p><p>当然，记住一个主题或一个地点可以帮助你集中精力，但不要被严格的期望所束缚。给自己自由去探索、实验，看看旅程将带你走向何方。通常，最意想不到的时刻和联系会带来最迷人的故事。</p><p>所以，收拾好你的装备，跟随你的直觉，开始冒险吧。请记住，出色的讲故事摄影通常始于开放的心态和拥抱未知的意愿。</p><h3 data-section id="learn-to-narrow-down-trim-and-exclude"> 9.学会缩小范围、修剪和排除</h3><p>向 Facebook 上传一百张照片，所有照片都是相似的背景，从相同的几个角度拍摄，肯定会失去人们的注意力。这 100 张照片可以很容易地缩小到 10 个讲故事的基本镜头。</p><p>所以要学会选择性！开始只分享您最好的图像。</p><p>洛克塔克湖（如下图）是如此壮观，以至于我在一个山顶上漫步，拍摄了数百张照片。这是幸福。很多结果都很棒，但我真的想把它们全部放到网上供朋友、家人和关注者筛选吗？我不会！</p><p>相反，重要的是找到一两个最喜欢的来讲述你的主题的故事： </p><div class="wp-block-image

data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>创建令人惊叹的运动模糊镜头需要仔细控制相机设置。请记住，我们的目标是捕捉快速移动的拍摄对象造成的美丽模糊。所以这是您需要了解的：</p><p>首先，将相机设置为<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/" target="_blank" aria-label="Shutter Priority mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">快门优先模式</a>。此模式使您可以控制运动模糊最重要的设置： <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">快门速度</a>。您希望能够根据您的创意愿景进行调整。</p><p>现在，我们来谈谈快门速度。这一切都是为了在冻结主体和创建所需的模糊之间找到适当的平衡。像 1/1000 秒这样的快快门速度会冻结动作，不留下任何运动痕迹。但如果您想要那种运动感，请选择较慢的快门速度，例如 1/2 秒甚至更长。</p><p>找到完美的快门速度取决于具体的拍摄对象和您想要达到的效果。一般来说，快门速度应低于 1/60 秒，以捕捉令人愉悦的运动模糊。任何更快的速度往往会产生更清晰的图像，但可能缺乏艺术感。</p><p>调整快门速度后，选择<a aria-label="ISO setting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO 设置</a>。使用相机的基本 ISO（通常为 100）可以降低快门速度，而不会导致图像曝光过度。</p><p>至于<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">光圈</a>，您的相机会自动选择它，但请留意并确保它不会开始缩小太多。 f/16-f/22 范围内的光圈可能会因衍射而产生模糊，因此，如果您确实注意到光圈向上攀升，请提高快门速度或考虑使用中性密度滤镜（如下所述）。</p><p>通过设置正确的快门速度、ISO 和光圈组合，您将能够拍摄出令人着迷的运动模糊照片。不要害怕尝试和调整这些设置，直到达到所需的效果。</p><h2 data-section

1/30 秒；对于较慢的拍摄对象，大约 1 秒通常会产生令人满意的结果。</p><p>然后，当拍摄对象穿过画面时，拍摄！为防止相机抖动造成模糊，请考虑使用遥控释放或激活两秒定时器。拍摄图像后，在相机的液晶显示屏上查看图像。找出需要改进的地方，进行必要的调整，然后继续拍摄。请记住，运动模糊摄影是一个实验过程，因此请毫不犹豫地测试不同的快门速度，直到达到所需的效果。</p><p>创建出色的运动模糊镜头需要练习和探索。准确预测模糊主体的外观具有挑战性，因此请准备好捕获大量图像并在以后选择最佳图像。当您提高运动模糊摄影技巧时，拥抱实验的乐趣并相信您的创作直觉。</p><h2

class="ek-link">平移</a>。这项技术可以让您拍摄出令人惊叹的照片，在美丽的模糊背景下展示清晰的主题。</p><p>平移涉及捕捉拍摄对象的移动，当它在画面上移动时，用相机跟踪它。通过使用较慢的快门速度并平滑地跟踪拍摄对象，您可以在保持拍摄对象相对清晰的同时营造出活力和速度感。</p><p>首先，选择一个移动的主体，例如骑自行车的人、汽车或跑步者。将相机的快门速度设置为允许更长曝光的时间，大约 1/30 秒甚至更慢，具体取决于拍摄对象的速度。请记住，练习和实验将帮助您找到适合不同情况的完美快门速度。</p><p>现在，手持相机，按下快门按钮的同时跟随拍摄对象的移动。关键是当拍摄对象在画面中移动时，将其保持在取景器中的同一位置。保持平稳稳定的动作，就像你在与拍摄对象一起跳舞一样。</p><p>当您平移时，由于快门速度较慢，背景会变得模糊，从而产生运动感和能量感。如果操作正确，您的拍摄对象将在模糊的周围环境中脱颖而出，从而拍摄出引人注目的动态照片。</p><div

The magic happens when you have both elements coexisting in your image. Imagine a scenario where your subject is in motion, streaking across the frame with a mesmerizing blur, while the background remains crisp and sharp.</p><p> By juxtaposing the blurred subject against a static backdrop, you engage the viewer&#39;s attention and create a visually dynamic effect. This technique allows the viewer to anchor their gaze on the sharp areas while also appreciating the mesmerizing motion conveyed by the blurs.</p><p> To achieve this, it&#39;s essential to use a tripod. Without a stable base, your entire image will suffer from unwanted blurriness. So, set up your camera on a tripod and compose your shot thoughtfully. Consider the path your subject will traverse and frame your image accordingly.</p><p> Remember, a successful motion blur shot combines the graceful movement of your subject with the solidity of the background. It&#39;s a delicate dance between capturing fleeting moments and preserving stillness. So, take your time, experiment, and let your creative vision guide you.</p><h3 data-section id="try-adding-a-flash"> 4.

But here&#39;s where things get interesting: when you&#39;re working with a model or a subject up close, adding a flash can have a remarkable impact!</p><p> Here&#39;s the deal: you slow down your shutter speed, and then you fire the flash either at the beginning or the end of the exposure. It&#39;s called front-curtain sync or rear-curtain sync, respectively. The magic happens because the flash is incredibly fast, freezing the subject in mid-action. But since the shutter speed is slow, the subject still shows that motion blur in the direction they were moving.

I&#39;ll explore its causes, and I&#39;ll equip you with practical strategies to avoid it like a pro.</p><p> Specifically, I explain:</p><ul><li> What chromatic aberration is</li><li> Why CA happens</li><li> Seven powerful strategies to minimize its effects and keep your photos fring-free!</li></ul><p> So without further ado, let&#39;s discuss how to deal with that pesky chromatic aberration once and for all.</p><h2 data-section id="what-is-chromatic-aberration"> What is chromatic aberration?</h2><p> Chromatic aberration is when a lens doesn&#39;t focus all light wavelengths at the same point, resulting in unnatural colors in your photos. Because these colors are often visible along high-contrast edges, this problem is known as <em>fringing</em> . </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_Cheetah_Chromatic_Aberration.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Chromatic Aberration example" title="OziRig_Cheetah_Chromatic_Aberration.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The left-hand side of this cheetah shows chromatic aberration along the sharp edges of the subject.</figcaption></figure></div><p> To help you understand chromatic aberration a bit better, remember that the focal plane is your sensor&#39;s point of focus, where all the light from your lens should join together to be correctly captured and recorded. But depending on the construction of your lens and your chosen focal length, certain wavelengths (colors) may converge at points <em>in front of</em> or <em>behind</em> the focal plane; wavelengths can also converge at a point that&#39;s <em>off-center</em> .</p><p> When different wavelengths converge at different points, the individual colors become visible, resulting in unpleasant chromatic aberration effects. Take a look at the diagram below. Do you see how the red, green, and blue light hits the sensor in different spots? That&#39;s chromatic aberration at work. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ozirig_ca_dlsr_illustration.jpg?ssl=1" alt="What is chromatic aberration and why it happens. " title="ozirig_ca_dlsr_illustration.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> CA doesn&#39;t look so great, and it can also reduce image sharpness. Therefore, photographers often funnel significant time and money into avoiding or removing chromatic aberration in their images. Fortunately, as I discuss below, there are a handful of ways of dealing with CA – though they&#39;re not all equally effective, so it&#39;s important to make careful choices both in the field and in the editing room for the best results.</p><h2 data-section id="longitudinal-vs-lateral-chromatic-aberration"> Longitudinal vs lateral chromatic aberration</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254487" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-121.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="A guide to chromatic aberration in photography" class="wp-image-254487" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-121.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-121.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-121.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-121.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-121.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> While many photographers are familiar with chromatic aberration as color fringing, it&#39;s important to understand that there are actually two types: longitudinal (axial) chromatic aberration and lateral (transverse) chromatic aberration. Both types involve the focusing of different wavelengths at different points, but their key distinction lies in the direction of the differential focusing.</p><p> Longitudinal chromatic aberration occurs when different colors focus in front of and behind one another. This type is commonly observed in <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-tips-for-great-telephoto-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="telephoto lenses (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">telephoto lenses</a> and less common when using <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/7-ways-to-get-more-out-of-a-wide-angle-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="wide-angle glass (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">wide-angle glass</a> . The manifestation of longitudinal chromatic aberration is seen as unnatural colors across the entire image, rather than just at the edges.</p><p> On the other hand, lateral chromatic aberration occurs when different colors focus at different points along the same plane, next to one another. This type is commonly observed in wide-angle lenses. Lateral chromatic aberration manifests as unnatural colors along high-contrast edges in the image.</p><p> The difference between these two types of chromatic aberration might seem trivial, but identifying which type is causing the issue can be helpful in finding the most effective solution.</p><h2 data-section id="what-causes-chromatic-aberration"> What causes chromatic aberration?</h2><p> Chromatic aberration happens because your lens acts as a prism. It bends light, and the colors passing through the lens are split at different angles. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ozirig_ca_prism_diagram.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Why does chromatic aberration occur prisms splitting the light" title="ozirig_ca_prism_diagram.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Here, it&#39;s important to remember that light is actually made up of several different wavelengths (colors). So for your camera&#39;s sensor to capture the combined color of light, your lens needs to make all wavelengths of that particular ray hit the exact same point on your sensor.</p><p> It may sound simple, but various wavelengths (and thus various colors) strike your lens all at once, and <em>each</em> of these wavelengths will behave slightly differently depending on the lens glass that it is passing through.</p><p> The feat of engineering required to correctly align all of these different light rays is generally achieved by the manufacturer&#39;s use of a lens array (rather than a single lens element). In fact, if you were to pull your favorite camera lens apart, you&#39;d probably find upward of 16 lens elements – all designed to correct for various things along the light&#39;s journey between your lens and your sensor. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_Lens_Elements.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Lens elements A guide to chromatic aberration in photography" title="OziRig_Lens_Elements.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Unfortunately, this is also where chromatic aberration tends to rear its ugly head. Hidden within the design of these lens elements are defects – either in the glass or the design of the lens itself – which, under specific conditions, may cause your photos to exhibit CA.</p><p> Now, I&#39;m not saying you need a pro-level lens. In fact, a key point is that <em>all</em> lenses suffer from chromatic aberration in one form or another, no matter the cost. What matters is whether or not your lens exhibits <em>visible</em> chromatic aberration, and whether the amount of visible CA is a dealbreaker for your particular needs.</p><h2 data-section id="is-chromatic-aberration-a-major-problem"> Is chromatic aberration a major problem?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254486" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-120.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="A guide to chromatic aberration in photography" class="wp-image-254486" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-120.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-120.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-120.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-120.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-120.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Chromatic aberration can have a significant impact on the quality of your photographs if you don&#39;t take steps to avoid it.

While a small amount of chromatic aberration may go unnoticed, once it becomes noticeable, it will distract the viewer and diminish the overall unity of the photo.</p><p> Unfortunately, chromatic aberration is sometimes unavoidable, especially when using certain lenses. In such cases, you&#39;ll need to employ post-processing techniques to minimize or eliminate its effects. Many photo-editing programs offer tools to address chromatic aberration, although they may not always provide a perfect solution.</p><h2 data-section id="how-to-avoid-chromatic-aberration-defects-powerful-strategies"> How to avoid chromatic aberration defects: 7 powerful strategies</h2><p> Chromatic aberration is a major problem, especially on cheap lenses. But the good news is that, if you <em>are</em> stuck working with a lens that exhibits some form of visible chromatic aberration, there are several easy-to-understand strategies to remove or minimize its effect on your photos.</p><h3 data-section id="avoid-high-contrast-scenes"> 1. Avoid high-contrast scenes </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_CA_Cheetah_High_Contrast.jpg?ssl=1" alt="CA Cheetah High Contrast" title="OziRig_CA_Cheetah_High_Contrast.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Chromatic aberration tends to flare up when shooting high-contrast scenes. Particularly problematic are darker subjects surrounded by white backdrops, landscapes against a bright sunrise, or – as in the example of the cheetah above – heavily backlit subjects.</p><p> There&#39;s no easy in-camera method of avoiding contrast. So there&#39;s often nothing you can do here except adjust your <a aria-label="composition (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-elements-of-composition-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">composition</a> . Swap your backdrop out to something that more closely matches your subject&#39;s tones, or simply wait for more favorable lighting conditions.</p><p> If you absolutely must capture an image as-is, then shoot in <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/raw-vs-jpeg/" target="_blank" aria-label="RAW (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">RAW</a> and prepare for a touch-up in post-production.</p><h3 data-section id="adjust-your-focal-length"> 2. Adjust your focal length </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_Chromatic_Aberration_Focal_Length.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Chromatic Aberration Focal Length" title="OziRig_Chromatic_Aberration_Focal_Length.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Although it&#39;s nice to have access to a wide range of focal lengths, the fact is that most <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/primes-versus-zoom-lenses/" target="_blank" aria-label="zoom lenses (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">zoom lenses</a> exhibit chromatic aberration at their focal length extremes. So setting the focal length toward the middle of your lens&#39;s range will usually help remove the offending CA.</p><p> Note that using a zoom lens at its widest will usually introduce various other defects in your image. So if you&#39;re set on a wide-angle perspective, choose a <a aria-label="prime (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/prime-lenses-an-introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">prime</a> wide-angle lens to handle the job, or make a panorama at a longer focal length, then join the photos in post-processing.</p><h3 data-section id="stop-down-your-aperture"> 3. Stop down your aperture </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_CA_Aperture.jpg?ssl=1" alt="CA Aperture" title="OziRig_CA_Aperture.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Although the result will depend on the type of lens you are using, stopping down your aperture helps minimize most lens defects, including chromatic aberration.</p><p> So instead of using an f/2.8 or f/4 aperture, try going to f/8 or f/11 – then take a few test shots to see if the chromatic aberration has disappeared. Of course, you&#39;ll need to consider reducing the <a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> or boosting the <a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> to compensate for the light loss.</p><p> (Note: A narrower aperture will specifically reduce longitudinal chromatic aberration but won&#39;t affect lateral chromatic aberration, so if you&#39;re not seeing the results you want, try one of the other options on this list.)</p><h3 data-section id="reframe-with-your-subject-at-the-center-of-the-image"> 4. Reframe with your subject at the center of the image </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_Rhino_CA_Recrop.jpg?ssl=1" alt="chromatic aberration rhino reframe" title="OziRig_Rhino_CA_Recrop.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Chromatic aberration is often more noticeable toward the edges of the frame, <em>not</em> the center. (This is generally due to the curvature of the lens elements.)</p><p> Therefore, if you reframe your shot but put your main subject closer to the <em>middle</em> , you&#39;ll often end up with little-to-no chromatic aberration on your subject.</p><p> Of course, you may still have noticeable CA around the edges of the frame, but you do have the option to crop this away. It&#39;s not ideal if you need to retain every pixel in your photo (eg, for large prints), in which case you should consider one of the other preventative measures discussed above. But if you&#39;re creating small prints or you plan to distribute your photo online, cropping shouldn&#39;t be a big issue.</p><h3 data-section id="remove-the-chromatic-aberration-in-post-processing"> 5. Remove the chromatic aberration in post-processing </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_Cheetah_Chromatic_Aberration_Comparison.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Cheetah Chromatic Aberration Comparison" title="OziRig_Cheetah_Chromatic_Aberration_Comparison.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> If you come across a photo with noticeable chromatic aberration or find yourself in a situation where it can&#39;t be avoided, post-processing can be a game-changer. Fortunately, popular editing software like Lightroom, Luminar, and Capture One offer straightforward tools for chromatic aberration removal. The process is usually as simple as clicking a button or selecting a checkbox, although you may have the option to fine-tune the results manually.</p><p> To begin, import the problematic image into your preferred editing software and locate the chromatic aberration removal tool. Typically, you can find it under the lens correction panel. Activate the tool and let the software do its thing; then take a look at the Before and After views, if available. Assess whether the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/fix-chromatic-aberration-lightroom-5/" target="_blank" aria-label="chromatic aberration is completely eliminated (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">chromatic aberration is completely eliminated</a> or at least significantly reduced.</p><p> If the results are satisfactory, you can proceed with your usual editing process. However, if the chromatic aberration persists, you might consider trying manual adjustments within the software or experimenting with a different editing program.</p><h3 data-section id="convert-to-black-and-white"> 6. Convert to black and white</h3><p> If you&#39;re finding it challenging to effectively remove chromatic aberration using the dedicated tools in your photo editing software, there&#39;s another straightforward option at your disposal: converting the image to black and white. While not every photo looks as striking in black and white as it does in color, this quick conversion can be a powerful technique for dealing with those unsightly color fringes.</p><p> It&#39;s important to note that converting an image to black and white won&#39;t magically eliminate the blur caused by chromatic aberration. So, even if you plan to shoot in black and white, it&#39;s still worth mastering the art of avoiding chromatic aberration in the field. However, when faced with persistent fringing that&#39;s difficult to remove through other means, this method can provide an effective solution.</p><h3 data-section id="purchase-a-better-lens"> 7. Purchase a better lens</h3><p> When aiming to minimize chromatic aberration, it&#39;s essential to consider the quality of your lens. Different lenses exhibit varying levels of fringing, which can be attributed to factors like focal length and lens design. By investing in a lens with limited chromatic aberration, you can significantly reduce the occurrence of color fringing in your images.</p><p> Higher-quality lenses, although often pricier, offer a range of benefits beyond minimizing chromatic aberration. These lenses boast superior optics for better image quality overall as well as fast focusing, a robust build, and smooth handling.</p><p> To find low-CA lenses, seek out models with low-dispersion elements; they&#39;re specifically designed to handle chromatic aberration!</p><h2 data-section id="chromatic-aberration-final-words"> Chromatic aberration: final words</h2><p> Well, that&#39;s it: All the chromatic aberration essentials, including what it is and how to avoid it. Now armed with knowledge and strategies, you&#39;re ready to conquer this pesky foe and unlock the full potential of your images.</p><p> That said, don&#39;t be disheartened if you encounter a hint of color fringing in your shots. With the right techniques, you can minimize or even eliminate the problem.</p><p> Now you know how to keep your images free of CA, and you know how to capture stunning photos – even with cheaper lenses.</p><p> Over to you:</p><p> <em>Are you struggling with chromatic aberration in your photos?

You get significant flexibility thanks to the wide-to-telephoto zoom capabilities, so you can easily capture street photos that require rapid changes in composition. The downside is this lens&#39;s size and weight (f/2.8 zoom lenses are always on the heavier side). For a zoom lens, the f/2.8 aperture is impressive and will let you blur out backgrounds, though you might prefer a larger-apertured prime lens in low light.

You might find yourself doing street photography in a dingy indoor market, at twilight, or at night – and in all of those situations, a lens with a large aperture provides a major advantage. Yes, modern cameras perform well at high ISOs, which negates the need for a high aperture to <em>some</em> extent. However, a large aperture is still required if you want beautiful bokeh lights in the background of your low-light photos.</p><h3 id="size-and-weight"> Size and weight</h3><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-207329" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-best-lens-for-street-photography-01.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="the best street photography lens" class="wp-image-207329" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-best-lens-for-street-photography-01.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-best-lens-for-street-photography-01.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-best-lens-for-street-photography-01.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-best-lens-for-street-photography-01.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-best-lens-for-street-photography-01.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-best-lens-for-street-photography-01.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> To get great street photos, you&#39;ll need to be out walking for much of the day.

If you want to capture the energy and chaos of urban life or need a wider field of view, opt for a 35mm lens. And if you&#39;re feeling adventurous, try a 28mm lens for a unique and expansive perspective.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1688592702153"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">What type of lens is best for street photography?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> Primes are the go-to choice for street photography. They are compact, allowing you to carry them easily, and they push you to become intimately familiar with a single focal length, enabling you to shoot without hesitation.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1688592714493"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Is 50mm or 85mm better for street photography?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> While 50mm lenses are highly popular among street photographers for their versatility, the use of an 85mm lens is less common in this genre. It can be challenging to capture wider scenes with an 85mm lens, but if you prefer the telephoto field of view, don&#39;t hesitate to give it a try!</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1688592733085"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Is 35mm or 50mm better for street photography?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> Both focal lengths have their merits, and the choice ultimately depends on personal preference. A 50mm lens allows you to get slightly closer to your subject, isolating them from complex surroundings. On the other hand, a 35mm lens captures a broader view, allowing you to encompass more action in a single shot.</p></div></div><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lens-for-street-photography/">The Best Lens for Street Photography: Top 12 Picks (in 2023)</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com">Digital Photography School</a> .

It&#39;s about preserving genuine expressions, emotions, and interactions without any forced poses or awareness of the camera. Instead of arranging the scene or instructing subjects to pose, candid photography aims to document life as it unfolds organically.</p><p> In this style of photography, images are often taken while subjects are often engrossed in their activities or simply being themselves. The photographer&#39;s role is to observe and seize those fleeting, authentic moments that reveal the true essence of the subject.</p><p> That said, some candid photos <em>are</em> taken with the subject&#39;s awareness. During a wedding, for instance, guests often know that the camera is pointed in their direction, but they still act naturally, resulting in beautiful candid shots. The key here is the <em>authenticity</em> of the photo; whether or not the subject knows they&#39;re being photographed, if the image is authentic, then it&#39;s a candid shot.</p><h2 data-section id="when-is-candid-photography-useful"> When is candid photography useful?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254413" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:67.13%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1007" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-8.jpg?resize=1500%2C1007&#038;ssl=1" alt="Candid photography" class="wp-image-254413" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-8.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-8.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-8.jpg?resize=600%2C403&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-8.jpg?resize=768%2C516&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-8.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-8.jpg?resize=436%2C293&amp;ssl=1 436w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-8.jpg?resize=717%2C481&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Candid photography is incredibly useful in various situations and genres, allowing you to capture spontaneous and natural moments. Here are some instances where candid photography shines:</p><ul><li> <strong>Portrait photography:</strong> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/six-ways-to-take-a-candid-portrait-of-somebody-you-know/" target="_blank" aria-label="Candid portraits (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Candid portraits</a> offer a wonderful authenticity compared to posed shots. They effectively capture the true essence of your subject. During a portrait session, you can encourage your subjects to act naturally or engage in activities, discreetly photographing them as they do. You can also seize candid opportunities between poses or while transitioning from one location to another.</li><li> <strong>Wedding and event photography:</strong> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-tips-for-doing-candid-wedding-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="Candid wedding and event photography (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Candid wedding and event photography</a> is very popular – and for good reason! These occasions present a multitude of possibilities, from capturing the bride getting ready to the groom adjusting his tie, and guests enjoying themselves at the reception. Candid shots in these scenarios are often effortless and stress-free, as the subjects are typically accepting of the camera&#39;s presence while being engrossed in the main event.</li><li> <strong>Street photography:</strong> Almost all street photography relies on candid shots taken without the subject&#39;s consent. The goal of a street photographer is to remain unnoticed, capturing individuals in their natural states. <a aria-label="Street candids (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/7-vital-tips-improve-candid-street-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Street candids</a> can encompass wide street landscapes, interactions between a few subjects, or a solitary person lost in thought, walking through the rain, or simply observing their surroundings.</li><li> <strong>Travel photography:</strong> When exploring different destinations, candid shots can help depict the unique essence of a place. Travel candid photography often resembles street photography, highlighting the people, clothing, lighting, and architecture that make a location distinctive.</li></ul><h2 data-section id="is-it-legal-to-take-candid-photos"> Is it legal to take candid photos?</h2><p> While candid photography without consent is generally legal in many places, such as the United States, the rules can vary depending on your location. It&#39;s crucial to check the laws of the specific place where you plan to do candid photography to avoid any legal trouble.</p><p> That said, candid photography <em>with</em> consent is widely accepted and legal almost everywhere. This means that if you&#39;re in an area where shooting without consent is prohibited, you can still capture some fantastic candid shots by simply asking for permission first.

Take your camera everywhere</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254414" style="width:399px"><span class="space" style="width:399px; padding-top:150.38%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="399" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-1.jpg?resize=399%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Candid photography tips and examples" class="wp-image-254414" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-1.jpg?resize=399%2C600&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1154&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-1.jpg?resize=717%2C1078&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-1.jpg?w=998&amp;ssl=1 998w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The best way to take spontaneous photos? Always have a camera! That way, when the moment presents itself, you can quickly flick the <em>On</em> button, snag a few shots, and (if all goes well!) get a great result.</p><p> When I&#39;m on a shoot, I&#39;ll use my DSLR – but when I&#39;m <em>between</em> shoots, I carry a point-and-shoot camera. If I see a good opportunity, I&#39;ll whip it out and capture the scene. Of course, you don&#39;t need to head out and buy an expensive second body – these days, smartphone cameras are very high quality and more than adequate for most candid photography.</p><p> Also, taking a camera everywhere helps people become more comfortable with you taking their photo. I find that my friends and family just expect me to have my camera out, so when I do fire it up, it&#39;s not a signal to pose, it&#39;s just a normal part of our interaction. And when I do take an image or two, the subjects are relaxed and the photos look natural.</p><h3 data-section id="use-a-long-focal-length"> 2. Use a long focal length</h3><p> To capture candid photography without being noticed, try shooting with a long lens – a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/review-sigma-135mm-art-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="135mm prime (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">135mm prime</a> , an <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tamron-18-200mm-zoom-f3-5-6-3-lll-vc-review/" target="_blank" aria-label="18-200mm zoom (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">18-200mm zoom</a> , or a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/every-photographer-needs-70-200mm-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="70-200mm zoom (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">70-200mm zoom</a> , for instance. As you&#39;ve probably already guessed, the farther you are from your subject, the less likely they are to know that you&#39;re taking pictures, and the more natural and relaxed they&#39;ll act.</p><p> Depending on the environment, though, a long lens can be pretty noticeable, and it may actually make people feel uncomfortable (like they&#39;re being spied on). So choose your lens widely, and if you are concerned about people&#39;s reactions, consider picking your most compact zoom.</p><p> That way, you can get your candid shots from outside people&#39;s personal space, you can go unnoticed, and you can maintain a feeling of intimacy in your compositions.</p><h3 data-section id="kill-the-flash"> 3.

Using a flash (especially the flash on the top of your camera!). After all, there&#39;s nothing like a blinding flash of light to get people&#39;s attention and kill a moment.</p><p> So if possible, keep your flash off for candid shots. When you&#39;re shooting in low light, instead of using flash, try boosting your <a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> , opening up your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> , or dropping your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> .</p><p> You&#39;ll get a brighter exposure, <em>and</em> you&#39;ll avoid making your subject uncomfortable.</p><h3 data-section id="wait-for-your-subject-to-look-away-or-drop-their-pose"> 4. Wait for your subject to look away or drop their pose</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254415" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-9.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Candid photography tips and examples" class="wp-image-254415" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-9.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-9.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-9.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-9.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-9.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Capturing the perfect candid shot often requires a bit of patience and keen observation. When photographing subjects who are highly aware of your presence, such as during portrait sessions or events, it can be challenging to capture their genuine, natural expressions.</p><p> Here&#39;s what you can do: Instead of hurriedly turning away when your subject notices you, simply give them a warm smile or act as though you&#39;re adjusting your camera settings. You may keep their attention for a moment, but after a few beats, something magical will happen:</p><p> As they become absorbed in the flow of the activity around them, they&#39;ll forget about your presence and start acting naturally once again. That&#39;s when you seize the opportunity, swiftly raise your camera to your eye, and capture that spontaneous, unposed shot.</p><h3 data-section id="take-a-lot-of-images"> 5.

But if you use a digital camera (and I&#39;m guessing you do!), there&#39;s no real need to hold back; instead, be <em>aggressive</em> with your shooting. Don&#39;t be afraid to take many images of the same subject.</p><p> In fact, I&#39;ve found that, when shooting a burst of images of a person, I can sometimes get some surprising and spontaneous shots that I&#39;d never have captured otherwise.</p><p> So switch your camera to its <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/burst-mode/" target="_blank" aria-label="continuous shooting mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">continuous shooting mode</a> (ie, burst mode), and fire off several shots at once. You&#39;ll significantly increase your chances of capturing an unexpectedly perfect candid image.</p><h3 data-section id="position-yourself-strategically"> 6. Position yourself strategically</h3><p> While candid photography is all about capturing the spontaneity of a moment and getting a perfect shot during that split second of time, if you think ahead and <em>anticipate</em> what is about to unfold, you can increase your chances of success.</p><p> So at a wedding, get to the church early (or even go to the rehearsal) and think about what will happen during the ceremony. Where should you stand to capture each moment? Which way will people be facing? What will they be doing?

It&#39;s a fantastic way to photograph without disturbing the natural flow of the scene.</p><p> Take a stroll through a bustling area in a nearby city, keeping an eye out for interesting subjects. As you walk, glance through the windows of establishments you pass by. Often, people inside are absorbed in their activities and don&#39;t notice what&#39;s happening outside, which gives you the perfect opportunity to discreetly capture candid moments.</p><p> Make sure your camera settings are adjusted to handle the lower lighting conditions indoors. When you spot a captivating subject worth photographing, swiftly raise your camera, seize the candid shot, and continue on your way!</p><h3 data-section id="photograph-people-doing-things"> 8.

And they tend to feature more natural compositions, too.</p><p> For one, your subject will be focused on something that adds energy to a photo. It also adds context and an element of storytelling (plus, it&#39;ll take the focus off of you!).</p><p> Timing is everything in candid photography, so wait until your subject is fully focused on their activity. This will inject a feeling of authenticity into your shots, where your subject is unaware and the viewer can look on unseen.</p><p> Note that your subject doesn&#39;t need to be doing something especially involved or complex – they might be dancing, talking, playing a game, etc.</p><h3 data-section id="get-your-subject-to-interact-with-the-environment"> 9. Get your subject to interact with the environment</h3><p> If you&#39;re doing a portrait photoshoot and you want to capture some candid images, it can be a challenge to make your subject feel relaxed and act natural, especially if you&#39;ve spent the first half of the session taking posed shots. Fortunately, you can often speed the process along by encouraging your subject to look away from the camera and engage with their surroundings.</p><p> Imagine you&#39;re in a picturesque park. Instead of simply instructing your subject to stand and smile, invite them to have some fun with the environment around them. Encourage them to scramble up a gentle slope, lean down to catch the scent of a blooming flower, or take a joyful run down a winding forest path.</p><p> If you&#39;re shooting in an urban setting, suggest climbing a flight of steps, gazing up at stunning architectural wonders, or even waving to people passing by. The key is to inspire your subject to interact with their surroundings naturally.</p><p> By redirecting their focus from the camera to the environment, you&#39;ll create a relaxed atmosphere where your subject can genuinely express themselves. As they engage with the surroundings, their gestures, expressions, and body language will become more authentic, resulting in captivating candid shots that truly reflect their personality.</p><p> Remember, the more your subject immerses themselves in the environment, the less self-conscious they&#39;ll feel about being photographed!</p><h3 data-section id="photograph-people-with-people"> 10.

Act as if you&#39;re photographing the broader scene: the bustling street, the picturesque park, or the city skyline. Aim your camera in different directions as though you&#39;re contemplating various expansive compositions.</p><p> By adopting this approach, your intended candid subject will often ignore you completely. And even if they do notice, they&#39;ll likely assume you&#39;re photographing something else and continue going about their business.

However, it&#39;s important to remember that while candid shots are all about the subject, the background plays a crucial role, too. A distracting or cluttered background can draw the viewer&#39;s attention away from the subject and diminish the impact of the photo.</p><p> So before pressing the shutter, take a moment to assess the background. Ensure the backdrop features non-distracting elements, such as a stand of trees or a clean brick wall. And if your subject happens to be positioned in front of a problematic backdrop, don&#39;t fret. Simply adjust your angle and position to find a better perspective!</p><p> Alternatively, you can also use a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="wide aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">wide aperture</a> to create a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-get-shallow-depth-of-field-in-your-digital-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="shallow depth of field (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shallow depth of field</a> , which will naturally blur out any distracting elements in the background.

Take posed shots into candid territory</h3><p> It may sound strange, but one of my favorite times to shoot candid images is when other photographers are taking formal ones.</p><p>为什么？ Well, during posed images, everyone is focused on the directing photographer, <em>not</em> you. So if, for instance, a wedding photographer is shooting a series of posed images, you can capture some wonderful candid moments simply by standing off to the side and taking a few images of your own.</p><p> I&#39;d also recommend zooming in with a telephoto lens to capture more intimate scenes, and you might also try zooming right out to get shots of the subject <em>plus</em> the photographer.</p><p> By the way, if you&#39;re the only photographer at an event or photoshoot, and you&#39;re the one taking the posed shots, I&#39;d recommend continuing to shoot <em>after</em> everyone thinks you&#39;ve finished. It&#39;s often these shots – captured moments after the posed images end – that look the best, because people relax, smile naturally, laugh, and look at each other.</p><h2 data-section id="a-guide-to-candid-photography-final-words"> A guide to candid photography: final words</h2><p> Hopefully, you now feel much more confident as a candid photographer, and you&#39;re ready to start taking some beautiful shots of your own!

Dive into the world of ICM photography.</em></strong></p><p> If you&#39;re tired of capturing the same old static images and crave a dash of creativity, then intentional camera movement photography is about to become your new best friend.</p><p> This technique is all about breaking the rules and embracing the beauty of blur. By intentionally moving your camera while the shutter is open, you can create mesmerizing, dreamlike images that defy convention. The results are reminiscent of an Impressionist painting, except instead of a paintbrush, you use a camera!</p><p> Note that ICM photography isn&#39;t just about waving your camera around and hoping for the best; it&#39;s a delicate dance between control and experimentation. By mastering the right techniques and settings, you can capture breathtaking shots that leave you (and your viewers!) in awe. So if you&#39;re ready to start capturing abstract masterpieces, let&#39;s dive right in!</p><h2 data-section id="what-is-icm-photography"> What is ICM photography?</h2><p> Intentional camera movement photography (ICM) is a technique that lets you create stunning, abstract images by moving your camera while capturing the shot. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bluebellwoodsblur750.jpg?ssl=1" alt="bluebell woods intentional camera movement" title="bluebellwoodsblur750.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> It&#39;s not a difficult technique; in fact, the beauty of ICM photography lies in its simplicity. All you need to do is adjust your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/beginners-guide-to-camera-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="camera settings (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">camera settings</a> to keep the shutter open for longer than usual. Then, as you intentionally move your camera from one point to another, the magic happens. Your camera captures the moving scene and transforms it into dreamy, blurry subjects while the world rushes past.</p><h2 data-section id="when-is-the-intentional-camera-movement-technique-useful"> When is the intentional camera movement technique useful? </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ICMburtonbshorejul15750.jpg?ssl=1" alt="intentional camera movement on a beach" title="ICMburtonbshorejul15750.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> You can use the ICM technique to photograph a wide array of subjects. Let&#39;s explore the various scenarios where ICM can truly shine:</p><ul><li> <strong>Landscapes:</strong> One of the best uses of ICM is in capturing breathtaking landscapes. By intentionally blurring the details, you can emphasize the lines, forms, and vibrant colors present in nature. Whether you&#39;re photographing a dense forest, a vast ocean, or an expansive prairie, ICM can help you create mesmerizing images that focus on the essence of the scene.</li><li> <strong>Moving subjects:</strong> Don&#39;t let the name fool you; ICM isn&#39;t just for stationary subjects. In fact, it can be particularly compelling when applied to moving subjects such as cars, sports players, or wildlife. By deliberately following the movement with your camera, you can create a captivating effect where the subject remains relatively sharp against a beautifully smooth and dynamic background. (This technique is also known as <em><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-tips-master-panning-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">panning</a></em> .)</li><li> <strong>Flower photography:</strong> If you&#39;re passionate about capturing the delicate beauty of flowers, ICM can add a touch of abstraction to your images. By intentionally blurring the scene, you can highlight the vibrant colors and elegant shapes of the flowers, creating a dreamy and artistic interpretation of nature.</li><li> <strong>Street photography:</strong> Surprisingly, ICM can even be incorporated into street photography. It offers a unique way to accentuate the architectural lines of buildings and convey the fast-paced energy of urban life. By intentionally moving your camera while capturing the scene, you can infuse your street photographs with a sense of motion and dynamism.</li></ul><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254364" style="width:480px"><span class="space" style="width:480px; padding-top:125%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="480" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-22.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Intentional camera movement (ICM) photography" class="wp-image-254364" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-22.jpg?resize=480%2C600&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-22.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-22.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-22.jpg?resize=717%2C896&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-22.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Bottom line: ICM photography opens up a world of creative possibilities, allowing you to transcend traditional photography and explore new dimensions of artistry. With the right subjects and a dash of experimentation, you can achieve remarkable results that transform ordinary scenes into extraordinary works of art.</p><h2 data-section id="essential-equipment-for-icm-photography"> Essential equipment for ICM photography </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/rockpoolsportlandICM750.jpg?ssl=1" alt="intentional camera movement abstract" title="rockpoolsportlandICM750.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> The intentional camera movement approach is incredibly accessible. You don&#39;t need fancy or expensive gear to get started. Here&#39;s what I recommend:</p><ul><li> <strong>Camera:</strong> Any camera that allows you to manually adjust the shutter speed will work. This includes DSLR and interchangeable-lens mirrorless cameras.</li><li> <strong>Lens:</strong> While you can use any lens for ICM photography, a slightly longer lens, like an 85mm or a 70-200mm, can make it easier to achieve strong blur effects. Longer lenses also help you focus on interesting patterns and colors. If possible, use a lens with manual focusing capabilities.</li><li> <strong>Filters:</strong> ICM photography requires long shutter speeds, which means you&#39;ll need to control the amount of light hitting the camera sensor. If you shoot during the early morning or evening, you&#39;re good to go. But if you want to try ICM during the day, consider using a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/neutral-density-filters-landscape-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="neutral density (ND) filter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">neutral density (ND) filter</a> . It acts like sunglasses for your lens, reducing the light and preventing overexposure. Another option is a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-and-buy-polarizing-filters/" target="_blank" aria-label="polarizing filter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">polarizing filter</a> , which cuts down on light and enhances colors. I personally prefer starting with a polarizing filter and adding a 2-stop or 4-stop ND filter if needed.</li><li> <strong>Tripod (optional):</strong> If you want ultra-smooth ICM images with flat horizons or vertical lines, a tripod can be helpful. Use a pan-and-tilt head for the best results. However, in most cases, a tripod isn&#39;t necessary. You can achieve great ICM images with just your camera, lens, and creative movements.</li></ul><p> Remember, the gear doesn&#39;t make the photographer. It&#39;s your creativity and vision that truly matter in ICM photography. So don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t have the latest equipment. Focus on exploring the technique and capturing unique images with what you have.</p><h2 data-section id="the-best-icm-photography-settings"> The best ICM photography settings</h2><p> If you&#39;re ready to dive into the exciting world of intentional camera movement photography, it&#39;s crucial to set your camera up properly to achieve those captivating and dreamy effects. Here are the essential ICM settings I recommend:</p><ul><li> Shutter Priority mode</li><li> 1/2s shutter speed</li><li> ISO 100</li><li> Manual focus</li><li> Image stabilization off</li></ul><p> Now let&#39;s delve into these settings in greater detail. Doing intentional camera movement photography is all about controlling the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> . Longer shutter speeds allow you to move your camera for more time, hence increasing the blur effect – whereas shorter shutter speeds only let you move your camera for fractions of a second, decreasing the blur effect. Therefore, by manually changing the shutter speed value, you can change the intensity of the effect!</p><p> <a aria-label="Shutter Priority mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Shutter Priority mode</a> , unlike Aperture Priority, Program, or Auto mode, offers complete control over your camera&#39;s shutter speed, making it an ideal choice for the ICM technique. You can set the desired shutter speed and ISO, while the camera automatically selects an appropriate aperture for a well-exposed image.</p><p> When it comes to selecting a specific shutter speed for ICM photography, there is no universal best choice. The desired effect depends on the look you want to achieve. For an ultra-abstract shot, you might opt for a longer exposure, such as 10 seconds. On the other hand, if you prefer a subtly blurry image, a faster shutter speed, like 1/30s, might be suitable.</p><p> Additionally, consider that the length of your lens can affect the level of blur, with longer lenses producing greater blur than wider lenses. However, as a starting point, I recommend trying out a shutter speed of 1/2s. If you&#39;re uncertain, experiment with different shutter speeds, review the results on your camera&#39;s screen, make adjustments, and continue refining your technique.</p><p> I highly recommend using your camera&#39;s base <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO setting (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO setting</a> . Not only does it prevent unsightly noise from compromising your images, but it also allows you to extend the shutter speed further, even in bright lighting conditions.</p><p> And to ensure that your subject remains (relatively) sharp, <a aria-label="manually focus (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dont-afraid-manual-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">manually focus</a> your lens in advance. This way, you won&#39;t have to worry about the camera struggling to find focus, which can be a problem in low-light situations or when using a neutral-density filter.</p><p> Finally, if your lens includes image stabilization, remember to deactivate it. Image stabilization tries to compensate for motion, which can hinder the desired blur effect in ICM photography.</p><h2 data-section id="how-to-do-icm-photography-my-three-step-approach"> How to do ICM photography: My three-step approach</h2><p> Now that you&#39;re familiar with the basic ICM settings and gear, it&#39;s time to have some fun! Here&#39;s what you do to achieve amazing results:</p><h3 data-section id="step-choose-a-subject"> Step 1: Choose a subject</h3><p> The first step to creating amazing ICM shots is selecting the perfect subject to work with.</p><p> Now, you might be wondering, “What&#39;s the best subject for ICM photography?” Well, the fantastic thing about ICM is that you can get creative with just about anything! But as you&#39;re starting out, it&#39;s helpful to pick a subject with clear lines and interesting shapes.</p><p> Imagine rows of majestic trees in a forest or the captivating horizon line at a beautiful beach. Even the edges of tall buildings can make for captivating ICM subjects. The more color and texture you can include in your scene, the better – it adds some wonderful pizzazz to your shot!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254365" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:62.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="941" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-24.jpg?resize=1500%2C941&#038;ssl=1" alt="Intentional camera movement (ICM) photography" class="wp-image-254365" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-24.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-24.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-24.jpg?resize=600%2C376&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-24.jpg?resize=768%2C482&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-24.jpg?resize=717%2C450&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Here&#39;s a little tip: Shooting in low-light conditions is ideal for ICM. So if you can, try to plan your ICM adventures during the magical <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-photograph-golden-hour/" target="_blank" aria-label="golden hours (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">golden hours</a> – just after sunrise and just before sunset – or during the enchanting <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-quick-tips-for-better-blue-hour-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="blue hour (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">blue hour</a> . Working at night can also produce some stunning results.</p><p> Of course, you can experiment with ICM in bright light too – like on a sunny afternoon – but in that case, you&#39;ll often need to use a filter to prevent overexposure.</p><h3 data-section id="step-select-your-settings-and-compose"> Step 2: Select your settings and compose</h3><p> Once you&#39;ve got your subject in mind, let&#39;s dive into the nitty-gritty of setting up your shot. It&#39;s time to position your subject just right and get those settings dialed in. Here&#39;s how to do it:</p><p> First things first, take a moment to frame your shot. Remember, the end result won&#39;t resemble what you see through the viewfinder, but it&#39;s still important to consider the size and position of the main elements in your scene. Move closer or farther away, or adjust your zoom, until you&#39;re satisfied with the composition. Then switch your lens to manual focus and turn the lens focus ring until your subject is reasonably sharp.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254366" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:80%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1200" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-23.jpg?resize=1500%2C1200&#038;ssl=1" alt="Intentional camera movement (ICM) photography" class="wp-image-254366" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-23.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-23.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-23.jpg?resize=600%2C480&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-23.jpg?resize=768%2C614&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-23.jpg?resize=717%2C574&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Set your camera to Shutter Priority mode and immediately choose ISO 100. Think about how heavily you want your subject to blur and choose a shutter speed accordingly. As I said above, 1/2s is a good starting point, but you might potentially start at 1s or more if you want a lot of blur.</p><p> One important note: Keep an eye on the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture value (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture value</a> suggested by your camera. If it&#39;s blinking or showing “high,” it means the light is too strong, and your image will be overexposed. In that case, you have two options. You can either increase the shutter speed until the blinking disappears, or you can use a filter to reduce the amount of light entering the camera. (If you do add a filter, make sure you check the aperture value one more time before proceeding!)</p><h3 data-section id="step-move-your-camera-while-pressing-the-shutter"> Step 3: Move your camera while pressing the shutter</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254367" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Intentional camera movement (ICM) photography" class="wp-image-254367" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> At this point, you&#39;re ready to take a photo, so start moving your camera in a smooth and deliberate manner.

This simultaneous movement and shutter press is what will give your photo that unique and captivating look.</p><p> Remember, the final outcome of your images will depend on the speed, direction, and smoothness of your camera movements. So, don&#39;t be afraid to try out different techniques and experiment with various styles.

Ask yourself some questions: Was the shutter speed too fast or too slow? Does the composition look pleasing to the eye? How did the camera movement you chose impact the overall image?</p><p> Based on your assessment, make any necessary adjustments to your settings and approach, and give it another go. Don&#39;t be discouraged if your first attempts don&#39;t turn out as expected. ICM photography is all about trial and error, so keep exploring and refining your technique.</p><h2 data-section id="intentional-camera-movement-tips"> Intentional camera movement tips</h2><p> Looking to quickly elevate your ICM photography? These tips and tricks can make a huge difference!</p><h3 data-section id="take-a-lot-of-photos"> 1. Take a lot of photos </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/riverweedsICMblandford750.jpg?ssl=1" alt="river weeds ICM" title="riverweedsICMblandford750.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> ICM photography is a fascinating and unpredictable technique that requires a bit of trial and error to master. If you&#39;re only snapping a few shots, chances are you won&#39;t end up with anything extraordinary, and you&#39;ll miss out on valuable learning opportunities.</p><p> To truly excel at intentional camera movement, you need to dedicate ample time to shooting and exploring different possibilities. Don&#39;t be afraid to click that shutter button repeatedly! The more photos you take, the more you&#39;ll familiarize yourself with the nuances of ICM and understand what works and what doesn&#39;t.</p><p> Once you&#39;ve captured a bunch of shots, set aside some quality time to review them. Take a close look at each image and consider what you like and dislike about it. Pay attention to the various elements, the movement, and the overall composition. This process of reflection and analysis will help you refine your technique and develop your own unique style.</p><p> Additionally, don&#39;t be afraid to experiment with different focal lengths and subjects. By trying out various approaches, you&#39;ll gain a better sense of your preferences and discover the aspects of ICM photography that truly resonate with you.</p><h3 data-section id="consider-including-one-sharp-element"> 2. Consider including one sharp element </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bluebellaction750.jpg?ssl=1" alt="intentional camera movement in bluebell woods" title="bluebellaction750.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Intentional camera movement photography is all about creating abstract images, but adding a touch of clarity or a recognizable element can enhance the overall impact of your final photo. Think of it as giving your viewer an anchor amidst the artistic chaos.</p><p> Including at least one sharp or easily identifiable subject within your abstract composition can provide a point of reference for your audience. It gives them something to hold onto while they explore the mesmerizing swirls and blurs of the image.</p><p> For example, imagine capturing the graceful movement of trees in a forest, with branches blending into a dreamy haze. Amidst this captivating blur, having one tree trunk sharply in focus can create a striking contrast. It draws attention and adds a sense of structure to the otherwise ethereal scene.</p><p> The sharp element could be anything that stands out in the midst of your intentional camera movements. It could be a person&#39;s silhouette, a prominent architectural feature, or even a colorful object placed strategically within the frame. The key is to ensure that this element remains clear and distinct, providing a visual focal point.</p><h3 data-section id="shoot-the-same-subject-at-different-times"> 3. Shoot the same subject at different times</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254369" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Intentional camera movement (ICM) photography" class="wp-image-254369" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Now here&#39;s a trick that can really level up your intentional camera movement skills: shoot the same subject at different times of the day. Light and shadow play a significant role in ICM, and by capturing your subject during various lighting conditions, you&#39;ll discover how the atmosphere and mood can change dramatically.</p><p> Once you&#39;ve found a subject that catches your eye, don&#39;t just snap a single shot and move on. Make a mental note of the subject and return to it repeatedly, capturing ICM shots at different times, such as during the golden hours (just after sunrise and just before sunset), the blue hour (the brief period before sunrise and after sunset), or even at night.</p><p> By exploring these different timeframes, you&#39;ll witness how the interplay of light and shadow transforms your subject, creating unique and captivating ICM images. Not only will this allow you to experiment with different effects, but it will also give you a chance to refine your skills and find your own personal style.</p><h2 data-section id="intentional-camera-movement-photography-final-words"> Intentional camera movement photography: final words</h2><p> And there you have it! We&#39;ve reached the end of our wild and wonderful journey through the world of ICM photography. You&#39;ve learned the ins and outs of this mesmerizing technique, including what it is, how it works, and you can use it to capture amazing abstract images.</p><p> Remember, intentional camera movement is all about breaking free from the constraints of traditional photography and letting your imagination run wild. It&#39;s about capturing the essence of a subject through streaks of color, rough shapes, and beautiful light.</p><p> Grab your camera, go out into the world, and start practicing. Embrace the happy accidents, learn from the not-so-successful experiments, and keep pushing your boundaries.

We&#39;ve handpicked 16 outstanding options to elevate your photos.</em></strong></p><p> Selecting the best lens for <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-ways-to-take-stunning-portraits/" class="ek-link">portrait photography</a> can be overwhelming, but it&#39;s also an essential task, whether you&#39;re a beginner, an intermediate enthusiast, or a professional. The right portrait lens will capture crisp, flattering images with a beautiful background blur – while the <em>wrong</em> portrait lens will produce soft photos that are prone to unpleasant distortion.</p><p> The good news is that there are plenty of amazing portrait lenses available, and many of them come with relatively affordable price tags. The bad news is that sorting through the wide array of focal lengths, features, compatibilities, sizes, and prices can be a time-consuming headache. Fortunately, I&#39;ve been capturing portraits for years, and I think I can help you out.</p><p> Below, I share the 16 best portrait lenses for photographers, including options for a variety of different camera types (DSLR and mirrorless, full-frame and APS-C), and portrait specialties. My list of top-notch portrait glass also offers selections for beginners on a budget, professionals seeking the best of the best, and everything in between.</p><p> Ready to grab the lens that&#39;ll take your portraits to the next level? Let&#39;s dive right in, starting with my number one pick:</p><h2 id="1-nikon-50mm-f-1-8g"> 1.

The lens is tack sharp and focuses quickly, and the 50mm focal length is great for headshots, medium shots, and even wider shots with groups. The large f/1.8 aperture turns busy backgrounds into buttery smooth <a aria-label="bokeh (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">bokeh</a> , and it works great in low-light situations, too. I have been shooting with this lens for nearly a decade and still bring it with me to portrait sessions because it just works so well.</p><p> You can also find similar inexpensive lenses from Sony, Canon, and other manufacturers – several of which are featured on this list! – so if you don&#39;t shoot with Nikon cameras, you can still pick up a 50mm f/1.8 lens for your camera at a great price. That said, I have used versions from other brands and tend to prefer the Nikon, but perhaps that&#39;s just my own personal bias; all of them do a great job with portraits and other photography situations, too.</p><p> These 50mm lenses often don&#39;t include advanced features like weather sealing or metal construction, but if you keep your expectations in check and are just looking for an outstanding lens to shoot portraits without breaking the bank, this is the one to get.</p><h3 id="pros"> Pros</h3><ul><li> Inexpensive; great price-to-performance ratio</li><li> Well-built</li><li> Very sharp</li><li> Amazing upgrade choice for new photographers who want better portraits than what their kit lens can offer</li></ul><h3 id="cons"> Cons</h3><ul><li> Shooting wide open results in some unpleasant image artifacts like <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/chromatic-aberration-what-is-it-and-how-to-avoid-it/" target="_blank" aria-label="chromatic aberration (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">chromatic aberration</a> and an overall drop in sharpness</li><li> The focusing ring feels a little cheap and stiff</li></ul><h2 id="7-sony-fe-85mm-f-1-4-gm"> 2.

Everything you might expect is here: exquisite sharpness, beautiful background blur, fast autofocus, and sealing against dust and moisture. However, this lens also includes a few extra features that certain portrait photographers will appreciate.</p><p> The built-in focus lock button is great if you want to use the shutter button for focusing while instantly locking focus at a moment&#39;s notice (it essentially eliminates the need for <a aria-label="back-button focus (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/back-button-focus-what-is-it-and-why-should-you-try-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">back-button focus</a> ). Also, this lens has a ring that lets you change apertures manually right on the lens instead of using a control dial on your camera. The ring clicks on third-stop increments, but the sound can be disabled for those planning to shoot video.</p><h3 id="pros"> Pros</h3><ul><li> 85mm focal length is versatile and highly useful for lots of portrait scenarios</li><li> Good manual controls, including focus lock and aperture</li><li> Excellent image quality</li></ul><h3 id="cons"> Cons</h3><ul><li> More expensive than similar 85mm lenses from Canon and Nikon</li><li> No image stabilization, but most Sony cameras have in-body image stabilization</li></ul><h2 data-section id="canon-rf-mm-f-stm"> 3.

This lens offers a plethora of benefits that will take your portrait shots to the next level.</p><p> First and foremost, the 50mm focal length of this lens is incredibly versatile. It allows you to capture a wide range of portrait styles, from half-body shots that highlight the subject&#39;s expression and details, to full-body compositions that showcase their entire presence. Additionally, if you&#39;re into <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/environmental-portraits/" target="_blank" aria-label="environmental portraits (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">environmental portraits</a> where the subject is placed within a specific context or location, the 50mm focal length excels in capturing the perfect balance between the subject and their surroundings.</p><p> One standout feature of the Canon RF 50mm f/1.8 STM is its impressive maximum <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> of f/1.8. This wide aperture not only allows you to create stunning background bokeh, with creamy and beautifully blurred backgrounds, but it also proves to be invaluable in low-light situations. When shooting without flash in dimly lit environments, the wide maximum aperture enables you to maintain a fast shutter speed, resulting in sharp and well-exposed portraits even in challenging lighting conditions.</p><p> In terms of ergonomics, this lens hits the mark. It&#39;s compact, lightweight, and incredibly portable, making it an ideal choice for photographers on the go. Whether you&#39;re exploring the streets or traveling to distant lands, you can easily slip the Canon RF 50mm f/1.8 STM into your bag or purse and have it readily available whenever the perfect portrait opportunity arises.</p><p> And let&#39;s not forget the best part: the price.

The images it produces are incredibly detailed, ensuring that you&#39;ll impress your models, clients, and viewers alike. Whether you&#39;re sharing your portraits on social media, displaying them on a website, or printing them in large format, the quality will be nothing short of outstanding.</p><p> Although the Fujinon XF 56mm f/1.2 R is not the smallest lens out there, it remains highly portable, making it a reliable companion for your photography endeavors.

The creamy background blur adds a dreamy quality to the images, drawing attention to the subject and creating a captivating visual impact.

It has long been a favorite of Canon shooters and with good reason: the 85mm focal length is great for headshots and medium shots, plus full-body and group photos, too. It&#39;s light, reasonably sized, and built to withstand the elements as well as some drops and falls. I know professional portrait photographers who use this lens exclusively, even over other options at their disposal like a 70-200mm f/2.8.</p><p> One key advantage of this particular lens is its built-in image stabilization, which is exceptionally useful when handholding at slower <a aria-label="shutter speeds (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speeds</a> .

There are plenty of other choices, including newer lenses from Nikon, Canon, and Sony that are specifically designed for mirrorless cameras, but this particular 70-200mm f/2.8 represents the pinnacle of lens construction for DSLR cameras. It&#39;s tack sharp at every aperture including wide open at f/2.8, it&#39;s designed to withstand years of daily use, and it has customizable buttons built right into the barrel so you can adapt the lens to your needs.</p><p> Portrait photographers love 70-200mm f/2.8 lenses because they give outstanding results without many compromises. You can get headshots, full-body portraits, and entire group photos where everyone is in focus but the background is beautifully blurry.

The 40mm focal length results in a bit of distortion when shooting close-ups and headshots, but in normal daily use this wasn&#39;t a huge problem for me. Despite these drawbacks, there&#39;s almost an intangible beauty to this lens that&#39;s difficult to describe, which makes it wonderful for portraits as well as everyday shooting. I especially like how I can get several people in a shot for group portrait scenarios and still create a beautiful blurry background; at the end of the day, those results matter to me more than anything else.</p><h3 id="pros"> Pros</h3><ul><li> Amazing sharpness, even wide open at f/1.4</li><li> Good choice for daily use in mixed environments, not just portraits</li><li> Solid construction and an extra-large rubber grip around the focusing ring</li></ul><h3 id="cons"> Cons</h3><ul><li> Expensive; it shoots great photos, but you pay a premium</li><li> 40mm is good for portraits, but not as widely used as longer focal lengths like 85mm</li><li> Autofocus is fine, but not as fast as some class-leading lenses</li></ul><h2 id="9-nikon-z-85mm-f-1-8-s"> 10.

Why not include other lenses with more varied focal lengths? Well, 85mm is the sweet spot for many portrait photographers, and when Nikon made this lens for their Z-mount mirrorless cameras, they took everything they had learned from their already-exceptional F-mount DSLR lenses and kicked it up a notch. It&#39;s got everything you would expect in a lens of this caliber and in this price range: sharp optics, solid construction, a massive grip for focusing, and good weather sealing – all in a package that isn&#39;t too big and won&#39;t weigh you down during long photo sessions.</p><p> While it&#39;s true that the f/1.8 aperture isn&#39;t as wide as the Canon 85mm f/1.4 or Sony 85mm f/1.4, this lens is also much less expensive and gets the job done nearly as well. And f/1.8 lenses can still be used in low light and are capable of very shallow depth of field, even if it&#39;s not quite as shallow as its f/1.4 brethren. (For reference, I almost never shoot my Nikon 85mm lens wider than f/2 or f/2.4, since the depth of field is wafer-thin.) The 85mm f/1.8 doesn&#39;t have built-in image stabilization, but almost every Nikon mirrorless camera comes with that already, so you can get sharp shots at slow shutter speeds even with non-stabilized lenses. If you use Nikon Z-mount cameras and want a great portrait lens without breaking the bank, this is the one to get.</p><h3 id="pros"> Pros</h3><ul><li> Excellent image quality even on high-megapixel cameras like the <a aria-label="Nikon Z7 II (opens in a new tab)" href="https://geni.us/NikonZ7II" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Nikon Z7 II</a></li><li> Massive rubberized focus ring is easy to grip and rotate, and can also be assigned to adjust aperture or exposure compensation</li><li> Very good autofocus is well-suited to photos and videos</li></ul><h3 id="cons"> Cons</h3><ul><li> Maximum f/1.8 aperture isn&#39;t as bright as some competing lenses that go to f/1.4 or f/1.2</li><li> Some photographers prefer slightly smaller lenses</li></ul><h2 id="5-canon-ef-50mm-f-1-2l-usm"> 11.

It checks nearly every possible box a portrait photographer might have on their wishlist, and to this day, it is widely regarded as one of the best portrait lenses of all time. Its medium telephoto focal length of 105mm means you can get beautiful close-ups without standing nose-to-nose with your subjects, and its incredible sharpness is the envy of many photographers. The insane f/1.4 aperture on this lens makes 70-200mm f/2.8 lenses weep, its autofocus is fast and reliable, and it even includes weather sealing so you can shoot in inclement weather.</p><p> If you like photographing portraits with medium-telephoto focal lengths, you&#39;ll love the 105mm f/1.4.

It&#39;s too bulky for daily casual shooting, and the 105mm focal length is ill-suited for nature, sports, and most other types of photography.

While the 28-70mm focal length essentially does the same work as two or three other lenses, its price is so high you could just purchase individual lenses instead. However, for an all-in-one workhorse, this lens is hard to beat. As you might expect, it is extremely sharp wide open at all focal lengths, has fast and reliable autofocus, and even sports a control ring that can be customized to change settings like aperture and ISO. If you shoot with Canon mirrorless cameras, like wider focal lengths, and want one lens to rule them all, this should be at the top of your list.</p><h3 id="pros"> Pros</h3><ul><li> Incredible versatility thanks to the extra-large f/2 maximum aperture across the entire focal range</li><li> Beautiful image quality at every focal length and aperture</li><li> Fast, reliable autofocus</li><li> Weather-resistant construction</li></ul><h3 id="cons"> Cons</h3><ul><li> Very expensive; given the price of this lens, some photographers might prefer buying a few prime lenses, instead</li><li> Minimum focal length isn&#39;t as wide as the 24mm found on other lenses (however, 24-70mm lenses have smaller maximum apertures of f/2.8 instead of f/2)</li></ul><h2 id="10-tamron-70-210mm-f-4-di-vc-usd"> 14.

However, if you&#39;re a professional Sony shooter looking for a reliable all-in-one solution, this lens is definitely worth considering.</p><p> So, if you want a lens that can handle a variety of shooting situations while delivering solid image quality, the Sony FE 24-70mm f/2.8 GM is an excellent choice for portrait photographers who like to explore different genres and capture diverse moments with ease.</p><h3 id="pros"> Pros</h3><ul><li> Excellent focal-length range</li><li> Great optics</li><li> Outstanding build quality</li></ul><h3 id="cons"> Cons</h3><ul><li> Expensive</li><li> f/2.8 maximum aperture is somewhat limiting</li></ul><h2 data-section id="nikon-z-mm-f-s"> 16.

This lens marks a significant milestone for Nikon, as it&#39;s been a while since they released a 50mm lens with autofocus technology. But let me tell you, it&#39;s worth the wait!</p><p> Now, we all know the benefits of the classic 50mm focal length for portrait photography. It&#39;s versatile, allowing you to capture a variety of shots from half-body portraits to headshots. But what sets this lens apart is its incredible f/1.2 maximum aperture. With such a wide aperture, you can achieve dreamy bokeh that adds a touch of magic to your portraits. Imagine a beautifully blurred background that makes your subject pop, creating that professional and artistic look.</p><p> When it comes to the optical quality, Nikon doesn&#39;t disappoint. The image quality is simply stunning, delivering sharpness and clarity that will leave you in awe. Whether you&#39;re capturing portraits for social media, printing large photos, or displaying your work on a website, this lens ensures your images will look their absolute best.</p><p> In terms of build quality, the Nikon Z 50mm f/1.2 S doesn&#39;t cut any corners. It&#39;s designed to withstand challenging shooting conditions, making it an excellent choice for outdoor portrait sessions. You can confidently <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-take-better-beach-portraits/" target="_blank" aria-label="shoot portraits on a beach (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shoot portraits on a beach</a> , in the rain, or any other unpredictable environment without worrying about damaging your equipment.</p><p> What I particularly love about this lens is its ease of use. It features a large manual focusing ring that provides precise control, perfect for when you want to fine-tune the focus manually. Additionally, there&#39;s a programmable control ring that allows you to customize its function according to your shooting preferences. It&#39;s these little details that make the shooting experience with this lens so enjoyable and efficient.</p><p> Now, it&#39;s worth noting that the Nikon Z 50mm f/1.2 S lens is not lightweight. It has a solid build and feels substantial in your hands. If you prefer a more casual shooting style or prioritize portability, this lens might not be the best choice for you. However, for passionate Nikon Z users who want top-of-the-line performance and are willing to invest in quality, this lens is an enticing option that will take your portrait photography to new heights.</p><h3 id="pros"> Pros</h3><ul><li> Breathtaking bokeh</li><li> Standard portrait focal length</li><li> Amazing low-light capabilities</li><li> Excellent ergonomics</li></ul><h3 id="cons"> Cons</h3><ul><li> Ultra-expensive</li><li> Heavy</li></ul><h2 id="best-lenses-for-portrait-photography-final-words"> Best lenses for portrait photography: final words</h2><p> Those are my top picks for portrait lenses in 2023, and I hope this gives you several options to consider – whether you&#39;re new to portraiture or you&#39;re a seasoned professional looking to upgrade your gear.</p><p> Great glass is just one component of portrait photography, though.

Leave your thoughts in the comments below!</em></p><h2 id="best-portrait-photography-lenses-faq"> Best portrait photography lenses FAQ </h2><div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1634766075403"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Do I need a prime lens to shoot portraits?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> No, but it helps. Prime lenses have wide apertures and sharp optics, which is why they are preferred by portrait photographers. Today&#39;s zoom lenses are better than the zooms of ten or twenty years ago, but you will still get the best results with a prime lens.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1634766149961"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">What is the best focal length for portraits?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> While everyone has their own preferences, 85mm is often considered to be a good portrait focal length. If you can only get one portrait lens, I would recommend going with an 85mm; this works well for headshots, full-body portraits, and group shots, too.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1634766289723"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">How can I shoot portraits with the kit zoom lens that came with my camera?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> While I do not recommend kit zoom lenses for paid client work, it is certainly possible to shoot portraits with them. Zoom in as far as you can go, open your aperture as wide as possible, put a lot of distance between your subject and the background, and you can get some decent shots.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1634766420612"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Is a DSLR or mirrorless camera better for portraits?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> Either type of camera is fully capable of producing great portraits. Mirrorless cameras have features like eye-detect autofocus that can certainly help, but even today many photographers still prefer DSLRs over mirrorless. It all comes down to personal preference. Thankfully, if you currently shoot with a Nikon or Canon DSLR and want to upgrade to mirrorless someday, both companies make adapters that let you use your current lenses on mirrorless cameras without any drop in quality.</p></div></div><p> The post<a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lens-for-portrait-photography/">16 Best Lenses for Portrait Photography (2023)</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com">Digital Photography School</a> .
