（换句话说，你不想从下面向上射击或从上面向下射击。你想要尽可能直接、正前方的角度。）</p><p>并检查太阳的位置，因为你<em>不</em>应该向它拍摄。首选来自您身后或您所在位置左侧或右侧的光线。</p><p>此外，鸟类通常会在风中起飞和降落，因此了解风向将有助于您预测所拍摄鸟类的飞行路径。</p><p>在飞行地点找到最好的鸟需要<em>大量</em>的试验和错误。你去的许多地点都是无用的——但这是值得的，因为偶尔你会发现一个可以一次又一次返回的区域。侦察足够多的地点，您最终会得到这些热点的详细列表！

但作为初学者，在昏暗的光线下拍摄会拍出惨淡的照片。）</p><p>那么在飞行摄影中什么才是鸟类的最佳光线呢？</p><p>早晨和傍晚的金色光芒，通常被称为<em><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-photograph-golden-hour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">黄金时段</a></em>，由于其绚丽、柔和的效果，是完美的。确实，只要你在日出后的两个小时和日落前的两个小时内拍摄，光线就会看起来很棒（不过请记住，你需要仔细选择你的位置；你希望从正面照亮鸟儿，而不是从侧面照亮）。后退！）。</p><p>另外，因为您拍摄的是空中的鸟类，所以即使您在黄金时间之前或之后拍摄，您仍然会在拍摄对象上获得良好的照明（只需确保光线不会变得太刺眼！）。</p><h2

target="_blank" aria-label="frame-filling images (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">充满画面的图像</a>，则需要尽可能让自己隐形。</p><p>首先避免穿颜色鲜艳的衣服。当您接近鸟类热点时，您也可以保持离地面较低的位置，或使用自然掩护物（例如树木）。当你变得更认真时，你可能会考虑穿迷彩服，使用百叶窗，甚至从车窗拍摄（鸟类往往不太受汽车打扰，所以你经常可以开车靠近通常会飞走的鸟类）。</p><p>一旦找到一个好地方，就保持相对静止。不要做任何突然的动作。相反，在设置相机时保持一切缓慢而稳定，然后如果可以的话坐下（我建议保持低调）。</p><h2

data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>要在飞行摄影中确定鸟类的正确相机设置，您需要平衡您的艺术需求（例如景深和清晰度）与曝光需求。它可能会变得有点复杂，特别是因为为飞行中的鸟类选择设置<em>不同于</em><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/bird-photography-camera-setting/" target="_blank" aria-label="settings for photographing birds more generally (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">为更一般的拍摄鸟类选择设置</a>。</p><p>不过，我确实有一些建议可以极大地简化流程。</p><p>首先，使用<a aria-label="Aperture Priority mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">光圈优先模式</a>；这样，您就可以随时控制光圈和 ISO（通过提高 ISO 或扩大光圈，您可以提高<a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">快门速度</a>）。</p><p>其次，将光圈设置为 f/8 左右。这是你的镜头最清晰的地方，而且它会给你足够的景深来获得翼尖到翼尖的清晰度。</p><p>第三，将ISO设置为最低值，通常在ISO 100左右。这里的目标是避免提高ISO，这会产生<em>噪音</em>。也就是说，在弱光条件下拍摄时，您需要提高 ISO 来提高快门速度。</p><p>现在，对于飞行中的鸟类摄影来说，快门速度可能是最重要的设置，因为如果速度太慢，鸟的翅膀就会模糊，这样看起来很少会很好。一般来说，我建议使用至少 1/1000 秒的快门速度，1/2000 秒及以上更好。 （不过，你的最低快门速度会根据鸟的速度而改变；飞行中的大型鸟类，如苍鹭和鹅，速度很慢，而飞行中的小型鸟类，如鹪鹩，则在天空中飞翔。）</p><p>无论如何，拨入光圈和 ISO，然后查看快门速度，相机将纯粹根据曝光考虑来选择快门速度。问问自己：这个快门速度足够快吗？如果是这样，那么你就很出色了，但如果不是，你需要提高 ISO 或扩大光圈，以便你的相机有足够的光线来提高快门速度。</p><p>我建议在调整光圈之前提高 ISO。但是，如果您的 ISO 逐渐进入嘈杂区域，那么扩大光圈可能是有意义的，而不是冒着图像噪音过大的风险。</p><p>拨入所有设置后，我建议您进行快速测试。拍摄一些附近鸟类的照片（它们不需要很好地构图 - 目标是确保快门速度足够快并且光圈足够窄）。放大相机液晶显示屏，确保一切看起来都很好，然后享受拍摄飞行中的鸟类的乐趣！ </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"

data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>鸟类速度很快，这意味着您需要付出一些认真的努力才能获得始终如一的锐利镜头。</p><p>首先，您需要将相机设置为连续<a aria-label="focusing mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/choosing-a-focus-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">对焦模式</a>。这样，每当您半按快门按钮时，焦点就会接合，然后随着拍摄对象的移动而<em>重新对焦</em>。 （尼康和许多其他制造商将这种模式称为“AF-C”，而佳能将其称为“AI Servo”。）</p><p>您应该将相机设置为最快<a aria-label="burst mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/burst-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">连拍模式</a>，也称为连拍模式。当鸟儿飞过时，您可以快速连续地捕捉一系列图像。</p><p>接下来，您需要启用相机的跟踪 AF 区域模式。它会告诉你的相机在画面中跟踪这只鸟，即使它左右、上下飞行等。具体细节将取决于你的相机，但某种形式的“跟踪”应该可以解决问题。另外，如果您的相机提供此功能，请尝试激活动物眼自动对焦，它将通过画面专门识别和跟踪鸟类的眼睛。</p><p>然后，一旦设置好相机，当鸟儿 a) 栖息并即将起飞，或 b) 飞向远处时，就开始对焦它。半按快门按钮，并在鸟起飞和/或靠近时继续跟踪它。一旦鸟儿飞入主要区域，完全按下快门按钮，连拍几张照片，然后——祈祷吧！ – 你会得到一个好的结果。</p><p>一些额外的提示：</p><p>当鸟儿飞过时，即使停止射击，也要继续平移。与突然停止相比，这种连续运动将使您的最后一张图像更好地保持焦点。</p><p>此外，当鸟儿飞过时平移时，您需要将平移速度与鸟儿的速度相匹配。即使您被迫降低快门速度，完美的摇摄也能让鸟儿保持清晰，而背景则变得模糊。</p><p>目标是保持鸟眼的焦点和锐利；这是关键。如果您手持设置，请尝试将左手放在镜头镜筒下方，并将肘部靠近身体，因为这将帮助您尽可能稳定地操纵相机。如果您站立，请将双腿分开，以形成坚固的基础。</p><p>最后，如果您打算暂时固定您的位置和位置，我建议您使用三脚架。这将有助于保持相机稳定，特别是当您使用非常重的镜头时。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="wait-for-contrasting-backgrounds"> 9.等待对比背景</h2><p>在之前关于飞行摄影中鸟类的技巧中，我讨论了正确对焦的重要性。但我想分享另一件对我自己的摄影来说非常宝贵的物品：</p><p>寻找对比鲜明的背景。</p><p>假设您正在跟踪小鸟以锁定焦点，但您的镜头正在寻找焦点。请记住，对焦系统需要拍摄对象和背景之间有足够好的对比度才能确定拍摄对象 - 当鸟儿在蓝天等干净的背景上飞行时，自动对焦系统通常很容易锁定焦点。</p><p>因此，不要左右射击，而是等到鸟飞过对比鲜明的背景，或者重新定位自己，以便下次鸟飞过时，背景会更加对比鲜明。</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span

(opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-space-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"

class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="adjust-your-point-of-view"> 12.调整你的观点</h2><p>通常，鸟类飞行照片好坏的区别在于视角。这只鸟是从下面捕获的吗？脑袋上？与眼睛齐平吗？每次改变视角，效果都会不同。</p><p>例如，拍摄一只在头顶上方飞行的鸟与拍摄一只飞过的鸟会产生不同的效果。一张飞向你的鸟的照片比一张飞离你的鸟的照片产生的影响更大。用眼睛水平拍摄一只飞翔的鸟会产生亲密的效果。</p><p>因此，在拍摄时，不要满足于单一视角。改变一下吧！</p><div

eBay 等市场上。</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-77118" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px;

</figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="step-ask-any-relevant-questions">第 2 步：询问任何相关问题</h3><p>如果您走进相机店并亲自检查您想要购买的装备（请参阅下一步），则可能没有必要。但如果您在网上购买，您通常会使用有限的商品描述，如果您不小心，您最终可能会购买到不符合您期望的相机或镜头。</p><p>这就是为什么仔细阅读装备描述并提出具体问题以收集任何缺失的信息非常重要。有些卖家根本不知道某些相关的花絮，需要一些提示才能获得所需的信息。别人会刻意隐瞒相关信息，购买前一定要查明真相。</p><p>你可能会想：如果卖家不透露相关信息，我就直接退货吧？</p><p>不幸的是，事情没那么简单。根据退货政策，您可能只能退回与描述不符的商品。如果描述非常模糊，您可能很难获得免费退货 - 而如果您提出具体问题，您的情况就会容易得多！</p><p>因此，请确保您提交了大量相关问题。购买二手相机时，请询问：</p><ul><li>相机有多少个<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/finding-your-cameras-current-shutter-actuations/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter actuations (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">快门按钮</a>？</li><li>传感器是否有明显的污垢或灰尘点？</li></ul><p>购买二手镜头时，请询问：</p><ul><li>镜片是否有真菌或雾霾？</li><li>镜头的前部或后部元件是否有划痕？</li><li>镜头是否有大块灰尘？</li><li>镜头自动对焦效果好吗？</li><li>镜头自动对焦机构是否有沙子？</li></ul><p>其中一些问题可能看起来很奇怪，但您会对相机或镜头中出现的情况感到惊讶。安全总比后悔好！</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="step-inspect-the-gear"> 第三步：检查齿轮</h3><p>如果您打算亲自购买装备，通常可以在同意购买设备之前进行检查。但如果您在线购买装备，则需要在收到时进行彻底检查。毕竟，您不想使用镜头一个月后才发现某个功能不起作用！</p><p>此检查应根据您购买的商品而有所不同。 </p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section

href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture blades (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">光圈叶片</a>干净并且可以自由移动，然后尝试变焦环和对焦环。根据镜头型号的不同，环提供一定阻力的情况并不罕见，但请确保它们都能相对平稳地运行。检查镜头的自动对焦功能并确保对焦顺畅。</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span

id="shutter-count">快门数</h3><p>相机的快门次数就是快门在其使用寿命内被触发的次数。</p><p> （快门计数也称为<em>快门启动</em>次数。）</p><p>一般来说，快门计数可以很好地表明相机的使用量，类似于检查汽车的行驶里程。相机根据快门耐用性进行评级，发烧友型号的额定拍摄次数通常约为 150,000 张，专业型号的额定拍摄次数为 300,000 张或更高。</p><p>浏览时，快门次数低通常表示使用次数较少的项目。 2-5年相机的拍摄次数少于10,000张是非常低的，正常数量在30,000-50,000张左右。</p><p>如果相机的计数非常高，达到 100,000 或更多，那么最好避免使用它，特别是因为这个数字还可以让您稍微了解所有者对相机的使用情况。较高计数的相机可能用于专业用途（以及更艰苦的生活），而较低计数则表明休闲消费者使用。</p><p>那么如何知道相机的快门次数呢？</p><p>二手相机出售时通常会提供该编号。但如果您不确定，可以根据型号通过多种方式找到答案。查看这篇文章以获取指导： <a

1.了解事件</h2><p>在弱光下捕捉室内体育赛事或舞蹈表演的精髓不仅仅在于拥有合适的设备或了解正确的设置。当我在下面详细讨论这些内容时，我想从更重要的事情开始：</p><p>了解您正在拍摄的内容。您对活动了解得越多，您的投篮就会越好。</p><p>从基础开始：学习游戏规则。如果是篮球，知道关键比赛何时发生。如果是舞蹈表演，请了解动作的顺序。这些知识可以让您预测行动。您将知道自己的位置以及何时按下快门。</p><p>但不要就此止步。如果您要拍摄一支球队或团体的整个赛季，请了解球员或表演者。每个运动员、每个舞者都有自己独特的风格。了解它们可以帮助您预测它们的动作，让您捕捉到更引人注目的个人图像。</p><p>感受赛事的最佳方式之一是参加排练或之前的比赛。观察动作如何展开。注意照明条件。计划好可能的镜头——然后，当大型比赛发生时，您将能够在比赛<em>即将</em>升温之前想象出令人惊叹的画面。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-manual-mode"> 2. 使用手动模式</h2><p>在您考虑按下快门按钮之前，请确保您的相机已成功设置 - 从拍摄模式开始。 </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-93935

mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">手动模式的</a>用武之地；它给你完全的控制权，所以它通常是一个不错的选择。但如果您不习惯使用手动或正在处理不断变化的光线条件，请改用<a

class="ek-link">光圈优先</a>。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-fast-lenses"> 3.使用快速镜头</h2><p>接下来，您需要决定使用哪个镜头。幸运的是，这是一个简单的过程：选择最长且<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/what-is-a-fast-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="fastest (i.e., wide-apertured) lens (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">最快（即大光圈）的镜头</a>。弱光环境意味着您需要一个快速镜头来让充足的光线进入。由于动作主体往往很远，因此您还需要更长的焦距。我个人使用 70-200mm f/2.8 镜头，效果很好，不过您也可以根据情况选择更长（或更宽）的镜头。 </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-93937

每个初学者摄影师都必须掌握的概念。一旦知道如何使用快门速度，您就可以随意拍摄锋利的照片。您还准备捕获有趣的艺术效果（例如快门速度模糊）。</p><p>在本文中，我将带您完成所有快门速度基础知识，包括：</p><ul><li>快门速度的简单定义</li><li>快门速度对您的图像的影响</li><li>缓慢与快门速度的差异（和重要性）</li><li>如何使用不同的快门速度以取得出色的结果</li><li>如何使用创意快门速度技术玩乐</li></ul><p>因此，如果您准备成为快门速度摄影专家，那么让我们开始潜入！</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-is-shutter-speed"> 什么是快门速度？</h2><p>快门速度是相机拍照时相机快门打开的时间长度。</p><p>您按下快门按钮，快门打开预定时间段（即快门速度），然后关闭快门，图像已完成。</p><p>快门打开时，光线会撞到相机传感器；因此，快门速度的时间越长，传感器收到的光就越多。如下一部分所讨论的那样，这具有各种效果。</p><p>请注意，快门速度以秒为单位（或一秒钟的分数）测量。这是一些常见的快门速度：</p><ul><li> 10秒</li><li>1秒</li><li>1/10</li><li> 1/30秒</li><li>1/60秒</li><li>1/125秒</li><li>1/250秒</li><li>1/500秒</li><li>1/1000秒</li><li>1/1600秒</li><li>1/2000秒</li></ul><p>列表以长长的10秒的快门速度开始，但是快门速度变短，以闪电般的1/2000速度快门速度结束。</p><p>请注意，上面列出的快门速度测量肯定并不全面。大多数数码单反相机和无反光摄像机都可以让您从30秒的快门速度一直降低到1/4000或1/8000，尽管您也可以访问一种特殊模式（称为灯泡模式），可以使您保持快门按钮的打开对于您所需的时间。</p><p>因此，尽管大多数摄像机都提供了数十个基本快门速度选项（如果愿意的话，快门速度<em>预设</em>），但实际上您可以使用数千个可能的快门速度，所有这些速度都使相机传感器暴露于略有不同的光线。合理？ </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-shutter-speed-affects-your-photos">快门速度如何影响您的照片</h2><p>快门速度以两种关键的方式影响您的图像：</p><ol><li>它增加并减少<a

class="ek-link">暴露</a>（即图像亮度）</li><li>它增加并降低清晰度（即图像细节）</li></ol><p>让我们依次看看每个项目。 </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shutter-speed-increases-and-decreases-exposure">快门速度增加并降低暴露</h3><p>快门速度的时间越长，击中相机传感器的光越多，<em>图像就会越亮</em>。</p><p>因此，如果您以1/1000秒的方式拍摄树，则将快门速度降低到1s，第二张图像（其快门速度较慢）将明显更明显。</p><p>这有重大后果。摄影的大部分是要在场景中实现适当的亮度或<em>曝光</em>，并且通过调整快门速度，您可以获得不同的结果。因此，快门速度是三个相机曝光变量之一（以及<a aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">光圈</a>和<a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> ）。</p><p>因此，当您与相机外出时，您需要调整快门速度以实现良好的平衡曝光。这些细节将取决于场景，但要注意爆炸的亮点和剪裁阴影。换句话说，请确保您不会过分或不充实，以至于您在照片的最轻或最黑暗的部分中丢失了信息。 </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shutter-speed-increases-and-decreases-sharpness">快门速度增加并降低清晰度</h3><p>更快的快门速度<em>冻结</em>运动。快门速度<em>模糊</em>运动。</p><p>因此，如果您在1/4000时拍摄飞行中的鸟，每个羽毛都会酥脆，甚至是拍打的翅膀。但是，如果您在1/15秒的时间里拍摄同一只鸟，那将是一种难以理解的模糊。</p><p>现在，冻结运动所需的快门速度将根据移动物体的速度而改变。羽毛在空气中漂移可能需要1/200s的快门速度，以最大程度的清晰度，而快速移动的汽车可能需要1/2000或更多。</p><div

1/60s的快门速度大约是1/125的两倍，因此使光的量增加了两倍。因此，1/250s比1/125的速度快，而<em>两个</em>停止速度比1/60的速度快。</p><p>这与光圈和ISO有什么关系？当您意识到ISO和孔径也以稍微不同的方式测量ISO和孔径时，连接就会发挥作用。这意味着我们可以将快门速度与ISO和光圈直接相关联。</p><div class="wp-block-image

除非您的快门速度足够快。</p><p>最低的手持式快门速度因人而异，而且取决于您的镜头（更长的镜头会增加相机摇动）。得益于图像稳定技术，一些相机和镜头可以使手持式射击速度较慢。但是，我建议至少在做一些测试之前，我建议将快门速度保持在1/60左右的左右，而长镜头左右为1/60左右。</p><p>当然，如果您没有动作拍摄场景，您确实有其他选择：您可以与三脚架一起拍摄。假设您的三脚架很坚固，它将让您尽可能低地降低快门速度（这就是您可以在本文稍后讨论的那样，您可以创造出美丽的移动水效果！）。

id="what-shutter-speed-is-best-basic-recommendations">哪种快门速度最好？基本建议</h2><p>现在，您已经熟悉选择快门速度的来源和出局，我想分享一些选择正确的快门速度的基本建议。这些建议并不<em>总是</em>有效的，但是在调整相机设置时，它们肯定应该为您提供一个很好的起点。 </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-best-shutter-speeds-for-landscape-photography">景观摄影的最佳快门速度</h3><p>景观摄影师通常有两个与快门相关的目标：</p><ol><li>从前景到背景尖锐的图像</li><li>在移动的水和云中创建艺术运动模糊</li></ol><p>现在，前景到背景的清晰度是指<em>深入的景深</em>。尽管这与快门速度没有直接相关，但快门速度的时间越长，实现深度的景深就越容易。</p><p> （为什么？景深由光圈控制 - 更长的快门速度使您可以在不忽视场景的情况下调整光圈。）</p><p>另外，正如我在上一节中解释的那样，如果您想要艺术动作模糊，则需要延长快门速度。</p><p>底线：景观摄影在长时间的曝光下蓬勃发展。大多数景观摄影师在明亮的日光下以1秒至1/200的射击，随着灯光下降，快门的速度会慢。许多景观射击者在日出，日落和夜间以1/30至30s（或更多）（或更多）工作。</p><p>这种冗长的快门速度只能使用三脚架。如果您<em>没有</em>三脚架，那么通常最好将快门速度降低，而不会创建相机摇动（通常在1/60左右）。 </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-best-shutter-speeds-for-portrait-photography">肖像摄影的最佳快门速度</h3><p>肖像摄影师在选择快门速度时可以非常灵活。关键目标是通过避免摄像机震动和运动模糊来保持敏锐度 - 但是由于您通常可以指导您的主题并从稳定的位置工作，所以这应该不会太难。</p><p>如果您要拍摄固定的主题，请随时将快门速度降低到1/80左右（尽管1/200更安全）。</p><p>而且，如果您要拍摄一个动人的主题，例如跳舞，我建议您在1/500及以后工作。 </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-best-shutter-speeds-for-wildlife-and-bird-photography">野生动植物和鸟类摄影的最佳快门速度</h3><p>鸟类和野生动植物摄影通常涉及用长镜头捕获快速移动的主题。</p><p>因此，您通常应该使用可以摆脱的最快快门速度。对于较慢的动物，1/500是一个合理的起点（如果动物完全固定，则<em>可以</em>降低 - 只要确保将镜头保持在三脚架或手持式上，请尽可能稳定）。</p><p>对于快速移动的动物和鸟类，是1/1000的起点。当动作发生时，我真的建议您将快门速度推向1/2000及以后。 </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-best-shutter-speeds-for-street-photography">街头摄影的最佳快门速度</h3><p>街头摄影师往往比其他射手更关心清晰度，因此您选择的快门速度并不那么重要。</p><p>就是说，如果您在拍摄和/或拍照步行者时走路，那么1/250是一个安全的起点。如果您和您的受试者都是静止的，那么您通常可以以1/100或较慢的速度拍摄（假设您使用良好的手持技术和相对较短的镜头）。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="tips-and-ideas-for-using-your-shutter-speed-creatively">创造性地使用快门速度的提示和想法</h2><p>我很喜欢尝试不同的快门速度的忠实拥护者，这似乎是无穷无尽的。仅使用快门速度，您就可以限制摄影，而错过了许多出色的图像。我认为，快门速度是使您成为最具创造力并捕获独特且视觉上有趣的图像的设置。</p><p>通过仅稍微更改快门速度（例如，从1/120S到1/60），图像看起来完全不同并讲述了一个不同的故事。这只是创造性地使用快门速度的一些想法和技术： </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-fast-shutter-speed-to-freeze-motion"> 1.使用快门速度冻结运动</h3><p>在高动作或戏剧性时期，您可以使用非常快的快门速度停止运动。</p><p>为此，您将希望快门速度至少为1/250。就像下面的水滴通过空中翻转一样，您可能希望快门速度<em>明显</em>更快。 （下面显示的图像以1/8000拍摄！） </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-77345 size-full

（这将导致景深度浅，但是这种效果通常在动作照片中看起来不错！）您可能还需要增加ISO（在明亮的日子里有点，在多云的日子或室内<em>很多</em>）。</p><p>此类快速速度速度照片的另一个提示：学会预测镜头。随着大多数现代相机提供的连续射击速度，您可能会很想将快门按钮放下并爆炸 - 但是根据我的经验，这很少有效。通常，只有通过预测动作并在正确的时刻触发百叶窗来捕获完美的时刻。 </p><h3

href="https://digital-photography-school.com/9-top-tips-for-shooting-waterfalls-creeks-and-streams/">瀑布）</a>时，长期暴露是一种很好的技术。这也非常适合轻型踪迹摄影。</p><p>在大多数情况下，您的快门速度挑战是要在相机中获得足够的光线以获得快门速度，但是当进行缓慢的摄影摄影时，通常会面临相反的问题。挑战是<em>限制</em>进入相机的光量，以便您可以将快门打开很长时间而不会过度曝光图像。</p><p>为此，首先将光圈关闭到最小的设置，然后使用相机上的最低ISO设置。如果这些动作不够限制光，则需要使用中性密度过滤器。这些过滤器限制了进入相机的光量。</p><p>它们具有不同的优势，尽管典型的值在2到10点之间。获取这些ND过滤器之一（或具有不同优势的几个不同的ND过滤器），如果您认为可能想尝试使用慢速速度速度的方法，请将其保存在包中。

This information can help you decide on the best times and places to shoot, aligning with the mood or atmosphere you want to create.</p><p> And don&#39;t be afraid to experiment with different weather conditions; rain, fog, and storms can add an unexpected touch of magic to your black and white landscapes. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="make-sure-you-understand-composition"> 4.

In fact, to capture good <a aria-label="color landscape photos (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/colorful-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">color landscape photos</a> , you often need to just find a dramatic scene and <a aria-label="photograph it in beautiful light (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/landscape-photography-about-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">photograph it in beautiful light</a> . (That&#39;s why so many color landscape shots are taken during the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-photograph-golden-hour/" target="_blank" aria-label="golden hour (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">golden hour</a> or just after sunset.)</p><p> But black and white landscape photography is very, <em>very</em> different. Without color, you can&#39;t rely on pure color and light; you have to captivate the viewer by creating strong compositions. Yes, light matters, but composition matters, too. And unless you can really master this technical skill, you&#39;ll struggle to produce compelling images.</p><p> In other words, instead of just chasing great light, you need to learn to look for the building blocks of photographic composition: leading lines, shapes, patterns, tonal contrast, and texture. When you approach a scene, try to ignore interesting colors. Do what you can to <em>see</em> in black and white so that you quickly recognize eye-catching geometry, impressive textures, and more.</p><p> For example, this photo works well in black and white because of the tonal contrast between the twin waterfalls and the dark rocks, not to mention the balanced geometry (two twin rectangles of light on an all-black background):</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-113203" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:80%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-1.jpg?resize=750%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="black and white landscape waterfall" class="wp-image-113203" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-1.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-1.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-1.jpg?resize=600%2C480&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-1.jpg?resize=717%2C574&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Yet the average viewer (or average color photographer) probably wouldn&#39;t notice these features at first glance. Instead, they&#39;d focus on the hues of the pool or the rich green leaves just outside the frame. And until you learn to see in black and white, you probably would, too! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="study-the-work-of-famous-black-and-white-landscape-photographers"> 5. Study the work of famous black and white landscape photographers</h2><p> We don&#39;t naturally see the world in black and white. Therefore, learning to work in monochrome takes some practice. It&#39;s almost like learning a new language; you have to spend time really recognizing what works in B&amp;W photos and what doesn&#39;t (which is often very <em>different</em> from what works in color landscapes).</p><p> Now, you can figure out how to make a great black and white landscape through a lot of trial and error, but why reinvent the wheel? Instead, deepen your understanding of B&amp;W landscape images by looking at the work of masters – the folks who already spent dozens of years perfecting their compositions, lighting, settings, and techniques.</p><p> I recommend starting with <a aria-label="Ansel Adams (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/quotes-from-master-photographer-ansel-adams-and-how-you-to-apply-them-to-your-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Ansel Adams</a> and <a aria-label="Edward Weston (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/lessons-masters-of-photography-edward-weston/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Edward Weston</a> , who shot predominantly in black and white and whose work is closely aligned with contemporary landscape aesthetics. You might also check out Harry Callahan (if you&#39;re interested in more intimate landscape shots) as well as Wynn Bullock (who captured wonderfully atmospheric photos).</p><p> Also, look at what modern-day photographers are doing on <a aria-label="Instagram (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.instagram.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">Instagram</a> and <a aria-label="500px (opens in a new tab)" href="https://500px.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">500px</a> . Some names to search for include Cole Thompson, Rob Dweck, Arnaud Bertrande, Thibault Roland, Joel Tjintjelaar, and Nathan Wirth.</p><p> When you look at the work of B&amp;W landscape shooters, ask yourself: What makes their black and white landscape photos so powerful? What light do they use? What photographic techniques (eg, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/step-by-step-guide-to-long-exposure-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="long exposure (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">long exposure</a> ) do they employ? How do they approach composition?</p><p> The answers will teach you a lot about black and white photography and will help you understand which elements and scenes really lend themselves to a monochrome treatment. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="look-for-tonal-contrast-and-texture"> 6.

Take the photo below as an example; the jetties are dark and the sky is much lighter. <em>That</em> is tonal contrast. <em>And it looks amazing in black and white</em> .</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-113204" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-2.jpg?resize=750%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="lighthouses out at sea in black and white" class="wp-image-113204" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-2.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-2.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-2.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-2.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-2.jpg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-2.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The alternative – low tonal contrast scenes, where the entire shot is covered with, say, midtones – tends to look very mushy and flat. Tones don&#39;t separate out, key elements fade into one another, and the composition loses impact. While color photographers may pursue scenes without tonal contrast, they can rely on changes in color to differentiate key elements. In black and white, however, that&#39;s not an option, and it becomes all about the tones.</p><p> <a aria-label="Texture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-texture-to-improve-your-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Texture</a> (and contrast <em>between</em> textures) looks great, too. If you think about the elements that often appear in B&amp;W landscape photos – cliffs, rocks, grass, trees, mountains, and oceans, along with human-made objects like piers, jetties, and old barns – you&#39;ll notice that they all have distinct textures. Some feature rough, heavy surfaces, while others are intensely smooth.</p><p> In the photo below, the arch, the cliffs in the distance, and the rocks in the foreground are all heavily textured. The sea and the sky are much smoother. There is a strong contrast between the roughness of the rocks and the smoothness of the sea and the sky. And thanks to that textural contrast, the photo is much more impactful!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-113205" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:56.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="423" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-3.jpg?resize=750%2C423&#038;ssl=1" alt="long exposure rock at sea" class="wp-image-113205" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-3.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-3.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-3.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-3.jpg?resize=717%2C404&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shoot-in-monochrome-mode"> 7.

This makes it easier to imagine how scenes will turn out in black and white if you&#39;re not shooting in monochrome mode (or if you don&#39;t have your camera to your eye).</p><p> Personally, I think that black and white electronic viewfinders are an absolute game-changer. If you&#39;re serious about B&amp;W landscape photography, it&#39;s probably worth switching to a mirrorless camera for that feature alone!

Grab one (or more) of these accessories, and you&#39;ll be able to capture jaw-dropping images beyond your wildest dreams.</p><p> (Am I exaggerating? Honestly, I don&#39;t think so. Neutral density filters are a <em>huge</em> deal.)</p><p> But what makes ND filters so special?</p><p> ND filters are basically dark pieces of glass that go in front of your lens and prevent light from hitting your camera sensor. In other words, ND filters <em>block out the light</em> , which lets you lengthen your shutter speed while retaining a balanced exposure.</p><p> You see, as a landscape photographer without an ND filter, you&#39;ll often be using a <a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> between 1/2s and 1/125s (assuming you&#39;re shooting with a relatively narrow <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> of f/13 or so, which is generally一个好主意）。</p><p> At times, you may want to lengthen your shutter speed for creative effect – so that you can blur water, stretch clouds, and create a beautiful ethereal look in your photos. But in most situations, dropping the shutter speed beyond 1/2s or so just can&#39;t be done. The light is too strong; if you try it, you&#39;ll end up with an overexposed image.</p><p> Unless you have an item that can block out the light – such as a neutral density filter! The ND filter will keep your camera from overexposing the scene even when you&#39;re dealing with lots of light. That way, you can push out your shutter speed to 5s, 10s, and more, and you can get the stretchy clouds and blurry water that you&#39;re after.</p><p> Check out the photos below. The first was taken at dusk with a shutter speed of 1/5s. This exposure time was slow enough to introduce some blur into the water (look at the foreground wave), but it wasn&#39;t slow enough to really flatten out the water while making the clouds turn into interesting streaks.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-113207" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:56.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="423" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?resize=750%2C423&#038;ssl=1" alt="relatively short seaside rock exposure" class="wp-image-113207" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?resize=717%2C404&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> But I added a neutral density filter and made the next photo using a shutter speed of 180 seconds.

Don&#39;t just take photos like everyone else</h2><p> Black and white landscape photographer Cole Thompson has an interesting idea. He practices what he calls “photographic abstinence,” where he doesn&#39;t look at the work of other photographers before heading to a new location. The idea is that it enables him to see the landscape through his own eyes without being influenced by other people&#39;s photos of the same elements.</p><p> I&#39;ve never taken this idea to its extreme. I believe it&#39;s important to research an area before you go; that way, you can find its most photogenic parts and avoid boring areas. But this does lead to a problem: The most powerful images you see tend to stick in your mind. The natural tendency is to want to create similar images – so if you spend time researching locations, you&#39;ll often end up capturing photos that look like everybody else&#39;s.</p><p> I encourage you to push back against this tendency! Recognize that certain subjects are photographed in particular ways. Use that knowledge to capture images that are different – images that are truly <em>you</em> .</p><p>让我举一个例子。 A few years ago, I visited the Playa de las Catedrales (Cathedral Beach) in northern Spain. Search for it on Google or 500px, and most photos will look something like this, showing the cathedral-like arches for which the beach is named:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-113209" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=750%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="arches in black and white" class="wp-image-113209" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Anybody who visits the beach will naturally want to take photos of the arches. They&#39;re the reason the spot is famous, after all. But if you only focus on the arches, you&#39;ll miss other (equally compelling!) possibilities.</p><p> So after traveling to Cathedral Beach and getting my rock arch photos, I really started <em>looking</em> . I saw some rocks in the sea that made an interesting minimalistic composition, and I captured the following photo:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-113210" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:40.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="304" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-8.jpg?resize=750%2C304&#038;ssl=1" alt="long exposure rocks in water" class="wp-image-113210" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-8.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-8.jpg?resize=300%2C122&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-8.jpg?resize=600%2C243&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-8.jpg?resize=717%2C291&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> It doesn&#39;t feature famous arches.

The files don&#39;t include any color information, which means that images can become pretty confusing. Various subjects blend into one another, and the viewer may struggle to understand the scene.</p><p> Now, one way to deal with this tendency is to include plenty of tonal contrast. It&#39;s a good technique, and I highly recommend it. But if you want to <em>really</em> elevate your B&amp;W photos, you should also aim to cut down on extraneous elements in your compositions. That way, the viewer will know exactly where to focus – and they&#39;ll be able to instantly interpret the shot.</p><p> So before capturing a new image, ask yourself: Does the frame include any elements that might distract the viewer? Is the viewer able to clearly identify the main subject?

And it&#39;s true: Composition makes a huge difference.</p><p> But make sure you don&#39;t fixate so heavily on composition that you forget about other key photographic elements – such as lighting.</p><p> Color landscape photographers love shooting during the golden hours, and this soft-yet-direct light also looks great in black and white. The low sun will create long shadows, which you can use as powerful composition elements (eg, <a aria-label="leading lines (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-leading-lines-for-better-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">leading lines</a> ).</p><p> But as a black and white shooter, you can head out at other times and capture equally compelling images. For instance, overcast days produce soft, intimate light that reveals detail in forest and mountain scenes. And even harsh midday sun – which is hated by most color landscape photographers – can make for interesting black and white shots. The trick is to use the contrasty light to your advantage; let it create shadow geometry, then incorporate the shadows into your compositions.</p><p> <a aria-label="Blue hour (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-quick-tips-for-better-blue-hour-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Blue hour</a> is another great time to shoot black and white landscapes. The light is wonderfully soft, and if you can find a moving subject (eg, ocean waves), you&#39;ll be able to capture ethereal long exposures that look <em>outstanding</em> . </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-be-afraid-of-harsh-lighting"> 12. Don&#39;t be afraid of harsh lighting</h2><p> In the previous tip, I mentioned that harsh lighting can work well for B&amp;W landscape photos. But because shooting landscape at midday is so frowned-upon, I wanted to share a personal example to show you what I mean.</p><p> A number of years ago, I was shooting in the altiplano of Bolivia. I arrived at mid-day at the spectacular and weird Laguna Colorado. It was savagely bright; cloudless skies, high elevation, middle of the day, and within a few degrees of the equator. Lighting conditions couldn&#39;t have been worse.</p><p> While the landscape was uniformly drenched in harsh, ugly light, there was contrast in the colors of the desert. A polarizer darkened the sky and removed the worst of the glare. The resulting black-and-white conversion, was if not perfect, at least the best of a very <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/life-is-too-short-to-be-taking-photos-of-great-subjects-in-bad-light/">bad situation</a> .</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-157944" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="14 - Black and White in the Outdoors" class="wp-image-157944" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by David Shaw</figcaption></figure></div><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-157943" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="15 - Black and White in the Outdoors" class="wp-image-157943" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581-2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581-2.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Frequently traveling landscape photographers find themselves in beautiful locations at bad times, and we don&#39;t always have the freedom to return when the light is better. In such situations, consider black and white. It&#39;s not a cure-all, by any means, but <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dispelling-the-myth-of-good-light-and-bad-light/">nasty light</a> will often translate better into monochrome than full color.</p><p> The situation I described above was not unique to my trip through Bolivia. The sweet light of morning and evening lasted only minutes in the high desert, quickly replaced by glaring light. And yet contrasts in the landscape salvaged many a scene for me.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-157942" style="width:1172px"><span class="space" style="width:1172px; padding-top:127.99%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1172" height="1500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-578.jpg?resize=1172%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="16 - Black and White in the Outdoors" class="wp-image-157942" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-578.jpg?w=1172&amp;ssl=1 1172w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-578.jpg?resize=234%2C300&amp;ssl=1 234w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-578.jpg?resize=768%2C983&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-578.jpg?resize=469%2C600&amp;ssl=1 469w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-578.jpg?resize=717%2C918&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by David Shaw </figcaption></figure></div><p></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="capture-intimate-landscape-shots"> 13.

Sometimes, the beauty lies in the details, textures, or geometry found within the scene. These intimate landscape shots can tell a different, more personal story.</p><p> Switching from a wide-angle lens to a <a aria-label="telephoto lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tips-shooting-landscapes-telephoto-lens-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">telephoto lens</a> can transform your perspective. It allows you to zoom in on specific elements, such as a lone tree, a winding path, or the intricate pattern of leaves and rocks. The compression effect of a telephoto lens can also create a unique visual relationship between the foreground and background.</p><p> Intimate shots are all about observation and imagination. Look for textures, shapes, and patterns that draw your eye. Experiment with different angles and framing to find the <a aria-label="perfect landscape composition (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/4-rules-of-composition-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">perfect landscape composition</a> . Sometimes, the most compelling images come from the most ordinary subjects, like delicate lines in the sand or the graceful curve of a branch.</p><p> Don&#39;t be afraid to get close and personal with nature. Part of the beauty of black and white photography lies in its ability to reveal the hidden artistry of the landscape.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="travel-when-you-can"> 14.

Don&#39;t just press the “Convert to Black and White” button; explore various conversion options to see what best fits your vision.</p><p> When converting to black and white, try adjusting individual color channels. This allows you to emphasize or de-emphasize different parts of the image, helping you create a visually engaging photograph. Play with the highlights and shadows, add contrast, tweak clarity, and even apply a vignette to guide the viewer&#39;s eye toward your main subject.</p><p> Editing software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop offers several good black and white conversion methods. Don&#39;t hesitate to experiment and find what works best for your particular shot. Spend time on this.

I discuss all the essentials, including settings, backgrounds, lighting, and composition; that way, you can photograph all those delicious-looking cakes, pies, cookies, hot chocolates, and lattes in all their glory!</p><p>让我们开始吧。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="carefully-arrange-your-holiday-food-setup"> 1. Carefully arrange your holiday food setup</h2><p> Sometimes, you won&#39;t have control over the placement of the food (if you&#39;re in a restaurant, say, or you&#39;re a guest at a friend&#39;s home). However, if you&#39;re making the food on your own, or you get an opportunity to adjust the food&#39;s positioning, make sure you spend some time creating a pleasing composition.</p><p> After all, nobody wants to see a mess of cookies strewn about a plate. But a carefully ordered spread of cookies with little crumbs sprinkled artfully across the tray? That looks <em>amazing</em> , and the beautiful arrangement will dramatically enhance the resulting photo.</p><p> When arranging the food, pay careful attention to the broad shapes, the colors, and the relationship of each food item to its neighbors (and to the frame as a whole). Aim to create balance throughout the scene, and see if you can enhance interest through the use of color contrast. (If you&#39;re doing Christmas food photography, green and red make for a great color combination!) Don&#39;t let things get too messy, but don&#39;t leave things looking static, either; try to create a natural setup that leads the eye around the frame.</p><p> It can also be helpful to choose a general color palette but add little color accents. For instance, the splash of red in the next photo breaks up the monotony of the warm whites and browns:</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-159279 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-159279" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-12.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Holiday food photography" class="wp-image-159279" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-12.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-12.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-12.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-12.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-12.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-12.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> It can also help to remember various <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/food-photography-composition/" target="_blank" aria-label="food photography composition guidelines (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">food photography composition guidelines</a> .

I always recommend starting with a single, well-chosen item. Then, if you want to get more complex, the key is to build the scene gradually.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-258109" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:59.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="893" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/holiday-food-photography-8.jpg?resize=1500%2C893&#038;ssl=1" alt="Holiday food photography" class="wp-image-258109" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/holiday-food-photography-8.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/holiday-food-photography-8.jpg?resize=300%2C179&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/holiday-food-photography-8.jpg?resize=600%2C357&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/holiday-food-photography-8.jpg?resize=768%2C457&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/holiday-food-photography-8.jpg?resize=717%2C427&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Begin with that one cookie. Then, perhaps introduce a rustic napkin or baking tray to add texture. Next, consider placing a second and third cookie slightly overlapping the first. Each element should be intentional, contributing to the overall narrative of your photograph. Every item in your frame should serve a purpose. If it doesn&#39;t add to the story, it should probably be removed.</p><p> As you arrange and rearrange, pay attention to the details. How does the light fall on the crumbs? What shadows do the folds of the napkin create? These small elements can transform a simple photograph into a stunning visual feast. But when in doubt, simplify. Keep your scene uncluttered and focused. After all, a single, well-shot cookie can be far more evocative than a poorly composed image of a table overflowing with treats. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-soft-flattering-light"> 3. Use soft, flattering light</h2><p> In my experience, light can make or break your food photos. By adjusting the direction of the light (overhead, front, back, or side) and by modifying the quality of the light (hard or soft), you can capture a great shot – or you can create a bland, boring, unflattering image.</p><p> So what kind of light is best for holiday food photos? First of all, make sure that you turn off your camera&#39;s pop-up flash. This will only produce harsh shadows and bright highlights, and it won&#39;t do the food any favors.</p><p> Instead, seek out soft light – such as light shining through translucent curtains or light coming through a north- or south-facing window. Soft light will help preserve detail and keep the food looking delicious, plus it&#39;ll make it easier to capture well-exposed images.</p><p> Note the difference between the hard light (created by a pop-up flash) on the left and the soft light (created by a window) on the right:</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-159267 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-159267" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:49.07%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="736" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-23.jpg?resize=1500%2C736&#038;ssl=1" alt="Holiday food photography" class="wp-image-159267" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-23.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-23.jpg?resize=300%2C147&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-23.jpg?resize=768%2C377&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-23.jpg?resize=600%2C294&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-23.jpg?resize=717%2C352&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> As for lighting direction:</p><p> Many food photographers like to use <a aria-label="side lighting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/side-lighting-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">side lighting</a> that comes from slightly <em>behind</em> the food items. The side lighting helps sculpt the food and add texture, creating a sense of three-dimensionality.</p><p> Take a look at this next shot, which is lit by the large window in the background. The light skims across the cupcake from the side, bringing out depth through highlights and shadows:</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-159274 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-159274" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:71.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1071" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-7.jpg?resize=1500%2C1071&#038;ssl=1" alt="Holiday food photography" class="wp-image-159274" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-7.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-7.jpg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-7.jpg?resize=768%2C548&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-7.jpg?resize=600%2C428&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-7.jpg?resize=717%2C512&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> I&#39;d encourage you to experiment with variations of <a aria-label="backlighting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/backlighting-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">backlighting</a> and side lighting. Direct backlight generally isn&#39;t great – it&#39;ll limit detail in your photos – but by adjusting the position of the food relative to the light, you can create different effects.

You can use these to mimic soft window light, and you won&#39;t need to worry about repositioning the food in relation to the window, nor will you need to wait for good light; instead, you can shoot whenever – and wherever – you like!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="think-about-your-angle"> 4. Think about your angle</h2><p> Once you&#39;ve determined the right arrangement and lighting for your holiday food setup, you&#39;ll want to think about <em>your</em> position in relation to the food – that is, your angle.</p><p> Food photographers use three broad approaches:</p><ol><li> Photographing from directly above</li><li> Photographing from 45 degrees</li><li> Photographing on a level with the food</li></ol><p> And while any of these approaches can work, it&#39;s important to consider how each angle will affect your final image. Shooting from directly overhead will highlight patterns and colors on top of the food, but it&#39;ll also flatten the scene. Conversely, shooting on a level with the food will emphasize its height and potentially its depth, but it won&#39;t let the viewer explore the broader patterns created by the food arrangement.</p><p> Note the difference between this holiday scene, shot from above:</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-159278 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-159278" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-11.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Holiday food photography" class="wp-image-159278" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-11.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-11.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-11.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-11.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-11.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-11.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> And this holiday scene, shot from much lower:</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-159284 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-159284" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:71.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1071" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-20.jpg?resize=1500%2C1071&#038;ssl=1" alt="Holiday food photography" class="wp-image-159284" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-20.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-20.jpg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-20.jpg?resize=768%2C548&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-20.jpg?resize=600%2C428&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-20.jpg?resize=717%2C512&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Finally, we have a third scene, which was shot on a level with the holiday cookies:</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-159282 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-159282" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-18.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Holiday food photography" class="wp-image-159282" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-18.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-18.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-18.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-18.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-18.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-18.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Each angle works well, but the results are <em>very</em> different.

Imagine capturing a steaming hot pie just as it comes out of the oven, its aroma almost wafting through the photo.听起来不错，对吧？</p><p> Waiting until the middle or end of your Christmas dinner to take photos can be a missed opportunity. Food declines rapidly. Ice melts, vegetables wilt, and fruits brown. These transformations, while natural, can rob your dishes of their photogenic qualities. Therefore, it&#39;s crucial to capture them in their prime.</p><p> That said, it&#39;s important to balance your photography with the festive atmosphere. Be respectful of those around you. If you&#39;re at a gathering, ensure that your photography doesn&#39;t disrupt the celebration. Sometimes, a quick snapshot taken discreetly can be as effective as a carefully staged shot. It&#39;s all about capturing the essence of the moment <em>without</em> getting in the way of the enjoyment. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="choose-a-complementary-background"> 6.

And if you&#39;re struggling to get a reasonably fast shutter speed while also capturing a well-exposed photo, it can help to boost the <a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> . (If you plan to regularly photograph food, a tripod can be a big help, too; it&#39;ll free you from the need to use a fast shutter speed.)</p><p> By the way, I&#39;d also encourage you to use a lens with a wide maximum aperture.

The preparation process can be equally photogenic! During the holidays, kitchens become centers of activity, filled with the warmth of cooking and the joy of family and friends.</p><p> Capturing these moments requires a slightly different approach than more standard holiday food photography. You&#39;ll want to use a reasonably fast shutter speed to freeze the action. This is especially important in dynamic kitchen environments, where hands and utensils are constantly moving. A shutter speed of around 1/125s can be a good starting point, but feel free to adjust based on the lighting and the level of activity.</p><p> As you photograph, look for stories. Maybe it&#39;s a grandparent instructing a child on a traditional recipe or grandchildren eagerly helping with simple tasks. These moments are laden with emotion and tradition, making them powerful subjects!</p><p> Be mindful of your presence in the kitchen. Move around quietly, and try not to interfere with the cooking process. With a respectful approach and a keen eye for detail, you can capture the essence of holiday cooking, which is as much about the people and the process as it is about the food itself. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="take-some-candid-images-of-people-with-food"> 9.

After all, it&#39;s not just about the dishes; it&#39;s about the experience and memories being made. Imagine catching your child&#39;s gleeful anticipation as they reach for a Christmas cookie, or the warm smiles exchanged over a family dinner. These candid shots are priceless.</p><p> When attempting this kind of candid photography, it&#39;s crucial to keep a low profile. You want to capture the essence of the moment <em>without</em> intruding. A slightly longer lens can be handy here, allowing you to photograph from a distance. And keep your camera settings ready for quick action; a faster shutter speed is essential for freezing quick movements and fleeting expressions.</p><p> But remember that respect and comfort are key. Not everyone enjoys being photographed while eating. Always ask for permission if you&#39;re not sure, and be mindful of people&#39;s privacy. With sensitivity and a bit of creativity, candid shots can truly encapsulate the spirit of holiday feasting!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="capture-some-close-ups"> 10.

Close-up photography lets you showcase these intricate details – the glistening of sugar on a cookie, the delicate patterns on a pie crust, and the vibrant colors of fresh garnishes. Such shots can transform ordinary food items into extraordinary photographic subjects.</p><p> You don&#39;t need a specialized macro lens for this. Any lens with a decent close-focusing capability will work. If possible, position your setup near a window for natural light that beautifully highlights these details. But watch out for camera shake and blurriness, especially at high magnifications.</p><p> A fast shutter speed can help, but for the ultimate sharpness, consider using a tripod. (Plus, though they may seem cumbersome, tripods encourage you to compose your shots more thoughtfully!)</p><p> Focus on the textures and colors, and experiment with different angles. Sometimes, an unusual perspective can reveal something fascinating about your subject. And as I mentioned above, pay attention to the background; a blurred backdrop can make your subject stand out even more. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="holiday-food-photography-final-words"> Holiday food photography: final words</h2><p> As we wrap up, remember that holiday food photography is about capturing the essence of the season. It&#39;s about the joy, the colors, the textures, and the people. Whether it&#39;s a simple shot of a holiday cookie or a candid moment of laughter at the dinner table, each photograph holds a story.</p><p> I encourage you to experiment with these tips and find what works best for you. Photography is a personal journey, and there&#39;s no one-size-fits-all approach. The holidays offer a perfect opportunity to practice and refine your skills, so take advantage of this festive season.</p><p> So have plenty of fun! Enjoy the delicious food!

Instead of capturing rolling hills or serene lakes, you focus on the concrete and steel that shape modern lives. For me, the beauty of cities often lies in their rich textures and layers; it&#39;s a tapestry of light, shapes, and emotions that you, as a photographer, can capture.</p><p> Bottom line: cityscape photography allows you to bring urban environments to life through your lens. From the glow of neon lights in Tokyo to the historical charm of London&#39;s cobblestone streets, it&#39;s your chance to show the world what makes a city beautiful – and what a city means to you. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="essential-cityscape-photography-gear"> Essential cityscape photography gear</h2><p> You&#39;re itching to hit the streets, camera in hand, ready to capture the city. I know the feeling, but before you head out the door, let&#39;s talk gear.</p><p> You see, in cityscape photography, the equipment you use can significantly impact your results. While it&#39;s not all about the camera and lenses, let&#39;s face it: quality gear can make your life easier and your photos even more stunning. You&#39;ll generally need three key items: a full-frame camera, a wide-angle lens, and a sturdy tripod. A neutral density filter, while optional, can also come in handy. Let&#39;s look at each in turn:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-full-frame-camera"> A full-frame camera</h3><p> These cameras offer large sensors that capture more light and generally provide a broader dynamic range than their cropped sensor counterparts. That&#39;s crucial when you&#39;re dealing with tricky lighting scenarios at dawn or dusk.</p><p> Plus, a full-frame camera&#39;s high megapixel count can be important if you&#39;re planning on going big – think wall-sized prints. But remember: more megapixels also mean larger file sizes, so you&#39;ll need ample storage space on your computer, too.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-wide-angle-lens"> A wide-angle lens</h3><p> It&#39;s possible to create stunning cityscape photography with a telephoto lens – you can use it to zoom in and highlight individual buildings and small details – but I&#39;d really recommend you start out with a wide-angle lens. A good wide-angle field of view will let you capture sweeping scenes, and you can even combine foreground and background layers for a three-dimensional effect.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254905" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-254905" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> What type of wide-angle lens is best? Beginners should try out a 24mm prime lens, which will cost very little yet still offer a wide field of view (and crisp optics). If you&#39;re willing to spend more and you want extra flexibility, a 16-35mm lens is a good bet; it&#39;ll let you capture various wide perspectives as you zoom from the ultra-wide 16mm to the tighter 35mm.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-robust-tripod"> A robust tripod</h3><p> Ah, the tripod – the unsung hero of sharp photography. In cityscape photography, you&#39;ll often find yourself shooting in less-than-ideal lighting conditions. A narrow aperture is generally a must to keep everything in focus, but this lets in less light. Combine that with the slow shutter speeds required for proper exposure, and you&#39;re in prime territory for camera shake, the leading cause of blurry photos.</p><p> That&#39;s where a sturdy tripod comes in. Opt for one that&#39;s lightweight yet solid – carbon fiber models offer the best of both worlds. At the end of the day, a good tripod might cost a chunk of change, but it&#39;ll make a <em>huge</em> difference to your cityscape shots. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-neutral-density-filter"> A neutral density filter</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256847" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:64.6%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="969" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-206.jpg?resize=1500%2C969&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-256847" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-206.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-206.jpg?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-206.jpg?resize=600%2C388&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-206.jpg?resize=768%2C496&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-206.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-206.jpg?resize=717%2C463&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Last but not least, consider adding a neutral density (ND) filter to your camera bag. While not an absolute necessity, an ND filter can elevate your daytime cityscapes by allowing for longer exposures without overexposing your shots.</p><p> These filters come in various strengths; a 10-stop ND filter is a solid starting point for those new to this game. With an ND filter, you can create mesmerizing effects like smoothing out water or capturing cloud movement, adding an artistic flair to your images. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-best-cityscape-photography-settings"> The best cityscape photography settings</h2><p> To unlock the full potential of your camera and capture those jaw-dropping cityscape images, you need to start with the right settings: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="aperture-priority-or-manual-mode"> Aperture Priority or Manual mode</h3><p> Aperture Priority mode is a fantastic place to start, especially if the very mention of Manual mode sends a shiver down your spine. This mode lets you select the aperture and ISO while your camera figures out the optimal shutter speed.</p><p> In contrast, Manual mode is for those who aren&#39;t afraid to handle everything themselves.

ISO 100 is my go-to here for pristine, noise-free images. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-generally-slow-shutter-speed"> A (generally) slow shutter speed</h3><p> Shutter speed serves as the linchpin in balancing your exposure triangle. It&#39;s essential to monitor your camera&#39;s exposure meter for guidance in selecting the appropriate shutter speed. You&#39;ll often end up using slower shutter speeds – below 1/80s or so – to keep your files looking detailed. (Note, however, that the use of a sturdy tripod is critical when working with slow shutter speeds; otherwise, you&#39;ll end up with lots of motion blur!)</p><p> For dynamic compositions involving moving objects, such as vehicles or pedestrians, a long shutter speed can introduce a captivating blur, adding a layer of complexity to your image. This effect is easiest to pull off during the blue hour when the light is low. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="lighting-in-cityscape-photography"> Lighting in cityscape photography</h2><p> In cityscape photography, lighting is your best friend and your worst enemy. It can elevate your shot from mediocre to magazine-worthy or plunge it into the depths of dullness. Let&#39;s get you equipped to make the most of it. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photograph-the-city-during-the-golden-hours"> Photograph the city during the golden hours</h3><p> First, consider the golden hours, which occurs in the (roughly) hour after sunrise and hour before sunset. Ever noticed how everything seems to glow during these times? That&#39;s because the sun is low in the sky, spreading its light at an angle that creates both depth and drama. When golden light hits skyscrapers and streets, the city transforms. Glass towers look <em>amazing</em> , and mundane streets suddenly look like they&#39;re paved with, well, gold.</p><p> To get the most out of the golden hour, it&#39;s essential to look at how the light is hitting your subjects. The textures of buildings, the hues of the reflective surfaces, and the shadows change depending on the light&#39;s direction.</p><p> But remember, the sun waits for no one! The golden hours don&#39;t last long, so you&#39;ll need to be prepared to work fast and make the most of the good lighting.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256849" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-205.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-256849" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-205.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-205.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-205.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-205.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-205.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-205.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photograph-the-city-during-blue-hour"> Photograph the city during blue hour</h3><p> Next, let&#39;s talk about the blue hour, the period just before sunrise and just after sunset when the sky takes on an ethereal blue hue.</p><p> During the blue hour, the sky grows darker and the city lights turn on. The balance of light – between the sky and the city – often becomes nearly equal, and you&#39;ll witness a stunning combination of tones.</p><p> Additionally, these lighting conditions are ideal for capturing long-exposure effects. Ever seen those cityscape photos where the clouds seem to smear across the sky, or the car lights draw vibrant lines across the roads? That&#39;s partially due to the blue hour and its magic.</p><p> Plus, with the softer light, you don&#39;t have to wrestle with harsh shadows or overblown highlights. Instead, you get serene tones that contrast with the city&#39;s frenetic energy.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256850" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:56.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="844" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-208.jpg?resize=1500%2C844&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-256850" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-208.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-208.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-208.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-208.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-208.jpg?resize=717%2C403&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photograph-the-city-at-midday"> Photograph the city at midday</h3><p> Next, there&#39;s the high-noon light, often avoided like the plague in landscape photography – but don&#39;t be so quick to dismiss it. Yes, it&#39;s harsh and creates strong shadows, but sometimes that&#39;s exactly what you need to emphasize the angular geometry of a modern city.</p><p> You see, when the sun is at its zenith, the light pours down vertically, etching out the details of buildings and streets in a way that&#39;s straightforward but striking. This is the time to embrace high-contrast compositions, where the play of light and shadow can be used to your advantage.</p><p> But what if it&#39;s cloudy? Far from being a disaster, an overcast sky can be a boon. Clouds act like a giant diffuser, spreading light evenly and softening the scene. If you&#39;ve got a cityscape that&#39;s naturally moody or industrial, a cloudy sky can amplify that aesthetic tenfold. You get to experiment with a different kind of drama, one that&#39;s quieter but just as impactful.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256853" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-256853" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-202.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Bottom line: whether you&#39;re catching the golden hour&#39;s warm embrace or exploiting the high-noon contrast, knowing how to work with light will elevate your cityscapes to new heights. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="tips-to-improve-your-cityscape-photography"> Tips to improve your cityscape photography</h2><p> Looking to elevate your cityscape shots even further? Below, I share plenty of practical tips to help you out!</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-incorporate-leading-lines-into-your-compositions"> 1. Incorporate leading lines into your compositions</h3><p> Beginners often point their camera directly at city skylines and fire away – but while there&#39;s nothing wrong with such an approach, it can get repetitive after a while, plus the images tend to look <em>flat</em> .</p><p> On the other hand, if you can incorporate a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-leading-lines-for-better-compositions/" target="_blank" aria-label="foreground line (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">foreground line</a> (or three!) that leads the eye into the image and toward key background elements, your shots will have tons of three-dimensionality. They&#39;ll also be far more interesting, as they&#39;ll take the viewer&#39;s eye on a journey from foreground to background. Check out this next image, which uses a path to lead the eye toward the mysterious light in the background: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cityscapes4.jpg?ssl=1" alt="tunnel with a lantern" title="cityscapes4.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> I&#39;d also mention that leading lines can help create order in an otherwise chaotic scene. If you&#39;re shooting in an area with lots of pedestrians or cars, for instance, a nice leading line – such as a road – can cut through the confusion and help bring the composition together.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="seek-out-reflections"> 2. Seek out reflections</h3><p> Reflections are everywhere in a city;你只需要知道去哪里找！ Buildings, water, and cars – they all offer ample opportunities for capturing compelling reflections, which can add intrigue and depth to your photos.</p><p> Note that reflections can be large and highly visible, such as the golden hues of a sunset mirrored in a row of sleek, glass buildings. Or they can be more subtle, like the fleeting image of a passerby&#39;s face reflected in the glossy hood of a car. Play with this as you capture your cityscape photos and see what you can create!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254898" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="994" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-11.jpg?resize=1500%2C994&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-254898" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-11.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-11.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-11.jpg?resize=600%2C398&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-11.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-11.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-11.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-11.jpg?resize=717%2C475&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Also, tweak your angle and adjust your focal length. Play around until you get that perfect reflection, the one that transforms a mundane scene into something magical. And don&#39;t shy away from getting low. Crouching down near a puddle can result in a surprisingly disorienting image – one that shows the world in a new, unexpected light. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-be-afraid-of-manual-focus"> 3. Don&#39;t be afraid of manual focus</h3><p> I get it: autofocus seems simple, dependable, and safe. But what happens when AF starts to falter in low-light conditions? This is where manual focus steps in to give you the control that you need.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256851" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-207.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-256851" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-207.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-207.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-207.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-207.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-207.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-207.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Switching to manual focus offers a level of precision that&#39;s often crucial when the lighting isn&#39;t ideal. So if you find your autofocus system hunting for the right spot to focus on, it&#39;s time to take matters into your own hands. Just switch your lens to manual and use your camera&#39;s LCD screen to check the focus as you zoom in on your subject. Then slowly rotate the focus ring back and forth until your subject is razor-sharp. This zooming-in method avoids the pitfalls of autofocus inaccuracies and ensures that you nail the focus every single time.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-shoot-long-exposures-at-intersections"> 4.

I&#39;d recommend using a shutter speed of at least five seconds, but you may wish to shoot for longer depending on the speed of the traffic. The goal is to keep the shutter speed long enough to blur the cars into lines of light.</p><p> (Pro tip: Make sure that your scene features some curves. Traffic moving in a straight line can look okay if you include interesting structures in the composition, but if you&#39;re focusing on the roadways from above, I highly recommend you include some bends and corners.)</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-look-for-fountains"> 5. Look for fountains</h3><p> I <em>love</em> fountains in cityscape photography. They look great when incorporated into long-exposure shots – the water will turn into a beautiful blur – and they&#39;re also just stunning points of interest to add to your compositions.</p><p> Happily, most cities are full of fountains. If you&#39;re not sure where to find a fountain or two at your next cityscape destination, pull up Google Maps and do a quick search.</p><p> Then, when you&#39;re out shooting, look for ways to include the fountains in your compositions. For instance, you can use the water to frame buildings, like this: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cityscapes6.jpg?ssl=1" alt="fountain long exposure" title="cityscapes6.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Or you can use fountains as interesting foreground subjects to add three-dimensionality to your images.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shoot-the-city-skyline"> 6.

The challenge is to capture it in a way that&#39;s unique, one that showcases your individual style.</p><p> Why not experiment with an ultra-long exposure? Or wait for a foggy day when the city becomes an ethereal dream? Don&#39;t forget the magic of beautiful light, either.

In my experience, getting up high offers a unique vantage point that most people never get to see. It takes the city you walk through every day and unveils it in a whole new light. So how you can use this strategy for jaw-dropping results?</p><p> Firstly, many cities offer observation decks specifically designed for panoramic city views. These decks often have enough space for photographers to shoot, but here&#39;s the catch: they don&#39;t generally allow tripods. So before you head to the top of that towering skyscraper, make a quick call to check if tripods are allowed. (Don&#39;t make assumptions; it&#39;s better to ask and plan accordingly!)</p><p> Parking garages can also serve as fantastic makeshift observation decks. You can drive up, park your car, and walk to a good vantage point. But always remember to check whether you&#39;re permitted to photograph there. Laws and regulations differ from city to city, so an afternoon call to the parking garage owners can save you a lot of trouble.</p><p> Finally, you can capture high-angle shots with a drone – and if you&#39;ve got access to a high-quality camera drone and your city&#39;s laws allow drone flights, the sky&#39;s the limit! Drones offer unprecedented angles and perspectives, letting you capture shots that are nothing short of awe-inspiring.</p><p> Of course, if you pursue cityscape drone photography, be responsible. Always adhere to regulations, don&#39;t invade anyone&#39;s privacy, and fly safely.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-use-patterns-to-improve-your-cityscape-compositions"> 8. Use patterns to improve your cityscape compositions</h3><p> If you&#39;re after more <em>subtle</em> cityscape photography, you don&#39;t need to capture stunning vistas of skyscrapers at night; instead, take a walk during the day, observe simple city scenes, and look for patterns.</p><p> You see, patterns can bring a sense of visual rhythm and harmony to an image. And when you incorporate them into the overall scene – here, a wide-angle lens is a big help! – you can create a calming, even <em>meditative</em> image.</p><p> Look at how the two patterns, made of the trees and the pedestrians, elevates this shot: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cityscapes7.jpg?ssl=1" alt="people walking through a park" title="cityscapes7.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> And by the way: Most scenes feature patterns of <em>some</em> kind, even if they&#39;re not immediately apparent. So if you&#39;re drawn to a scene but you can&#39;t find a pattern, stop, take a deep breath, and look around. I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ll be able to find some repeating graphic elements, such as shapes, lines, or even colors.</p><p> When you do, include them in your composition, and let them add interest to – or even unite – the overall scene. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="change-things-up-with-a-telephoto-lens"> 9. Change things up with a telephoto lens</h3><p> Wide-angle lenses are often the go-to for cityscape photography, but hear me out: a telephoto lens has its unique charm. When you&#39;re looking for an alternative to the grand sweeping vistas, a telephoto lens can be a game-changer.</p><p> A 70-200mm zoom lens is especially versatile. With it, you can zoom into specific elements of the city that you find captivating – think intricate architecture, patterned windows, or even far-off bridges. In other words, you can isolate subjects and make them the focus of your photograph.</p><p> Plus, a telephoto lens is particularly adept at showcasing the geometry of cities. The straight lines of the roads, the curves of the buildings, and the grid-like patterns formed by intersecting streets can be made into abstract compositions that celebrate the city&#39;s form.</p><p> Another great advantage of telephoto glass is the ability to compress distances. With a telephoto lens, elements that are far apart can appear closer together, creating a cool effect that wide-angle lenses simply can&#39;t offer.</p><p> So while wide-angle lenses give you the sweeping drama, telephoto lenses showcase the details. Each has its place in cityscape photography. It&#39;s all about choosing the right tool for the story you want to tell. And if you&#39;ve been shying away from telephoto lenses, it&#39;s time to give them a fair shake. You might be surprised at how they can enrich your cityscape photography portfolio. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-symmetry-for-bold-cityscape-images"> 10.

Symmetry can bring that feeling into your cityscape photography.</p><p> It&#39;s easy to shy away from symmetry, to think it clashes with other so-called “rules” of composition, like the rule of thirds. But when wielded with intention, symmetry can add intensity and visual appeal to your shots.</p><p> Take buildings, for example. These concrete structures are often innately symmetrical. Imagine standing dead-center, looking straight up at a skyscraper.

Try frame-within-a-frame compositional techniques</h3><p> The city environment is brimming with opportunities to experiment with composition, and one method that&#39;s always interesting to play around with is the frame-within-a-frame technique.</p><p> The idea is straightforward enough: You choose a primary subject and then frame it using another scene element, typically in the foreground. Archways, door frames, even gaps between buildings – these can all act as your “frame.”</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254901" style="width:480px"><span class="space" style="width:480px; padding-top:125%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="480" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-8.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-254901" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-8.jpg?resize=480%2C600&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-8.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-8.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-8.jpg?resize=717%2C896&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-8.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Now, there are a few things to keep in mind here. First, picking the right aperture – and hence controlling the depth of field in your image – is essential. This is because you want your foreground frame and your main subject to <em>both</em> be in sharp focus.</p><p> Finding the right frame can be challenging when you&#39;re starting out. You might look around and feel there&#39;s nothing that will work. But remember, the frame doesn&#39;t have to completely surround your subject. Even something that partially frames your subject can add depth and draw the viewer&#39;s eye.</p><p> You could also think about the nature of your frame. Is it something rigid and human-made, like a window or a bridge? Or is it something more natural and fluid, like tree branches or reflections? This contrast between the frame and the main subject can make your photo even more intriguing.</p><p> Sometimes, a well-placed frame can dramatically alter the narrative of your photo. A busy street, when viewed through a quiet café window, takes on a different tone. It can emphasize the dichotomy of public and private spaces, the calm amidst the chaos – plus it can just be very eye-catching!</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-use-long-shutter-speeds-to-blur-pedestrians"> 12. Use long shutter speeds to blur pedestrians</h3><p> Many beginner cityscape photographers struggle to deal with pedestrians. After all, if you like the surrounding scene, you may view pedestrians as a distraction.</p><p> And it&#39;s true: Pedestrians can be a distraction when rendered in sharp detail.</p><p> But if you lengthen your shutter speed to 1/5s and beyond, pedestrians will <em>blur</em> . They&#39;ll begin to lose detail, and they&#39;ll appear as an interesting ghostly presence: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cityscapes8.jpg?ssl=1" alt="cityscape photography night people walking through a square" title="cityscapes8.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Note that you can always experiment with different shutter speeds here, and your results will vary depending on the speed of the pedestrians.</p><p> Pro tip: If you want to blur pedestrians but you&#39;re shooting in bright light, I&#39;d recommend mounting a <a aria-label="neutral density filter (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/neutral-density-filters-landscape-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">neutral density filter</a> in front of your lens, which will block light from the sensor and prevent overexposure. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="capture-the-intimate-details"> 13. Capture the intimate details</h3><p> Now let&#39;s shift gears a bit. Cityscape photography isn&#39;t just about capturing wide, sweeping shots. Just as landscape photographers occasionally focus on tiny details within a larger vista, you can do the same in the city.</p><p> Turn your lens to details that strike you as moving or powerful. Get up close and capture them. A weathered door. A vibrant graffiti. A pigeon perched on a windowsill. They all have a story to tell.</p><p> Textures can be incredibly striking, too. The sleek glass of skyscrapers. The rough brickwork of older buildings. The faded flyers plastered on utility poles. The crushed soda can on the sidewalk. These details, though often overlooked, can provide an intimate view of city life.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254902" style="width:480px"><span class="space" style="width:480px; padding-top:125%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="480" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-254902" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=480%2C600&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=717%2C896&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-5.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> It&#39;s not just about what the items <em>are</em> , but how they contribute to your composition. The play of light and shadow. The interesting shapes and forms. The textures and colors. The contrasts and harmonies.

If you can&#39;t use a tripod, then improvise</h3><p> While tripods are allowed in most places, certain areas – such as city parks, business plazas, and city observation decks – may have a “no tripod” rule.

And if they <em>aren&#39;t</em> , don&#39;t give up; just be prepared to do your best with what you have.</p><p> For instance, you might bring a hard-shelled backpack, or look for tables, pillars, benches, and anything else on location that is flat and safe.</p><p> Then position your camera stably and safely, and use a remote release or self-timer to trigger the shutter.

For instance, you can show water reflecting city lights, the contrast of a relatively still surface against bustling city life, or even capture long-exposure water images to create a misty, dream-like aesthetic.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254909" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75.07%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1126" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-6.jpg?resize=1500%2C1126&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-254909" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-6.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-6.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-6.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-6.jpg?resize=768%2C577&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-6.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> My simplest advice? Seek out compositions that include water and city structures. And return to the same location under varying conditions if you can. A sunny day will give you crisp, well-lit shots. On an overcast day, you might catch the city in a more introspective mood. Early mornings can reveal a city waking up with the first rays of sun glinting off the water.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-hdr-as-needed"> 17. Use HDR as needed</h3><p> Cityscape photography often involves capturing contrasting elements, such as dark buildings against brighter skies or radiant electric lights adorning buildings at night. These scenarios can be tough to successfully expose as it&#39;s challenging to maintain detail in <em>both</em> the highlights and the shadows within a single frame.</p><p> Enter HDR, or high dynamic range imaging. It&#39;s a technique that can be a big help when faced with such challenges, and while it can be a bit advanced, the results are often worth it.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254904" style="width:480px"><span class="space" style="width:480px; padding-top:125%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="480" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-1-2.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-254904" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-1-2.jpg?resize=480%2C600&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-1-2.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-1-2.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-1-2.jpg?resize=717%2C896&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-1-2.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> HDR involves capturing multiple shots at different exposures: One for the bright sky, one for the darker buildings, and so on. Later, you can blend these shots to create a final image that retains detail across the entire dynamic range of the scene.</p><p> Yes, HDR might seem intimidating at first. It requires patience and a bit of technical know-how. But trust me, with a little practice and a reliable tripod to keep your frames consistent, HDR will elevate your cityscape photography to new heights.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="stay-safe"> 18. Stay safe</h3><p> Safety isn&#39;t something to gloss over when you&#39;re out capturing the pulse of the city through your lens. You&#39;re carrying equipment that&#39;s not only valuable in a monetary sense but is also crucial for your craft. Here&#39;s how to mitigate risks and protect your gear and yourself.</p><p> Firstly, pay close attention to your surroundings. Urban environments are dynamic, and things can change quickly. A location that feels safe during the day may not be so nice when the night falls. Always trust your instincts.如果感觉有什么不对劲，那很可能就是这样。 Your shots aren&#39;t worth compromising your safety.</p><p> Now, let&#39;s talk about keeping your gear safe. The temptation to take your eyes off your bag is real, especially when you&#39;re focused on capturing the perfect frame. Don&#39;t give in. Make it a habit to use bags that you can sling across your body and ensure they remain in your field of vision at all times.</p><p> Also, don&#39;t flaunt your gear unnecessarily. Be discreet when changing lenses or memory cards. The less attention you draw to your equipment, the better.</p><p> If you want to shoot cities at night, I&#39;d really recommend you team up. Not only does this add an extra layer of safety, but it&#39;s also a great way to share tips and tricks, enhancing the overall experience. And if you do prefer to go out alone, informing someone about your whereabouts is never a bad idea.</p><p> Lastly, consider insuring your gear. Photography equipment is a significant investment, and in the unfortunate event of theft or damage, insurance will be your financial safety net. Look into specialized photography insurance policies that cover a range of situations!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cityscape-photography-tips-final-words"> Cityscape photography tips: final words</h2><p> You&#39;ve just taken a deep dive into the world of cityscape photography, unraveled its mysteries, and gained invaluable insights.

If you can read a histogram, you can quickly and accurately check the exposure of your image while out in the field or when editing at home. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-read-a-histogram-step-by-step"> How to read a histogram: step by step</h2><p> As I explained, a histogram is a graph – which represents the pixels in an image, like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-95300" style="width:374px"><span class="space" style="width:374px; padding-top:66.84%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="374" height="250" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/histogram-info.jpg?resize=374%2C250&#038;ssl=1" alt="histogram-info" class="wp-image-95300" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/histogram-info.jpg?w=374&amp;ssl=1 374w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/histogram-info.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/histogram-info.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by Anne McKinnell</figcaption></figure></div><p> The left side of the graph represents the blacks or shadows, the right side of the graph represents the highlights or bright areas, and the middle section represents the midtones of the photo.</p><p> The graph peaks represent the number of pixels of a particular tone (with each peak corresponding to a different tonal value). So a peak at the right side of the histogram (such as in the example histogram above) indicates a large volume of bright pixels in the image. Whereas a peak at the left side of the histogram indicates a large volume of dark pixels in the image.</p><p> Here&#39;s how I recommend reading a new histogram: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="step-look-at-the-overall-curve-of-the-graph">步骤1：<strong> </strong>Look at the overall curve of the graph</h3><p> Is the histogram skewed to the right? Skewed to the left?

The histogram above shows the increase in red tones toward the brighter end of the scale. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="when-to-use-the-histogram"> When to use the histogram</h2><p> In the field, you can use the histogram in conjunction with Live View before you make an image (though you can generally turn on the histogram in the viewfinder if you have a mirrorless camera with an EVF). You can also see the histogram afterward when you review the photo on your LCD screen.</p><p> Either way, you <em>must</em> use the histogram to check your exposure while you&#39;re in the field. That way, you have an opportunity to make another exposure while you are still out with your camera.</p><p> Another key point: Don&#39;t rely on your LCD to give you feedback about exposure. It&#39;s great for checking composition and focus, but not exposure. That&#39;s because the brightness of your LCD doesn&#39;t correspond perfectly with the brightness of your image since you can adjust the brightness of your LCD.</p><p> For example, you can brighten the LCD so you can see it more easily outside on a sunny day. But then if you <em>don&#39;t</em> reduce the brightness and you look at the LCD at night, your images are going to appear super bright when they are not.</p><p> The histogram is also available to you while post-processing your image. Use it to see where adjustments need to be made <em>and</em> to ensure you don&#39;t create areas that are too bright or too dark while processing your images. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="additional-resources-on-histograms"> Additional resources on histograms</h2><p> This video does a great job of explaining how the histogram on your camera works and how to read it: </p><p><iframe loading="lazy" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/CIbcS6Qkel8" width="601" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p><p> I do slightly disagree with his tip that having a mountain in the center is the best option, as it does depend on the subject and your artistic vision! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="histogram-myths-and-misconceptions"> Histogram myths and misconceptions</h2><p> There have been dozens of articles and videos published about the purpose and interpretation of the histogram in post-production. Unfortunately, many of them contain significant errors.</p><p> I&#39;ve been adjusting images for decades – long before the histogram graph was publicly introduced! – and I&#39;ve worked with it every day since it became popular, so I&#39;d like to weigh in on rumors and clarify some facts. Once you understand the histogram&#39;s primary function and limitations, you&#39;ll find it to be a solid feedback resource. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="myth-the-vertical-lines-reflect-image-contrast"> Myth 1: The vertical lines reflect image contrast</h3><p> <strong>FACT:</strong> The horizontal axis does reflect the image&#39;s tonal range (from the darkest tones to the lightest), though the vertical lines reveal little about its contrast. Actually, the horizontal distribution is what reveals the overall contrast. Tones located mostly on the right reveal very light (or high-key) images, while tones favoring the left side are darker (low-key) images.</p><p> The extreme right side wall represents white and the extreme left wall of the graph represents solid black. The highest (vertical) peak of the graph merely indicates the highest ratio of pixels containing that particular color tone as it relates to the others. The lowest vertical level on the graph indicates the tone color with the least number of pixels in the image. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="myth-there-is-one-best-histogram-shape"> Myth 2: There is one <em>best</em> histogram shape</h3><p> <strong>FACT:</strong> There are as many histogram shapes as there are images. There is no such thing as a good or bad histogram, and there is no such thing as an ideal histogram. Because these graphs reflect each image&#39;s distribution of tones, you&#39;ll be hard-pressed to find any two that are alike. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Histogram-Shapes.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Histogram Shapes" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Only images containing mostly midtones will actually display a true bell (mountain) shape on the histogram as in the top left.

In truth, however, there are only 256 vertical bars presented in the histogram. Each horizontal bar represents less than one-half of one percent (0.4%) of the total tonal range (100% / 256 = 0.390625%). Even if a photo contains a very gradual change in tones across a wide area (like an unclouded sky), your eyes will only perceive “banding” if the JPEG image has been degraded by repeated “Save” functions.</p><p> JPEG images contain a maximum of 256 levels (8 bits) of tone between black (solid color) and white (no color). Once JPEG files have been opened and saved several times, the number of tone levels can become significantly reduced and tone-banding may occur. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/News-Journal.jpg?ssl=1" alt="News Journal - Shedding Light on the Histogram - How to Use it in Post-Production" title="News Journal.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/News-Journal-Gappy.jpg?ssl=1" alt="News Journal Gappy - Shedding Light on the Histogram - How to Use it in Post-Production" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> These two histograms appear quite different, though the images are very similar.

Since editing software histograms are based on a horizontal graph only 256 pixels wide, each representation is a basic overview at best. If the full range of possible colors were truly represented by a single graph, the chart would occupy the wall of a good-sized room!</p><p> Let me break down the numbers. This 256 pixel-wide graph portrays each image&#39;s potential color range using an 8-bit (256 level) interpolation. This means that all 16.8 million possible colors are represented in a mere 256 horizontal point histogram. Tones change levels in 0.4% increments. The graph significantly exaggerates the difference between minor shifts in tonal value. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/256-Pixel-Histogram2.jpg?ssl=1" alt="256 Pixel Histogram 2" title="256 Pixel Histogram2.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image from Herb Paynter</figcaption></figure></div><p> Human eyes barely perceive a half-percent (0.5%) difference between tones, so 256 levels in a JPEG image provide the illusion of continuous tone. This means the histogram uses less than two vertical columns to represent a single percent change in value. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/57-58-percent.jpg?ssl=1" alt="57 58 percent" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The two patches on the bottom (marked “57%” and “58%”) are separated by only 1% in tone, though your eyes may have trouble seeing the difference.

There&#39;s something truly magical about witnessing a fireworks display, and as a photography enthusiast, you can&#39;t help but feel the burning desire to capture those fleeting moments forever.</p><p> However, shooting fireworks can be incredibly challenging and require some real technical finesse. That&#39;s where this article comes in handy; I explore a handful of effective approaches to help you master the art of fireworks photography and capture awe-inspiring shots.</p><p> Specifically, I share:</p><ul><li> The best settings for fireworks images</li><li> Essential fireworks photo gear</li><li> A simple way to prevent image blur</li><li>多得多！</li></ul><p> Just a quick note before we get started: Please remember that if you&#39;ve never tried fireworks before, it does depend heavily on trial and error. I&#39;ve made a lot of mistakes myself before I got any images that I was happy to show anyone.  Each time I photograph fireworks, there&#39;s always an element of unpredictability, so you have to learn to adapt, learn from your own mistakes, and do it again.</p><p> Ready to learn how to photograph fireworks?那么让我们开始吧！ </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="bring-the-right-equipment"> 1. Bring the right equipment</h2><p> What will you need to make good fireworks photos? Let&#39;s break down the basic equipment needs: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-dslr-or-mirrorless-model-for-more-flexibility"> Use a DSLR or mirrorless model for more flexibility</h3><p> You can take fireworks photos with a smartphone camera if that&#39;s all you have. However, the results won&#39;t be quite as impressive, and I&#39;d therefore recommend you invest in (at least) an entry-level DSLR or mirrorless camera.</p><p> Also, be sure to have a good-sized storage card, as well as a spare battery or two, as you&#39;ll usually take lots of shots at a fireworks show. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-zoom-lens-for-compositional-variety"> Use a zoom lens for compositional variety</h3><p> Lens choice largely depends on how close you will be to the fireworks launch location.  If you are close, you may need a wide-angle lens to keep the larger bursts in the frame. If, however, you are a long distance from the show or want to compress the apparent distance between your foreground object and the sky bursts, a telephoto lens might be in order.</p><p> My go-to lens for firework photography is a <a href="https://geni.us/dPSCanonEF24-105F4ISII" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenersponsored nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="ek-link">Canon EF 24-105mm f/4L IS</a> , which covers a good range. Note that you don&#39;t need a particularly fast (ie, wide-aperture) lens as you will be working with mid to small apertures and longer shutter speeds. Of course, it&#39;s worth using a lens that offers consistently crisp results, so don&#39;t skimp on this piece of equipment! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-tripod-to-keep-your-camera-still"> Use a tripod to keep your camera still</h3><p> To capture sharp fireworks shots, it is crucial to keep your camera perfectly still, and this generally requires the use of a sturdy tripod.</p><p> Why is a tripod so important? Fireworks displays occur at night, when lighting conditions are challenging, and long shutter speeds are necessary (more on this later!). When you&#39;re capturing a lengthy exposure, even the slightest camera shake can result in blurry images – unless your camera is set up on a rock-solid tripod, that is.</p><p> Ensure that you set up your tripod on a stable surface and shield it from any potential wind. If you don&#39;t already own a tripod, there are affordable options available, including some <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-travel-tripods/" target="_blank" aria-label="portable travel tripods (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">portable travel tripods</a> . If you don&#39;t have the time or money to purchase a tripod, you can always improvise by placing your camera on the ground or a table.</p><p> Note that shooting with a tripod offers additional benefits: It enables you to try <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/getting-real-hdr/" target="_blank" aria-label="HDR bracketing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">HDR bracketing</a> , and it encourages you to compose more deliberately and thoughtfully by slowing down the process.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174491" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:56.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="844" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photograph-fireworks-tripod.jpg?resize=1500%2C844&#038;ssl=1" alt="photograph fireworks tripod" class="wp-image-174491" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photograph-fireworks-tripod.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photograph-fireworks-tripod.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photograph-fireworks-tripod.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photograph-fireworks-tripod.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photograph-fireworks-tripod.jpg?resize=717%2C403&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-remote-release-to-further-reduce-camera-shake"> Use a remote release to further reduce camera shake</h3><p> Even with your camera securely mounted on a sturdy tripod, there&#39;s a risk of camera shake when you press the shutter button, resulting in blurry shots. This is why a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/8-benefits-using-wireless-remote-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="remote release (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">remote release</a> is an essential firework photography accessory.</p><p> A remote release is a wireless device that connects to your camera, allowing you to trigger the shutter from a distance. By using the remote, you eliminate the need to physically touch the camera, ensuring maximum stability and sharpness in your images.</p><p> Happily, investing in a remote release won&#39;t break the bank (they&#39;re quite affordable)! However, if you don&#39;t have one or prefer not to purchase it, you can get a similar result by activating your camera&#39;s two-second self-timer. While this method isn&#39;t ideal – you&#39;ll need to anticipate the firework bursts and fire the shutter two seconds in advance – it can still get the job done. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="scout-the-location-in-advance"> 2. Scout the location in advance</h2><p> When it comes to capturing stunning fireworks photographs, preparation is key. Firework displays take place after sunset, and if you&#39;ve ever tried to compose in the dark, you&#39;ll know that it is <em>hard</em> . To ensure you make the most of the limited time you have to photograph the spectacle, it is crucial to scout the location in advance.</p><p> Visiting the location earlier in the day allows you to familiarize yourself with the surroundings and identify potential vantage points that will offer breathtaking perspectives. Seek out locations that allow for expansive and sweeping shots, where you can capture the full grandeur of the display. Consider the angles, sightlines, and potential obstacles that may hinder your view or introduce unwanted distractions. By doing so, you can position yourself to capture the magic as it unfolds.</p><p> Note, however, that while scouting the location in advance provides you with valuable insights, it doesn&#39;t mean you have to rigidly stick to predetermined compositions. Embrace the spontaneity of the moment and be open to improvisation. Fireworks are dynamic, and each explosion brings unique patterns and colors to the sky. Use your scouting knowledge as a foundation, but allow yourself to experiment and adapt on the spot! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-low-iso-for-the-cleanest-shots"> 3. Use a low ISO for the cleanest shots</h2><p> High <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISOs (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISOs</a> create brighter exposures, but they also create noise, which reduces image quality and looks plain <em>bad</em> .</p><p> So whenever possible, use your camera&#39;s lowest native ISO setting. And only raise the ISO if your exposures are turning out too dark.</p><p> I recommend using ISO 100 or 200, and this is for a couple of reasons. First, the higher the ISO you use, the more noise you&#39;ll introduce in your images. Noise also tends to live in blue areas of images, and nighttime has a <em>lot</em> of blue, so that compounds the issue. Plus, long exposures tend to increase noise.</p><p> Bottom line: You should work especially hard to minimize noise in your fireworks photos, and that involves using a low ISO. Fortunately, fireworks tend to be very bright, so as long as you use a tripod, you probably won&#39;t need to raise your ISO. Therefore, I&#39;d recommend setting it to ISO 100 and only raising it if you absolutely need a boost.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174493" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/low-iso-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="low iso for fireworks" class="wp-image-174493" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/low-iso-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/low-iso-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/low-iso-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/low-iso-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/low-iso-for-fireworks.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shoot-in-raw">4. Shoot in RAW</h2><p> For fireworks photographers, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/raw-vs-jpeg/" target="_blank" aria-label="photographing in RAW (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">photographing in RAW</a> is a game-changer. While beginners may opt for JPEG files due to their simplicity and immediate usability, you won&#39;t be able to realize the true potential of your fireworks photographs without working in RAW.</p><p> JPEG files may seem appealing at first, with their smaller size and lack of post-processing requirements. However, they limit your creative freedom when it comes to refining your images. On the other hand, RAW files offer an abundance of possibilities during post-processing. These versatile files allow you to recover details hidden in shadows and highlights, ensuring that every element is faithfully preserved. With RAW, you also have the ability to fine-tune colors and tones, enhancing the overall impact of your firework photographs.</p><p> While it&#39;s true that RAW files require post-processing before sharing them on websites or social media platforms, the editing process can be remarkably quick. Software programs like Adobe Lightroom offer intuitive interfaces that allow you to quickly convert RAW shots into shareable files.</p><p> So don&#39;t let the additional workflow step deter you from shooting in RAW; it&#39;s an investment that <em>really</em> pays off.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="switch-off-your-flash"> 5. Switch off your flash</h2><p> It&#39;s simple, really:</p><p> An on-camera flash (or even an off-camera flash) can only illuminate the area a handful of meters in front of you. Therefore, <em>a flash cannot affect a firework</em> , and turning on your camera&#39;s flash will only serve to waste battery.</p><p> Plus, if your camera uses a flash metering system, an active flash will cause the fireworks to come out dark. And constant flashing may even frustrate other folks trying to watch the fireworks.</p><p> So switch your flash off. And use the long-exposure technique I discuss below! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="turn-off-long-exposure-noise-reduction"> 6. Turn off long exposure noise reduction</h2><p> Many modern cameras have a noise reduction feature, which after the first exposure, takes a second “black frame” exposure, detecting the noise and then subtracting that from the initial exposure. It can work well in some situations, but here&#39;s the thing:</p><p> The second exposure takes as long as the first, and if you&#39;re making multi-second exposures, your camera will be busy working, and you&#39;ll be missing subsequent firework bursts.</p><p>所以把它关掉。 You&#39;ll generally be using a low ISO with minimal noise anyway, and the delay in being able to make more shots isn&#39;t worth the benefit.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="do-not-use-live-view"> 7. Do <em>not</em> use Live View</h2><p> Live View lets you preview your exposures on the camera LCD before you actually press the shutter button. It comes in handy in a lot of situations, but it&#39;ll eat up your battery fast.</p><p> My recommendation: Save your battery for actually shooting and set up your shot using the eyecup viewfinder.</p><p> (That said, if you use a mirrorless camera, Live View is actually <em>less</em> energy-intensive than work via the electronic viewfinder. Therefore, if you shoot mirrorless, using Live View is a good idea!) </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-smaller-apertures-for-the-best-fireworks-photography"> 8. Use smaller apertures for the best fireworks photography</h2><p> The lens <a aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> controls the image <a aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> – that is, whether the scene features a small sliver of sharpness ( <a aria-label="shallow depth of field (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-get-shallow-depth-of-field-in-your-digital-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shallow depth of field</a> ) or whether the scene is sharp throughout (deep depth of field). But what aperture is right for photographing fireworks?</p><p> If you&#39;re capturing fireworks that are far off in the distance and you have no foreground subjects, then you can get away with pretty much any aperture, from wide options like f/2.8 to narrow options like f/16.</p><p> However, if your composition features foreground elements or the fireworks are relatively close to your position, then you&#39;ll want to use a narrow aperture (anywhere between f/8 and f/16 is good).</p><p> Plus, those apertures are pretty optimal for fireworks as the light streaks are controlled by the size of the aperture.  Closing down more will make the light trails thinner, opening up more will make them wider and possible too over exposed.  Do some tests but all the times I&#39;ve done fireworks I keep coming back to f8 as my preference.</p><p> The narrower aperture will widen the depth of field, ensuring that the fireworks <em>and</em> the rest of the scene turn out sharp. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-longer-shutter-speed-but-dont-let-it-go-too-long"> 9. Use a longer shutter speed (but don&#39;t let it go too long!)</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174492" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:56.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="844" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shutter-speed-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=1500%2C844&#038;ssl=1" alt="shutter speed for fireworks" class="wp-image-174492" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shutter-speed-for-fireworks.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shutter-speed-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shutter-speed-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shutter-speed-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shutter-speed-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=717%2C403&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Fireworks are a moving subject, and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> deals with subject motion. So if you want to get great fireworks shots, you <em>must</em> choose the perfect shutter speed.</p><p> Now, fireworks leave beautiful light trails, and you can capture this with a longer shutter speed. However, you don&#39;t want to let the shutter go for <em>too</em> long. Fireworks are bright, and if you&#39;re not careful, you&#39;ll end up with lots of clipped highlights in your frames.</p><p> An easy method to handle this is by switching your camera over to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/using-bulb-mode-long-exposure-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="Bulb mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Bulb mode</a> . Once in Bulb mode, the shutter will remain open for as long as you hold down the shutter button (or the shutter release).</p><p> When a firework is about to explode, you can hit the shutter button. And you can hold down the button until the explosion is finished.</p><p> Do a test shot before the show starts and see if the sky is too dark or too bright and adjust the exposure time accordingly. As long as you&#39;re under 30 seconds (the longest shutter speed on most cameras), you can let the camera time the shots for you. Or you can switch to Bulb and just open and close manually when you feel you&#39;ve captured enough bursts in one image. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-manual-focusing-for-sharp-shots"> 10. Use manual focusing for sharp shots</h2><p> Mirrorless autofocus systems are better than ever before – yet focusing in low light still causes cameras to struggle. Plus, refocusing on each new burst of fireworks takes time, which may ultimately cause you to miss the shot.</p><p> Therefore, instead of trying to autofocus, switch your lens over to <a aria-label="manual focus (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dont-afraid-manual-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">manual focus</a> .</p><p> Then, when you see the first burst of fireworks, manually adjust the focus ring until the scene appears sharp. Take a test shot, and be sure to zoom in on your LCD screen to make sure it looks good.</p><p> Once you&#39;ve acquired perfect focus, simply leave it alone for the rest of the fireworks show, and the results will turn out great (especially if you&#39;re using a narrow aperture!).</p><p> One note: Changing focal lengths will change the plane of focus on most lenses, so if you zoom in or out, you should check your point of focus (and re-focus if necessary). </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="anticipate-the-best-compositions"> 11.

The challenge is that you generally need to compose <em>before</em> the fireworks actually burst, so anticipation is key. Here are a few quick tips to help you select compositions in advance:</p><ul><li> <strong>Watch a few bursts before you shoot</strong> . In general, each new firework will come from (roughly) the same spot, so by observing the skies, you can get a sense of where to train your camera. You can also get a sense of how long you have between bursts; that way, you can be ready to fire the shutter before each new explosion.</li><li> <strong>Decide whether to shoot vertically</strong> <strong>or horizontally</strong> . You can capture fireworks vertically (portrait orientation) or horizontally (landscape orientation). Both can work for fireworks photography, but I personally prefer a vertical perspective – after all, there&#39;s a lot of vertical firework movement! Horizontal shots are nice if you&#39;re after an expansive shot using a wide-angle lens, however.</li><li> <strong>Refine your framing</strong> . Once you&#39;ve found a nice composition, don&#39;t take a single shot and then move on to the next frame. Instead, see if you can improve the result by moving to one side, getting down low, getting up high, etc. You might be surprised by what you can create when you really dedicate yourself to working the scene. </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="enhance-your-firework-compositions-with-foreground-interest"> 12. Enhance your firework compositions with foreground interest</h2><p> Beginner firework photographers often just point their camera at the sky and shoot away – but while this can produce nice results, if your goal is to create captivating images that leave a lasting impact, incorporating an interesting foreground is a great idea.</p><p> You see, by seamlessly blending a magnificent sky explosion with a compelling foreground, you offer viewers a visual journey. They can start by appreciating the foreground&#39;s charm before engaging with the mesmerizing backdrop.</p><p> Note that you can include all sorts of elements as your foreground interest: buildings, mountains, hills stretching into the distance, or even amusement park rides. The choice is yours, but I encourage you to think carefully about which foreground elements will complement the fireworks display.</p><p> By the way, if you can include foreground elements that offer <a aria-label="leading lines (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-leading-lines-for-better-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">leading lines</a> , the results will be especially spectacular. These lines can create a visual pathway that not only connects the foreground and the fireworks but also enhances the overall composition! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="include-reflections-in-your-firework-compositions"> 13. Include reflections in your firework compositions</h2><p> Looking to elevate your firework shots from ordinary to extraordinary? Incorporating reflections into your compositions can provide that extra touch of brilliance.</p><p> You&#39;ll need to strategically position yourself to include a reflective surface with the frame, but finding a suitable reflective object is easier than you might think. While lakes and ponds can always work, you can also unleash your creativity by utilizing puddles, glossy car surfaces, or even sunglass lenses.</p><p> I&#39;d also encourage you to experiment with different compositions. For instance, try placing the horizon line in different areas of the frame and see what you think of the results. A dead-center horizon will yield a symmetrical shot infused with tension, while a horizon positioned in the upper or lower third of the frame will infuse your image with a dynamic and captivating feel. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="include-people-in-your-images"> 14. Include people in your images</h2><p> While the magnificent bursts of fireworks alone can create awe-inspiring images, incorporating people into your compositions can elevate your fireworks photos to new heights.</p><p> For one, including human figures in your frames will introduce a sense of scale that emphasizes the grandeur of the dazzling light show unfolding in the night sky. Additionally, people can act as foreground interest, adding depth and narrative to your photographs.</p><p> Plus, you can use people to tell stories; a solitary figure gazing in awe at the fireworks can evoke a sense of wonder, while a group of friends or a couple holding hands can portray a shared moment of joy and celebration.</p><p> One fascinating element to explore when including people in firework photography is the interplay between focus points. Experiment with different approaches to create varied effects. You can choose to focus on the fireworks, allowing the people in the foreground to become slightly blurred – or you can focus on the people in the foreground, intentionally blurring the fireworks in the background, creating an ethereal and dreamlike atmosphere. Both techniques can yield compelling results, so don&#39;t hesitate to try different focal points and see which resonates with your artistic vision! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="experiment-with-different-focal-lengths"> 15.

With a long lens, you&#39;ll need to keep your camera trained on the right part of the sky at the right time, and it can be easy to miss.</p><p> On the other hand, you can use a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/7-ways-to-get-more-out-of-a-wide-angle-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="wide-angle lens (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">wide-angle lens</a> (such as a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/every-photographer-needs-24-70mm-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="24-70mm (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">24-70mm</a> ), which will capture the entire skyline but won&#39;t offer lots of detail. Wide-angle lenses feature great “safety” focal lengths because you can generally trust that they&#39;ll include the fireworks in the scene, even if the results aren&#39;t quite as impactful as you might like.</p><p> So which lens should you use? As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, I&#39;d recommend working primarily with a wide-angle zoom. But once you&#39;ve grabbed a few wide-angle shots that you like, feel free to switch over to your telephoto lens and see if you can nail some close-ups.</p><p> Of course, if your camera offers enough resolution, you do have the option to crop afterward – just bear that in mind! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-neutral-density-filter-to-get-a-longer-exposure-if-need-be"> 16.

Another option to consider is the ND 1.8 filter. Far fewer brands make ND 1.8 filters, and the brands that do are usually more expensive, <em>but</em> the filter is very versatile and offers a couple of advantages over the ND 0.9 filter.</p><p> First, since it reduces the exposure by six stops of light as opposed to the three stops of light, you&#39;ll be able to get decent shutter speeds even with a slightly wider aperture. And a wider aperture – in the f/5.6-f/8 range – minimizes diffraction and maximizes sharpness. Plus, an ND 1.8 filter can come in handy when shooting other subjects in the daytime or at twilight, whereas an ND 0.9 filter won&#39;t have a huge effect. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shoot-most-of-your-shots-at-the-start-of-the-show"> 17. Shoot most of your shots at the start of the show</h2><p> This tip is quick but handy:</p><p> Whenever possible, capture your most interesting, surefire compositions at the beginning of the show, not the end.</p><p> This will avoid the smoke and haze that appears a bit later. Eventually, the sky will be filled with smoke, which doesn&#39;t look as pretty.

Turn the ring so things are out of focus.</li><li> Just as a firework explodes, fire the shutter and smoothly turn the focus right back to the focus point. You must get the fireworks in focus before the exposure is complete, but if you finish early, that&#39;s okay. </li></ul><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-173368 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/make-better-fireworks-photos-bloom-technique-02.jpg?ssl=1" alt="better fireworks photos" class="wp-image-173368" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Two images using the defocus-to-focus technique.
