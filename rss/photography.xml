Type a word or a sentence, and the tool will generate a digital representation of what you wrote.</p><p> Not only does Generative Fill produce content on command, but it also matches the lighting and perspective of the existing photo for a much more realistic result.</p><p> Generative Fill can also create content <em>without</em> a text prompt. If you don&#39;t prompt the tool and instead leave it blank, it will use information from the surrounding area to generate new pixels, which can be very useful if you want to remove (and replace) a portion of your photo or extend an existing image.</p><h2 data-section id="when-is-generative-fill-useful"> When is Generative Fill useful?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253889" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Use-Generative-Fill.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Photoshop Generative Fill" class="wp-image-253889" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Use-Generative-Fill.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Use-Generative-Fill.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Use-Generative-Fill.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Use-Generative-Fill.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Use-Generative-Fill.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Use-Generative-Fill.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Generative Fill offers four main features: Removing objects, adding objects, creating backgrounds, and expanding images. So when do these options come in handy?</p><p> For one, the tool is perfect if you want to create a digital background – anything from artistic bokeh to a landscape with mountains.</p><p> It&#39;s also useful if you want to extend an existing photo to fit a specific format or if you need more space to improve the composition.</p><p> Generative Fill can also be helpful if you accidentally cut off an important element when photographing; you can use it to recreate the missing part of your subject (and expand the surrounding area).</p><p> It&#39;s also a great way to add props or incorporate elements that are missing from the picture. Say you&#39;re taking a photo of a cheesecake with strawberry jelly. Maybe strawberries aren&#39;t in season, but a few strawberries would be the perfect prop to style your photo – so you just add them in with Generative Fill!</p><p> Finally, you can generate an entire work of art using <em>just</em> Generative Fill.

Here are a few tips to get better results:</p><h3 data-section id="include-pixels-in-the-selection"> 1. Include pixels in the selection</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253901" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Photoshop Generative Fill" class="wp-image-253901" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> In most cases, it&#39;s important to create selections as precise as possible. You don&#39;t want to include anything from the surrounding areas when you&#39;re compositing or masking.</p><p> But when you&#39;re using Generative Fill, forget about all that! This AI tool benefits from having some data to work with – so including pixels in the selections from the surrounding areas will yield better results. This is especially true if you&#39;re extending the background or merging images.</p><h3 data-section id="be-as-precise-as-you-can-with-your-text-prompts"> 2. Be as precise as you can with your text prompts</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253902" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Photoshop Generative Fill" class="wp-image-253902" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips-2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips-2.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Whenever you&#39;re typing a text prompt in the Generative Fill field, be as specific as possible. For instance, instead of typing “beach sunset,” type “sun setting in the background of a sandy beach with ocean waves crashing on the wharf.” And instead of just typing “flower,” type “blooming red rose” and so on. This will save you a lot of time by generating images that fit your creative vision more precisely.</p><p> This only works, of course, if you have something clear in mind. Otherwise, you may appreciate the tool&#39;s randomness, and you can be deliberately vague just to see what you get.</p><h3 data-section id="build-upon-the-original-variation"> 3. Build upon the original variation</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253903" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:48.07%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="721" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips-3.jpg?resize=1500%2C721&#038;ssl=1" alt="Photoshop Generative Fill" class="wp-image-253903" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips-3.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips-3.jpg?resize=300%2C144&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips-3.jpg?resize=600%2C288&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips-3.jpg?resize=768%2C369&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Generative-Fill-tips-3.jpg?resize=717%2C345&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you type in a prompt and you don&#39;t get a perfect result, don&#39;t be discouraged. In fact, Generative Fill is very rarely flawless (at least at this stage of the tool&#39;s development).</p><p> So instead of starting over with a new text prompt or simply quitting the project, build on the best variation you have.</p><p> Let&#39;s say you want to generate a portrait of a woman. Maybe the hair doesn&#39;t look the way you imagined – you wanted short curls, but you got long, straight locks instead. Simply select the hair, then type in a new prompt instead of trying to generate an entirely new portrait from scratch.</p><p> The same goes for the obvious errors. Generative Fill still has problems with fingers and teeth, plus it can also create patterns or include random pixels that don&#39;t fit. In such cases, you can select the area and try a new text prompt, or you can try it without a prompt. (If you do the latter, it&#39;ll work as a content-aware fill tool and correct the issue.)</p><h2 data-section id="generative-fill-in-photoshop-final-words"> Generative Fill in Photoshop: final words</h2><p> Generative Fill is a powerful method of enhancing your photos, and it&#39;s likely only the beginning. However, before I sign off, I&#39;d like to mention one more thing: legalities.</p><p> It&#39;s quite complicated to talk about the legal implications of AI usage in photography at this point.

On the other hand, basic solutions like Dropbox and Google Drive, while convenient, are too rough around the edges for professional use.</p><p> That&#39;s where client galleries come in. They offer a straightforward platform for sharing photos, but the designs are polished and specifically cater to photography clients. Plus, if you choose the right software, galleries can include print sales and even automatic print fulfillment.</p><p> Of course, not all gallery platforms are equally effective, and that&#39;s where this article can help you out.

Not only does Zno produce software for photographers, but the company <em>also</em> runs a top-notch print lab. The result? An outstanding client gallery experience that rolls image display, print sales, automatic order fulfillment, and plenty of extra benefits into one low-priced package.</p><p> So if you&#39;re ready to discover how Zno&#39;s powerful platform can help you boost customer satisfaction <em>and</em> profits, then let&#39;s dive right in!</p><h2 data-section id="what-is-a-client-gallery"> What is a client gallery?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253996" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1005" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1005&#038;ssl=1" alt="Zno online photo gallery" class="wp-image-253996" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-1.jpg?resize=600%2C402&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-1.jpg?resize=768%2C515&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-1.jpg?resize=436%2C293&amp;ssl=1 436w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-1.jpg?resize=717%2C480&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> A <a href="https://www.zno.com/client-gallery.html" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">client gallery</a> is a method of displaying images for clients to view following the completion of a photoshoot (eg, a newborn session, a high-school senior session, or a wedding).</p><p> They tend to offer elegant designs that far outclass simple photo-sharing solutions like Dropbox, and they&#39;re designed so clients can appreciate dozens – or even hundreds – of images with minimal hassle.</p><p> The goal is to share photos with clients, but these online galleries can be used in a variety of ways: for proofing, to show off finished photos, to allow clients to choose images for printing, and more.

As part of the <em>self-fulfillment</em> process, the photographer would then need to review each new order, (manually) place it with the relevant lab, then ensure the product is successfully shipped to the customer.</p><h2 data-section id="how-do-a-client-gallery-and-online-store-work-together"> How do a client gallery and online store work together?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253997" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:57.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="867" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-5.jpg?resize=1500%2C867&#038;ssl=1" alt="Zno online photo gallery" class="wp-image-253997" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-5.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-5.jpg?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-5.jpg?resize=600%2C347&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-5.jpg?resize=768%2C444&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-5.jpg?resize=717%2C414&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Some client gallery platforms directly incorporate online stores for a seamless viewing and purchasing experience. The basic process works like this:</p><p> First, the photographer uploads their finished photos to a client gallery, then sends an email to the client inviting them to access the gallery via a simple link.</p><p> Once the client clicks the link, they can view the gallery and select their favorite photos (for instance, by starring or favoriting different files).</p><p> Thanks to the integration between the gallery and the store, the client can see print options and prices when viewing the photos – and can then choose to purchase prints of their favorite shots by placing an online order.</p><p> Finally, the photographer collects the payment sent by the client and ensures the order is fulfilled (either automatically or manually). Depending on the integration between the online store and the print lab, the photographer may only receive the profits, or they may receive the entire fee (but then need to use a portion to cover the costs of third-party print products).</p><h2 data-section id="what-makes-znos-online-photo-gallery-better-than-competitors"> What makes Zno&#39;s online photo gallery better than competitors?</h2><p> If you&#39;re sold on the promise of a client gallery but you&#39;re not sure which platform to pick, I encourage you to consider Zno Gallery. It&#39;s one of the best online photo galleries for photographers, and here are just a few of the reasons why:</p><h3 data-section id="off-select-zno-print-products"> 25% off select Zno print products</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253999" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:64.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="964" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C964&#038;ssl=1" alt="Zno online photo gallery" class="wp-image-253999" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-2.jpg?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-2.jpg?resize=600%2C386&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-2.jpg?resize=768%2C494&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-2.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-2.jpg?resize=717%2C461&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> When you subscribe to any of the Zno Gallery paid plans – including the Basic plan at just $5 per month – you get an impressive 25% off an array of Zno products. The discount applies to select standard prints but also extends to wall art, tabletop plaques and blocks, and even print set collections.</p><p> Note that the discount works on both personal and customer orders. In other words, you can gain massive savings on your own print orders, and you can <em>also</em> dramatically decrease costs for the prints you sell to customers.</p><h3 data-section id="commission-fee-even-on-the-free-plan"> 0% commission fee even on the Free Plan</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254001" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:64.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="968" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-6.jpg?resize=1500%2C968&#038;ssl=1" alt="Zno online photo gallery" class="wp-image-254001" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-6.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-6.jpg?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-6.jpg?resize=600%2C387&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-6.jpg?resize=768%2C496&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-6.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-6.jpg?resize=717%2C463&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you&#39;re not quite ready to commit to a paid photo gallery plan, don&#39;t worry; Zno boasts a Free Plan that includes both gallery and store functionality.</p><p> In fact, most of the top platforms offer some type of free option. They&#39;ll let you upload photos for both sharing and sales, and you can receive orders and start making real money from your work.</p><p> But here&#39;s the critical distinction between Zno and competitor companies like Pixieset, Pic-Time, and CloudSpot: With Zno, you will <em>never</em> pay commissions on your sales, whether you use the free Gallery plan or the most advanced Unlimited plan. Your profits are your own.</p><p> The competition, however, is rarely so generous. Create an e-store gallery using a free plan, and expect Pixieset, Pictime, and CloudSpot to take 15% commissions on every sale you make. If you&#39;re a young photographer just breaking into the business, you need all the profits you can get, and 15% can make a <em>huge</em> difference to your bottom line.</p><h3 data-section id="you-can-apply-any-store-credit-or-promos-to-orders"> You can apply any store credit or promos to orders</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253989" style="width:1225px"><span class="space" style="width:1225px; padding-top:59.1%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1225" height="724" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-101.jpg?resize=1225%2C724&#038;ssl=1" alt="Zno online photo gallery" class="wp-image-253989" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-101.jpg?w=1225&amp;ssl=1 1225w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-101.jpg?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-101.jpg?resize=600%2C355&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-101.jpg?resize=768%2C454&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-101.jpg?resize=717%2C424&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Remember how I said that Zno was both a lab and a software company? As it turns out, this dual focus comes with a huge benefit: Lab store credit and promotional discounts on Zno products can be applied, not just to your personal orders, but to <em>customer</em> orders.</p><p> Imagine, for example, that Zno is offering a 50% discount on acrylic blocks for Black Friday. If a client then orders an acrylic block from your online photo gallery, Zno will apply a 50% discount to the order. The client will pay the price that <em>you</em> listed in the client gallery, but Zno will take 50% less in fulfillment (ie, material) costs. And as a result, your profits will increase significantly!</p><p> The same is true of credit gained through the Zno Pro plan. As a Pro subscriber, you get up to 25% back – in the form of credit rebates – on your Zno store purchases. The credit can then be applied to orders from your customers; that way, Zno takes less for material costs and you get a profit boost.</p><p> Note that both sales and store credit can even be combined with the 25%-off discount you get (on select products) as part of the Zno Gallery paid plans.</p><h2 data-section id="znos-client-gallery-is-part-of-an-all-in-one-platform"> Zno&#39;s Client Gallery is part of an all-in-one platform</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253988" style="width:1268px"><span class="space" style="width:1268px; padding-top:63.64%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1268" height="807" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-100.jpg?resize=1268%2C807&#038;ssl=1" alt="Zno online photo gallery" class="wp-image-253988" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-100.jpg?w=1268&amp;ssl=1 1268w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-100.jpg?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-100.jpg?resize=600%2C382&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-100.jpg?resize=768%2C489&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-100.jpg?resize=717%2C456&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Zno doesn&#39;t just offer a powerful gallery platform. The company also boasts a bevy of photo-focused programs, such as Zno Designer (for designing custom albums and other print products), Zno Slideshow (for producing high-quality slideshows), and Zno Retoucher (for quickly and effectively processing your photos).</p><p> These programs are certainly useful for professional photographers, but they also come with another significant benefit: Because Zno developed each application in the context of an all-in-one platform, the app suite is extremely well integrated. You can purchase a single subscription to gain access to the entire set of Zno apps, and you also only need to create a single account with one login.</p><p> There&#39;s also a dashboard that allows you to launch all of your apps; it&#39;s like a handy toolbox for tackling client galleries, slideshows, album designs, and more. But most importantly, the various Zno programs feature integrated functionality, meaning that the work you do in one app can prove useful when tackling tasks in another app. For instance, photos uploaded to Zno Gallery can then be used to create albums in Zno Designer or client slideshows in Zno Slideshow.</p><p> If you do want to take advantage of Zno&#39;s entire set of programs, there is a <a href="https://www.zno.com/fulfillment-apps-bundle.html" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">package subscription that comes with a major discount</a> .</p><h2 data-section id="znos-client-gallery-allows-for-seamless-printing"> Zno&#39;s Client Gallery allows for seamless printing</h2><p> I&#39;ve touched on this throughout the article, but it&#39;s so unique that it bears repeating: Zno offers software <em>and</em> in-house printing. Therefore, the integration between the company&#39;s online photo gallery platform and its lab is genuinely seamless; as soon as a client places an order in their gallery, Zno is able to instantly proceed with order fulfillment at no cost to you.</p><p> This smooth integration also comes with a couple of other major advantages. For one, certain Zno plans offer discounts on select print products, and you can also increase profits with the help of store rebates and Zno lab sales.</p><p> You can also sell albums directly from client galleries, an option not available in online stores created by competitors like Zenfolio and ShootProof.</p><h2 data-section id="how-does-zno-gallery-compare-in-price-to-other-online-photo-galleries"> How does Zno Gallery compare in price to other online photo galleries?</h2><p> To access the Zno Gallery platform, you&#39;ll need to sign up for a monthly or yearly subscription plan. Fortunately, the options are <em>very</em> reasonably priced, and each of the Zno paid plans offer complete gallery and e-store functionality as well as 0% in commissions.</p><p> In addition to its Free Plan, Zno offers:</p><ul><li> A Basic Plan with 10 GB of storage ($5/month with annual billing or $7/month with monthly billing)</li><li> A Standard Plan with 100 GB of storage ($10/month with annual billing or $14/month with monthly billing)</li><li> An Unlimited Plan with unlimited storage ($20/month with annual billing or $28/month with monthly billing)</li></ul><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254003" style="width:1124px"><span class="space" style="width:1124px; padding-top:73.13%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1124" height="822" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-110.jpg?resize=1124%2C822&#038;ssl=1" alt="Zno online photo gallery" class="wp-image-254003" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-110.jpg?w=1124&amp;ssl=1 1124w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-110.jpg?resize=300%2C219&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-110.jpg?resize=600%2C439&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-110.jpg?resize=768%2C562&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/online-photo-gallery-110.jpg?resize=717%2C524&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Below, I run through the pricing offered by competitors.

It determines how much of the scene you can capture and how close or far away objects appear.</p><p> Consumer lenses come in a range of focal lengths (from around 8mm to 800mm). On the low end, we have ultra-wide lenses that can capture a vast portion of the scene. On the high end, we have ultra-long lenses like 800mm, which capture only a tiny sliver of the scene and are perfect for getting close to distant subjects like wildlife.</p><p> Note that focal length is a property of the lens, not the camera. Some lenses offer wide focal lengths, some offer standard (medium) focal lengths, and some offer telephoto focal lengths. Prime lenses are capable of photographing at a fixed focal length, such as 50mm, while zoom lenses can shoot at multiple focal lengths, like 24-70mm, allowing you to adjust your crop as needed.</p><p> Different focal lengths cater to different genres and photographic subjects, so the best focal length for you will depend heavily on what you want to photograph. Are you into capturing breathtaking landscapes, compelling portraits, bustling street scenes, or intricate macro details? Each genre has its own set of ideal focal lengths (as I explore throughout this article!).</p><h2 data-section id="common-focal-lengths-to-consider"> Common focal lengths to consider</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253951" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-7.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="The best focal length in photography" class="wp-image-253951" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-7.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-7.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-7.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-7.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-7.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Below, I share a few of the most common focal lengths you&#39;ll encounter in photography.

It&#39;s easy to experiment with, not only because there are many affordable 24mm prime options available, but also because you&#39;ll find this focal length at the wide end of many zoom lenses, such as a 24-70mm f/4 or f/2.8. Also, many kit lenses feature a 24mm wide end once you account for the APS-C crop factor.</p><p> A 24mm prime lens will be sufficiently wide and remarkably sharp, making it an ideal candidate for landscape photography. Zooms are wonderful for landscape photography, too, but the locked-in field of view (on a 24mm prime lens) will force you to think carefully about your compositions. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/5-Focal-Lengths-and-Why-You-Should-Use-Them-2.jpg?ssl=1" alt="landscape at 24mm" title="5 Focal Lengths and Why You Should Use Them-2.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> The 24mm focal length also excels in low-light situations.

On the other hand, 35mm isn&#39;t <em>too</em> wide; you can use it to photograph natural-looking people, close-up details, and more.</p><p> This same philosophy applies to wedding or event photography, which is why these photographers <em>love</em> the 35mm focal length, especially when combined with a wide maximum aperture such as f/1.8 or even f/1.4. Note that 35mm prime lenses, like 24mm lenses, tend to be impressively cheap – so if you&#39;re on a budget, 35mm is a great place to start.</p><p> Another nice thing about 35mm: It&#39;s great for environmental portraits, especially those casual, spur-of-the-moment portrait opportunities that come up at family gatherings and dinner with friends. For instance, I often use 35mm to shoot portraits across the dinner table: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/5-Focal-Lengths-and-Why-You-Should-Use-Them-4.jpg?ssl=1" alt="man laughing at a table" title="5 Focal Lengths and Why You Should Use Them-4.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Any wider, and my subject&#39;s face might suffer from feature-exaggerating perspective distortion; any narrower, and I&#39;d have had to get out of my seat to back up for the shot. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/5-Focal-Lengths-and-Why-You-Should-Use-Them-5.jpg?ssl=1" alt="woman with wine at a table" title="5 Focal Lengths and Why You Should Use Them-5.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 data-section id="mm"> 3. 50mm</h3><p> <strong>The best genres for 50mm lenses</strong> : Street photography, full-body portrait photography, walk-around shooting</p><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/why-a-50mm-lens-is-your-new-best-friend/" target="_blank" aria-label="50mm primes (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">50mm primes</a> are <em>the</em> lenses for the photography beginner for a whole host of reasons.

You can purchase a brand-new 50mm lens for most camera systems for a little over $100.

Here wide and ultra-wide focal lengths can work wonders, allowing you to capture sweeping compositions with plenty of foreground and background details.</p><p> Professional landscape photographers often opt for expensive zoom lenses that cover around 12mm to 24mm. However, if you&#39;re on a budget, there are slightly narrower zoom options available, such as 16-35mm lenses. Alternatively, you might consider starting with a versatile 24mm prime lens.</p><p> Also, while <a aria-label="wide angles (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/7-ways-to-get-more-out-of-a-wide-angle-lens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">wide angles</a> dominate landscape photography, don&#39;t underestimate the power of longer focal lengths. Working at 70mm, 135mm, and even 200mm allows you to focus on specific elements within the landscape to reveal intricate patterns and details.</p><h3 data-section id="the-best-focal-length-for-portraits"> The best focal length for portraits</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253944" style="width:380px"><span class="space" style="width:380px; padding-top:157.89%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="380" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-8.jpg?resize=380%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="The best focal length in photography" class="wp-image-253944" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-8.jpg?resize=380%2C600&amp;ssl=1 380w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-8.jpg?resize=190%2C300&amp;ssl=1 190w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-8.jpg?resize=768%2C1213&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-8.jpg?resize=717%2C1132&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-8.jpg?w=950&amp;ssl=1 950w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> In portrait photography, it&#39;s often a good idea to capture a variety of shots of each subject: more environmental (wider) images, full-body and half-body compositions, and tighter head-and-shoulders and headshots. Therefore, you&#39;ll need to familiarize yourself with a handful of different focal lengths.</p><p> When you want to tell a broader story and incorporate the surroundings of your subject, wider focal lengths like 24mm to 35mm are the way to go; they&#39;ll allow you to capture plenty of context, which will in turn create a sense of place and add depth to your portraits.</p><p> For capturing full-body or half-body compositions, the 50mm focal length is ideal. It strikes a perfect balance, allowing you to maintain a natural perspective while also creating solid background bokeh.</p><p> Next, the 85mm focal length works great for head-and-shoulders compositions or close-up headshots. This focal length is highly flattering, as it makes it easy to gently compress facial features and produce a pleasing background separation. Plus, with an 85mm lens, you can capture intimate details while maintaining a comfortable shooting distance.</p><p> Finally, if you&#39;re looking to create high-quality headshots, you might want to consider longer focal lengths like 135mm or even 200mm. You can capture exquisite details and achieve stunning subject-background separation, and thanks to the longer reach, you can maintain a comfortable distance when doing close-ups.</p><h3 data-section id="the-best-focal-length-for-street-photography"> The best focal length for street photography</h3><p> There are two focal lengths that are widely favored by street photographers: 50mm and 35mm. In fact, whether you should use 50mm or 35mm for street photography is a common point of contention among street shooters!</p><p> <a aria-label="35mm is an excellent choice for street photographers (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/35mm-street-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">35mm is an excellent choice for street photographers</a> who embrace the energy and dynamism of busy urban areas. It excels at capturing candid moments and street scenes filled with activity (though you can also use it in quieter parts of the city to create compelling urban landscape shots). If you prefer a more immersive approach where you want to get up close and personal with your subjects, 35mm is the way to go. It&#39;s perfect for capturing images that convey the vibrant atmosphere of bustling streets and can provide a sense of <em>being there</em> in the action.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253943" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.07%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="991" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C991&#038;ssl=1" alt="The best focal length in photography" class="wp-image-253943" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-2.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-2.jpg?resize=600%2C396&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-2.jpg?resize=768%2C507&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-2.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-2.jpg?resize=717%2C474&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> On the other hand, <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/50mm-street-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">50mm is ideal</a> if you&#39;re looking to isolate your subject from the surrounding environment. It&#39;s particularly useful on crowded streets where you want to focus on a specific person or object without distractions. Additionally, the 50mm focal length provides a natural perspective – similar to what our eyes see – so it&#39;s great for creating authentic compositions.</p><p> At the end of the day, choosing between 35mm and 50mm for street photography often boils down to personal preference and shooting style. If you enjoy capturing the bustling chaos and prefer close interactions on the streets, 35mm is an excellent go-to focal length. On the other hand, if you prefer a more focused and isolated approach where your subject stands out from the surroundings, 50mm will serve you well.</p><h3 data-section id="the-best-focal-length-for-macro-photography"> The best focal length for macro photography</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253942" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="The best focal length in photography" class="wp-image-253942" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-4.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-4.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-4.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-4.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-4.jpg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/best-focal-length-photography-4.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> For most close-up photography purposes, I highly recommend investing in a <a aria-label="dedicated macro lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lenses-for-macro-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">dedicated macro lens</a> . These models are specifically designed to deliver exceptional high-magnification capabilities. When it comes to focal lengths, macro lenses typically range from 50mm to 100mm, though there are a few wider or longer options.</p><p> If you&#39;re seeking the versatility needed to capture a broad range of macro subjects, the sweet spot often falls in the 90-110mm window. At around 100mm, you can easily photograph small objects, plants, flowers, food, and occasional insects. With this focal length, you&#39;ll be able to maintain a comfortable shooting distance while capturing intricate details and textures.</p><p> However, if your primary goal is to capture breathtaking shots of insects, consider a longer focal length (such as 180mm). The extra reach of a lengthy telephoto lens will help you capture detailed close-ups of dragonflies, butterflies, and more without disturbing their natural behavior.</p><h2 data-section id="the-best-focal-length-in-photography-final-words"> The best focal length in photography: final words</h2><p> Whether you&#39;re capturing breathtaking landscapes, soul-revealing portraits, busy street shots, or close-up macro scenes, the right focal length can make all the difference. Hopefully, you now have a sense of the perfect length for your favorite types of photography, and you&#39;re ready to head out with your camera (or purchase a new lens).</p><p> That said, the best focal length does come down to personal preference – so if you don&#39;t like my recommendations, that&#39;s completely okay!

That&#39;s what makes it so powerful – it&#39;s a simple way to improve your compositions, and it requires literally zero art training or photographic experience.</p><p> I&#39;ll say it up front, though: Rules are meant to be broken, and just because you ignore the rule of thirds doesn&#39;t mean that your composition is uninteresting, bland, or otherwise bad. Despite its name, the rule of thirds is a <em>guideline</em> , not a hard-and-fast <em>rule</em> . You can absolutely create beautiful compositions without using the rule of thirds.</p><p> Also, keep in mind that it&#39;s just one composition technique among many. There are plenty of other “rules” and guidelines worth considering, such as <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/two-shot-strategy-symmetry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">symmetry</a> , the <a aria-label="rule of odds (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/the-rule-of-odds-in-photography-an-easy-trick-for-better-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">rule of odds</a> , <a aria-label="triangular compositions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/triangle-composition-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">triangular compositions</a> , and more.</p><p> At the same time, the rule of thirds is an excellent way to get started with composition. It consistently produces great results, and even professional photographers use it all the time in their work. Plus, as a wise person once told me: If you intend to break a rule, you should always learn it first! That way, you can make sure you break it as effectively as possible.</p><h2 data-section id="why-is-the-rule-of-thirds-useful"> Why is the rule of thirds useful?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-210162" style="width:415px"><span class="space" style="width:415px; padding-top:144.58%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="415" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rule-of-thirds-in-photography-1007-2.jpg?resize=415%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="flower rule of thirds example" class="wp-image-210162" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rule-of-thirds-in-photography-1007-2.jpg?resize=415%2C600&amp;ssl=1 415w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rule-of-thirds-in-photography-1007-2.jpg?resize=208%2C300&amp;ssl=1 208w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rule-of-thirds-in-photography-1007-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1110&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rule-of-thirds-in-photography-1007-2.jpg?resize=717%2C1037&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rule-of-thirds-in-photography-1007-2.jpg?w=830&amp;ssl=1 830w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Now that you know how to follow the rule of thirds, it&#39;s important to understand <em>why</em> it matters and what exactly it can do for your photos.</p><p> At base, the rule of thirds is about two things:</p><ol><li> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/composition-balance-and-visual-mass/" target="_blank" aria-label="Balance (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Balance</a></li><li> Dynamism (movement)</li></ol><p> First, by positioning key elements at rule-of-thirds intersections or gridlines, your photo becomes more <em>balanced</em> .

There&#39;s nowhere for the viewer&#39;s eye to wander; instead, the viewer looks at the shot, sees the subject at its center, then turns away.</p><p> But the rule of thirds encourages <em>dynamism</em> . When encountering dynamic images, the viewer starts by appreciating a key element of the shot, then takes a visual journey throughout the rest of the scene. In other words, a rule-of-thirds composition provides a more engaging photographic experience.</p><p> One more thing: The rule of thirds draws on the way humans naturally view images. Studies show that people&#39;s eyes usually go to one of the intersection points rather than the center of the shot – so the rule of thirds works with this natural way of viewing an image.</p><h2 data-section id="when-should-you-use-the-rule-of-thirds"> When should you use the rule of thirds?</h2><p> The rule of thirds is helpful in a wide variety of scenarios – basically, anytime you have distinct compositional elements to work with, you can try applying the rule.</p><p> In fact, professional photographers swear by the rule of thirds in a wide range of genres. Whether you&#39;re capturing breathtaking portraits, sweeping landscapes, bustling street scenes, or even product photography, it can offer outstanding results. It&#39;s versatile, adaptable, and adds a touch of harmony and dynamism to each image, engaging the viewer in a way that feels <em>just right</em> .</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253924" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:62.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="938" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-11.jpg?resize=1500%2C938&#038;ssl=1" alt="Rule of Thirds in Photography: The Essential Guide" class="wp-image-253924" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-11.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-11.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-11.jpg?resize=600%2C375&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-11.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-11.jpg?resize=717%2C448&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> But the rule of thirds can – and should – be broken. Remember, the rule is all about balance and creating a sense of harmony, but sometimes you may want to challenge the norm. If you&#39;re aiming to create tension or a minimalist feel, it&#39;s perfectly fine to step away from the rule and try a different approach instead.</p><p> For those of you just starting out, however, my advice is to give the rule of thirds a go whenever you encounter a new subject. Capture a couple of shots while allowing the rule to guide you. Then, once you&#39;ve got a feel for it, don&#39;t be afraid to mix things up and experiment with other compositional techniques like minimalism, the golden ratio, or the golden spiral.</p><p> When you review your photos later (on your computer), you&#39;ll get a better sense of which approach resonates with your style and the scene itself.</p><h2 data-section id="how-to-use-the-rule-of-thirds-with-examples"> How to use the rule of thirds (with examples)</h2><p> Because the rule of thirds is so universal, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t explain how to use it in every possible genre or scenario; that article would be never ending!

This simple alignment can add an extra layer of harmony to your composition.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253914" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Rule of Thirds in Photography: The Essential Guide" class="wp-image-253914" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-4.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-4.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-4.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Now, let&#39;s focus on the main subjects that bring life to the streets. If there&#39;s a person walking by a building or a captivating scene unfolding before your eyes, try positioning them at one of the power points. This placement adds a touch of emphasis and draws the viewer&#39;s attention right to the heart of the action.</p><p> But what if you prefer to get up close and personal with your subjects? In that case, consider placing their head at one of the power points while aligning their body along one of the vertical gridlines. This technique not only creates a visually pleasing composition but also adds a sense of connection between the subject and their surroundings.</p><h2 data-section id="applying-the-rule-in-post-processing"> Applying the rule in post-processing</h2><p> If you didn&#39;t have the chance to employ the rule of thirds while out in the field, fret not! There&#39;s still a way to bring that balanced magic to your photographs through a little post-processing wizardry.</p><p> Step into the realm of your favorite editing program and grab hold of the crop tool. This powerful tool allows you to trim away portions of the frame, unlocking the potential to align key elements with the rule of thirds gridlines and power points. It&#39;s like giving your composition a second chance to shine.</p><p> Not only can you refine your composition, but post-processing offers an opportunity to experiment with different arrangements and gauge their impact. Test the waters of various compositions and see which ones truly resonate with your artistic vision. It&#39;s an avenue for growth and discovery.</p><p> Of course, it&#39;s always best to nail the composition right there in the field, capturing that perfect balance without the need for cropping. But hey, we&#39;re all human, and sometimes a slight crop can salvage a photo that deserves a second lease on life. While cropping does result in a slight reduction in image resolution, the trade-off is generally worth it. It&#39;s far better to have a well-composed image with slightly fewer pixels than a lackluster shot bursting with unnecessary details!</p><h2 data-section id="the-rule-of-thirds-vs-the-golden-ratio"> The rule of thirds vs the golden ratio</h2><p> Photographers and photography instructors often toss around terms like “rule of thirds” and “golden ratio,” leaving many beginners scratching their heads in confusion. What sets these two concepts apart? Let&#39;s dive deeper into the world of composition and unravel the mysteries behind these techniques.</p><p> Imagine your camera&#39;s viewfinder as a blank canvas waiting to be transformed into a captivating masterpiece. The rule of thirds provides you with a straightforward three-by-three grid, dividing the frame into nine equal sections. On the other hand, the golden ratio gives birth to a different grid: the phi grid.</p><p> While the phi grid shares similarities with the golden ratio, it concentrates its gridlines in the center of the frame, creating a sense of intensity and a touch of static energy. When employing the phi grid, you position essential elements of your composition along these gridlines, just as you would with the rule of thirds.</p><p> But which grid should you choose? The rule of thirds offers a distinct advantage: It&#39;s more accessible and easier to remember precisely where the gridlines should align. Plus, many cameras and even smartphones offer gridline guides that can be activated to assist you during shooting.</p><p> That being said, some photographers find themselves drawn to the golden ratio&#39;s phi grid. It offers a unique visual aesthetic and can create an intriguing sense of balance in your images. I recommend starting with the rule of thirds, then gradually exploring the golden ratio grid to see how it resonates with your artistic vision.</p><h2 data-section id="should-you-break-the-rule-of-thirds"> Should you break the rule of thirds?</h2><p> It <em>is</em> possible to break the rule of thirds and end up with beautiful photos. As I&#39;ve emphasized throughout this article, the rule of thirds isn&#39;t a rule, but a guideline. Yes, it&#39;ll often get you great results, but sometimes you can end up with an even stronger composition by taking a different approach. By deliberately deviating from the rule, you can create images that captivate viewers and evoke emotions in unexpected ways.</p><p> So while I encourage you to learn the rule of thirds, <em>once</em> it&#39;s ingrained, experiment with breaking it.</p><p> One of my favorite times to break the rule of thirds is when photographing symmetrical subjects. If you&#39;re photographing a succulent or flower from above, the symmetry looks even more striking when perfectly centered in the frame:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-210157" style="width:1200px"><span class="space" style="width:1200px; padding-top:78.58%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="943" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rule-of-thirds-in-photography-1009.jpg?resize=1200%2C943&#038;ssl=1" alt="symmetrical succulent" class="wp-image-210157" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rule-of-thirds-in-photography-1009.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rule-of-thirds-in-photography-1009.jpg?resize=300%2C236&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rule-of-thirds-in-photography-1009.jpg?resize=600%2C472&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rule-of-thirds-in-photography-1009.jpg?resize=768%2C604&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rule-of-thirds-in-photography-1009.jpg?resize=717%2C563&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> This shot of a corridor is also roughly symmetrical, which increases the composition&#39;s intensity:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-210159" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:61.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="919" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rule-of-thirds-in-photography-1010-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C919&#038;ssl=1" alt="man in corridor with cello breaking the rule of thirds" class="wp-image-210159" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rule-of-thirds-in-photography-1010-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rule-of-thirds-in-photography-1010-1.jpg?resize=300%2C184&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rule-of-thirds-in-photography-1010-1.jpg?resize=600%2C368&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rule-of-thirds-in-photography-1010-1.jpg?resize=768%2C471&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rule-of-thirds-in-photography-1010-1.jpg?resize=717%2C439&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> You can also experiment with breaking the rule of thirds is by deliberately placing your main subject toward the edge of the frame. This bold approach can add a sense of tension, drawing attention to the subject and creating a visually striking composition. It challenges the viewer&#39;s expectations, encouraging them to explore the image beyond the conventional confines of composition.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253915" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-10.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Rule of Thirds in Photography: The Essential Guide" class="wp-image-253915" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-10.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-10.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-10.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-10.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-10.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-10.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Another creative avenue is to play with the placement of the horizon line. Instead of adhering to the traditional approach of positioning the horizon along the rule of thirds gridlines, try placing it high up or low down in the frame. This technique can evoke a sense of vastness and emphasize the sky or foreground, creating a minimalist aesthetic that exudes tranquility or a sense of grandeur.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253916" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="Rule of Thirds in Photography: The Essential Guide" class="wp-image-253916" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-1.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-1.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-1.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> That said, breaking the rule of thirds should not be done haphazardly or simply for the sake of rebellion. Instead, it should be a deliberate choice that enhances the story or visual impact of your photograph.</p><h2 data-section id="tips-and-tricks-to-improve-your-rule-of-thirds-photos"> Tips and tricks to improve your rule of thirds photos</h2><p> Want to level up your rule of thirds compositions? Here are a few quick tips to use the rule like a pro:</p><h3 data-section id="turn-on-your-cameras-gridlines"> 1. Turn on your camera&#39;s gridlines</h3><p> One powerful tool at your disposal is the rule of thirds, a technique that can transform your images from ordinary to extraordinary.</p><p> But how do you ensure that you&#39;re applying the rule of thirds with precision and finesse? The answer lies in activating your camera&#39;s gridlines. Most cameras, whether it&#39;s a professional DSLR or your trusty smartphone, offer a rule of thirds overlay that acts as your guiding compass in composing stunning shots.</p><p> Once you&#39;ve enabled this invaluable feature, behold the magic that unfolds before your eyes. With the gridlines gracing your camera&#39;s LCD or even your viewfinder, you gain a remarkable advantage. You can effortlessly align your subjects with the gridlines, creating a sense of balance and visual harmony that captivates the viewer.</p><p> Personally, I recommend using the viewfinder gridlines. That way, you can immerse yourself in the scene while remaining acutely aware of the gridline positions. It allows you to maintain a connection with your subject while <em>also</em> ensuring that every element falls perfectly into place.</p><p> The convenience doesn&#39;t end there. Even smartphone cameras have embraced the rule of thirds, providing gridline overlays to enhance your mobile photography experience. So whether you&#39;re wielding a professional-grade camera or capturing moments with your phone, don&#39;t hesitate to embrace the power of gridlines.</p><h3 data-section id="identify-a-main-subject-in-each-scene"> 2. Identify a main subject in each scene</h3><p> Imagine yourself standing before a breathtaking landscape, a bustling city street, or a stunning portrait. Before you even lift your camera, take a moment to immerse yourself in the scene. Look for that one element that commands attention, the focal point that will become the anchor of your composition.</p><p> It could be a majestic mountain peak, bathed in the soft hues of a sunrise, drawing the viewer&#39;s gaze upwards and filling them with awe. Perhaps it&#39;s a solitary figure walking along a deserted beach, exuding a sense of solitude and introspection. Or maybe it&#39;s a vibrant flower, bursting with color and life, inviting you to explore its delicate details.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253917" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Rule of Thirds in Photography: The Essential Guide" class="wp-image-253917" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-2.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Once you&#39;ve identified your main subject, it&#39;s time to unleash its power via the rule of thirds framework. Positioning your subject along one of the intersecting gridlines or at a power point can create a visually harmonious composition that captivates the viewer&#39;s eye. By aligning your main subject with these strategic points, you create a sense of balance and visual interest that elevates your photograph to new heights.</p><p> Remember, the rule of thirds is not merely about placing any random element along the gridlines; it&#39;s about highlighting the most significant, visually striking aspects of your scene. By thoughtfully framing your main subject within the rule of thirds, you guide the viewer&#39;s attention directly to the heart of your image, leaving a lasting impression.</p><h3 data-section id="incorporate-leading-lines-into-your-images"> 3. Incorporate leading lines into your images</h3><p> The rule of thirds is a tried-and-true technique that can do a great job on its own. However, combining it with other compositional elements can take your images to new heights, and one powerful technique that can give your photos an extra boost is leading lines.</p><p> Leading lines are like visual pathways that guide the viewer&#39;s gaze towards the main subject, creating a sense of depth and movement within the frame. They can be found in various forms, such as winding roads, meandering rivers, architectural lines, or even everyday objects like fences or footprints in the sand.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253918" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:60.07%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="901" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-5.jpg?resize=1500%2C901&#038;ssl=1" alt="Rule of Thirds in Photography: The Essential Guide" class="wp-image-253918" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-5.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-5.jpg?resize=300%2C180&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-5.jpg?resize=600%2C360&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-5.jpg?resize=768%2C461&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rule-of-thirds-photography-5.jpg?resize=717%2C431&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> To incorporate leading lines effectively, begin by seeking out a scene that presents these captivating elements. Look for lines that seem to converge or flow towards your intended focal point. This could be a person, an object, or a particular area of interest that you want to highlight within the frame.</p><p> Once you have identified your subject and the leading lines within the scene, it&#39;s time to align them with the rule of thirds. Position your main subject along one of the gridlines, while allowing the leading lines to flow naturally towards it. This dual approach creates a dynamic composition that draws the viewer&#39;s eye into the photograph, leading them on a visual journey towards the focal point.</p><p> Imagine a photograph of a lone hiker standing at the edge of a magnificent mountain range. The winding path that leads to the hiker serves as a leading line, guiding the viewer&#39;s gaze from the foreground towards the majestic peaks in the distance. By placing the hiker along one of the rule of thirds gridlines, you create a harmonious balance between the subject and the surrounding landscape, emphasizing their significance within the composition.</p><p> Incorporating leading lines into your photography opens up a world of creative possibilities. It adds depth, visual interest, and a sense of narrative to your images. Experiment with different scenes and subjects, and observe how leading lines interact with the rule of thirds to create compelling compositions.</p><h3 data-section id="analyze-the-work-of-your-favorite-photographers"> 4. Analyze the work of your favorite photographers</h3><p> One of the most powerful ways to truly internalize a photographic technique is to immerse yourself in the captivating work of other talented photographers. By examining and dissecting their images, you can gain valuable insights into how they skillfully employ the rule of thirds to create captivating and visually striking compositions.</p><p> So spend time visiting the websites or Instagram pages of your favorite photographers. Take your time to browse through their portfolio, paying particular attention to the photographs that incorporate the rule of thirds.</p><p> As you explore these images, ask yourself questions, such as: Where precisely did the photographer position their main subject within the frame? Which elements gracefully align with the rule of thirds gridlines? How do the strategic placements of these elements contribute to the overall impact of the composition? What emotions or story does the rule of thirds evoke?</p><p> Over time, you&#39;ll develop an intuitive eye for the effective use of the rule of thirds. Studying the works of experienced photographers will expose you to a wealth of creative possibilities and allow you to gain a deeper understanding of how the rule can be harnessed to produce compelling, original shots.</p><h2 data-section id="the-rule-of-thirds-in-photography-final-words"> The rule of thirds in photography: final words</h2><p> The rule of thirds is a powerful and versatile method of photographic composition that can greatly enhance your images. Whether you&#39;re a beginner, an intermediate photographer, or a professional, incorporating the rule of thirds into your compositions can elevate the visual impact of your photos.</p><p> While it&#39;s important to note that the rule of thirds is not a strict rule that must be followed in every photo, it serves as a valuable guideline that rarely disappoints. It provides a strong foundation for creating well-balanced and visually appealing images.</p><p> As you gain experience and explore different creative avenues, don&#39;t be afraid to break the rule of thirds intentionally for artistic effect. However, understanding and practicing the rule of thirds will sharpen your compositional skills and give you a solid starting point for creating captivating photographs.</p><p> So grab your camera and explore the world.

But before you can provide a client with an estimate, you need to know the specifics of what you&#39;ll be capturing. This will help you gauge how long the shoot will take, as different subjects, like beverages, may require extra attention due to tricky glass reflections.</p><p> To price your services accurately, it&#39;s crucial to base your estimates on the project scope. So ask for a detailed breakdown of the number of food images, drink images, and other requirements. Some restaurants may request you to bring your own props like surfaces, dishes, and linens. That&#39;s not necessarily a problem; just make sure you understand the look the client is seeking. Also, bear in mind that shooting prop-filled scenes may take a bit longer compared to capturing dishes on the restaurant tables.</p><p> Remember, a well-prepared shot list not only helps you plan and estimate better but also ensures you&#39;re equipped with everything you need to deliver stunning images!</p><h2 data-section id="scout-for-the-location-and-light"> 2. <span class="s1">Scout for the location and light</span></h2><p> If you want to capture those appetizing shots, understanding the lighting conditions is crucial. So before your shoot, take the time to explore the restaurant, getting a feel for its lighting, layout, and ambiance. While most areas of restaurants are usually accessible to the public, it&#39;s a good idea to ask permission if you plan on venturing into the kitchen – or if you&#39;re hoping to capture any test shots with a camera (which I highly recommend).</p><p> During your scouting expedition, pay close attention to the direction and quality of light within the restaurant. Consider how the lighting changes throughout the day and aim to schedule your session when things look their best.</p><p> Next, let&#39;s talk about setting up your equipment and workspace. You&#39;ll need to choose a spot in the restaurant to act as your home base; it&#39;ll be the place with the best lighting and plenty of room to work.</p><p> If you&#39;re shooting with studio lighting, keep your workspace away from the windows to avoid interference from ambient light. On the other hand, if you&#39;re harnessing the beauty of natural light, positioning yourself near the windows is a great idea.</p><p> Finally, it&#39;s important to get the manager or proprietor on board with your plans; be sure to explain where you plan to shoot and what you plan to bring with you.</p><p> Pro tip: While you&#39;re shooting, be mindful of the restaurant&#39;s patrons. Strive to be discreet and unobtrusive to minimize disturbances. Consider asking if a section of the restaurant can be temporarily closed off so you can shoot without inconveniencing anyone.</p><h2 data-section id="discuss-styling-the-food"> 3. <span class="s1">Discuss styling the food</span></h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-180189" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.87%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1003" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-italian.jpg?resize=1500%2C1003&#038;ssl=1" alt="10 Tips for Successful Restaurant Photography" class="wp-image-180189" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-italian.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-italian.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-italian.jpg?resize=768%2C514&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-italian.jpg?resize=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-italian.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-italian.jpg?resize=436%2C293&amp;ssl=1 436w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-italian.jpg?resize=717%2C479&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Establishing clear boundaries is essential when shooting for restaurants. As a professional photographer, it&#39;s important to make it crystal clear from the outset that your expertise lies in capturing remarkable images, <em>not</em> in the intricate <a aria-label="art of food styling (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-tips-to-improve-your-food-photography-styling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">art of food styling</a> .</p><p> Food styling requires a distinct set of skills that often belongs to chefs or dedicated food stylists. Let your clients know that while you excel at lighting and image capture, the responsibility for plating the food falls outside your scope. (On the other hand, if you happen to possess a talent for both photography and food styling, feel free to skip to the next section!)</p><p> In other words, the restaurant owners should be sure their chef is up to the task of styling each plage – and if they aren&#39;t, they&#39;ll need to consider hiring a food stylist. Unfortunately, food stylists are expensive, but at the very least, your client should recognize that the final look of the food on the plate ultimately falls on their shoulders. Be sure to address this in your contract (and if you don&#39;t have one, get one right away!).</p><p> That said, even though you&#39;re not directly responsible for plating, it&#39;s still crucial to pay attention to the finer details that enhance the food&#39;s appearance. Keep a keen eye out for garnishes – it&#39;s important that they complement the dish! – and watch for any stray crumbs that might distract from the overall visual appeal. Trust me; I&#39;ve been known to send back a bad-looking burger or two!</p><h2 data-section id="bring-a-food-styling-kit-and-some-basic-props"> 4. <span class="s1">Bring a food styling kit and some basic props</span></h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-180192" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-main.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="successful-restaurant-photography" class="wp-image-180192" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-main.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-main.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-main.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-main.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-main.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Although you won&#39;t be the one plating and styling the food, it&#39;s crucial to have a basic styling kit on hand. Equip yourself with useful tools like tweezers, cotton swabs, and small brushes. These little helpers will assist you in taming unruly garnishes, and they&#39;ll come in handy when you need to wipe away crumbs or drips from a plate. Remember, even if you&#39;re not the one doing the plating, you want to present it in the best possible way.</p><p> Don&#39;t forget to pack a few <a aria-label="props (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/diy-food-photography-props/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">props</a> to act as the supporting actors in your food photography production. You might try using linens in different shapes, sizes, and colors, which can add texture and visual interest to your compositions. Also consider bringing some cutlery to enhance the overall aesthetic.</p><p> But make sure to get your props approved before shooting! Some clients may want their tables, flatware, and dishes captured as they appear to customers, while others might have specific branding that requires a particular look or ambiance.</p><p> For instance, if your clients desire dark and moody images, they won&#39;t be pleased if you show up and start shooting with bright white linens. Instead, you&#39;ll need to be prepared with small, dark dishes and vintage cutlery. It&#39;s important to talk to the client about this beforehand to prevent any confusion!</p><h2 data-section id="choose-your-lighting-wisely"> 5. <span class="s1">Choose your lighting wisely</span></h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-180185" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:73.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1101" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-action.jpg?resize=1500%2C1101&#038;ssl=1" alt="successful-restaurant-photography" class="wp-image-180185" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-action.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-action.jpg?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-action.jpg?resize=768%2C564&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-action.jpg?resize=600%2C440&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-action.jpg?resize=717%2C526&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Lighting is a critical factor in capturing enticing food photographs.</p><p> While natural light can work wonders, most restaurants tend to be dimly lit, which can be a real challenge. If you rely solely on natural light, you&#39;ll need to position yourself near a window and work on a tripod so you can decrease your shutter speed without losing sharpness. (Keep in mind that this technique isn&#39;t suitable for photographing moving people. However, if you&#39;re shooting for the web or social media, you can generally just increase the ISO and address any noise issues during post-production.)</p><p> During your restaurant scout, take a few test shots and review them in Lightroom to assess the lighting situation. While natural light may suffice, it&#39;s also beneficial to have a set of strobes or speedlights on hand as a backup plan in case the available natural light doesn&#39;t meet your desired aesthetic.</p><p> By being prepared with alternative lighting options, you won&#39;t have to worry about sudden changes in the weather ruining your entire shoot.</p><h2 data-section id="photograph-to-meet-the-clients-needs"> 6. <span class="s1">Photograph to meet the client&#39;s needs</span></h2><p> When preparing for your restaurant photoshoot, it&#39;s essential to have a conversation with the client ahead of time. Ideally, this conversation should take place days or even weeks in advance. During this discussion, ask about the preferred format and resolution for the images. That way, you can ensure that you capture the perfect shots that align with their vision.</p><p> In most cases, restaurants require images primarily for their website, in which case landscape orientation is often the way to go. Landscape shots often integrate seamlessly with restaurant website displays.</p><p> But it&#39;s worth noting that if the client intends to print some of the images on their menu, a vertical format may be necessary. Keep in mind that if the client requests both orientations, it may take twice as long to complete the photoshoot. Not only will you need to adjust the camera before each new shot sequence, but you&#39;ll also need to recompose each image. Be sure to factor this into your pricing and have a transparent discussion with the client beforehand to manage expectations.</p><p> By proactively understanding the client&#39;s preferences and planning accordingly, you can ensure you capture stunning images that meet their specific needs.</p><h2 data-section id="shoot-tethered"> 7. <span class="s1">Shoot tethered</span></h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-180188" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:69.47%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1042" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-high-tea.jpg?resize=1500%2C1042&#038;ssl=1" alt="10 Tips for Successful Restaurant Photography" class="wp-image-180188" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-high-tea.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-high-tea.jpg?resize=300%2C208&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-high-tea.jpg?resize=768%2C534&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-high-tea.jpg?resize=600%2C417&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-high-tea.jpg?resize=717%2C498&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> <a aria-label="Tethered shooting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tutorial-shoot-tethered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Tethered shooting</a> may seem like a hassle for many beginners. Who wants to lug around a laptop in a restaurant and juggle it alongside their camera? Yes, working with your camera connected to a laptop can be inconvenient, but it&#39;s also a <em>major</em> game-changer.</p><p> I always do restaurant shooting tethered.为什么？ For starters, shooting tethered allows me to view my shots in greater detail because my laptop screen certainly surpasses what I can see on the back of my camera.</p><p> But that&#39;s not all. Tethering also comes in handy when I want to show my clients the images as I work (which I highly recommend!). They can easily point out any looks they love or don&#39;t quite fancy.</p><p> Now, I know what you&#39;re thinking: Isn&#39;t tethering rather complicated? Not really! It&#39;s actually simpler than you might predict. You can use popular software like Lightroom or Capture One Pro for tethering; just make sure you have a high-quality cord on hand to ensure a seamless connection (as well as a backup cord just in case!).</p><h2 data-section id="work-with-the-client"> 8. <span class="s1">Work with the client</span></h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-180190" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:67.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1011" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MG_3869.jpg?resize=1500%2C1011&#038;ssl=1" alt="10 Tips for Successful Restaurant Photography" class="wp-image-180190" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MG_3869.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MG_3869.jpg?resize=300%2C202&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MG_3869.jpg?resize=768%2C518&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MG_3869.jpg?resize=600%2C404&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MG_3869.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MG_3869.jpg?resize=436%2C293&amp;ssl=1 436w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MG_3869.jpg?resize=717%2C483&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> As a professional restaurant photographer, your goal should not be to take photos that <em>you</em> feel are great. Instead, your goal is to deliver exceptional work that impresses the <em>client</em> .</p><p> That&#39;s why it&#39;s crucial to involve the client in the process. If possible, arrange an in-person meeting ahead of the shoot. Then insist that your client works with you to provide creative direction and approve the captured images on the day of the shoot. It&#39;ll prevent any surprises or discrepancies later, and you&#39;ll avoid complaints that the photos don&#39;t align with the restaurant&#39;s branding or aesthetic.</p><p> As a professional photographer, you must protect your time and effort. That&#39;s why I include a clause in my contract stating that I won&#39;t commence a shoot without a representative from the restaurant present. I also include a clause noting that if I have to pack up my gear and leave due to their absence, they will forfeit their deposit. While this may seem like an unpleasant measure, it&#39;s necessary to maintain a smooth workflow and produce outstanding results.</p><p> By actively involving the client throughout the photography process, you can create a collaborative atmosphere that boosts client satisfaction – so remember to communicate, establish expectations, and ensure their presence during the shoot.</p><h2 data-section id="collaborate-with-the-chef"> 9. <span class="s1">Collaborate with the chef</span></h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-180187" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:73.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1101" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-dessert.jpg?resize=1500%2C1101&#038;ssl=1" alt="10 Tips for Successful Restaurant Photography" class="wp-image-180187" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-dessert.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-dessert.jpg?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-dessert.jpg?resize=768%2C564&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-dessert.jpg?resize=600%2C440&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/photography-restaurant-dessert.jpg?resize=717%2C526&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> In addition to working closely with your client, it&#39;s a great idea to involve the chef in the process whenever possible.

The most memorable and enjoyable photoshoot experiences occur when the chef is genuinely excited to collaborate with you – plus, if the chef is excited, they&#39;ll strive to present their culinary creations in the most enticing way possible.

As photographers, we&#39;re in the business of capturing light, and it rarely gets better than the soft, golden rays of the early morning or late afternoon sun.</p><p> During this window – which generally lasts around an hour – the light takes on an otherworldly quality. It blankets the landscape with warm hues, adding a touch of softness and depth that you won&#39;t find during any other time of the day.</p><p> Unfortunately, capturing breathtaking golden-hour landscape photos isn&#39;t as simple as pointing your camera and clicking away. Working around sunrise and sunset comes with several major challenges, and to ensure outstanding images, you&#39;ll need to apply a few tricks and tips of the trade. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve put together this article – to help you unlock the full potential of nature&#39;s most magical time!</p><p> Below, I share a variety of helpful advice, including gear recommendations, ideal camera settings, and tips for taking advantage of that gorgeous light. So if you&#39;re ready to start capturing sun-drenched landscapes guaranteed to make your heart beat faster, let&#39;s dive right in!</p><h2 data-section id="pay-attention-to-the-direction-of-the-light"> 1. Pay attention to the direction of the light</h2><p> When it comes to capturing stunning golden-hour landscape photographs, understanding the direction of light is key. During this magical hour, the sun hangs low in the sky, casting a warm glow over the landscape. But here&#39;s the thing: Depending on the sun&#39;s position, the landscape will be hit from different angles, creating unique <a aria-label="lighting effects (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/landscape-photography-about-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">lighting effects</a> that can transform your images.</p><p> Let&#39;s break it down. There are three main lighting directions to consider: frontlight, backlight, and sidelight. Frontlight occurs when the light is coming from the front, illuminating the scene directly. This effect is often more straightforward and descriptive, showcasing the landscape in a clear way.</p><p> On the other hand, sidelight occurs when the light is coming from the side, creating beautiful shadows, emphasizing texture, and adding depth to the scene. And then we have backlight, where the light is coming from behind the subject, a striking and artistic choice that can make for captivating images.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253734" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:56.33%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="845" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-10.jpg?resize=1500%2C845&#038;ssl=1" alt="Golden-hour landscape photography tips" class="wp-image-253734" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-10.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-10.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-10.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-10.jpg?resize=768%2C433&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-10.jpg?resize=717%2C404&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Here, the sun sits somewhere between a backlit angle and a sidelit angle. The resulting photo includes a <em>lot</em> of depth!</figcaption></figure></div><p> While many landscape photographers are drawn to backlight and sidelight for their dramatic effects, don&#39;t underestimate the power of frontlight. It can produce equally stunning results and allow you to capture the landscape in all its glory.</p><p> The key is to pay attention to the position of the sun when you arrive at your location. Observe how it hits the landscape and consider the lighting direction that best suits your creative vision for each scene.</p><h2 data-section id="look-for-some-clouds"> 2. Look for some clouds</h2><p> Looking to create awe-inspiring golden-hour landscape photos? Clouds can be the extra ingredient that elevates your images from ordinary to extraordinary. They possess the remarkable ability to transform a boring image into a mesmerizing display of texture and ethereal beauty.</p><p> Of course, there is such a thing as too many clouds! A completely overcast sky will generally dampen the intensity of your photos. What you want is partly cloudy skies, which will infuse your compositions with plenty of drama and magic.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253733" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Golden-hour landscape photography tips" class="wp-image-253733" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-5.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Before embarking on your photography adventure, it&#39;s worth checking the weather forecast to gauge the cloud cover in your desired location. But don&#39;t despair if you find yourself facing a cloudless sky during the golden hour. Instead, try to explore more non-conventional shots, such as minimalist compositions where simplicity takes center stage.</p><p> Remember that, even in the absence of clouds, the golden-hour light can still work its magic!</p><h2 data-section id="bring-a-tripod"> 3. Bring a tripod</h2><p> If you plan to shoot during the golden hours, a <a aria-label="sturdy tripod (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-tripods-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">sturdy tripod</a> becomes your trusty companion. As the sun descends lower in the sky during this magical hour, the light becomes weaker. This can result in underexposed images if you don&#39;t adjust your camera settings accordingly. One way to compensate for the diminishing light is by lengthening your <a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> . However, doing so without a stable tripod can lead to unwanted blurriness in your shots.</p><p> Now, I know what you might be thinking: Tripods can be cumbersome and a hassle to carry around. But the benefits far outweigh any minor inconveniences. In addition to ensuring your photos stay sharp, tripods force you to slow down and carefully consider each composition. You might even find that working with a tripod enhances your overall photography experience.</p><p> Of course, if you find yourself without a tripod, there are alternative options to explore. You can keep your shutter speed relatively fast by increasing the <a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> or widening the <a aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> , though these adjustments do come with trade-offs. Boosting the ISO can introduce noise artifacts, while widening the aperture narrows the plane of focus, resulting in blurry portions of the scene. Therefore, while a tripod isn&#39;t a necessity, I do highly recommend it!</p><h2 data-section id="scout-the-location-in-advance"> 4. Scout the location in advance</h2><p> To make the most of the fleeting golden-hour light, it&#39;s essential to <a aria-label="scout your location in advance (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/importance-scouting-landscape-photographers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">scout your location in advance</a> . This allows you to familiarize yourself with the environment, discover potential compositions, and anticipate how the sun&#39;s light will interact with the landscape.</p><p> If you plan to shoot during the early morning, scouting becomes even more critical as you&#39;ll need to find a composition and set up your equipment in the dark.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253735" style="width:450px"><span class="space" style="width:450px; padding-top:133.33%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="450" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-7.jpg?resize=450%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Golden-hour landscape photography tips" class="wp-image-253735" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-7.jpg?resize=450%2C600&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-7.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-7.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-7.jpg?resize=717%2C956&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-7.jpg?w=1125&amp;ssl=1 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Consider allocating time before your planned shoot to visit the location. It can be days in advance or just a few hours (if you&#39;re shooting in the evening). During your scouting trip, pay attention to the various subjects that catch your eye. Visualize how the sunlight will paint the scene, bringing out textures and casting shadows.</p><p> By familiarizing yourself with the location, you&#39;ll approach the golden hour with confidence and be better equipped to capture truly remarkable images.</p><h2 data-section id="consider-waking-up-for-the-sunrise"> 5. Consider waking up for the sunrise</h2><p> While many photographers head out around sunset, there are significant benefits to setting your alarm and venturing out to witness the magical moments of sunrise. It&#39;s a time when the world is very tranquil and the soft light of dawn casts a delicate glow upon the landscape.</p><p> One of the greatest advantages of <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/8-simple-guidelines-capturing-spectacular-sunrise-sunset-images/" target="_blank" aria-label="shooting at sunrise (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shooting at sunrise</a> is the solitude it offers. As the rest of the world sleeps, you&#39;ll find yourself immersed in a serene setting, free from the distractions of crowds and bustling activity. This sense of solitude not only enhances your creative focus but also allows you to capture scenes without worrying about people accidentally stepping into your frame.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253736" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-9.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Golden-hour landscape photography tips" class="wp-image-253736" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-9.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-9.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-9.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-9.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-9.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-9.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> In addition to the peaceful ambiance, the morning hours often bring less wind compared to the rest of the day. This means you have a better chance of capturing pristine reflections in bodies of water, adding an extra layer of beauty and tranquility to your <a aria-label="landscape compositions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/4-rules-of-composition-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">landscape compositions</a> .</p><p> Plus, there is something truly magical about witnessing the sunrise itself. It&#39;s a remarkable experience that can connect you with the beauty and rhythm of the natural world – so don&#39;t be afraid to get up a bit earlier and embrace the unique rewards of shooting at sunrise!</p><h2 data-section id="use-the-right-aperture-and-shutter-speed"> 6. Use the right aperture and shutter speed</h2><p> Setting the appropriate aperture and shutter speed is essential to achieve stunning golden-hour landscape shots. Here&#39;s what I recommend:</p><p> To keep the entire scene sharp, opt for a narrow aperture. Generally, f/8 works well when your composition doesn&#39;t involve elements very close to the camera. However, if there are prominent foreground elements, consider using an aperture of f/11 or beyond. But be cautious not to exceed f/16; otherwise, you might end up with blur due to diffraction.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253737" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:56.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="844" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-11.jpg?resize=1500%2C844&#038;ssl=1" alt="Golden-hour landscape photography tips" class="wp-image-253737" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-11.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-11.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-11.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-11.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-11.jpg?resize=717%2C403&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> When it comes to shutter speed, a longer exposure is often necessary during the golden hour due to the diminishing light. If you have a tripod, you can use longer shutter speeds without worrying about camera shake. In <a aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> , you can set the shutter speed with the help of the exposure bar in the camera viewfinder. Alternatively, if you use <a aria-label="Aperture Priority mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-versus-shutter-priority-which-shooting-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Aperture Priority mode</a> , the camera will automatically select a suitable shutter speed for a well-exposed image.</p><p> Pro tip: Don&#39;t shy away from experimenting with ultra-long shutter speeds to capture the mesmerizing movement of water or clouds. By narrowing your aperture to around f/16 and maintaining an ISO of 100, you can achieve relatively slow shutter speeds during sunrise and sunset.</p><p> Finally, if you desire even <em>longer</em> shutter speeds or find yourself shooting when the sun is slightly higher in the sky, a <a aria-label="neutral density filter (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/neutral-density-filters-landscape-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">neutral density filter</a> can be a game-changer. It&#39;ll reduce the influx of light, preventing overexposure and allowing for extended exposure times.</p><h2 data-section id="use-gnd-filters-or-hdr-techniques"> 7. Use GND filters or HDR techniques</h2><p> During the golden hours, you&#39;ll often encounter scenes with significant variations in brightness. This combination of dark shadows and bright skies can pose a challenge for your camera&#39;s sensor, making it difficult to capture all the details in a single shot. Fortunately, there are two techniques you can employ to overcome this hurdle.</p><p> One option is to use <a aria-label="graduated neutral density (GND) filters (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/using-graduated-neutral-density-filters-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">graduated neutral density (GND) filters</a> . They&#39;re specifically designed to balance the exposure between the sky and the foreground. By placing the darker portion of the filter over the sky, you can reduce the brightness levels while keeping the foreground properly exposed. GND filters are highly effective, although they can be a bit cumbersome to set up and require careful positioning.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253738" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Golden-hour landscape photography tips" class="wp-image-253738" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Alternatively, you can try <a aria-label="high dynamic range (HDR) techniques (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/getting-real-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">high dynamic range (HDR) techniques</a> . With this approach, you capture a series of shots at different exposure levels, typically bracketing to capture details in the highlights, midtones, and shadows. Later, you merge these shots using post-processing software like Lightroom Classic, allowing you to blend the properly exposed areas from each image into one final photograph. HDR can be a viable option and has fast become a favorite among professionals.</p><p> GND filters provide an in-camera solution while HDR techniques offer a post-processing solution. Both methods have their merits, so it&#39;s worth researching to find the one that suits your style and preferences.</p><p> Remember, the goal is to achieve a balanced exposure where both the sky and the foreground retain their details. By using GND filters or HDR shooting, you can overcome the limitations of your camera&#39;s dynamic range and capture the full beauty of the golden-hour landscapes. So whether you prefer the hands-on approach of filters or the post-processing finesse of HDR, these techniques will both be valuable tools in your photographic arsenal.</p><h2 data-section id="try-some-landscape-silhouettes"> 8. Try some landscape silhouettes</h2><p> As I explained in the previous section, landscape photography often revolves around capturing intricate details in both the foreground and the sky. While these images are undeniably stunning, certain scenes are difficult to photograph without filters or HDR techniques. What if you just want to enjoy some straightforward photography?</p><p> That&#39;s where the magic of <a aria-label="silhouette shots (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-photograph-silhouettes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">silhouette shots</a> comes in.

Frame your shot, ensuring that the landscape elements you want to silhouette are prominent. Now, lock in the suggested exposure for the bright sky. Manual mode is particularly suitable for this technique, but Aperture Priority can also work well.</p><p> Once you&#39;ve taken a shot, review it on your camera&#39;s LCD screen. A successful silhouette will result in a dark foreground and a detailed sky, forming a captivating contrast. If the exposure isn&#39;t ideal, don&#39;t be discouraged. Adjust the exposure compensation or the shutter speed until you achieve the desired outcome.</p><p> Silhouette photos can add a touch of mystique to your portfolio. The approach allows you to focus on the shapes and contours of the landscape – and create visually compelling images that evoke emotion and spark the viewer&#39;s imagination.</p><h2 data-section id="dont-forget-to-post-process-your-golden-hour-landscapes"> 9. Don&#39;t forget to post-process your golden-hour landscapes</h2><p> The beauty of golden-hour lighting is undeniable, but to truly unlock the full potential of your landscape shots, it&#39;s crucial to spend time <a aria-label="enhancing them through post-processing (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/editing-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">enhancing them through post-processing</a> . This is where you can take your already stunning images and elevate them to a whole new level.</p><p> One of the first steps in post-processing your golden-hour landscapes is to work with the white balance. By adjusting the temperature and tint sliders, you can achieve a more natural look or even create a deliberately cooler or warmer tone that elevates the overall mood of your image.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253732" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Golden-hour landscape photography tips" class="wp-image-253732" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/golden-hour-landscape-photography-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Next, pay attention to the details in your highlights and shadows. Golden-hour scenes often have a wide dynamic range, with deep shadows and bright skies, and this can result in a loss of detail in both areas. Happily, you can use post-processing tools to recover lost details, ensuring that the important elements of your image are well-exposed.</p><p> Color grading can also be a powerful technique to enhance the depth and drama of your golden-hour landscapes. By adjusting the color hues, you can create a unique and personalized look. Experiment with different color combinations to find the one that evokes the desired emotions and reinforces the atmosphere you&#39;re after.</p><p> Lastly, consider applying a subtle vignette to push the viewer&#39;s eye toward the main subject of your image. Be cautious not to overdo it, however; restraint is the key to maintaining a natural and balanced look.</p><p> Pro tip: When heading out for some golden-hour adventuring, I highly recommend <a aria-label="shooting in RAW (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/raw-vs-jpeg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shooting in RAW</a> . RAW files contain more data and provide greater flexibility for adjusting various aspects of your image during post-processing compared to JPEGs. This enables you to make adjustments without sacrificing image quality and recover detail as needed.</p><p> Remember, post-processing is an art form in itself, and there&#39;s no one-size-fits-all approach. Take the time to experiment, develop your own editing style, and stay true to your artistic vision.</p><h2 data-section id="keep-shooting-after-sunset"> 10.

Their mischievous grins, sparkling eyes, and genuine laughter can light up any frame. But as anyone whose ever photographed children knows, working with kids can be quite a rollercoaster ride! From dealing with their unpredictable moods to capturing those split-second moments of pure joy, child photography demands a mix of patience, creativity, and a little sprinkle of luck.</p><p> Fortunately, I&#39;ve done my fair share of child portrait sessions, and I&#39;ve developed a variety of techniques to ensure great results. So whether you&#39;re a parent eager to capture your little one&#39;s milestones or a hobbyist looking to master the art of child photography, this article is your gateway to success. We&#39;ll explore everything from choosing a location and preparing for your shoot to capturing both formal and candid shots – and by the time you&#39;ve finished reading, you&#39;ll be itching to get out with your camera!</p><h2 data-section id="choose-the-time-and-location-carefully"> 1. Choose the time and location carefully</h2><p> Timing is everything when it comes to capturing those precious moments with children. I&#39;ve learned from experience that the perfect time for a photo session is usually after a refreshing nap and a little snack. That&#39;s when the kids are at their happiest and most cooperative!</p><p> Now, let&#39;s talk about the importance of timing when it comes to lighting. Avoid shooting outdoors at midday when the sun is blazing and intense. That harsh light will cast unflattering shadows, and your photos will look intense and contrasty. Instead, aim to shoot during the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-photograph-golden-hour/" target="_blank" aria-label="golden hour (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">golden hour</a> , that magical time when the sun is low on the horizon and casting a warm, soft glow. And if you <em>do</em> find yourself stuck <a aria-label="shooting during high noon (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/3-tips-photographing-kids-harsh-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shooting during high noon</a> , seek out some shady spots to even out the light and consider <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-ways-of-using-reflector-to-take-better-portraits/" target="_blank" aria-label="using a reflector (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">using a reflector</a> .</p><p> It&#39;s also crucial to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-choose-a-great-portrait-photography-location/" target="_blank" aria-label="select the right location (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">select the right location</a> . Working outdoors is fantastic as it provides ample space for kids to move around freely. Plus, you get to take advantage of beautiful natural backdrops in parks and forests, where leaves and flowers add an extra touch of charm.</p><p> On the other hand, don&#39;t fret if you have to work indoors due to specific setting requirements or weather conditions. Just make sure you have enough room to accommodate the little ones&#39; boundless energy and to experiment with different lenses. You don&#39;t want to be stuck in a tiny space – it&#39;ll cramp your style and limit your creative possibilities. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/kids-chairs-water-summer.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Child photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This family found some lovely outdoor locations, and we chose to do the session in the evening to ensure we had plenty of soft light.

Be prepared (but be ready to improvise)</h2><p> Both you and the kids want the photo session to go smoothly and quickly. Children aren&#39;t exactly famous for their patience, after all! If you spend too much time fumbling around with your camera or checking out different backdrops, they&#39;ll get bored, fidgety, and lose interest faster than you can say “cheese.”</p><p> That&#39;s why <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/preparing-for-a-client-photoshoot/" target="_blank" aria-label="being prepared is key (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">being prepared is key</a> . Before you get started, have your camera ready with a fully charged battery. Make sure you have multiple memory cards and your basic settings dialed in. Get all your gear in order so you can focus on what matters most: capturing those heart-melting smiles and playful giggles.</p><p> Oh, and don&#39;t forget about <a aria-label="props (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/using-props-in-portraits-make-them-interesting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">props</a> ! Searching frantically for that picnic basket or chair while your subject is waiting is a recipe for disaster. So have your props ready and easily accessible. And here&#39;s a pro tip: Keep any toys hidden until they&#39;re needed so you can surprise the little ones when the time is just right (and prevent them from being distracted during the rest of the shoot!).</p><p> If you&#39;re working in a studio with different <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-types-portrait-backgrounds-creative-images/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">portrait backdrops</a> , plan ahead and decide on the order in which you&#39;ll use them. Make sure they&#39;re all set up and ready to go. And if you&#39;re photographing outside, scout for various backgrounds in advance and have a rough idea of when you&#39;ll transition between them. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/posed-girl-indoor-studio.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Posed girl indoor studio child photography tips" title="posed girl indoor studio.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Of course, we all know that kids and plans don&#39;t always mix. So don&#39;t sweat it if your meticulously organized session goes off the rails. That&#39;s when you need to embrace the unexpected and go with the flow, improvising as needed to capture those authentic and magical moments.</p><h2 data-section id="make-a-list"> 3. Make a list</h2><p> In the previous section, we covered the planning essentials, like prepping your gear and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-tips-location-scouting-before-photo-session/" target="_blank" aria-label="scouting locations (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">scouting locations</a> . Now let&#39;s take it a step further and talk about creating a game plan for capturing those picture-perfect moments.</p><p> First things first, jot down a list of shots you&#39;d like to nail. You can include some posed pictures, but don&#39;t forget to mix it up with <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/six-ways-to-take-a-candid-portrait-of-somebody-you-know/" target="_blank" aria-label="candid portraits (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">candid portraits</a> that truly capture the essence of your little subject. Let them be themselves, because let&#39;s face it, those Pinterest-perfect poses might not work out – and that&#39;s totally okay!</p><p> Think about various activities they can engage in, like sitting, standing, playing, or even running wild with unbridled joy. Look for inspiration and themes, but remember, it&#39;s all about capturing their unique personality. Plan ahead by considering some fun activities you can try, and be ready with some backup options like snacks or a phone for entertainment. Just make sure you&#39;ve got the parent&#39;s approval if you&#39;re working with someone else&#39;s kiddos.</p><p> Once again, it&#39;s essential to stay flexible with your list and be ready to toss it aside if needed. Sometimes the best moments happen spontaneously, and you don&#39;t want to miss out on those gems by being too rigid with your plans! </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/list.jpg?ssl=1" alt="child photography tips shot list" title="list.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 data-section id="get-reinforcements"> 4. Get reinforcements</h2><p> Kids are like little balls of energy, and they don&#39;t always play nice with the camera. So if you can swing it, call in some backup! Whether you&#39;re photographing your own kiddos or working with a client, having an extra set of hands can be a game-changer.</p><p> Your trusty sidekick should stand right behind you, not off to the side. The goal? To catch those captivating moments when the child&#39;s eyes lock onto your lens. For the littlest ones, you can have your helper plonk them on a chair and swiftly step away while you stand at the ready with your finger on the shutter button.</p><p> When choosing your accomplice, pick someone who knows how to coax out those smiles and giggles. They&#39;ll help you keep your cool when photographing your own munchkins, and they&#39;ll also ensure everything goes far more smoothly. Older siblings are great for this, and parents can do a good job, too.</p><h2 data-section id="start-with-the-posed-shots"> 5. Start with the posed shots</h2><p> Not every child photography session requires rigidly <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/posing-guide-21-sample-poses-to-get-you-started-with-photographing-children/" target="_blank" aria-label="posed shots (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">posed shots</a> (candid images can turn out fantastic, too!). However, if you do decide to go for posed photos, it&#39;s best to start with the most posed and formal ones. For instance, that sibling shot where you want everyone all looking directly at the camera with big smiles. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sisters-posed.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Sisters posed child photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Posed shots like this are best taken at the beginning of the session, not at the end!</figcaption></figure></div><p> At the beginning of the session, your little subjects are usually more patient and cooperative. Toward the end, they can become a bit restless and fidgety, making it harder to get them to sit still for more than a second or two.</p><p> Honestly, even if you begin with the posed shots, there&#39;s no guarantee that you&#39;ll get what you&#39;re after, but at least you&#39;ll have a chance!</p><h2 data-section id="limit-movement"> 6. Limit movement</h2><p> Kids have a knack for exploring areas that are conveniently out of reach for your camera lens. So if you&#39;re struggling to keep them in one place, consider reining in their movement using a prop like a chair, stool, couch, basket, swing, or whatever else sparks their curiosity.</p><p> Here&#39;s a nifty trick: Hide a fun chair until the perfect moment. Then stick it in the spot where you want the child to be and see if their little radar leads them straight to it. You might strike gold and rejoice as they naturally gravitate toward it. Keep in mind that they may not want to sit on the chair at all, but no worries! You can adapt and let them stand while holding onto it or even have them sit on the ground nearby. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/boy-chair.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Boy chair child photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Near the beginning of the session is a great time to limit movement using props, chairs, etc. After a while, they&#39;ll want to run around instead of sitting. This little guy wasn&#39;t feeling conventional, but that&#39;s okay – just go with the flow!</figcaption></figure></div><p> Flexibility is key here – don&#39;t force it. It&#39;s better to struggle a bit with capturing your subject from a distance than to end up with a close-up shot featuring a red, blotchy, crying face. And if you feel your subject isn&#39;t quite ready, you can always come back to the prop later. If not, simply let it go. You might have a ton of ideas, but in the end, you&#39;ll only use a select few.</p><h2 data-section id="let-them-play"> 7. Let them play</h2><p> Once you&#39;ve captured a few formal shots (or at least pictures where the kids are sitting or standing in place), it&#39;s time to take a step back and let them play! While you can offer some guidance, avoid excessive posing or trying to make them sit still. Trust me, if you push too hard, you&#39;ll find yourself in a battle you won&#39;t win. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/feeding-cows-boy.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Feeding cows boy child photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> We were nearing the end of this session and sitting still wasn&#39;t an option anymore! This little guy loved feeding the cows, so over to the cows we went. It was also a way of telling the story of who he is and what he loves. Sometimes the most cherished pictures don&#39;t have a smile or even eyes facing the camera.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Why not center the rest of your session around an activity that the kids enjoy or introduce them to something new that might ignite their excitement? Take them in the yard with a sprinkler, hit the park with slides, or embark on a beach adventure to collect seashells. How about an outdoor tea party or flying a kite? Get them jumping on a trampoline or set up a bucket full of soapy water on the grass. The possibilities are endless!</p><p> Oh, and here&#39;s a little secret: Music can work wonders. Consider throwing a fun dance party to get those big smiles and laughs. And if you&#39;ve been shooting indoors, taking the session outside is a fantastic idea. Kids love having space to roam and explore, and a large outdoor area opens up a world of creative possibilities.</p><h2 data-section id="do-your-best-to-relax"> 8. Do your best to relax</h2><p> Photographing children can be a bit overwhelming at times, I understand. However, it is crucial that you take a moment to breathe deeply and find a sense of calm.</p><p> Here&#39;s the deal: Kids have this uncanny ability to pick up on your stress vibes, and it often results in them doing the exact opposite of what you&#39;re aiming for. So do what you can to let go of those nerves.</p><p> And if you&#39;re feeling jittery before your first client shoot, why not practice with your own kiddos or a friend&#39;s? It&#39;s a great way to ease those pre-shoot jitters. And let me share a secret stress reliever: Plan like there&#39;s no tomorrow. Run scenarios in your mind, create detailed shot lists, scout different locations, and even practice adjusting your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-camera-settings-portrait-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="camera settings (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">camera settings</a> . This preparation will boost your confidence, even if you end up tossing your plans out the window during the actual shoot.</p><h2 data-section id="child-photography-tips-final-words"> Child photography tips: final words</h2><p> And that&#39;s a wrap! We&#39;ve reached the end of our wild and wonderful journey through the captivating realm of child photography. Armed with these eight tips, you&#39;re now equipped to freeze those precious moments in time forever. So get ready to embark on countless fun photoshoots with your camera in hand!</p><p> As you venture into the world of child photography, remember to embrace the beauty of imperfection and let go of expectations. Start with poses, limit movement if needed, but above all, let them play and be their authentic selves. And most importantly, relax! The magic happens when you&#39;re in the moment, connecting with your subjects and capturing their world.</p><p> So embrace the unpredictable, cherish the fleeting moments, and have fun.

The roaring crowd, the pulsating beats, and those magical moments on stage that make your heart skip a beat – it&#39;s a photographer&#39;s paradise!</p><p> But let&#39;s face it: Capturing the energy and essence of a concert isn&#39;t so easy. From low-light conditions to fast-paced action, every gig presents its own unique challenges, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s essential to arm yourself with the right knowledge and techniques.</p><p> In this article, we&#39;ll delve into the nitty-gritty of photographing concerts and unlock plenty of secrets to capture those mind-blowing moments. I&#39;ll share the best gear and camera settings, explain how to anticipate the action, and reveal ways to navigate the chaotic dance of light and shadow. So grab some memory cards, make sure your camera batteries are charged, and get ready to rock the concert photography world!</p><h2 data-section id="use-a-fast-lens-and-shoot-wide-open"> 1. Use a fast lens and shoot wide open</h2><p> Using a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/what-is-a-fast-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="fast lens (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">fast lens</a> (ie, a lens with a wide maximum <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> ) is crucial when it comes to concert photography. Most concerts take place in the evening or indoors with low lighting conditions, which means you need to allow as much light as possible through the lens to ensure a detailed exposure. Additionally, since performers are constantly moving on stage, you&#39;ll want to use faster <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speeds (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speeds</a> to freeze their motion – and boosting the shutter speed without also widening the aperture will result in subpar results.</p><p> Good fast lenses include the 50mm f/1.8, 135mm f/1.8, and the 24-70mm f/2.8. These models are all offered by a variety of major camera manufacturers, and they do a great job of letting plenty of light into your camera.</p><p> Note that it&#39;s not enough to simply <em>use</em> a fast lens. You need to make sure you dial in the lens&#39;s widest aperture; that way, you can effectively capture sharp, well-exposed shots, assuming you also adjust your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> (more on that in a later section!). </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tips-to-capture-concert-photos-5.jpg?ssl=1" alt="concert photography tips" title="Tips-to-capture-concert-photos-5.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> By the way, using a fast lens at its widest aperture can also create a beautiful <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-get-shallow-depth-of-field-in-your-digital-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="shallow depth of field effect (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shallow depth of field effect</a> . This means that your main subject will be in sharp focus while the background fades into a soft blur, and it&#39;s a fantastic way to make your subject stand out and add a touch of artistic flair to your shots.</p><h2 data-section id="shoot-in-aperture-priority-mode"> 2. Shoot in Aperture Priority mode</h2><p> Many beginners rely on Auto mode, but it often results in blurry or grainy photos without any control over camera settings. That&#39;s why I encourage you to choose <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-versus-shutter-priority-which-shooting-mode/" target="_blank" aria-label="Aperture Priority mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Aperture Priority mode</a> instead.</p><p> In Aperture Priority, you set the aperture you want while the camera automatically adjusts the shutter speed to match the changing lighting conditions. (Wondering about the ideal aperture? As mentioned earlier, go as wide as possible, like f/2.8 or even f/1.8, for sharp, well-exposed shots with stunning <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" aria-label="background bokeh (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">background bokeh</a> .) </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tips-to-capture-concert-photos-7.jpg?ssl=1" alt="concert photography tips" title="Tips-to-capture-concert-photos-7.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> While some photographers advocate for <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> , I personally prefer Aperture Priority. By letting the camera handle the exposure, you can focus your mind on the artists, the crowd, and the overall atmosphere. It frees you up to capture those spontaneous and creative shots without getting bogged down in technical details.</p><h2 data-section id="crank-up-the-iso"> 3. Crank up the ISO </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tips-to-capture-concert-photos-1.jpg?ssl=1" alt="concert photography tips" title="Tips-to-capture-concert-photos-1.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Concerts often unfold in dimly lit environments, and using a tripod just isn&#39;t an option for a whole host of reasons. So what can you do to ensure your shots come out sharp and well-exposed? Boost the one setting that gives you control in these challenging conditions: ISO.</p><p> Now, here&#39;s the deal with cranking up the ISO: It does introduce a bit of noise into your images. But in my experience, it&#39;s a tradeoff you have to make to capture those epic concert moments. Even if you have a fast lens with an ultra-wide aperture, it can only get you so far. That&#39;s why you need to rely on a higher ISO to push you the rest of the way.</p><p> Keep in mind that different cameras produce varying levels of noise based on their sensor quality. If you have the means, consider investing in a model with solid high-ISO capabilities. Then, before you head to your first concert photography gig, take a series of test shots at different ISO values. Pay attention to the point where the noise becomes too much for your liking. Remember that value and strive to stay below it whenever possible.</p><p> That said, a bit of noise can actually add a creative touch to your shots, especially if you&#39;re open to converting them to black and white. A monochrome image with noise can give off a cool film-grain feel, adding character to your work.</p><p> And if you happen to end up with a memory card full of ultra-noisy shots, don&#39;t fret too much; in post-processing, you can <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-do-noise-reduction-in-lightroom/" target="_blank" aria-label="apply noise reduction (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">apply noise reduction</a> to improve the image quality. However, keep in mind that noise-reduction algorithms do have their limitations, so it&#39;s best to get things right in the field as much as possible.</p><h2 data-section id="avoid-using-your-flash"> 4. Avoid using your flash </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tips-to-capture-concert-photos-2.jpg?ssl=1" alt="concert photography tips" title="Tips-to-capture-concert-photos-2.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> When you&#39;re shooting at a concert, resist the temptation to whip out that flash. Imagine you&#39;re on stage, pouring your heart out, and suddenly you&#39;re blinded by a burst of light. Annoying, right? That&#39;s how performers feel, and you do <em>not</em> want to get on their bad side.</p><p> But it&#39;s not just about the artists. Part of concert photography is capturing the audience, too. You don&#39;t want to be that photographer who distracts everyone from the incredible show, so save your flash for another occasion.</p><p> And here&#39;s the thing: Even if you could use your flash, it wouldn&#39;t make much of a difference. The stage is usually too far away for the light to reach the subject. So why bother? Instead, focus on mastering the art of working with available light. Embrace the challenge of capturing the dimly lit atmosphere and the dynamic play of shadows. It&#39;ll result in much better photos!</p><h2 data-section id="move-around-constantly"> 5. Move around constantly</h2><p> When it comes to concert photography, staying glued to one spot and snapping the same shot repeatedly just won&#39;t cut it. As a photographer, it&#39;s essential to keep on the move, flowing with the artists and following the ever-changing lighting dynamics. This way, you&#39;ll be able to capture those electrifying moments that truly stand out. Of course, remember to respect any venue or artist restrictions regarding movement. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tips-to-capture-concert-photos-4.jpg?ssl=1" alt="concert photography tips" title="Tips-to-capture-concert-photos-4.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> If your view gets blocked by enthusiastic fans, quickly reposition yourself. (Whatever you do, <em>don&#39;t</em> ask them to move or get in their way. After all, they&#39;ve paid to witness their favorite artists in action!) When the lead singer ventures to one side of the stage, it&#39;s your cue to hustle over there and capture the moment.</p><p> Bottom line: Moving around opens up a world of creative possibilities, allowing you to compose shots that are as diverse and vibrant as the music itself. So get your groove on, embrace the hustle, and capture the frenetic essence of the performance. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tips-to-capture-concert-photos-6.jpg?ssl=1" alt="concert photography tips" title="Tips-to-capture-concert-photos-6.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 data-section id="wait-and-anticipate"> 6. Wait and anticipate</h2><p> Concerts are a whirlwind of action, but when it comes to concert photography, patience is key. It&#39;s all about playing the waiting game to capture those decisive moments that others might miss.</p><p> Now, I&#39;m not saying you should spend your entire time waiting for a fleeting moment that may never come. No, it&#39;s about developing the skill to anticipate those golden opportunities. And the good news is that it&#39;s a skill that can be <em>honed</em> with practice and experience.</p><p> One effective way to improve your ability to predict good shots is to immerse yourself in the concert experience. Attend as many shows as you can and pay close attention. Notice patterns and recurring moments that unfold onstage. This could be a guitarist dramatically arching backward, a DJ energetically waving their arms, or a singer gripping the mic with passion. These are the moments that beg to be captured, and they tend to happen multiple times throughout a concert, giving you several opportunities to grab photos. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tips-to-capture-concert-photos-3.jpg?ssl=1" alt="concert photography tips" title="Tips-to-capture-concert-photos-3.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Another strategy is to observe the artists once the performance starts. Look for their unique habits and signature moves. By familiarizing yourself with their style, you can be prepared when those picture-perfect moments occur.</p><p> If you&#39;re truly dedicated to getting stellar shots and the artist has live videos available online, take advantage of them! Watch performances beforehand to give yourself a head start.</p><p> Remember, mastering the art of waiting and anticipating will elevate your concert photography game and ensure you don&#39;t miss a beat when it comes to capturing those stunning images.</p><h2 data-section id="concert-photography-tips-final-words"> Concert photography tips: final words</h2><p> And that wraps up our epic journey through the wild world of concert photography!
