（换句话说，你不想从下面向上射击或从上面向下射击。你想要尽可能直接、正前方的角度。）</p><p>并检查太阳的位置，因为你<em>不</em>应该向它拍摄。首选来自您身后或您所在位置左侧或右侧的光线。</p><p>此外，鸟类通常会在风中起飞和降落，因此了解风向将有助于您预测所拍摄鸟类的飞行路径。</p><p>在飞行地点找到最好的鸟需要<em>大量</em>的试验和错误。你去的许多地点都是无用的——但这是值得的，因为偶尔你会发现一个可以一次又一次返回的区域。侦察足够多的地点，您最终会得到这些热点的详细列表！

但作为初学者，在昏暗的光线下拍摄会拍出惨淡的照片。）</p><p>那么在飞行摄影中什么才是鸟类的最佳光线呢？</p><p>早晨和傍晚的金色光芒，通常被称为<em><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-photograph-golden-hour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">黄金时段</a></em>，由于其绚丽、柔和的效果，是完美的。确实，只要你在日出后的两个小时和日落前的两个小时内拍摄，光线就会看起来很棒（不过请记住，你需要仔细选择你的位置；你希望从正面照亮鸟儿，而不是从侧面照亮）。后退！）。</p><p>另外，因为您拍摄的是空中的鸟类，所以即使您在黄金时间之前或之后拍摄，您仍然会在拍摄对象上获得良好的照明（只需确保光线不会变得太刺眼！）。</p><h2

target="_blank" aria-label="frame-filling images (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">充满画面的图像</a>，则需要尽可能让自己隐形。</p><p>首先避免穿颜色鲜艳的衣服。当您接近鸟类热点时，您也可以保持离地面较低的位置，或使用自然掩护物（例如树木）。当你变得更认真时，你可能会考虑穿迷彩服，使用百叶窗，甚至从车窗拍摄（鸟类往往不太受汽车打扰，所以你经常可以开车靠近通常会飞走的鸟类）。</p><p>一旦找到一个好地方，就保持相对静止。不要做任何突然的动作。相反，在设置相机时保持一切缓慢而稳定，然后如果可以的话坐下（我建议保持低调）。</p><h2

性能（因此您可以在低光照条件下提高相机的<a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> ，而不必担心噪点）</li><li>良好的自动对焦性能（因此您可以跟踪在空中编织和俯冲的拍摄对象）</li></ul><p>通常，您在开始时需要做出妥协，但请尝试尽可能多地检查上述框。</p><p>您还需要获得最好的镜头，它通常具有以下四个功能：</p><ul><li>长焦距（至少300mm，500mm或600mm更好）</li><li>宽大的最大<a

（这就是你在海滩上花了几个小时观察鸟类后学到的东西！） </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="capture-some-take-off-and-landing-shots"> 6. 拍摄一些起飞和着陆镜头</h2><p>飞行中的鸟类摄影并不总是关于鸟类在天空中翱翔的画面。您也可以通过为美丽的起飞和着陆时刻做好准备来拍摄一些令人惊叹的照片。</p><p>这里的关键是了解鸟类的行为方式。例如，大多数鸟类在起飞前经常排便以减轻负载。这是获得精彩起飞镜头的非常重要的线索。当然，这还取决于您的位置和光线方向，以充分利用这种情况。</p><p>风向对于获得更好的起飞和着陆镜头起着重要作用，因为在这些场景中鸟类经常逆风飞行。因此，明智的做法是让自己的视线远离风的主要方向。这样，鸟儿就会面向您降落和起飞。

data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>要在飞行摄影中确定鸟类的正确相机设置，您需要平衡您的艺术需求（例如景深和清晰度）与曝光需求。它可能会变得有点复杂，特别是因为为飞行中的鸟类选择设置<em>不同于</em><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/bird-photography-camera-setting/" target="_blank" aria-label="settings for photographing birds more generally (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">为更一般的拍摄鸟类选择设置</a>。</p><p>不过，我确实有一些建议可以极大地简化流程。</p><p>首先，使用<a aria-label="Aperture Priority mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">光圈优先模式</a>；这样，您就可以随时控制光圈和 ISO（通过提高 ISO 或扩大光圈，您可以提高<a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">快门速度</a>）。</p><p>其次，将光圈设置为 f/8 左右。这是你的镜头最清晰的地方，而且它会给你足够的景深来获得翼尖到翼尖的清晰度。</p><p>第三，将ISO设置为最低值，通常在ISO 100左右。这里的目标是避免提高ISO，这会产生<em>噪音</em>。也就是说，在弱光条件下拍摄时，您需要提高 ISO 来提高快门速度。</p><p>现在，对于飞行中的鸟类摄影来说，快门速度可能是最重要的设置，因为如果速度太慢，鸟的翅膀就会模糊，这样看起来很少会很好。一般来说，我建议使用至少 1/1000 秒的快门速度，1/2000 秒及以上更好。 （不过，你的最低快门速度会根据鸟的速度而改变；飞行中的大型鸟类，如苍鹭和鹅，速度很慢，而飞行中的小型鸟类，如鹪鹩，则在天空中飞翔。）</p><p>无论如何，拨入光圈和 ISO，然后查看快门速度，相机将纯粹根据曝光考虑来选择快门速度。问问自己：这个快门速度足够快吗？如果是这样，那么你就很出色了，但如果不是，你需要提高 ISO 或扩大光圈，以便你的相机有足够的光线来提高快门速度。</p><p>我建议在调整光圈之前提高 ISO。但是，如果您的 ISO 逐渐进入嘈杂区域，那么扩大光圈可能是有意义的，而不是冒着图像噪音过大的风险。</p><p>拨入所有设置后，我建议您进行快速测试。拍摄一些附近鸟类的照片（它们不需要很好地构图 - 目标是确保快门速度足够快并且光圈足够窄）。放大相机液晶显示屏，确保一切看起来都很好，然后享受拍摄飞行中的鸟类的乐趣！ </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"

data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>鸟类速度很快，这意味着您需要付出一些认真的努力才能获得始终如一的锐利镜头。</p><p>首先，您需要将相机设置为连续<a aria-label="focusing mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/choosing-a-focus-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">对焦模式</a>。这样，每当您半按快门按钮时，焦点就会接合，然后随着拍摄对象的移动而<em>重新对焦</em>。 （尼康和许多其他制造商将这种模式称为“AF-C”，而佳能将其称为“AI Servo”。）</p><p>您应该将相机设置为最快<a aria-label="burst mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/burst-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">连拍模式</a>，也称为连拍模式。当鸟儿飞过时，您可以快速连续地捕捉一系列图像。</p><p>接下来，您需要启用相机的跟踪 AF 区域模式。它会告诉你的相机在画面中跟踪这只鸟，即使它左右、上下飞行等。具体细节将取决于你的相机，但某种形式的“跟踪”应该可以解决问题。另外，如果您的相机提供此功能，请尝试激活动物眼自动对焦，它将通过画面专门识别和跟踪鸟类的眼睛。</p><p>然后，一旦设置好相机，当鸟儿 a) 栖息并即将起飞，或 b) 飞向远处时，就开始对焦它。半按快门按钮，并在鸟起飞和/或靠近时继续跟踪它。一旦鸟儿飞入主要区域，完全按下快门按钮，连拍几张照片，然后——祈祷吧！ – 你会得到一个好的结果。</p><p>一些额外的提示：</p><p>当鸟儿飞过时，即使停止射击，也要继续平移。与突然停止相比，这种连续运动将使您的最后一张图像更好地保持焦点。</p><p>此外，当鸟儿飞过时平移时，您需要将平移速度与鸟儿的速度相匹配。即使您被迫降低快门速度，完美的摇摄也能让鸟儿保持清晰，而背景则变得模糊。</p><p>目标是保持鸟眼的焦点和锐利；这是关键。如果您手持设置，请尝试将左手放在镜头镜筒下方，并将肘部靠近身体，因为这将帮助您尽可能稳定地操纵相机。如果您站立，请将双腿分开，以形成坚固的基础。</p><p>最后，如果您打算暂时固定您的位置和位置，我建议您使用三脚架。这将有助于保持相机稳定，特别是当您使用非常重的镜头时。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="wait-for-contrasting-backgrounds"> 9.等待对比背景</h2><p>在之前关于飞行摄影中鸟类的技巧中，我讨论了正确对焦的重要性。但我想分享另一件对我自己的摄影来说非常宝贵的物品：</p><p>寻找对比鲜明的背景。</p><p>假设您正在跟踪小鸟以锁定焦点，但您的镜头正在寻找焦点。请记住，对焦系统需要拍摄对象和背景之间有足够好的对比度才能确定拍摄对象 - 当鸟儿在蓝天等干净的背景上飞行时，自动对焦系统通常很容易锁定焦点。</p><p>因此，不要左右射击，而是等到鸟飞过对比鲜明的背景，或者重新定位自己，以便下次鸟飞过时，背景会更加对比鲜明。</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span

href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">三分法则</a>，它告诉您将鸟（或鸟眼）定位在画面的三分之一处，而不是死点。</p><p>我还建议使用<a aria-label="rule of space (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-space-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">空间规则</a>，它要求您在鸟的前面放置比其后面更多的空间（一个好的指导原则是在鸟的前面至少留出两到三倍的空间，这将有助于无论如何，你遵循三分法则！）。</p><p>此外，虽然大多数飞行中的鸟类照片只包含一只鸟，但请寻找可以同时捕捉两只或三只鸟的场合，以获得独特的效果。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="adjust-your-point-of-view"> 12.调整你的观点</h2><p>通常，鸟类飞行照片好坏的区别在于视角。这只鸟是从下面捕获的吗？脑袋上？与眼睛齐平吗？每次改变视角，效果都会不同。</p><p>例如，拍摄一只在头顶上方飞行的鸟与拍摄一只飞过的鸟会产生不同的效果。一张飞向你的鸟的照片比一张飞离你的鸟的照片产生的影响更大。用眼睛水平拍摄一只飞翔的鸟会产生亲密的效果。</p><p>因此，在拍摄时，不要满足于单一视角。改变一下吧！</p><div

步：询问任何相关问题</h3><p>如果您走进相机店并亲自检查您想要购买的装备（请参阅下一步），则可能没有必要。但如果您在网上购买，您通常会使用有限的商品描述，如果您不小心，您最终可能会购买到不符合您期望的相机或镜头。</p><p>这就是为什么仔细阅读装备描述并提出具体问题以收集任何缺失的信息非常重要。有些卖家根本不知道某些相关的花絮，需要一些提示才能获得所需的信息。别人会刻意隐瞒相关信息，购买前一定要查明真相。</p><p>你可能会想：如果卖家不透露相关信息，我就直接退货吧？</p><p>不幸的是，事情没那么简单。根据退货政策，您可能只能退回与描述不符的商品。如果描述非常模糊，您可能很难获得免费退货 - 而如果您提出具体问题，您的情况就会容易得多！</p><p>因此，请确保您提交了大量相关问题。购买二手相机时，请询问：</p><ul><li>相机有多少个<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/finding-your-cameras-current-shutter-actuations/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter actuations (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">快门按钮</a>？</li><li>传感器是否有明显的污垢或灰尘点？</li></ul><p>购买二手镜头时，请询问：</p><ul><li>镜片是否有真菌或雾霾？</li><li>镜头的前部或后部元件是否有划痕？</li><li>镜头是否有大块灰尘？</li><li>镜头自动对焦效果好吗？</li><li>镜头自动对焦机构是否有沙子？</li></ul><p>其中一些问题可能看起来很奇怪，但您会对相机或镜头中出现的情况感到惊讶。安全总比后悔好！</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="step-inspect-the-gear"> 第三步：检查齿轮</h3><p>如果您打算亲自购买装备，通常可以在同意购买设备之前进行检查。但如果您在线购买装备，则需要在收到时进行彻底检查。毕竟，您不想使用镜头一个月后才发现某个功能不起作用！</p><p>此检查应根据您购买的商品而有所不同。 </p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section

id="shutter-count">快门数</h3><p>相机的快门次数就是快门在其使用寿命内被触发的次数。</p><p> （快门计数也称为<em>快门启动</em>次数。）</p><p>一般来说，快门计数可以很好地表明相机的使用量，类似于检查汽车的行驶里程。相机根据快门耐用性进行评级，发烧友型号的额定拍摄次数通常约为 150,000 张，专业型号的额定拍摄次数为 300,000 张或更高。</p><p>浏览时，快门次数低通常表示使用次数较少的项目。 2-5年相机的拍摄次数少于10,000张是非常低的，正常数量在30,000-50,000张左右。</p><p>如果相机的计数非常高，达到 100,000 或更多，那么最好避免使用它，特别是因为这个数字还可以让您稍微了解所有者对相机的使用情况。较高计数的相机可能用于专业用途（以及更艰苦的生活），而较低计数则表明休闲消费者使用。</p><p>那么如何知道相机的快门次数呢？</p><p>二手相机出售时通常会提供该编号。但如果您不确定，可以根据型号通过多种方式找到答案。查看这篇文章以获取指导： <a

rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">孔径</a>，当涉及弱光照相时，挑选光圈很容易：</p><p>将其设置为最宽的可用选项（即，最小的f-number，通常为f/4，f/2.8，甚至更宽）。</p><p>这将使最轻微（反过来允许您保持快门速度快速和ISO降低）。但是，不利的一面是，您将获得非常<a

8.做很多实验</h2><p>当您试图在弱光中捕获快节奏的动作时，很容易犯错，弄乱，最终得到模糊或构成不佳或稍后稍后的图像。处理此问题的关键？实验。</p><p>您的前几次镜头可能有些偏离。也许您选择了太慢的快门速度，导致模糊。也许您的AF模式不太正确，导致了重点问题。这是完全正常的。诀窍是继续尝试不同的设置。以快门速度玩耍。调整您的ISO。更改您的焦点模式。</p><p>而且不要害怕拍摄大量照片。当场对它们进行检查。看看什么有效，什么无效。这种动手学习是无价的。您将开始了解哪些设置在要处理的特定照明中最有效。在不知不觉中，您将轻松捕捉那些动态，敏锐的动作镜头。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="zoom-in"> 9.放大</h2><p>这是一个快速的提示，但一个重要的提示：</p><p>如果您想创建有影响力的动作镜头，那么重要的是要缩小镜头（或物理移动），直到对象填充框架为止。</p><p>换句话说，不要留下很多背景。您的主题是构图中最重要的部分，因此他们应该统治。您不想留出重大干扰的空间。</p><p> （一个例外是您要创建环境，场景设定的镜头；在这些情况下，它可以帮助缩小以捕获整个区域。）</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="wait-for-peak-action"> 10.等待高峰动作</h2><div class="wp-block-image

class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-is-shutter-speed"> 什么是快门速度？</h2><p>快门速度是相机拍照时相机快门打开的时间长度。</p><p>您按下快门按钮，快门打开预定时间段（即快门速度），然后关闭快门，图像已完成。</p><p>当快门打开时，光线照射到相机传感器；因此，快门速度越长，传感器接收到的光线就越多。如下一部分所讨论的那样，这具有各种效果。</p><p>请注意，快门速度以秒为单位（或一秒钟的分数）测量。以下是一些常见的快门速度：</p><ul><li> 10秒</li><li>1秒</li><li>1/10秒</li><li>1/30秒</li><li>1/60秒</li><li>1/125秒</li><li>1/250秒</li><li>1/500秒</li><li>1/1000秒</li><li>1/1600秒</li><li>1/2000秒</li></ul><p>该列表以 10 秒的长快门速度开始，但快门速度越来越短，最后以闪电般的 1/2000 秒快门速度结束。</p><p>请注意，上面列出的快门速度测量肯定并不全面。 Most DSLRs and mirrorless cameras let you select from 30-second shutter speeds all the way down to 1/4000s or 1/8000s, though you may also have access to a special mode – called Bulb mode – that lets you keep the shutter button open for your desired length of time.</p><p>因此，虽然大多数相机提供几十种基本快门速度选项（快门速度<em>预设</em>，如果您愿意的话），但实际上您可以使用数千种可能的快门速度，所有这些都会使相机传感器暴露在略有不同的光线量下。合理？ </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-shutter-speed-affects-your-photos"> How shutter speed affects your photos</h2><p>快门速度通过两个主要方式影响您的图像：</p><ol><li> It increases and decreases <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure</a> (ie, image brightness)</li><li> It increases and decreases sharpness (ie, image detail)</li></ol><p>让我们依次看一下每一项。 </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shutter-speed-increases-and-decreases-exposure">快门速度增加并减少曝光</h3><p>快门速度越长，到达相机传感器的光线就越多，<em>图像就会变得越亮</em>。</p><p> So if you photograph a tree at 1/1000s, then you lower the shutter speed to 1s, your second image – with its slower shutter speed – will be noticeably brighter.</p><p> This has major consequences.摄影的大部分内容都是为了实现场景的适当亮度或<em>曝光</em>，通过调整快门速度，您可以获得不同的结果。因此，快门速度是相机的三个曝光变量之一（另外两个是<a aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">光圈</a>和<a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> ）。</p><p>因此，当您携带相机外出时，您需要调整快门速度以获得良好、平衡的曝光。 The specifics will depend on the scene, but watch for blown-out highlights and clipped shadows.

The depth of field is controlled by the aperture – and lengthier shutter speeds allow you to adjust the aperture without underexposing the scene.)</p><p> Plus, as I explained in a previous section, if you want artistic motion blur, you need to lengthen the shutter speed.</p><p>底线：风景摄影依靠长时间曝光而蓬勃发展。 Most landscape photographers shoot at 1s to 1/200s in bright daylight, and as the light falls, the shutter speeds slow.许多风景拍摄者在日出、日落和夜间以 1/30 秒到 30 秒（或更长）的速度进行拍摄。</p><p>如此长的快门速度只有使用三脚架才能实现。 If you <em>don&#39;t</em> have a tripod, then it&#39;s often best to drop your shutter speed as low as you can go without creating camera shake (often around 1/60s or so). </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-best-shutter-speeds-for-portrait-photography"> The best shutter speeds for portrait photography</h3><p> Portrait photographers can be pretty flexible when choosing shutter speeds. The key goal is to keep your shots sharp – by avoiding camera shake as well as motion blur – but because you can generally instruct your subject and work from a stable position, this shouldn&#39;t be too tough.</p><p> If you&#39;re shooting a stationary subject, feel free to drop your shutter speed to around 1/80s or so (though 1/200s is safer).</p><p>如果您要拍摄移动的主体，例如跳舞的人，我建议使用 1/500 秒及以上。 </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-best-shutter-speeds-for-wildlife-and-bird-photography"> The best shutter speeds for wildlife and bird photography</h3><p>鸟类和野生动物摄影通常涉及用长镜头捕捉快速移动的物体。</p><p>因此，您通常应该使用可以承受的最快快门速度。 For slower-moving animals, 1/500s is a reasonable starting point (and you <em>can</em> go lower if the animal is completely stationary – just make sure you keep your lens on a tripod or handheld as stably as possible).</p><p> For fast-moving animals and birds, 1/1000s is the place to start.当动作发生时，我强烈建议将快门速度提高到 1/2000 秒或更高。 </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-best-shutter-speeds-for-street-photography"> The best shutter speeds for street photography</h3><p>与其他摄影师相比，街头摄影师往往不太关心清晰度，因此快门速度的选择并不那么重要。</p><p>也就是说，如果您边走边拍摄和/或拍摄行走的人，1/250 秒是一个安全的起点。 If both you and your subject are stationary, then you can often shoot at 1/100s or slower (assuming you&#39;re using good handholding techniques and relatively short lenses). </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="tips-and-ideas-for-using-your-shutter-speed-creatively">创造性地使用快门速度的技巧和想法</h2><p>我之所以热衷于尝试不同的快门速度，是因为机会似乎无穷无尽。 By only using a fast shutter speed you&#39;ll limit your photography and miss out on so many great images.在我看来，快门速度是让您最具创造力并捕捉独特且视觉上有趣的图像的设置。</p><p>只需稍微改变快门速度（例如，从 1/120 秒到 1/60 秒），图像就可以看起来完全不同，并讲述一个完全不同的故事。以下是创造性地使用快门速度的一些想法和技巧： </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-fast-shutter-speed-to-freeze-motion"> 1. 使用较快的快门速度来定格动作</h3><p>In times of high action or drama, you can stop the motion by using a very fast shutter speed.</p><p>为此，您需要至少 1/250 秒的快门速度。 As with the picture below of the water droplets being flipped through the air, you may want your shutter speed to be <em>significantly</em> faster. （下面显示的图像是在 1/8000 秒拍摄的！） </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-77345 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-77345" style="width:480px"><span class="space" style="width:480px; padding-top:125%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="480" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ShutterSpeed-1-of-61.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="水" class="wp-image-77345" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ShutterSpeed-1-of-61.jpg?w=480&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ShutterSpeed-1-of-61.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ShutterSpeed-1-of-61.jpg?resize=163%2C203&amp;ssl=1 163w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ShutterSpeed-1-of-61.jpg?resize=130%2C162&amp;ssl=1 130w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">吉姆·哈梅尔摄</figcaption></figure></div><p>即使在阳光明媚的日子，使用这么快的快门速度也需要进行一些调整。 For example, you&#39;ll need to open up the aperture to its widest setting. （这会导致景深变浅，但这种效果在动作照片中通常看起来不错！）您可能还需要增加 ISO（在晴天增加一点，在阴天或室内<em>增加很多</em>）。</p><p> One more tip for this type of fast-shutter-speed photo: learn to anticipate the shot.由于大多数现代相机提供的连续拍摄速度，您可能会想按住快门按钮并快速拍摄 - 但根据我的经验，这很少奏效。 The perfect moment is usually only captured by anticipating the action and triggering the shutter at precisely the right moment. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="pan-for-a-cool-slow-motion-effect"> 2.

Full-frame models often offer superior image quality, but APS-C or Micro Four Thirds models can be great, too. If you&#39;re hiking to different locations, a more compact, mirrorless camera might be a good fit. It&#39;s lighter, and the <a aria-label="electronic viewfinder (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/electronic-viewfinders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">electronic viewfinder</a> allows you to “see” in black and white, providing a preview of the final result.</p><p> Note that most <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-camera-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="cameras that work well for standard landscape photography (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">cameras that work well for standard landscape photography</a> <em>also</em> work great for B&amp;W images, so if you already shoot landscapes in color, you probably don&#39;t need to buy another camera!</p><p> Your choice of lens is equally important. You want <a aria-label="landscape photography lenses (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lens-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">landscape photography lenses</a> that cover a range of focal lengths, such as wide-angle for sweeping scenics and telephoto for capturing tighter details. A <a aria-label="sturdy landscape tripod (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-tripods-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">sturdy landscape tripod</a> is another essential piece of equipment, especially if you&#39;re shooting long exposures or in low-light conditions where stability is key.</p><p> Finally, investing in a <a aria-label="good neutral density filter (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-nd-filters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">good neutral density filter</a> (see Tip #8!) can also come in handy. It lets you control the amount of light entering the lens, providing creative control over exposure times.</p><p> By putting together this gear, you&#39;ll be able to craft beautiful black and white landscape images with the tools that help you realize your vision. Remember, it&#39;s not about having the most expensive equipment but understanding how to use what you have to its fullest potential. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="pick-the-perfect-black-and-white-landscape-settings"> 2.

The first thing you want to do is switch your camera to <a aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> . It gives you full control over every aspect of the image.不用担心; it&#39;s easier than it sounds!</p><p> A narrow <a aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> , like f/8 or beyond, ensures that everything from the foreground to the background remains sharp. This is vital if you want to capture all the details in your scene.</p><p> Keeping the <a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> as low as possible is also crucial. Higher ISO levels can cause noise in your images. With a low ISO, your shots will retain plenty of detail and appear crisp and clear.</p><p> Your <a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> is another important setting to consider. This can vary depending on the effect you want to achieve. If you wish to create an ultra-long exposure effect (like a silky water effect in a river or waterfall), you may need to add a neutral density filter. This filter allows you to extend the shutter speed without overexposing the image.</p><p> <a aria-label="Focusing manually (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dont-afraid-manual-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Focusing manually</a> might sound intimidating, but it can offer more precision. Autofocus might not always pick the exact spot you want to be sharp. By setting the focus point yourself – generally at the <a aria-label="hyperfocal distance (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-find-and-use-hyperfocal-distance-for-sharp-backgrounds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">hyperfocal distance</a> , around a third of the way into the scene – you can ensure that the entire shot is crisp.</p><p> Finally, don&#39;t be afraid to experiment. Play with different settings to see what works best for your specific scene. Every landscape is unique, and the more you practice, the more intuitive these settings will become.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="work-with-the-weather"> 3.

Unlike color photography, where sunlight might offer golden hues, black and white photography is more about contrast, texture, and form.</p><p> Clouds, for instance, can be a photographer&#39;s best friend. Textured clouds swirling in the sky can make a dramatic background for landscapes. They provide a natural contrast that enhances the richness of the scene.</p><p> Pure white skies, on the other hand, offer a different kind of opportunity. These conditions are better for shots that include a lot of <a aria-label="negative space (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/negative-space-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">negative space</a> . A clear sky might seem empty and dull in color photography, but in black and white, it can create a powerful, minimalistic image. An overcast sky can provide a soft and even light that reduces harsh shadows, giving you a different aesthetic to play with.</p><p> But how do you know what the weather will be like?规划是关键。 Utilize weather-tracking apps or websites that provide forecasts tailored for photographers. This information can help you decide on the best times and places to shoot, aligning with the mood or atmosphere you want to create.</p><p> And don&#39;t be afraid to experiment with different weather conditions; rain, fog, and storms can add an unexpected touch of magic to your black and white landscapes. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="make-sure-you-understand-composition"> 4.

In fact, to capture good <a aria-label="color landscape photos (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/colorful-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">color landscape photos</a> , you often need to just find a dramatic scene and <a aria-label="photograph it in beautiful light (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/landscape-photography-about-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">photograph it in beautiful light</a> . (That&#39;s why so many color landscape shots are taken during the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-photograph-golden-hour/" target="_blank" aria-label="golden hour (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">golden hour</a> or just after sunset.)</p><p> But black and white landscape photography is very, <em>very</em> different. Without color, you can&#39;t rely on pure color and light; you have to captivate the viewer by creating strong compositions. Yes, light matters, but composition matters, too. And unless you can really master this technical skill, you&#39;ll struggle to produce compelling images.</p><p> In other words, instead of just chasing great light, you need to learn to look for the building blocks of photographic composition: leading lines, shapes, patterns, tonal contrast, and texture. When you approach a scene, try to ignore interesting colors. Do what you can to <em>see</em> in black and white so that you quickly recognize eye-catching geometry, impressive textures, and more.</p><p> For example, this photo works well in black and white because of the tonal contrast between the twin waterfalls and the dark rocks, not to mention the balanced geometry (two twin rectangles of light on an all-black background):</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-113203" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:80%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-1.jpg?resize=750%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="black and white landscape waterfall" class="wp-image-113203" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-1.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-1.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-1.jpg?resize=600%2C480&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-1.jpg?resize=717%2C574&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Yet the average viewer (or average color photographer) probably wouldn&#39;t notice these features at first glance. Instead, they&#39;d focus on the hues of the pool or the rich green leaves just outside the frame.

Study the work of famous black and white landscape photographers</h2><p> We don&#39;t naturally see the world in black and white. Therefore, learning to work in monochrome takes some practice. It&#39;s almost like learning a new language; you have to spend time really recognizing what works in B&amp;W photos and what doesn&#39;t (which is often very <em>different</em> from what works in color landscapes).</p><p> Now, you can figure out how to make a great black and white landscape through a lot of trial and error, but why reinvent the wheel? Instead, deepen your understanding of B&amp;W landscape images by looking at the work of masters – the folks who already spent dozens of years perfecting their compositions, lighting, settings, and techniques.</p><p> I recommend starting with <a aria-label="Ansel Adams (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/quotes-from-master-photographer-ansel-adams-and-how-you-to-apply-them-to-your-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Ansel Adams</a> and <a aria-label="Edward Weston (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/lessons-masters-of-photography-edward-weston/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Edward Weston</a> , who shot predominantly in black and white and whose work is closely aligned with contemporary landscape aesthetics. You might also check out Harry Callahan (if you&#39;re interested in more intimate landscape shots) as well as Wynn Bullock (who captured wonderfully atmospheric photos).</p><p> Also, look at what modern-day photographers are doing on <a aria-label="Instagram (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.instagram.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">Instagram</a> and <a aria-label="500px (opens in a new tab)" href="https://500px.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">500px</a> . Some names to search for include Cole Thompson, Rob Dweck, Arnaud Bertrande, Thibault Roland, Joel Tjintjelaar, and Nathan Wirth.</p><p> When you look at the work of B&amp;W landscape shooters, ask yourself: What makes their black and white landscape photos so powerful? What light do they use? What photographic techniques (eg, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/step-by-step-guide-to-long-exposure-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="long exposure (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">long exposure</a> ) do they employ?

Tones don&#39;t separate out, key elements fade into one another, and the composition loses impact. While color photographers may pursue scenes without tonal contrast, they can rely on changes in color to differentiate key elements. In black and white, however, that&#39;s not an option, and it becomes all about the tones.</p><p> <a aria-label="Texture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-texture-to-improve-your-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Texture</a> (and contrast <em>between</em> textures) looks great, too. If you think about the elements that often appear in B&amp;W landscape photos – cliffs, rocks, grass, trees, mountains, and oceans, along with human-made objects like piers, jetties, and old barns – you&#39;ll notice that they all have distinct textures. Some feature rough, heavy surfaces, while others are intensely smooth.</p><p> In the photo below, the arch, the cliffs in the distance, and the rocks in the foreground are all heavily textured. The sea and the sky are much smoother. There is a strong contrast between the roughness of the rocks and the smoothness of the sea and the sky. And thanks to that textural contrast, the photo is much more impactful!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-113205" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:56.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="423" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-3.jpg?resize=750%2C423&#038;ssl=1" alt="long exposure rock at sea" class="wp-image-113205" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-3.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-3.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-3.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-3.jpg?resize=717%2C404&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shoot-in-monochrome-mode"> 7.

Grab one (or more) of these accessories, and you&#39;ll be able to capture jaw-dropping images beyond your wildest dreams.</p><p> (Am I exaggerating? Honestly, I don&#39;t think so. Neutral density filters are a <em>huge</em> deal.)</p><p> But what makes ND filters so special?</p><p> ND filters are basically dark pieces of glass that go in front of your lens and prevent light from hitting your camera sensor. In other words, ND filters <em>block out the light</em> , which lets you lengthen your shutter speed while retaining a balanced exposure.</p><p> You see, as a landscape photographer without an ND filter, you&#39;ll often be using a <a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> between 1/2s and 1/125s (assuming you&#39;re shooting with a relatively narrow <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> of f/13 or so, which is generally一个好主意）。</p><p> At times, you may want to lengthen your shutter speed for creative effect – so that you can blur water, stretch clouds, and create a beautiful ethereal look in your photos. But in most situations, dropping the shutter speed beyond 1/2s or so just can&#39;t be done. The light is too strong; if you try it, you&#39;ll end up with an overexposed image.</p><p> Unless you have an item that can block out the light – such as a neutral density filter! The ND filter will keep your camera from overexposing the scene even when you&#39;re dealing with lots of light. That way, you can push out your shutter speed to 5s, 10s, and more, and you can get the stretchy clouds and blurry water that you&#39;re after.</p><p>看看下面的照片。 The first was taken at dusk with a shutter speed of 1/5s. This exposure time was slow enough to introduce some blur into the water (look at the foreground wave), but it wasn&#39;t slow enough to really flatten out the water while making the clouds turn into interesting streaks.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-113207" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:56.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="423" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?resize=750%2C423&#038;ssl=1" alt="relatively short seaside rock exposure" class="wp-image-113207" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?resize=717%2C404&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> But I added a neutral density filter and made the next photo using a shutter speed of 180 seconds.

Don&#39;t just take photos like everyone else</h2><p> Black and white landscape photographer Cole Thompson has an interesting idea. He practices what he calls “photographic abstinence,” where he doesn&#39;t look at the work of other photographers before heading to a new location. The idea is that it enables him to see the landscape through his own eyes without being influenced by other people&#39;s photos of the same elements.</p><p> I&#39;ve never taken this idea to its extreme. I believe it&#39;s important to research an area before you go; that way, you can find its most photogenic parts and avoid boring areas. But this does lead to a problem: The most powerful images you see tend to stick in your mind. The natural tendency is to want to create similar images – so if you spend time researching locations, you&#39;ll often end up capturing photos that look like everybody else&#39;s.</p><p> I encourage you to push back against this tendency! Recognize that certain subjects are photographed in particular ways. Use that knowledge to capture images that are different – images that are truly <em>you</em> .</p><p>让我举一个例子。 A few years ago, I visited the Playa de las Catedrales (Cathedral Beach) in northern Spain. Search for it on Google or 500px, and most photos will look something like this, showing the cathedral-like arches for which the beach is named:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-113209" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=750%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="arches in black and white" class="wp-image-113209" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Anybody who visits the beach will naturally want to take photos of the arches. They&#39;re the reason the spot is famous, after all. But if you only focus on the arches, you&#39;ll miss other (equally compelling!) possibilities.</p><p> So after traveling to Cathedral Beach and getting my rock arch photos, I really started <em>looking</em> . I saw some rocks in the sea that made an interesting minimalistic composition, and I captured the following photo:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-113210" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:40.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="304" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-8.jpg?resize=750%2C304&#038;ssl=1" alt="long exposure rocks in water" class="wp-image-113210" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-8.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-8.jpg?resize=300%2C122&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-8.jpg?resize=600%2C243&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-8.jpg?resize=717%2C291&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> It doesn&#39;t feature famous arches.

The files don&#39;t include any color information, which means that images can become pretty confusing. Various subjects blend into one another, and the viewer may struggle to understand the scene.</p><p> Now, one way to deal with this tendency is to include plenty of tonal contrast. It&#39;s a good technique, and I highly recommend it. But if you want to <em>really</em> elevate your B&amp;W photos, you should also aim to cut down on extraneous elements in your compositions. That way, the viewer will know exactly where to focus – and they&#39;ll be able to instantly interpret the shot.</p><p> So before capturing a new image, ask yourself: Does the frame include any elements that might distract the viewer? Is the viewer able to clearly identify the main subject? Make sure that every part of the scene contributes to the composition.</p><p> If you come upon a scene that seems a bit cluttered, don&#39;t walk away. Instead, take steps to <em>simplify</em> . Get in closer, use a longer lens, or adjust your angle so that you highlight certain objects and block out others.合理？ </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-forget-about-the-light">11.

And it&#39;s true: Composition makes a huge difference.</p><p> But make sure you don&#39;t fixate so heavily on composition that you forget about other key photographic elements – such as lighting.</p><p> Color landscape photographers love shooting during the golden hours, and this soft-yet-direct light also looks great in black and white. The low sun will create long shadows, which you can use as powerful composition elements (eg, <a aria-label="leading lines (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-leading-lines-for-better-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">leading lines</a> ).</p><p> But as a black and white shooter, you can head out at other times and capture equally compelling images. For instance, overcast days produce soft, intimate light that reveals detail in forest and mountain scenes. And even harsh midday sun – which is hated by most color landscape photographers – can make for interesting black and white shots. The trick is to use the contrasty light to your advantage; let it create shadow geometry, then incorporate the shadows into your compositions.</p><p> <a aria-label="Blue hour (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-quick-tips-for-better-blue-hour-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Blue hour</a> is another great time to shoot black and white landscapes. The light is wonderfully soft, and if you can find a moving subject (eg, ocean waves), you&#39;ll be able to capture ethereal long exposures that look <em>outstanding</em> . </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-be-afraid-of-harsh-lighting"> 12. Don&#39;t be afraid of harsh lighting</h2><p> In the previous tip, I mentioned that harsh lighting can work well for B&amp;W landscape photos. But because shooting landscape at midday is so frowned-upon, I wanted to share a personal example to show you what I mean.</p><p> A number of years ago, I was shooting in the altiplano of Bolivia. I arrived at mid-day at the spectacular and weird Laguna Colorado. It was savagely bright; cloudless skies, high elevation, middle of the day, and within a few degrees of the equator. Lighting conditions couldn&#39;t have been worse.</p><p> While the landscape was uniformly drenched in harsh, ugly light, there was contrast in the colors of the desert. A polarizer darkened the sky and removed the worst of the glare. The resulting black-and-white conversion, was if not perfect, at least the best of a very <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/life-is-too-short-to-be-taking-photos-of-great-subjects-in-bad-light/">bad situation</a> .</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-157944" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="14 - Black and White in the Outdoors" class="wp-image-157944" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by David Shaw</figcaption></figure></div><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-157943" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="15 - Black and White in the Outdoors" class="wp-image-157943" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581-2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bolivia-Altiplano-Feb2008-581-2.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Frequently traveling landscape photographers find themselves in beautiful locations at bad times, and we don&#39;t always have the freedom to return when the light is better.

It allows you to zoom in on specific elements, such as a lone tree, a winding path, or the intricate pattern of leaves and rocks. The compression effect of a telephoto lens can also create a unique visual relationship between the foreground and background.</p><p> Intimate shots are all about observation and imagination. Look for textures, shapes, and patterns that draw your eye. Experiment with different angles and framing to find the <a aria-label="perfect landscape composition (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/4-rules-of-composition-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">perfect landscape composition</a> . Sometimes, the most compelling images come from the most ordinary subjects, like delicate lines in the sand or the graceful curve of a branch.</p><p> Don&#39;t be afraid to get close and personal with nature. Part of the beauty of black and white photography lies in its ability to reveal the hidden artistry of the landscape.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="travel-when-you-can"> 14.

Photographing in RAW is a wise choice, as it gives you more control and flexibility when editing. Don&#39;t just press the “Convert to Black and White” button; explore various conversion options to see what best fits your vision.</p><p> When converting to black and white, try adjusting individual color channels. This allows you to emphasize or de-emphasize different parts of the image, helping you create a visually engaging photograph. Play with the highlights and shadows, add contrast, tweak clarity, and even apply a vignette to guide the viewer&#39;s eye toward your main subject.</p><p> Editing software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop offers several good black and white conversion methods. Don&#39;t hesitate to experiment and find what works best for your particular shot. Spend time on this. The conversion from color to black and white isn&#39;t just a technical step; it&#39;s an artistic one. This is where your creativity shines, and it&#39;s how you can transform a good photo into a masterpiece. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="additional-resources-for-capturing-beautiful-bw-landscapes"> Additional resources for capturing beautiful B&amp;W landscapes</h2><p> Shooting for black and white requires you to see a scene and think a little differently.

I discuss all the essentials, including settings, backgrounds, lighting, and composition; that way, you can photograph all those delicious-looking cakes, pies, cookies, hot chocolates, and lattes in all their glory!</p><p>让我们开始吧。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="carefully-arrange-your-holiday-food-setup"> 1. Carefully arrange your holiday food setup</h2><p> Sometimes, you won&#39;t have control over the placement of the food (if you&#39;re in a restaurant, say, or you&#39;re a guest at a friend&#39;s home). However, if you&#39;re making the food on your own, or you get an opportunity to adjust the food&#39;s positioning, make sure you spend some time creating a pleasing composition.</p><p> After all, nobody wants to see a mess of cookies strewn about a plate. But a carefully ordered spread of cookies with little crumbs sprinkled artfully across the tray? That looks <em>amazing</em> , and the beautiful arrangement will dramatically enhance the resulting photo.</p><p> When arranging the food, pay careful attention to the broad shapes, the colors, and the relationship of each food item to its neighbors (and to the frame as a whole). Aim to create balance throughout the scene, and see if you can enhance interest through the use of color contrast. (If you&#39;re doing Christmas food photography, green and red make for a great color combination!) Don&#39;t let things get too messy, but don&#39;t leave things looking static, either; try to create a natural setup that leads the eye around the frame.</p><p> It can also be helpful to choose a general color palette but add little color accents. For instance, the splash of red in the next photo breaks up the monotony of the warm whites and browns:</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-159279 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-159279" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-12.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Holiday food photography" class="wp-image-159279" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-12.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-12.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-12.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-12.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-12.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-12.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> It can also help to remember various <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/food-photography-composition/" target="_blank" aria-label="food photography composition guidelines (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">food photography composition guidelines</a> .

Keep it simple</h2><p> When it comes to holiday food photography, less is often more. I always recommend starting with a single, well-chosen item. Then, if you want to get more complex, the key is to build the scene gradually.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-258109" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:59.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="893" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/holiday-food-photography-8.jpg?resize=1500%2C893&#038;ssl=1" alt="Holiday food photography" class="wp-image-258109" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/holiday-food-photography-8.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/holiday-food-photography-8.jpg?resize=300%2C179&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/holiday-food-photography-8.jpg?resize=600%2C357&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/holiday-food-photography-8.jpg?resize=768%2C457&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/holiday-food-photography-8.jpg?resize=717%2C427&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Begin with that one cookie. Then, perhaps introduce a rustic napkin or baking tray to add texture. Next, consider placing a second and third cookie slightly overlapping the first. Each element should be intentional, contributing to the overall narrative of your photograph. Every item in your frame should serve a purpose. If it doesn&#39;t add to the story, it should probably be removed.</p><p> As you arrange and rearrange, pay attention to the details. How does the light fall on the crumbs? What shadows do the folds of the napkin create? These small elements can transform a simple photograph into a stunning visual feast. But when in doubt, simplify. Keep your scene uncluttered and focused. After all, a single, well-shot cookie can be far more evocative than a poorly composed image of a table overflowing with treats. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-soft-flattering-light"> 3. Use soft, flattering light</h2><p> In my experience, light can make or break your food photos. By adjusting the direction of the light (overhead, front, back, or side) and by modifying the quality of the light (hard or soft), you can capture a great shot – or you can create a bland, boring, unflattering image.</p><p> So what kind of light is best for holiday food photos? First of all, make sure that you turn off your camera&#39;s pop-up flash. This will only produce harsh shadows and bright highlights, and it won&#39;t do the food any favors.</p><p> Instead, seek out soft light – such as light shining through translucent curtains or light coming through a north- or south-facing window.

You can use these to mimic soft window light, and you won&#39;t need to worry about repositioning the food in relation to the window, nor will you need to wait for good light; instead, you can shoot whenever – and wherever – you like!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="think-about-your-angle"> 4. Think about your angle</h2><p> Once you&#39;ve determined the right arrangement and lighting for your holiday food setup, you&#39;ll want to think about <em>your</em> position in relation to the food – that is, your angle.</p><p> Food photographers use three broad approaches:</p><ol><li> Photographing from directly above</li><li> Photographing from 45 degrees</li><li> Photographing on a level with the food</li></ol><p> And while any of these approaches can work, it&#39;s important to consider how each angle will affect your final image. Shooting from directly overhead will highlight patterns and colors on top of the food, but it&#39;ll also flatten the scene. Conversely, shooting on a level with the food will emphasize its height and potentially its depth, but it won&#39;t let the viewer explore the broader patterns created by the food arrangement.</p><p> Note the difference between this holiday scene, shot from above:</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-159278 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-159278" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-11.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Holiday food photography" class="wp-image-159278" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-11.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-11.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-11.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-11.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-11.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-11.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> And this holiday scene, shot from much lower:</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-159284 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-159284" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:71.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1071" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-20.jpg?resize=1500%2C1071&#038;ssl=1" alt="Holiday food photography" class="wp-image-159284" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-20.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-20.jpg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-20.jpg?resize=768%2C548&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-20.jpg?resize=600%2C428&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-20.jpg?resize=717%2C512&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Finally, we have a third scene, which was shot on a level with the holiday cookies:</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-159282 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-159282" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-18.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Holiday food photography" class="wp-image-159282" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-18.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-18.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-18.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-18.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-18.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Christmas-Food-Photography-Tips-18.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Each angle works well, but the results are <em>very</em> different.

Imagine capturing a steaming hot pie just as it comes out of the oven, its aroma almost wafting through the photo.听起来不错，对吧？</p><p> Waiting until the middle or end of your Christmas dinner to take photos can be a missed opportunity. Food declines rapidly. Ice melts, vegetables wilt, and fruits brown. These transformations, while natural, can rob your dishes of their photogenic qualities. Therefore, it&#39;s crucial to capture them in their prime.</p><p> That said, it&#39;s important to balance your photography with the festive atmosphere. Be respectful of those around you. If you&#39;re at a gathering, ensure that your photography doesn&#39;t disrupt the celebration. Sometimes, a quick snapshot taken discreetly can be as effective as a carefully staged shot.这一切都是为了捕捉当下的本质<em>，同时又不</em>妨碍享受。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="choose-a-complementary-background"> 6.

Indoor scenes tend to have very little light, and if you&#39;re not careful, you&#39;ll end up with blurry and/or underexposed photos.</p><p> I&#39;d encourage you to switch your camera mode to <a aria-label="Aperture Priority (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-versus-shutter-priority-which-shooting-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Aperture Priority</a> , which will give you control over your <a aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> and (indirectly) over your <a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> . ( <a aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> is another option, though it can be a bit intimidating for beginners.)</p><p> Make sure your shutter speed is fast enough to produce sharp images (1/100s is a good starting point). And if you&#39;re struggling to get a reasonably fast shutter speed while also capturing a well-exposed photo, it can help to boost the <a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> . (If you plan to regularly photograph food, a tripod can be a big help, too; it&#39;ll free you from the need to use a fast shutter speed.)</p><p> By the way, I&#39;d also encourage you to use a lens with a wide maximum aperture. That way, you can shoot wide open, which will let in more light while also creating beautiful background blur effects! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="take-some-photos-of-the-holiday-food-as-its-prepared"> 8.

The preparation process can be equally photogenic! During the holidays, kitchens become centers of activity, filled with the warmth of cooking and the joy of family and friends.</p><p> Capturing these moments requires a slightly different approach than more standard holiday food photography. You&#39;ll want to use a reasonably fast shutter speed to freeze the action. This is especially important in dynamic kitchen environments, where hands and utensils are constantly moving. A shutter speed of around 1/125s can be a good starting point, but feel free to adjust based on the lighting and the level of activity.</p><p> As you photograph, look for stories. Maybe it&#39;s a grandparent instructing a child on a traditional recipe or grandchildren eagerly helping with simple tasks. These moments are laden with emotion and tradition, making them powerful subjects!</p><p> Be mindful of your presence in the kitchen. Move around quietly, and try not to interfere with the cooking process. With a respectful approach and a keen eye for detail, you can capture the essence of holiday cooking, which is as much about the people and the process as it is about the food itself. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="take-some-candid-images-of-people-with-food"> 9.

After all, it&#39;s not just about the dishes; it&#39;s about the experience and memories being made. Imagine catching your child&#39;s gleeful anticipation as they reach for a Christmas cookie, or the warm smiles exchanged over a family dinner. These candid shots are priceless.</p><p> When attempting this kind of candid photography, it&#39;s crucial to keep a low profile. You want to capture the essence of the moment <em>without</em> intruding. A slightly longer lens can be handy here, allowing you to photograph from a distance. And keep your camera settings ready for quick action; a faster shutter speed is essential for freezing quick movements and fleeting expressions.</p><p> But remember that respect and comfort are key. Not everyone enjoys being photographed while eating. Always ask for permission if you&#39;re not sure, and be mindful of people&#39;s privacy. With sensitivity and a bit of creativity, candid shots can truly encapsulate the spirit of holiday feasting!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="capture-some-close-ups"> 10.

Close-up photography lets you showcase these intricate details – the glistening of sugar on a cookie, the delicate patterns on a pie crust, and the vibrant colors of fresh garnishes. Such shots can transform ordinary food items into extraordinary photographic subjects.</p><p> You don&#39;t need a specialized macro lens for this. Any lens with a decent close-focusing capability will work. If possible, position your setup near a window for natural light that beautifully highlights these details. But watch out for camera shake and blurriness, especially at high magnifications.</p><p> A fast shutter speed can help, but for the ultimate sharpness, consider using a tripod. (Plus, though they may seem cumbersome, tripods encourage you to compose your shots more thoughtfully!)</p><p> Focus on the textures and colors, and experiment with different angles. Sometimes, an unusual perspective can reveal something fascinating about your subject. And as I mentioned above, pay attention to the background; a blurred backdrop can make your subject stand out even more. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="holiday-food-photography-final-words"> Holiday food photography: final words</h2><p> As we wrap up, remember that holiday food photography is about capturing the essence of the season. It&#39;s about the joy, the colors, the textures, and the people. Whether it&#39;s a simple shot of a holiday cookie or a candid moment of laughter at the dinner table, each photograph holds a story.</p><p> I encourage you to experiment with these tips and find what works best for you. Photography is a personal journey, and there&#39;s no one-size-fits-all approach.

Instead of capturing rolling hills or serene lakes, you focus on the concrete and steel that shape modern lives. For me, the beauty of cities often lies in their rich textures and layers; it&#39;s a tapestry of light, shapes, and emotions that you, as a photographer, can capture.</p><p> Bottom line: cityscape photography allows you to bring urban environments to life through your lens. From the glow of neon lights in Tokyo to the historical charm of London&#39;s cobblestone streets, it&#39;s your chance to show the world what makes a city beautiful – and what a city means to you. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="essential-cityscape-photography-gear"> Essential cityscape photography gear</h2><p> You&#39;re itching to hit the streets, camera in hand, ready to capture the city. I know the feeling, but before you head out the door, let&#39;s talk gear.</p><p> You see, in cityscape photography, the equipment you use can significantly impact your results. While it&#39;s not all about the camera and lenses, let&#39;s face it: quality gear can make your life easier and your photos even more stunning. You&#39;ll generally need three key items: a full-frame camera, a wide-angle lens, and a sturdy tripod. A neutral density filter, while optional, can also come in handy. Let&#39;s look at each in turn:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-full-frame-camera"> A full-frame camera</h3><p> These cameras offer large sensors that capture more light and generally provide a broader dynamic range than their cropped sensor counterparts. That&#39;s crucial when you&#39;re dealing with tricky lighting scenarios at dawn or dusk.</p><p> Plus, a full-frame camera&#39;s high megapixel count can be important if you&#39;re planning on going big – think wall-sized prints. But remember: more megapixels also mean larger file sizes, so you&#39;ll need ample storage space on your computer, too.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-wide-angle-lens"> A wide-angle lens</h3><p> It&#39;s possible to create stunning cityscape photography with a telephoto lens – you can use it to zoom in and highlight individual buildings and small details – but I&#39;d really recommend you start out with a wide-angle lens. A good wide-angle field of view will let you capture sweeping scenes, and you can even combine foreground and background layers for a three-dimensional effect.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254905" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-254905" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> What type of wide-angle lens is best? Beginners should try out a 24mm prime lens, which will cost very little yet still offer a wide field of view (and crisp optics). If you&#39;re willing to spend more and you want extra flexibility, a 16-35mm lens is a good bet; it&#39;ll let you capture various wide perspectives as you zoom from the ultra-wide 16mm to the tighter 35mm.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-robust-tripod"> A robust tripod</h3><p> Ah, the tripod – the unsung hero of sharp photography. In cityscape photography, you&#39;ll often find yourself shooting in less-than-ideal lighting conditions. A narrow aperture is generally a must to keep everything in focus, but this lets in less light. Combine that with the slow shutter speeds required for proper exposure, and you&#39;re in prime territory for camera shake, the leading cause of blurry photos.</p><p> That&#39;s where a sturdy tripod comes in. Opt for one that&#39;s lightweight yet solid – carbon fiber models offer the best of both worlds. At the end of the day, a good tripod might cost a chunk of change, but it&#39;ll make a <em>huge</em> difference to your cityscape shots. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-neutral-density-filter"> A neutral density filter</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256847" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:64.6%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="969" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-206.jpg?resize=1500%2C969&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-256847" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-206.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-206.jpg?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-206.jpg?resize=600%2C388&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-206.jpg?resize=768%2C496&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-206.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-206.jpg?resize=717%2C463&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Last but not least, consider adding a neutral density (ND) filter to your camera bag. While not an absolute necessity, an ND filter can elevate your daytime cityscapes by allowing for longer exposures without overexposing your shots.</p><p> These filters come in various strengths; a 10-stop ND filter is a solid starting point for those new to this game. With an ND filter, you can create mesmerizing effects like smoothing out water or capturing cloud movement, adding an artistic flair to your images. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-best-cityscape-photography-settings"> The best cityscape photography settings</h2><p> To unlock the full potential of your camera and capture those jaw-dropping cityscape images, you need to start with the right settings: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="aperture-priority-or-manual-mode"> Aperture Priority or Manual mode</h3><p> Aperture Priority mode is a fantastic place to start, especially if the very mention of Manual mode sends a shiver down your spine. This mode lets you select the aperture and ISO while your camera figures out the optimal shutter speed.</p><p> In contrast, Manual mode is for those who aren&#39;t afraid to handle everything themselves. When you set your camera to Manual, you&#39;re in the driver&#39;s seat. Every setting, from shutter speed to aperture, is at your fingertips, which can be a great way to ensure you get the results you&#39;ve envisioned.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-narrow-aperture"> A narrow aperture</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256848" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-201.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-256848" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-201.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-201.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-201.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-201.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-201.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-201.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Aperture settings directly affect the depth of field in your cityscape images. A narrower aperture, such as f/8 or higher, provides a greater depth of field, ensuring objects both near and distant are in focus.<br /></p><p> Should your composition involve elements from the foreground to the skyline, you may consider an aperture setting as small as f/16. Proper aperture selection allows you to encapsulate the city&#39;s grandeur comprehensively.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-low-iso"> A low ISO</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256844" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-203.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-256844" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-203.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-203.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-203.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-203.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-203.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> High ISO values can help you use fast shutter speeds in low light, but when you&#39;re doing cityscape photography, chances are you&#39;re armed with a tripod – and this eliminates the need for speed.</p><p> Therefore, keep the ISO as low as you can to ensure the highest quality. ISO 100 is my go-to here for pristine, noise-free images. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-generally-slow-shutter-speed"> A (generally) slow shutter speed</h3><p> Shutter speed serves as the linchpin in balancing your exposure triangle. It&#39;s essential to monitor your camera&#39;s exposure meter for guidance in selecting the appropriate shutter speed. You&#39;ll often end up using slower shutter speeds – below 1/80s or so – to keep your files looking detailed. (Note, however, that the use of a sturdy tripod is critical when working with slow shutter speeds; otherwise, you&#39;ll end up with lots of motion blur!)</p><p> For dynamic compositions involving moving objects, such as vehicles or pedestrians, a long shutter speed can introduce a captivating blur, adding a layer of complexity to your image. This effect is easiest to pull off during the blue hour when the light is low. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="lighting-in-cityscape-photography"> Lighting in cityscape photography</h2><p> In cityscape photography, lighting is your best friend and your worst enemy. It can elevate your shot from mediocre to magazine-worthy or plunge it into the depths of dullness. Let&#39;s get you equipped to make the most of it. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photograph-the-city-during-the-golden-hours"> Photograph the city during the golden hours</h3><p> First, consider the golden hours, which occurs in the (roughly) hour after sunrise and hour before sunset. Ever noticed how everything seems to glow during these times? That&#39;s because the sun is low in the sky, spreading its light at an angle that creates both depth and drama. When golden light hits skyscrapers and streets, the city transforms. Glass towers look <em>amazing</em> , and mundane streets suddenly look like they&#39;re paved with, well, gold.</p><p> To get the most out of the golden hour, it&#39;s essential to look at how the light is hitting your subjects. The textures of buildings, the hues of the reflective surfaces, and the shadows change depending on the light&#39;s direction.</p><p> But remember, the sun waits for no one! The golden hours don&#39;t last long, so you&#39;ll need to be prepared to work fast and make the most of the good lighting.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256849" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-205.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-256849" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-205.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-205.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-205.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-205.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-205.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-205.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photograph-the-city-during-blue-hour"> Photograph the city during blue hour</h3><p> Next, let&#39;s talk about the blue hour, the period just before sunrise and just after sunset when the sky takes on an ethereal blue hue.</p><p> During the blue hour, the sky grows darker and the city lights turn on. The balance of light – between the sky and the city – often becomes nearly equal, and you&#39;ll witness a stunning combination of tones.</p><p> Additionally, these lighting conditions are ideal for capturing long-exposure effects. Ever seen those cityscape photos where the clouds seem to smear across the sky, or the car lights draw vibrant lines across the roads? That&#39;s partially due to the blue hour and its magic.</p><p> Plus, with the softer light, you don&#39;t have to wrestle with harsh shadows or overblown highlights. Instead, you get serene tones that contrast with the city&#39;s frenetic energy.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256850" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:56.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="844" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-208.jpg?resize=1500%2C844&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-256850" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-208.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-208.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-208.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-208.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-208.jpg?resize=717%2C403&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photograph-the-city-at-midday"> Photograph the city at midday</h3><p> Next, there&#39;s the high-noon light, often avoided like the plague in landscape photography – but don&#39;t be so quick to dismiss it. Yes, it&#39;s harsh and creates strong shadows, but sometimes that&#39;s exactly what you need to emphasize the angular geometry of a modern city.</p><p> You see, when the sun is at its zenith, the light pours down vertically, etching out the details of buildings and streets in a way that&#39;s straightforward but striking. This is the time to embrace high-contrast compositions, where the play of light and shadow can be used to your advantage.</p><p> But what if it&#39;s cloudy? Far from being a disaster, an overcast sky can be a boon. Clouds act like a giant diffuser, spreading light evenly and softening the scene. If you&#39;ve got a cityscape that&#39;s naturally moody or industrial, a cloudy sky can amplify that aesthetic tenfold. You get to experiment with a different kind of drama, one that&#39;s quieter but just as impactful.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256853" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-256853" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-202.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Bottom line: whether you&#39;re catching the golden hour&#39;s warm embrace or exploiting the high-noon contrast, knowing how to work with light will elevate your cityscapes to new heights. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="tips-to-improve-your-cityscape-photography"> Tips to improve your cityscape photography</h2><p> Looking to elevate your cityscape shots even further? Below, I share plenty of practical tips to help you out!</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-incorporate-leading-lines-into-your-compositions"> 1. Incorporate leading lines into your compositions</h3><p> Beginners often point their camera directly at city skylines and fire away – but while there&#39;s nothing wrong with such an approach, it can get repetitive after a while, plus the images tend to look <em>flat</em> .</p><p> On the other hand, if you can incorporate a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-leading-lines-for-better-compositions/" target="_blank" aria-label="foreground line (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">foreground line</a> (or three!) that leads the eye into the image and toward key background elements, your shots will have tons of three-dimensionality.它们也会更加有趣，因为它们会将观众的注意力带入从前景到背景的旅程。 Check out this next image, which uses a path to lead the eye toward the mysterious light in the background: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cityscapes4.jpg?ssl=1" alt="tunnel with a lantern" title="cityscapes4.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> I&#39;d also mention that leading lines can help create order in an otherwise chaotic scene. If you&#39;re shooting in an area with lots of pedestrians or cars, for instance, a nice leading line – such as a road – can cut through the confusion and help bring the composition together.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="seek-out-reflections"> 2. Seek out reflections</h3><p> Reflections are everywhere in a city;你只需要知道去哪里找！ Buildings, water, and cars – they all offer ample opportunities for capturing compelling reflections, which can add intrigue and depth to your photos.</p><p> Note that reflections can be large and highly visible, such as the golden hues of a sunset mirrored in a row of sleek, glass buildings. Or they can be more subtle, like the fleeting image of a passerby&#39;s face reflected in the glossy hood of a car. Play with this as you capture your cityscape photos and see what you can create!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254898" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="994" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-11.jpg?resize=1500%2C994&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-254898" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-11.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-11.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-11.jpg?resize=600%2C398&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-11.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-11.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-11.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-11.jpg?resize=717%2C475&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Also, tweak your angle and adjust your focal length. Play around until you get that perfect reflection, the one that transforms a mundane scene into something magical. And don&#39;t shy away from getting low. Crouching down near a puddle can result in a surprisingly disorienting image – one that shows the world in a new, unexpected light. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-be-afraid-of-manual-focus"> 3. Don&#39;t be afraid of manual focus</h3><p> I get it: autofocus seems simple, dependable, and safe.但是，当自动对焦在弱光条件下开始不稳定时会发生什么？ This is where manual focus steps in to give you the control that you need.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256851" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-207.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-256851" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-207.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-207.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-207.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-207.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-207.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cityscape-photography-207.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Switching to manual focus offers a level of precision that&#39;s often crucial when the lighting isn&#39;t ideal. So if you find your autofocus system hunting for the right spot to focus on, it&#39;s time to take matters into your own hands. Just switch your lens to manual and use your camera&#39;s LCD screen to check the focus as you zoom in on your subject. Then slowly rotate the focus ring back and forth until your subject is razor-sharp. This zooming-in method avoids the pitfalls of autofocus inaccuracies and ensures that you nail the focus every single time.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-shoot-long-exposures-at-intersections"> 4. Shoot long exposures at intersections</h3><p> Do you want to capture cityscape photos like this next example? </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cityscapes5.jpg?ssl=1" alt="cityscape photography light trails at night from above" title="cityscapes5.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> The good news is that it&#39;s not as hard as you might think, and it doesn&#39;t require any Photoshop wizardry, either!</p><p> Simply find a busy intersection in a city, and get up <em>high</em> . You can shoot from an observation deck, a roof, or a parking garage; just make sure you have an unobstructed view of the high-traffic areas.</p><p> Bring a tripod, bring your remote release, and capture some <a aria-label="long-exposure shots (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/step-by-step-guide-to-long-exposure-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">long-exposure shots</a> . I&#39;d recommend using a shutter speed of at least five seconds, but you may wish to shoot for longer depending on the speed of the traffic. The goal is to keep the shutter speed long enough to blur the cars into lines of light.</p><p> (Pro tip: Make sure that your scene features some curves. Traffic moving in a straight line can look okay if you include interesting structures in the composition, but if you&#39;re focusing on the roadways from above, I highly recommend you include some bends and corners.)</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-look-for-fountains"> 5. Look for fountains</h3><p> I <em>love</em> fountains in cityscape photography. They look great when incorporated into long-exposure shots – the water will turn into a beautiful blur – and they&#39;re also just stunning points of interest to add to your compositions.</p><p> Happily, most cities are full of fountains. If you&#39;re not sure where to find a fountain or two at your next cityscape destination, pull up Google Maps and do a quick search.</p><p> Then, when you&#39;re out shooting, look for ways to include the fountains in your compositions. For instance, you can use the water to frame buildings, like this: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cityscapes6.jpg?ssl=1" alt="fountain long exposure" title="cityscapes6.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>或者，您可以使用喷泉作为有趣的前景主题，为您的图像添加三维效果。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shoot-the-city-skyline"> 6. Shoot the city skyline</h3><p> Yes, the city against the sky – photographed from a great distance – is a classic shot. Yet it&#39;s one that never loses its charm. The unique silhouette of a city, etched against the clouds or a pale blue sky, can make for the kind of photo that you want to hang on your wall.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254899" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-10.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-254899" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-10.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-10.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-10.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-10.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-10.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-10.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> But how do you get the best results? Look for a vantage point that lets you capture the skyline from a distance. A spot across the water works great, especially if you&#39;re photographing in a city with larger waterways. But keep in mind that the city skyline is a popular subject. The challenge is to capture it in a way that&#39;s unique, one that showcases your individual style.</p><p> Why not experiment with an ultra-long exposure?还是等待一个大雾天，让这座城市变成一场空灵的梦？也不要忘记美丽光线的魔力。 Shooting at sunrise or sunset can bathe the city in warm hues and create an unforgettable image. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photograph-the-city-from-above"> 7.

These decks often have enough space for photographers to shoot, but here&#39;s the catch: they don&#39;t generally allow tripods.因此，在您前往那座高耸的摩天大楼的顶部之前，请快速打电话确认是否允许使用三脚架。 （不要做出假设；最好进行相应的询问和计划！）</p><p> Parking garages can also serve as fantastic makeshift observation decks. You can drive up, park your car, and walk to a good vantage point. But always remember to check whether you&#39;re permitted to photograph there. Laws and regulations differ from city to city, so an afternoon call to the parking garage owners can save you a lot of trouble.</p><p>最后，您可以使用无人机拍摄高角度照片 - 如果您拥有高质量的摄影无人机，并且您所在城市的法律允许无人机飞行，那么天空就是极限！ Drones offer unprecedented angles and perspectives, letting you capture shots that are nothing short of awe-inspiring.</p><p> Of course, if you pursue cityscape drone photography, be responsible. Always adhere to regulations, don&#39;t invade anyone&#39;s privacy, and fly safely.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-use-patterns-to-improve-your-cityscape-compositions"> 8. Use patterns to improve your cityscape compositions</h3><p> If you&#39;re after more <em>subtle</em> cityscape photography, you don&#39;t need to capture stunning vistas of skyscrapers at night; instead, take a walk during the day, observe simple city scenes, and look for patterns.</p><p> You see, patterns can bring a sense of visual rhythm and harmony to an image.当您将它们融入到整个场景中时 - 在这里，广角镜头会有很大帮助！ – 你可以创造一个平静、甚至<em>冥想的</em>形象。</p><p>看看由树木和行人组成的两种图案如何提升这张照片的效果： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cityscapes7.jpg?ssl=1" alt="people walking through a park" title="城市景观7.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>顺便说一句：大多数场景都具有<em>某种</em>模式，即使它们不是立即显而易见的。 So if you&#39;re drawn to a scene but you can&#39;t find a pattern, stop, take a deep breath, and look around.我猜您将能够找到一些重复的图形元素，例如形状、线条甚至颜色。</p><p>当你这样做时，将它们包含在你的构图中，让它们为整个场景增添趣味，甚至统一起来。 </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="change-things-up-with-a-telephoto-lens"> 9.用远摄镜头更改事物</h3><p>Wide-angle lenses are often the go-to for cityscape photography, but hear me out: a telephoto lens has its unique charm.当您正在寻找一览无余的远景的替代方案时，长焦镜头可以改变游戏规则。</p><p> 70-200mm 变焦镜头的用途尤其广泛。有了它，您可以放大您认为迷人的城市的特定元素 - 想想复杂的建筑、有图案的窗户，甚至是遥远的桥梁。换句话说，您可以隔离主体并使它们成为照片的焦点。</p><p> Plus, a telephoto lens is particularly adept at showcasing the geometry of cities. The straight lines of the roads, the curves of the buildings, and the grid-like patterns formed by intersecting streets can be made into abstract compositions that celebrate the city&#39;s form.</p><p>长焦玻璃的另一大优点是能够压缩距离。 With a telephoto lens, elements that are far apart can appear closer together, creating a cool effect that wide-angle lenses simply can&#39;t offer.</p><p> So while wide-angle lenses give you the sweeping drama, telephoto lenses showcase the details.每一个在城市景观摄影中都有其自己的位置。 It&#39;s all about choosing the right tool for the story you want to tell.如果您一直回避使用长焦镜头，那么现在是时候好好考虑一下它们了。您可能会对它们如何丰富您的城市景观摄影作品集感到惊讶。 </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-symmetry-for-bold-cityscape-images"> 10. 使用对称性来拍摄大胆的城市景观图像</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-254908" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-254908" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-4.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-4.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-4.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>当你看到完美平衡的东西时，是否曾有过那种刺痛的满足感？ Symmetry can bring that feeling into your cityscape photography.</p><p> It&#39;s easy to shy away from symmetry, to think it clashes with other so-called “rules” of composition, like the rule of thirds.

Try frame-within-a-frame compositional techniques</h3><p> The city environment is brimming with opportunities to experiment with composition, and one method that&#39;s always interesting to play around with is the frame-within-a-frame technique.</p><p>这个想法足够简单：您选择一个主要主题，然后使用另一个场景元素（通常在前景中）将其构架。 Archways, door frames, even gaps between buildings – these can all act as your “frame.”</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254901" style="width:480px"><span class="space" style="width:480px; padding-top:125%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="480" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-8.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-254901" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-8.jpg?resize=480%2C600&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-8.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-8.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-8.jpg?resize=717%2C896&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-8.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>现在，这里有几件事要牢记。 First, picking the right aperture – and hence controlling the depth of field in your image – is essential. This is because you want your foreground frame and your main subject to <em>both</em> be in sharp focus.</p><p>当您启动时，找到正确的框架可能会具有挑战性。您可能会环顾四周，觉得没有什么可以起作用的。但是请记住，框架不必完全包围您的主题。 Even something that partially frames your subject can add depth and draw the viewer&#39;s eye.</p><p> You could also think about the nature of your frame. Is it something rigid and human-made, like a window or a bridge?还是更自然和流畅的东西，例如树枝或反射？ This contrast between the frame and the main subject can make your photo even more intriguing.</p><p> Sometimes, a well-placed frame can dramatically alter the narrative of your photo. A busy street, when viewed through a quiet café window, takes on a different tone. It can emphasize the dichotomy of public and private spaces, the calm amidst the chaos – plus it can just be very eye-catching!</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-use-long-shutter-speeds-to-blur-pedestrians"> 12. Use long shutter speeds to blur pedestrians</h3><p> Many beginner cityscape photographers struggle to deal with pedestrians. After all, if you like the surrounding scene, you may view pedestrians as a distraction.</p><p> And it&#39;s true: Pedestrians can be a distraction when rendered in sharp detail.</p><p> But if you lengthen your shutter speed to 1/5s and beyond, pedestrians will <em>blur</em> . They&#39;ll begin to lose detail, and they&#39;ll appear as an interesting ghostly presence: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cityscapes8.jpg?ssl=1" alt="cityscape photography night people walking through a square" title="cityscapes8.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Note that you can always experiment with different shutter speeds here, and your results will vary depending on the speed of the pedestrians.</p><p> Pro tip: If you want to blur pedestrians but you&#39;re shooting in bright light, I&#39;d recommend mounting a <a aria-label="neutral density filter (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/neutral-density-filters-landscape-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">neutral density filter</a> in front of your lens, which will block light from the sensor and prevent overexposure. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="capture-the-intimate-details"> 13. Capture the intimate details</h3><p> Now let&#39;s shift gears a bit. Cityscape photography isn&#39;t just about capturing wide, sweeping shots. Just as landscape photographers occasionally focus on tiny details within a larger vista, you can do the same in the city.</p><p> Turn your lens to details that strike you as moving or powerful. Get up close and capture them. A weathered door. A vibrant graffiti. A pigeon perched on a windowsill. They all have a story to tell.</p><p> Textures can be incredibly striking, too. The sleek glass of skyscrapers. The rough brickwork of older buildings. The faded flyers plastered on utility poles. The crushed soda can on the sidewalk. These details, though often overlooked, can provide an intimate view of city life.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254902" style="width:480px"><span class="space" style="width:480px; padding-top:125%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="480" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-254902" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=480%2C600&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=717%2C896&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-5.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> It&#39;s not just about what the items <em>are</em> , but how they contribute to your composition. The play of light and shadow. The interesting shapes and forms. The textures and colors. The contrasts and harmonies. Arrange all these elements as if you&#39;re creating an abstract shot out of shapes; that way, you can create a compelling composition that <em>also</em> speaks to the nature of the city.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-if-you-can-t-use-a-tripod-then-improvise"> 14. If you can&#39;t use a tripod, then improvise</h3><p> While tripods are allowed in most places, certain areas – such as city parks, business plazas, and city observation decks – may have a “no tripod” rule. (Alternatively, they may require you to pay to bring in a tripod; it&#39;s up to you to decide whether this is worth the money.)</p><p> Before heading to a new location, I recommend you call ahead to find out whether tripods are allowed. And if they <em>aren&#39;t</em> , don&#39;t give up; just be prepared to do your best with what you have.</p><p> For instance, you might bring a hard-shelled backpack, or look for tables, pillars, benches, and anything else on location that is flat and safe.</p><p> Then position your camera stably and safely, and use a remote release or self-timer to trigger the shutter. While you won&#39;t have the same level of compositional flexibility offered by an <em>actual</em> tripod, you can still get great results, even at night: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cityscapes9.jpg?ssl=1" alt="cityscape photography" title="cityscapes9.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-don-t-be-afraid-to-shoot-in-bad-weather"> 15.

Use a waterproof cover to protect your camera and lens, and never change lenses out in the open. Also, be sure to wear a coat of your own, and if things get really bad – for instance, you see lightning – then head inside.

Seek out compositions that include water and city structures. And return to the same location under varying conditions if you can. A sunny day will give you crisp, well-lit shots. On an overcast day, you might catch the city in a more introspective mood. Early mornings can reveal a city waking up with the first rays of sun glinting off the water.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-hdr-as-needed"> 17. Use HDR as needed</h3><p> Cityscape photography often involves capturing contrasting elements, such as dark buildings against brighter skies or radiant electric lights adorning buildings at night. These scenarios can be tough to successfully expose as it&#39;s challenging to maintain detail in <em>both</em> the highlights and the shadows within a single frame.</p><p> Enter HDR, or high dynamic range imaging. It&#39;s a technique that can be a big help when faced with such challenges, and while it can be a bit advanced, the results are often worth it.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254904" style="width:480px"><span class="space" style="width:480px; padding-top:125%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="480" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-1-2.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-254904" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-1-2.jpg?resize=480%2C600&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-1-2.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-1-2.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-1-2.jpg?resize=717%2C896&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-1-2.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> HDR involves capturing multiple shots at different exposures: One for the bright sky, one for the darker buildings, and so on. Later, you can blend these shots to create a final image that retains detail across the entire dynamic range of the scene.</p><p> Yes, HDR might seem intimidating at first. It requires patience and a bit of technical know-how.

Stay safe</h3><p> Safety isn&#39;t something to gloss over when you&#39;re out capturing the pulse of the city through your lens. You&#39;re carrying equipment that&#39;s not only valuable in a monetary sense but is also crucial for your craft. Here&#39;s how to mitigate risks and protect your gear and yourself.</p><p> Firstly, pay close attention to your surroundings. Urban environments are dynamic, and things can change quickly. A location that feels safe during the day may not be so nice when the night falls. Always trust your instincts.如果感觉有什么不对劲，那很可能就是这样。 Your shots aren&#39;t worth compromising your safety.</p><p> Now, let&#39;s talk about keeping your gear safe. The temptation to take your eyes off your bag is real, especially when you&#39;re focused on capturing the perfect frame. Don&#39;t give in. Make it a habit to use bags that you can sling across your body and ensure they remain in your field of vision at all times.</p><p> Also, don&#39;t flaunt your gear unnecessarily. Be discreet when changing lenses or memory cards. The less attention you draw to your equipment, the better.</p><p> If you want to shoot cities at night, I&#39;d really recommend you team up. Not only does this add an extra layer of safety, but it&#39;s also a great way to share tips and tricks, enhancing the overall experience. And if you do prefer to go out alone, informing someone about your whereabouts is never a bad idea.</p><p> Lastly, consider insuring your gear. Photography equipment is a significant investment, and in the unfortunate event of theft or damage, insurance will be your financial safety net. Look into specialized photography insurance policies that cover a range of situations!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cityscape-photography-tips-final-words"> Cityscape photography tips: final words</h2><p> You&#39;ve just taken a deep dive into the world of cityscape photography, unraveled its mysteries, and gained invaluable insights.

If you can read a histogram, you can quickly and accurately check the exposure of your image while out in the field or when editing at home. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-read-a-histogram-step-by-step"> How to read a histogram: step by step</h2><p> As I explained, a histogram is a graph – which represents the pixels in an image, like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-95300" style="width:374px"><span class="space" style="width:374px; padding-top:66.84%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="374" height="250" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/histogram-info.jpg?resize=374%2C250&#038;ssl=1" alt="histogram-info" class="wp-image-95300" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/histogram-info.jpg?w=374&amp;ssl=1 374w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/histogram-info.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/histogram-info.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by Anne McKinnell</figcaption></figure></div><p> The left side of the graph represents the blacks or shadows, the right side of the graph represents the highlights or bright areas, and the middle section represents the midtones of the photo.</p><p> The graph peaks represent the number of pixels of a particular tone (with each peak corresponding to a different tonal value). So a peak at the right side of the histogram (such as in the example histogram above) indicates a large volume of bright pixels in the image. Whereas a peak at the left side of the histogram indicates a large volume of dark pixels in the image.</p><p> Here&#39;s how I recommend reading a new histogram: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="step-look-at-the-overall-curve-of-the-graph">步骤1：<strong> </strong>Look at the overall curve of the graph</h3><p> Is the histogram skewed to the right? Skewed to the left? Or just generally centered?</p><p> A left-skewed histogram often (but not always!) indicates underexposure, as the shot is full of dark pixels.</p><p> A right-skewed histogram often (but not always!) indicates overexposure, as the shot is full of light pixels.</p><p> And a balanced, generally centered histogram tends to indicate a beautifully detailed, well-exposed image, because the shot is full of midtones. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="step-look-at-the-ends-of-the-histogram"> Step 2: Look at the ends of the histogram</h3><p> A histogram with peaks pressed up against the graph “walls” indicates a loss of information, which is nearly always bad.</p><p> So check both the right and left ends of the histogram. Look for any clipping – highlight clipping along the right side, and shadow clipping along the left side. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-will-a-histogram-tell-you"> What will a histogram tell you?</h3><p> A careful analysis of a histogram will tell you two things:</p><ol><li> Whether an image is broadly well-exposed</li><li> Whether an image has clipped tones</li></ol><p> You can tell that an image is well-exposed if it&#39;s balanced toward the center of the frame, with no obvious skew. Ideally, the graph is spread across the entire histogram, from edge to edge – but without edge <em>peaks</em> , which indicate clipping.</p><p> Here&#39;s an example of a well-exposed histogram: </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-40436 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-40436" style="width:222px"><span class="space" style="width:222px; padding-top:63.96%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="222" height="142" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ideal.png?resize=222%2C142&#038;ssl=1" alt="an ideal histogram" class="wp-image-40436" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ideal.png?w=222&amp;ssl=1 222w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ideal.png?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 222px) 100vw, 222px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This is how an ideal histogram might look: evenly distributed and not up the sides, stretching across the entire graph.</figcaption></figure></div><p> If your histogram looks like the one displayed above, then your exposure is likely perfect and requires no adjustment.</p><p> However, if the graph is skewed to the right and/or includes peaking against the right end, it&#39;s a sign you should reduce your exposure (try boosting the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> ) and retake the image: </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-40439 is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-40439" style="width:208px"><span class="space" style="width:208px; padding-top:60.1%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="208" height="125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/over-exp.jpeg?resize=208%2C125&#038;ssl=1" alt="an overexposed histogram" class="wp-image-40439" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/over-exp.jpeg?w=208&amp;ssl=1 208w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/over-exp.jpeg?resize=206%2C125&amp;ssl=1 206w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/over-exp.jpeg?resize=207%2C125&amp;ssl=1 207w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> And if the graph is skewed to the left and/or includes peaking against the left end, it&#39;s a sign you should increase your exposure (try dropping the shutter speed or increasing the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> ) and retake the image: </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-40440 is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-40440" style="width:435px"><span class="space" style="width:435px; padding-top:42.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="435" height="185" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/histogram-underexposed.png?resize=435%2C185&#038;ssl=1" alt="an underexposed histogram" class="wp-image-40440" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/histogram-underexposed.png?w=435&amp;ssl=1 435w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/histogram-underexposed.png?resize=300%2C128&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="histogram-pitfalls-and-mistakes"> Histogram pitfalls and mistakes</h2><p> In the previous section, I talked all about ideal histograms and how you can use a histogram to determine the perfect exposure for a scene.</p><p> But while this is <em>generally</em> true, and the histogram guidelines I shared above are <em>generally</em> reliable, you may run into three issues: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="your-scene-may-be-naturally-darker-or-lighter-than-middle-gray"> 1. Your scene may be naturally darker or lighter than middle gray</h3><p> A well-balanced, unskewed histogram is ideal for images that include plenty of midtones and are generally centered around midtone detail.</p><p> But certain scenes just don&#39;t look like this. For instance, if you photograph a black rock against a night sky, you might end up with a significantly skewed histogram, even if you&#39;ve captured all the detail correctly: </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-40437 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-40437" style="width:219px"><span class="space" style="width:219px; padding-top:64.38%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="219" height="141" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dark-subject.png?resize=219%2C141&#038;ssl=1" alt="a darker histogram" class="wp-image-40437" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dark-subject.png?w=219&amp;ssl=1 219w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dark-subject.png?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 219px) 100vw, 219px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This is a histogram for a dark subject.

You can also see the histogram afterward when you review the photo on your LCD screen.</p><p> Either way, you <em>must</em> use the histogram to check your exposure while you&#39;re in the field. That way, you have an opportunity to make another exposure while you are still out with your camera.</p><p> Another key point: Don&#39;t rely on your LCD to give you feedback about exposure. It&#39;s great for checking composition and focus, but not exposure. That&#39;s because the brightness of your LCD doesn&#39;t correspond perfectly with the brightness of your image since you can adjust the brightness of your LCD.</p><p> For example, you can brighten the LCD so you can see it more easily outside on a sunny day. But then if you <em>don&#39;t</em> reduce the brightness and you look at the LCD at night, your images are going to appear super bright when they are not.</p><p> The histogram is also available to you while post-processing your image. Use it to see where adjustments need to be made <em>and</em> to ensure you don&#39;t create areas that are too bright or too dark while processing your images. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="additional-resources-on-histograms"> Additional resources on histograms</h2><p> This video does a great job of explaining how the histogram on your camera works and how to read it: </p><p><iframe loading="lazy" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/CIbcS6Qkel8" width="601" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p><p> I do slightly disagree with his tip that having a mountain in the center is the best option, as it does depend on the subject and your artistic vision! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="histogram-myths-and-misconceptions"> Histogram myths and misconceptions</h2><p> There have been dozens of articles and videos published about the purpose and interpretation of the histogram in post-production. Unfortunately, many of them contain significant errors.</p><p> I&#39;ve been adjusting images for decades – long before the histogram graph was publicly introduced! – and I&#39;ve worked with it every day since it became popular, so I&#39;d like to weigh in on rumors and clarify some facts. Once you understand the histogram&#39;s primary function and limitations, you&#39;ll find it to be a solid feedback resource. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="myth-the-vertical-lines-reflect-image-contrast"> Myth 1: The vertical lines reflect image contrast</h3><p> <strong>FACT:</strong> The horizontal axis does reflect the image&#39;s tonal range (from the darkest tones to the lightest), though the vertical lines reveal little about its contrast. Actually, the horizontal distribution is what reveals the overall contrast. Tones located mostly on the right reveal very light (or high-key) images, while tones favoring the left side are darker (low-key) images.</p><p> The extreme right side wall represents white and the extreme left wall of the graph represents solid black. The highest (vertical) peak of the graph merely indicates the highest ratio of pixels containing that particular color tone as it relates to the others. The lowest vertical level on the graph indicates the tone color with the least number of pixels in the image. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="myth-there-is-one-best-histogram-shape"> Myth 2: There is one <em>best</em> histogram shape</h3><p> <strong>FACT:</strong> There are as many histogram shapes as there are images. There is no such thing as a good or bad histogram, and there is no such thing as an ideal histogram. Because these graphs reflect each image&#39;s distribution of tones, you&#39;ll be hard-pressed to find any two that are alike. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Histogram-Shapes.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Histogram Shapes" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Only images containing mostly midtones will actually display a true bell (mountain) shape on the histogram as in the top left.

In truth, however, there are only 256 vertical bars presented in the histogram. Each horizontal bar represents less than one-half of one percent (0.4%) of the total tonal range (100% / 256 = 0.390625%). Even if a photo contains a very gradual change in tones across a wide area (like an unclouded sky), your eyes will only perceive “banding” if the JPEG image has been degraded by repeated “Save” functions.</p><p> JPEG images contain a maximum of 256 levels (8 bits) of tone between black (solid color) and white (no color). Once JPEG files have been opened and saved several times, the number of tone levels can become significantly reduced and tone-banding may occur. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/News-Journal.jpg?ssl=1" alt="News Journal - Shedding Light on the Histogram - How to Use it in Post-Production" title="News Journal.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/News-Journal-Gappy.jpg?ssl=1" alt="News Journal Gappy - Shedding Light on the Histogram - How to Use it in Post-Production" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> These two histograms appear quite different, though the images are very similar.

Since editing software histograms are based on a horizontal graph only 256 pixels wide, each representation is a basic overview at best. If the full range of possible colors were truly represented by a single graph, the chart would occupy the wall of a good-sized room!</p><p> Let me break down the numbers. This 256 pixel-wide graph portrays each image&#39;s potential color range using an 8-bit (256 level) interpolation. This means that all 16.8 million possible colors are represented in a mere 256 horizontal point histogram. Tones change levels in 0.4% increments. The graph significantly exaggerates the difference between minor shifts in tonal value. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/256-Pixel-Histogram2.jpg?ssl=1" alt="256 Pixel Histogram 2" title="256 Pixel Histogram2.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image from Herb Paynter</figcaption></figure></div><p> Human eyes barely perceive a half-percent (0.5%) difference between tones, so 256 levels in a JPEG image provide the illusion of continuous tone. This means the histogram uses less than two vertical columns to represent a single percent change in value. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/57-58-percent.jpg?ssl=1" alt="57 58 percent" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The two patches on the bottom (marked “57%” and “58%”) are separated by only 1% in tone, though your eyes may have trouble seeing the difference.

There&#39;s something truly magical about witnessing a fireworks display, and as a photography enthusiast, you can&#39;t help but feel the burning desire to capture those fleeting moments forever.</p><p> However, shooting fireworks can be incredibly challenging and require some real technical finesse. That&#39;s where this article comes in handy; I explore a handful of effective approaches to help you master the art of fireworks photography and capture awe-inspiring shots.</p><p> Specifically, I share:</p><ul><li> The best settings for fireworks images</li><li> Essential fireworks photo gear</li><li> A simple way to prevent image blur</li><li>多得多！</li></ul><p> Just a quick note before we get started: Please remember that if you&#39;ve never tried fireworks before, it does depend heavily on trial and error. I&#39;ve made a lot of mistakes myself before I got any images that I was happy to show anyone.  Each time I photograph fireworks, there&#39;s always an element of unpredictability, so you have to learn to adapt, learn from your own mistakes, and do it again.</p><p> Ready to learn how to photograph fireworks?那么让我们开始吧！ </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="bring-the-right-equipment"> 1. Bring the right equipment</h2><p> What will you need to make good fireworks photos? Let&#39;s break down the basic equipment needs: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-dslr-or-mirrorless-model-for-more-flexibility"> Use a DSLR or mirrorless model for more flexibility</h3><p> You can take fireworks photos with a smartphone camera if that&#39;s all you have. However, the results won&#39;t be quite as impressive, and I&#39;d therefore recommend you invest in (at least) an entry-level DSLR or mirrorless camera.</p><p> Also, be sure to have a good-sized storage card, as well as a spare battery or two, as you&#39;ll usually take lots of shots at a fireworks show. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-zoom-lens-for-compositional-variety"> Use a zoom lens for compositional variety</h3><p> Lens choice largely depends on how close you will be to the fireworks launch location.  If you are close, you may need a wide-angle lens to keep the larger bursts in the frame. If, however, you are a long distance from the show or want to compress the apparent distance between your foreground object and the sky bursts, a telephoto lens might be in order.</p><p> My go-to lens for firework photography is a <a href="https://geni.us/dPSCanonEF24-105F4ISII" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenersponsored nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="ek-link">Canon EF 24-105mm f/4L IS</a> , which covers a good range. Note that you don&#39;t need a particularly fast (ie, wide-aperture) lens as you will be working with mid to small apertures and longer shutter speeds. Of course, it&#39;s worth using a lens that offers consistently crisp results, so don&#39;t skimp on this piece of equipment! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-tripod-to-keep-your-camera-still"> Use a tripod to keep your camera still</h3><p> To capture sharp fireworks shots, it is crucial to keep your camera perfectly still, and this generally requires the use of a sturdy tripod.</p><p> Why is a tripod so important? Fireworks displays occur at night, when lighting conditions are challenging, and long shutter speeds are necessary (more on this later!). When you&#39;re capturing a lengthy exposure, even the slightest camera shake can result in blurry images – unless your camera is set up on a rock-solid tripod, that is.</p><p> Ensure that you set up your tripod on a stable surface and shield it from any potential wind. If you don&#39;t already own a tripod, there are affordable options available, including some <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-travel-tripods/" target="_blank" aria-label="portable travel tripods (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">portable travel tripods</a> . If you don&#39;t have the time or money to purchase a tripod, you can always improvise by placing your camera on the ground or a table.</p><p> Note that shooting with a tripod offers additional benefits: It enables you to try <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/getting-real-hdr/" target="_blank" aria-label="HDR bracketing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">HDR bracketing</a> , and it encourages you to compose more deliberately and thoughtfully by slowing down the process.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174491" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:56.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="844" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photograph-fireworks-tripod.jpg?resize=1500%2C844&#038;ssl=1" alt="photograph fireworks tripod" class="wp-image-174491" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photograph-fireworks-tripod.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photograph-fireworks-tripod.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photograph-fireworks-tripod.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photograph-fireworks-tripod.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photograph-fireworks-tripod.jpg?resize=717%2C403&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-remote-release-to-further-reduce-camera-shake"> Use a remote release to further reduce camera shake</h3><p> Even with your camera securely mounted on a sturdy tripod, there&#39;s a risk of camera shake when you press the shutter button, resulting in blurry shots. This is why a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/8-benefits-using-wireless-remote-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="remote release (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">remote release</a> is an essential firework photography accessory.</p><p> A remote release is a wireless device that connects to your camera, allowing you to trigger the shutter from a distance. By using the remote, you eliminate the need to physically touch the camera, ensuring maximum stability and sharpness in your images.</p><p> Happily, investing in a remote release won&#39;t break the bank (they&#39;re quite affordable)! However, if you don&#39;t have one or prefer not to purchase it, you can get a similar result by activating your camera&#39;s two-second self-timer. While this method isn&#39;t ideal – you&#39;ll need to anticipate the firework bursts and fire the shutter two seconds in advance – it can still get the job done. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="scout-the-location-in-advance"> 2. Scout the location in advance</h2><p> When it comes to capturing stunning fireworks photographs, preparation is key. Firework displays take place after sunset, and if you&#39;ve ever tried to compose in the dark, you&#39;ll know that it is <em>hard</em> . To ensure you make the most of the limited time you have to photograph the spectacle, it is crucial to scout the location in advance.</p><p> Visiting the location earlier in the day allows you to familiarize yourself with the surroundings and identify potential vantage points that will offer breathtaking perspectives. Seek out locations that allow for expansive and sweeping shots, where you can capture the full grandeur of the display. Consider the angles, sightlines, and potential obstacles that may hinder your view or introduce unwanted distractions. By doing so, you can position yourself to capture the magic as it unfolds.</p><p> Note, however, that while scouting the location in advance provides you with valuable insights, it doesn&#39;t mean you have to rigidly stick to predetermined compositions. Embrace the spontaneity of the moment and be open to improvisation. Fireworks are dynamic, and each explosion brings unique patterns and colors to the sky. Use your scouting knowledge as a foundation, but allow yourself to experiment and adapt on the spot! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-low-iso-for-the-cleanest-shots"> 3. Use a low ISO for the cleanest shots</h2><p> High <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISOs (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISOs</a> create brighter exposures, but they also create noise, which reduces image quality and looks plain <em>bad</em> .</p><p> So whenever possible, use your camera&#39;s lowest native ISO setting. And only raise the ISO if your exposures are turning out too dark.</p><p> I recommend using ISO 100 or 200, and this is for a couple of reasons. First, the higher the ISO you use, the more noise you&#39;ll introduce in your images. Noise also tends to live in blue areas of images, and nighttime has a <em>lot</em> of blue, so that compounds the issue. Plus, long exposures tend to increase noise.</p><p> Bottom line: You should work especially hard to minimize noise in your fireworks photos, and that involves using a low ISO. Fortunately, fireworks tend to be very bright, so as long as you use a tripod, you probably won&#39;t need to raise your ISO. Therefore, I&#39;d recommend setting it to ISO 100 and only raising it if you absolutely need a boost.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174493" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/low-iso-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="low iso for fireworks" class="wp-image-174493" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/low-iso-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/low-iso-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/low-iso-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/low-iso-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/low-iso-for-fireworks.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shoot-in-raw">4. Shoot in RAW</h2><p> For fireworks photographers, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/raw-vs-jpeg/" target="_blank" aria-label="photographing in RAW (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">photographing in RAW</a> is a game-changer. While beginners may opt for JPEG files due to their simplicity and immediate usability, you won&#39;t be able to realize the true potential of your fireworks photographs without working in RAW.</p><p> JPEG files may seem appealing at first, with their smaller size and lack of post-processing requirements. However, they limit your creative freedom when it comes to refining your images. On the other hand, RAW files offer an abundance of possibilities during post-processing. These versatile files allow you to recover details hidden in shadows and highlights, ensuring that every element is faithfully preserved. With RAW, you also have the ability to fine-tune colors and tones, enhancing the overall impact of your firework photographs.</p><p> While it&#39;s true that RAW files require post-processing before sharing them on websites or social media platforms, the editing process can be remarkably quick. Software programs like Adobe Lightroom offer intuitive interfaces that allow you to quickly convert RAW shots into shareable files.</p><p> So don&#39;t let the additional workflow step deter you from shooting in RAW; it&#39;s an investment that <em>really</em> pays off.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="switch-off-your-flash"> 5. Switch off your flash</h2><p> It&#39;s simple, really:</p><p> An on-camera flash (or even an off-camera flash) can only illuminate the area a handful of meters in front of you. Therefore, <em>a flash cannot affect a firework</em> , and turning on your camera&#39;s flash will only serve to waste battery.</p><p> Plus, if your camera uses a flash metering system, an active flash will cause the fireworks to come out dark. And constant flashing may even frustrate other folks trying to watch the fireworks.</p><p> So switch your flash off. And use the long-exposure technique I discuss below! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="turn-off-long-exposure-noise-reduction"> 6. Turn off long exposure noise reduction</h2><p> Many modern cameras have a noise reduction feature, which after the first exposure, takes a second “black frame” exposure, detecting the noise and then subtracting that from the initial exposure. It can work well in some situations, but here&#39;s the thing:</p><p> The second exposure takes as long as the first, and if you&#39;re making multi-second exposures, your camera will be busy working, and you&#39;ll be missing subsequent firework bursts.</p><p>所以把它关掉。 You&#39;ll generally be using a low ISO with minimal noise anyway, and the delay in being able to make more shots isn&#39;t worth the benefit.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="do-not-use-live-view"> 7. Do <em>not</em> use Live View</h2><p> Live View lets you preview your exposures on the camera LCD before you actually press the shutter button. It comes in handy in a lot of situations, but it&#39;ll eat up your battery fast.</p><p> My recommendation: Save your battery for actually shooting and set up your shot using the eyecup viewfinder.</p><p> (That said, if you use a mirrorless camera, Live View is actually <em>less</em> energy-intensive than work via the electronic viewfinder. Therefore, if you shoot mirrorless, using Live View is a good idea!) </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-smaller-apertures-for-the-best-fireworks-photography"> 8.

But what aperture is right for photographing fireworks?</p><p> If you&#39;re capturing fireworks that are far off in the distance and you have no foreground subjects, then you can get away with pretty much any aperture, from wide options like f/2.8 to narrow options like f/16.</p><p> However, if your composition features foreground elements or the fireworks are relatively close to your position, then you&#39;ll want to use a narrow aperture (anywhere between f/8 and f/16 is good).</p><p> Plus, those apertures are pretty optimal for fireworks as the light streaks are controlled by the size of the aperture.  Closing down more will make the light trails thinner, opening up more will make them wider and possible too over exposed.  Do some tests but all the times I&#39;ve done fireworks I keep coming back to f8 as my preference.</p><p> The narrower aperture will widen the depth of field, ensuring that the fireworks <em>and</em> the rest of the scene turn out sharp. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-longer-shutter-speed-but-dont-let-it-go-too-long"> 9.

Here are a few quick tips to help you select compositions in advance:</p><ul><li><strong>拍摄前观看几爆</strong>。 In general, each new firework will come from (roughly) the same spot, so by observing the skies, you can get a sense of where to train your camera. You can also get a sense of how long you have between bursts;这样，您可以准备在每次新爆炸之前发射快门。</li><li> <strong>Decide whether to shoot vertically</strong> <strong>or horizontally</strong> .您可以垂直捕获烟花（肖像取向）或水平（景观取向）。 Both can work for fireworks photography, but I personally prefer a vertical perspective – after all, there&#39;s a lot of vertical firework movement!但是，如果您在使用广角镜的大镜头之后，水平镜头很不错。</li><li> <strong>Refine your framing</strong> .找到一个不错的构图后，请勿单击一杆，然后再进入下一帧。 Instead, see if you can improve the result by moving to one side, getting down low, getting up high, etc. You might be surprised by what you can create when you really dedicate yourself to working the scene. </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="enhance-your-firework-compositions-with-foreground-interest"> 12. Enhance your firework compositions with foreground interest</h2><p> Beginner firework photographers often just point their camera at the sky and shoot away – but while this can produce nice results, if your goal is to create captivating images that leave a lasting impact, incorporating an interesting foreground is a great idea.</p><p> You see, by seamlessly blending a magnificent sky explosion with a compelling foreground, you offer viewers a visual journey. They can start by appreciating the foreground&#39;s charm before engaging with the mesmerizing backdrop.</p><p>请注意，您可以将各种元素包括在您的前景中：建筑物，山脉，延伸到远处甚至游乐园的山丘。选择是您的，但我鼓励您仔细考虑哪些前景元素将补充烟花汇演。</p><p> By the way, if you can include foreground elements that offer <a aria-label="leading lines (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-leading-lines-for-better-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">leading lines</a> , the results will be especially spectacular. These lines can create a visual pathway that not only connects the foreground and the fireworks but also enhances the overall composition! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="include-reflections-in-your-firework-compositions"> 13. Include reflections in your firework compositions</h2><p> Looking to elevate your firework shots from ordinary to extraordinary? Incorporating reflections into your compositions can provide that extra touch of brilliance.</p><p> You&#39;ll need to strategically position yourself to include a reflective surface with the frame, but finding a suitable reflective object is easier than you might think.虽然湖泊和池塘总是可以工作，但您也可以利用水坑，光滑的汽车表面甚至太阳镜镜片来释放创造力。</p><p>我还鼓励您尝试不同的作品。例如，尝试将地平线放置在框架的不同区域，并查看您对结果的看法。死去的中心地平线将产生充满张力的对称镜头，而位于框架上部或下三分之一的地平线将以动态和迷人的感觉为您的图像注入。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="include-people-in-your-images"> 14. Include people in your images</h2><p>虽然仅凭大量烟花爆发就可以创造出令人敬畏的图像，但将人们纳入您的作品中可以将烟花的照片提升到新的高度。</p><p>首先，包括人物在镜框中的人物将引入一种规模感，强调在夜空中展开令人眼花show灯的宏伟。 Additionally, people can act as foreground interest, adding depth and narrative to your photographs.</p><p>另外，您可以用人们讲故事；一个孤独的人物凝视着烟花的敬畏之情会唤起一种奇妙的感觉，而一群朋友或一对夫妇牵手可以描绘出共同的欢乐和庆祝时刻。</p><p>在包括烟花摄影中的人时，要探索的一个令人着迷的元素是焦点之间的相互作用。 Experiment with different approaches to create varied effects. You can choose to focus on the fireworks, allowing the people in the foreground to become slightly blurred – or you can focus on the people in the foreground, intentionally blurring the fireworks in the background, creating an ethereal and dreamlike atmosphere. Both techniques can yield compelling results, so don&#39;t hesitate to try different focal points and see which resonates with your artistic vision! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="experiment-with-different-focal-lengths"> 15.

So decide if you have already got enough necessary shots before you try it and whether the show will last long enough for some experimentation.</p><p> If you&#39;re game, here&#39;s how you do it:</p><ul><li> You will need your hands free for this, and you&#39;ll want to look through the viewfinder or perhaps use Live View, so using the remote release probably isn&#39;t going to work. Instead, set your shutter speed for about 8-10 seconds, leaving all the other camera settings where they were.</li><li> Set your lens to manual focus, then focus on the spot where the fireworks will burst. Turn the ring so things are out of focus.</li><li> Just as a firework explodes, fire the shutter and smoothly turn the focus right back to the focus point. You must get the fireworks in focus before the exposure is complete, but if you finish early, that&#39;s okay. </li></ul><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-173368 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/make-better-fireworks-photos-bloom-technique-02.jpg?ssl=1" alt="better fireworks photos" class="wp-image-173368" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Two images using the defocus-to-focus technique.

Go from focused to unfocused, zoom in or out during the exposure, or maybe take the camera off the tripod and move it during the exposure to make light trails. Play and see what you like.</p><p> Just remember that the duration of the show is limited, so try some experiments but also be sure you have some solid keepers.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-the-black-hat-trick">22. Use the black hat trick</h2><p> Here&#39;s a handy trick that can produce very artistic results:</p><ul><li> Have a hat, preferably one that&#39;s dark and opaque.</li><li> Put the hat over the front of the lens.</li><li> Have the camera in Bulb mode, and just before the firework launches, click open the shutter.</li><li> Quickly but gently – so as not to bump the camera – remove the hat while the firework explodes.</li><li> Leave the shutter open and carefully replace the hat. Repeat, removing and replacing the hat for multiple fireworks bursts. (You may need to have a smaller aperture or lower ISO to do this as you will be building up exposure brightness with each additional firework added).</li><li> Unlock the remote and close the shutter when you&#39;ve done all you want.</li></ul><p> What you&#39;re doing is making a multiple-exposure image in-camera. Of course, you can always capture several images and blend them during post-processing instead! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="experiment-and-evaluate-your-results"> 23.

Happily, this list features plenty of options worth considering.</p><p> I&#39;ve included some top-notch professional models, but you should bear in mind that the best cameras for portraiture aren&#39;t necessarily the most expensive; hence, you&#39;ll also find some entry-level cameras and budget-conscious recommendations.</p><p>所以，事不宜迟，让我们开始吧！</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="canon-eos-r"> 1.

For those who like to make action portraits, you get up to 12 fps continuous shooting via the mechanical shutter, and this jumps to 20 fps continuous shooting when using the electronic shutter. The autofocus has Eye/Face/Head recognition, and its 1053 AF zones use 100% of the AF area to ensure the sharpest images.</p><p> For maximum flexibility, the EOS R5 has up to 8 stops of shake correction; that way you can shoot handheld portraits even in low light. It also has dual memory card slots, an optional battery grip, the ability to voice-tag photos and videos, and many other features that make it the perfect companion for your photoshoots. And – for those who like to work outdoors – it&#39;s weather, drip, and dust sealed.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="nikon-z-ii"> 2.

While its 24 MP sensor can&#39;t compete with the R5&#39;s high-megapixel capabilities, the Z6 II is packed full of features, including a beautiful 3.69M-dot electronic viewfinder that offers a top-notch shooting experience.</p><p> Portrait shooters will appreciate the solid subject-tracking autofocus, which is especially handy when working in faster-paced shooting scenarios (though it&#39;s also highly convenient for more conventional portrait sessions, too). The Z6 II also boasts outstanding image quality, and its low-light performance is spectacular, making it perfect for nighttime and indoor photoshoots. The in-body image stabilization is also a major benefit if you like to shoot handheld in darker scenarios.</p><p> While the Z6 II doesn&#39;t come cheap, it&#39;s not obscenely expensive, either, making it a good pick for serious hobbyists and up-and-coming professionals.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="nikon-z"> 3.

Priced under $1000, it&#39;s an attractive option for those wanting to make the jump from APS-C to full-frame. The 24 MP sensor delivers high-quality images across various portrait scenarios, and I&#39;m a fan of the Z5&#39;s viewfinder, which boasts a 3.6M-dot resolution that outshines the Canon EOS RP&#39;s EVF (on this list below!) for a more immersive and realistic shooting experience.</p><p> What&#39;s more, the Z5 comes with in-body image stabilization and dual card slots – features often found in higher-end models. For photographers who frequently shoot in low-light conditions, the IBIS will be particularly helpful, while the dual-card slots are essential for redundancy when working with clients.</p><p> While the Z5&#39;s 4.5 FPS continuous shooting speed isn&#39;t the fastest, it&#39;s more than sufficient for most portrait sessions. And its compact design is a huge plus for those who prefer a lighter kit and also makes it ideal for on-the-go as well as candid portraits. The Nikon Z5 is a well-rounded camera, offering the benefits of full-frame photography without the hefty price tag; ultimately, it&#39;s a smart choice for portrait hobbyists looking to step up their game.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="canon-eos-rp"> 4.

Priced around $900, body only, it&#39;s an excellent entry point into the world of full-frame photography, even if it struggles to go toe-to-toe with the Nikon Z5 (above).</p><p> Despite its age, the EOS RP&#39;s image quality remains impressive; with its 26 MP sensor, you can expect your portraits to be rich in detail, giving you the flexibility to print your work in large formats without losing any of the fine texture that makes a portrait come alive.</p><p> The EOS RP is relatively compact for a full-frame camera, a trait that is highly valued by portrait photographers who often find themselves in cramped shooting environments. This camera also opens up a world of possibilities with Canons&#39; extensive lens lineup; plenty of EF and RF lenses offer sharpness as well as ultra-wide maximum apertures – a key ingredient for that dreamy, blurred background effect in portraits. When I first got my hands on the EOS RP, its ergonomics were a pleasant surprise; it just feels right in your hands. The viewfinder isn&#39;t as high resolution as I&#39;d like, but it does a decent job, and for casual portrait enthusiasts looking to delve deeper into the craft, the EOS RP strikes a perfect balance between price, performance, and portability.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="canon-eos-d-mark-iv"> 5.

The 5D Mark IV is a professional full-frame camera packing a well-designed 30-megapixel sensor, and as a result, images feature great color depth and <a aria-label="dynamic range (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-dynamic-range-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">dynamic range</a> , even at high <a aria-label="ISOs (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISOs</a> .</p><p> Its AF tracking and AF face detection ensure that you get the sharpest images for both still portraits and action shots, and even if you miss focus by a few millimeters, the Dual Pixel RAW technology allows you to shift the focus in post-processing. For example, if you get the eyelashes sharp instead of the eye, you can make a few adjustments, and – voila! – the eye appears sharp. Another perk of the Dual Pixel RAW tech is the ability to adjust the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" aria-label="bokeh (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">bokeh</a> in the background for a more pleasing effect.</p><p> The camera has a robust build <em>and</em> environmental sealing, which makes it perfect for outdoor portrait sessions. Just remember that it&#39;s not water, dust, or freeze-proof.</p><p> The battery life is around four hours, so you won&#39;t need to worry about interrupting your creative flow. And the 5D Mark IV also features two memory card slots, essential for professionals who need on-the-spot backups of their work.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="nikon-z"> 6.

And its speed and performance make it ideal for those looking to capture more than just posed portraits, so it&#39;s a great choice for photographers looking to delve into more dynamic people photography.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="canon-eos-r"> 13.

The cropped sensor keeps this model in the prosumer or enthusiast category, but that doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t an excellent camera. For some types of portraits – for example, couples or family sessions – you can absolutely do professional work.</p><p> The R10 is still on the newer side, which means it takes advantage of Canon&#39;s more recent technology, including a fantastic 24 MP sensor that captures beautiful images. Autofocus is also impressive; you get 651 focus points plus a host of AF modes, including a powerful face-detection option that&#39;s perfect for keeping subjects in sharp focus even when shooting in tough conditions.</p><p> And dance portrait photographers will love the 15 FPS continuous shooting speeds, which will ensure you can capture even the most fleeting moment. Ergonomics are great, too, thanks to a fully articulating LCD (great for low-angle shots) and a solid-quality electronic viewfinder.</p><p> One of the biggest benefits of the EOS R10 is the access it affords to Canon&#39;s amazing RF-mount lens lineup, which includes plenty of amazing portrait glass. Bonus: Since the camera is so cheap, you&#39;ll have some extra money to splurge on wide-aperture lenses!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="sony-ac"> 14.

It also has a minimum focusing distance of 0.99 feet (0.3 meters) to 1.48 feet (0.45 meters) for detail shots of eyes, hands, and more.</p><p> The autofocus uses Real-Time Tracking, Eye AF, and features a whopping 693 phase-detection points, which cover 93% of the image area, along with 425 contrast-detection points for extreme accuracy even when capturing portraits with busy backgrounds. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="olympus-om-d-e-m-mark-iii"> 15.

However, for long hours of use, you might want to get an external grip; the body is relatively thin and not especially comfortable to hold.</p><p> The E-M5 Mark III is the first model in this series to have on-sensor phase-detect autofocus with face and eye detection, which makes it a great choice for enthusiasts or beginner photographers interested in portrait shooting. And while the camera only offers 20 megapixels, you can use the High-Resolution mode to capture 50 MP JPEGs or 80 MP RAW files.</p><p> And you get plenty more features and creative options, including Pro Capture, which registers up to 14 high-resolution shots with a half-press of the shutter button. That way, when you press the button all the way down, you get a handful of shots taken <em>before</em> your finger fully hammers the shutter (you can choose the best shot later on!).</p><p> While designed for sports photography, Pro Capture is great for working with non-professional models, in case they close their eyes or tense up at the sound of the shutter. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-choose-the-right-portrait-photography-camera"> How to choose the right portrait photography camera</h2><p> Selecting a camera for portrait photography doesn&#39;t have to be an overwhelming task, but it&#39;s essential to keep in mind several key factors that will influence your purchase decision, such as:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="image-quality">画面质量</h3><p>At the core of portrait photography is image quality. Ideally, a camera for this genre should offer a minimum of 20 megapixels, which ensures ample detail for enlargements and prints. More significant than the megapixel count, however, is the sensor size. Full-frame sensors excel in low-light conditions and provide a shallower depth of field effect, crucial for achieving that dreamy background blur prized in portraiture. That said, while full-frame cameras are often regarded as the gold standard for portraits, APS-C cameras are also capable performers, especially when paired with a lens that has a wide maximum aperture.</p><p> In addition to sensor size and resolution, in-body image stabilization (IBIS) is a feature worth considering. IBIS allows you to handhold your camera at slower shutter speeds without sacrificing sharpness and is an invaluable asset when working with natural light. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="autofocusing-performance"> Autofocusing performance</h3><p> The importance of a reliable and accurate autofocus system in portrait photography cannot be overstated. When working with a shallow depth of field – common in portrait work – the margin for error is minimal; a slight mistake can lead to the eyes being out of focus, turning a potentially stunning portrait into a missed opportunity. Hence, it&#39;s crucial to select a camera with a capable autofocusing system.</p><p> Features like Eye AF are especially helpful here. Eye AF technology identifies and locks focus on the subject&#39;s eyes, ensuring critical sharpness where it matters most. This feature becomes even more vital when photographing moving subjects or working in dynamic environments where focusing can be challenging.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="ergonomics">人体工学</h3><p>Ergonomics often get neglected, but comfort in handling can significantly impact your shooting experience, and by extension, the quality of your images. Key ergonomic factors include the design of the camera grip, which should feel secure and comfortable in your hands, and the LCD screen design. A fully articulating or tilting LCD screen offers greater compositional freedom, particularly in challenging shooting angles.</p><p> Another aspect to consider is the viewfinder. A high-resolution electronic viewfinder (EVF) or a nice optical viewfinder can greatly enhance your shooting experience, providing a more accurate and immersive view of your subject. While shooting with the LCD screen is always an option, a quality viewfinder offers a more direct connection with your subject, which is often essential for portrait work.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="lens-compatibility">镜头兼容性</h3><p>In portrait photography, the choice of lenses is as critical as the camera body. <a aria-label="The best portrait lenses (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lens-for-portrait-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">The best portrait lenses</a> typically feature ultra-wide maximum apertures, such as f/2.8, f/1.8, or even wider. These apertures allow for a shallower depth of field so you can highlight your subject against a smoothly blurred background. Therefore, it&#39;s important to ensure that the camera system you choose supports a wide range of high-quality portrait lenses.</p><p> Fortunately, most major camera brands offer an extensive selection of lenses suitable for portrait work. However, it&#39;s still important to verify that your chosen camera is compatible with the lenses you intend to use, especially if you&#39;re looking for specific focal lengths or apertures.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="price">价格</h3><p>Last, price is an inevitable consideration in the camera selection process. While higher-priced cameras often come with advanced features, it&#39;s important to balance your budget with your actual photography needs. Cameras under $1000, like the Canon EOS R50, are capable of producing stunning portraits and shouldn&#39;t be overlooked!</p><p> Additionally, the most expensive camera isn&#39;t always the best choice for every photographer. Assess your specific needs, such as the kind of portraits you intend to shoot and whether you plan to make large prints. In many cases, a camera with a moderately high-resolution sensor will suffice, and investing in a high-resolution model may only result in unnecessarily large files without a useful gain in image quality. Remember, a significant portion of your budget should also be allocated to lenses and other essential accessories, which are equally important in the art of portrait photography. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-best-camera-for-portrait-photography-final-words"> The best camera for portrait photography: final words</h2><p> As you can see, there are many wonderful portrait cameras – but you need to pick the one that&#39;s right for your needs.</p><p> So ask yourself: Do I want a mirrorless camera or a DSLR? What type of sensor do I want? From there, you can start to narrow down your choices depending on your style, the type of portraiture you like, and personal preference.</p><p> Now over to you:</p><p> <em>Which portrait photography camera is your favorite?
