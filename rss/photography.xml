Grab one (or more) of these accessories, and you&#39;ll be able to capture jaw-dropping images beyond your wildest dreams.</p><p> (Am I exaggerating? Honestly, I don&#39;t think so. Neutral density filters are a <em>huge</em> deal.)</p><p> But what makes ND filters so special?</p><p> ND filters are basically dark pieces of glass that go in front of your lens and prevent light from hitting your camera sensor. In other words, ND filters <em>block out the light</em> , which lets you lengthen your shutter speed while retaining a balanced exposure.</p><p> You see, as a landscape photographer without an ND filter, you&#39;ll often be using a <a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> between 1/2s and 1/125s (assuming you&#39;re shooting with a relatively narrow <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> of f/13 or so, which is generally a good idea).</p><p> At times, you may want to lengthen your shutter speed for creative effect – so that you can blur water, stretch clouds, and create a beautiful ethereal look in your photos. But in most situations, dropping the shutter speed beyond 1/2s or so just can&#39;t be done. The light is too strong; if you try it, you&#39;ll end up with an overexposed image.</p><p> Unless you have an item that can block out the light – such as a neutral density filter! The ND filter will keep your camera from overexposing the scene even when you&#39;re dealing with lots of light. That way, you can push out your shutter speed to 5s, 10s, and more, and you can get the stretchy clouds and blurry water that you&#39;re after.</p><p> Check out the photos below. The first was taken at dusk with a shutter speed of 1/5s. This exposure time was slow enough to introduce some blur into the water (look at the foreground wave), but it wasn&#39;t slow enough to really flatten out the water while making the clouds turn into interesting streaks.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-113207" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:56.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="423" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?resize=750%2C423&#038;ssl=1" alt="relatively short seaside rock exposure" class="wp-image-113207" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-5.jpg?resize=717%2C404&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> But I added a neutral density filter and made the next photo using a shutter speed of 180 seconds.

Don&#39;t just take photos like everyone else</h2><p> Black and white landscape photographer Cole Thompson has an interesting idea. He practices what he calls “photographic abstinence,” where he doesn&#39;t look at the work of other photographers before heading to a new location. The idea is that it enables him to see the landscape through his own eyes without being influenced by other people&#39;s photos of the same elements.</p><p> I&#39;ve never taken this idea to its extreme. I believe it&#39;s important to research an area before you go; that way, you can find its most photogenic parts and avoid boring areas. But this does lead to a problem: The most powerful images you see tend to stick in your mind. The natural tendency is to want to create similar images – so if you spend time researching locations, you&#39;ll often end up capturing photos that look like everybody else&#39;s.</p><p> I encourage you to push back against this tendency! Recognize that certain subjects are photographed in particular ways. Use that knowledge to capture images that are different – images that are truly <em>you</em> .</p><p> Let me give you an example. A few years ago, I visited the Playa de las Catedrales (Cathedral Beach) in northern Spain. Search for it on Google or 500px, and most photos will look something like this, showing the cathedral-like arches for which the beach is named:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-113209" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=750%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="arches in black and white" class="wp-image-113209" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/black-white-landscape-tips-7.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Anybody who visits the beach will naturally want to take photos of the arches.

The files don&#39;t include any color information, which means that images can become pretty confusing. Various subjects blend into one another, and the viewer may struggle to understand the scene.</p><p> Now, one way to deal with this tendency is to include plenty of tonal contrast. It&#39;s a good technique, and I highly recommend it. But if you want to <em>really</em> elevate your B&amp;W photos, you should also aim to cut down on extraneous elements in your compositions. That way, the viewer will know exactly where to focus – and they&#39;ll be able to instantly interpret the shot.</p><p> So before capturing a new image, ask yourself: Does the frame include any elements that might distract the viewer? Is the viewer able to clearly identify the main subject? Make sure that every part of the scene contributes to the composition.</p><p> If you come upon a scene that seems a bit cluttered, don&#39;t walk away. Instead, take steps to <em>simplify</em> . Get in closer, use a longer lens, or adjust your angle so that you highlight certain objects and block out others. Make sense?</p><h2 data-section id="dont-forget-about-the-light"> 11.

And it&#39;s true: Composition makes a huge difference.</p><p> But make sure you don&#39;t fixate so heavily on composition that you forget about other key photographic elements – such as lighting.</p><p> Color landscape photographers love shooting during the golden hours, and this soft-yet-direct light also looks great in black and white. The low sun will create long shadows, which you can use as powerful composition elements (eg, <a aria-label="leading lines (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-leading-lines-for-better-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">leading lines</a> ).</p><p> But as a black and white shooter, you can head out at other times and capture equally compelling images. For instance, overcast days produce soft, intimate light that reveals detail in forest and mountain scenes. And even harsh midday sun – which is hated by most color landscape photographers – can make for interesting black and white shots. The trick is to use the contrasty light to your advantage; let it create shadow geometry, then incorporate the shadows into your compositions.</p><p> <a aria-label="Blue hour (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-quick-tips-for-better-blue-hour-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Blue hour</a> is another great time to shoot black and white landscapes. The light is wonderfully soft, and if you can find a moving subject (eg, ocean waves), you&#39;ll be able to capture ethereal long exposures that look <em>outstanding</em> .</p><h2 data-section id="capture-intimate-landscape-shots"> 12.

Sometimes, the beauty lies in the details, textures, or geometry found within the scene. These intimate landscape shots can tell a different, more personal story.</p><p> Switching from a wide-angle lens to a <a aria-label="telephoto lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tips-shooting-landscapes-telephoto-lens-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">telephoto lens</a> can transform your perspective. It allows you to zoom in on specific elements, such as a lone tree, a winding path, or the intricate pattern of leaves and rocks. The compression effect of a telephoto lens can also create a unique visual relationship between the foreground and background.</p><p> Intimate shots are all about observation and imagination. Look for textures, shapes, and patterns that draw your eye. Experiment with different angles and framing to find the <a aria-label="perfect landscape composition (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/4-rules-of-composition-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">perfect landscape composition</a> . Sometimes, the most compelling images come from the most ordinary subjects, like delicate lines in the sand or the graceful curve of a branch.</p><p> Don&#39;t be afraid to get close and personal with nature. Part of the beauty of black and white photography lies in its ability to reveal the hidden artistry of the landscape.</p><h2 data-section id="travel-when-you-can"> 13.

All my favorite landscape photos were taken while traveling, and the two activities really do go together very well – travel is more interesting and exciting when there&#39;s a purpose behind it.

Photographing in RAW is a wise choice, as it gives you more control and flexibility when editing. Don&#39;t just press the “Convert to Black and White” button; explore various conversion options to see what best fits your vision.</p><p> When converting to black and white, try adjusting individual color channels. This allows you to emphasize or de-emphasize different parts of the image, helping you create a visually engaging photograph. Play with the highlights and shadows, add contrast, tweak clarity, and even apply a vignette to guide the viewer&#39;s eye toward your main subject.</p><p> Editing software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop offers several good black and white conversion methods. Don&#39;t hesitate to experiment and find what works best for your particular shot. Spend time on this. The conversion from color to black and white isn&#39;t just a technical step; it&#39;s an artistic one. This is where your creativity shines, and it&#39;s how you can transform a good photo into a masterpiece.</p><h2 data-section id="black-and-white-landscape-photography-final-words"> Black and white landscape photography: final words</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255630" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/black-and-white-landscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Black and white landscape photography" class="wp-image-255630" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/black-and-white-landscape-photography-202.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/black-and-white-landscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/black-and-white-landscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/black-and-white-landscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/black-and-white-landscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/black-and-white-landscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Black and white landscape photography is an exciting and rewarding pursuit.

First came the <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.tamron-usa.com/news/2023/35150_zmount_develop_jul.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">35-150mm f/2-2.8 Di III VXD (for Nikon Z-mount)</a> , followed by the <a aria-label="upgraded version of the existing 70-180mm f/2.8 Di III VC VXD (for Sony E-mount) (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.tamron-usa.com/news/2023/70180_secondgen_dev_aug.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">upgraded version of the existing 70-180mm f/2.8 Di III VC VXD (for Sony E-mount)</a> .</p><p> While Tamron is primarily known for developing enthusiast lenses that combine excellent optics, compact designs, and reasonable prices, the two just-announced lenses will likely occupy a position in the upper echelons of the company&#39;s lens lineup – assuming earlier versions of the products are indicative of what&#39;s to come.</p><h2 data-section id="the-tamron-mm-f-di-iii-vxd-for-nikon-z-mount"> The Tamron 35-150mm f/2-2.8 Di III VXD for Nikon Z-mount</h2><p> The original <a href="https://geni.us/Tamron35-150dPS" target="_blank" aria-label="Tamron 35-150mm f/2-2.8 (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Tamron 35-150mm f/2-2.8</a> was released back in 2021 for Sony E-mount, and the new product, this time compatible with Nikon&#39;s entire array of <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/use-mirrorless-in-2020/" target="_blank" aria-label="mirrorless cameras (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">mirrorless cameras</a> , appears to match its specifications. Like the E-mount version, the new lens promises outstanding optics, not to mention an incredible focal-length range that&#39;ll instantly take you from a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/7-ways-to-get-more-out-of-a-wide-angle-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="wide-angle view (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">wide-angle view</a> all the way into a tight <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-tips-for-great-telephoto-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="telephoto crop (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">telephoto crop</a> .</p><p> As the Sony version proved, the lens will be useful for a host of photographers. It should be popular among serious portrait snappers (who can use the lens to capture a wide variety of portrait types within a single session), travel photographers (to shoot landscapes, travel portraits, and everything in between), and professional event photographers (who can use the lens to alternate between scene-setting photos and tighter compositions).</p><p> The maximum <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> , which goes all the way to f/2 on the wide end, should appeal to a couple of types of photographers, including shooters who often work indoors and at night as well as portraitists seeking that <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" aria-label="beautiful background bokeh (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">beautiful background bokeh</a> .</p><p> Of course, a do-everything lens like this one does come with drawbacks. The 35-150mm is large, heavy, and expensive. While the MSRP for the Nikon version hasn&#39;t been revealed yet, the Sony version comes with an $1899 price tag.</p><p> As a result, the lens likely won&#39;t see much use from beginners as well as certain minimalistic travel shooters. For others, however, the heft and cost are the sacrifices you make if you want to work with one of the most versatile and effective lenses on the market. Therefore, I recommend Nikon pros and semi-pros take a good look at this lens – especially if you frequently work in low-light scenarios.</p><h2 data-section id="the-tamron-mm-f-di-iii-vc-vxd-g"> The Tamron 70-180mm f/2.8 Di III VC VXD G2</h2><p> Tamron&#39;s more recent announcement, the 70-180mm f/2.8 G2, is arguably even more exciting. It&#39;s not an existing lens with a converted mount but instead comes as the upgraded version of the <a href="https://geni.us/NA1FCD" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">first-generation 70-180mm f/2.8 Di III VC VXD</a> , an E-mount lens that hit the shelves back in 2020.</p><p> The new version of the 70-180mm looks to perfect its predecessor&#39;s <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/gear-review-tamron-70-180mm-f-2-8-for-sony/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">already excellent feature set</a> . Like the original, you can expect outstanding low-light performance thanks to the f/2.8 maximum aperture, an impressively compact design, and a focal-length range that&#39;s already much-loved by landscape photographers, portrait photographers, event photographers, and more.</p><p> Note that the old 70-180mm f/2.8 is only 20mm shorter than the standard 70-200mm f/2.8 lenses offered by Sony. Yet it&#39;s far more compact, making it ideal for travel photography and general walkaround shooting. It&#39;s also available for a much cheaper $1099; as a result, it appeals to serious hobbyists as well as professionals. The upgraded version may cost more, but I doubt the price will rise significantly.</p><p> In addition to the features mentioned above, what will the new lens offer? For one, the 70-180mm will now include image stabilization technology – Tamron calls this “VC,” or “Vibration Compensation” – which should dramatically improve sharpness when handholding at slow shutter speeds. This will be invaluable for wedding and event photographers working in low light and should also come in handy for landscape and wildlife snappers who prefer to capture tighter images without a tripod.</p><p> The lens will boast upgraded autofocus capabilities to ensure even greater speed and accuracy when photographing moving subjects, such as sports and birds in flight; it also sports a “revamped optical design” that “delivers truly superb performance at all focal lengths.” Considering that the original optic lens&#39;s optics were well-received by professionals and critics, this should only serve to improve the lens further.</p><h2 data-section id="tamron-zoom-lens-announcements-final-words"> Tamron zoom lens announcements: final words</h2><p> While we don&#39;t yet know when the new lenses will debut – Tamron&#39;s official press releases only state “Fall 2023” – you shouldn&#39;t have long to wait, and if you&#39;re a Nikon Z-mount or Sony E-mount shooter seeking a highly versatile zoom, these are lenses you don&#39;t want to miss.

It appears as characteristic rounded shapes in the background of photos.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255591" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-15.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bokeh effect in photography" class="wp-image-255591" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-15.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-15.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-15.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-15.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-15.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-15.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Many professional photographers use this bokeh effect in their images; it helps the main subject stand out, plus it can add an element of artistry to the overall shot. Portrait photographers often rely on creamy background bokeh to elevate their compositions, but you can also find heavy use of bokeh in wildlife photography, product photography, food photography, and event photography.</p><p> Note that, generally speaking, the term “bokeh” refers to any background (or foreground) blur in an image. So you can get <em>beautiful</em> bokeh (when the out-of-focus areas are smooth and stunning), or you can get <em>bad</em> bokeh (when the out-of-focus areas are too detailed or appear jagged). Later on in this article, I&#39;ll explain what causes good versus bad bokeh, but for now, just know that not all bokeh looks equally gorgeous.</p><h2 data-section id="the-factors-determining-the-bokeh-effect-in-your-photos"> The 5 factors determining the bokeh effect in your photos</h2><p> Beginners often struggle to capture lovely bokeh effects, and it&#39;s because bokeh can be <em>complicated</em> ; it&#39;s not as simple as adjusting one setting on your camera and calling it a day.</p><p> Instead, the bokeh quality in your photos is influenced by five factors:</p><ol><li> <span style="color: initial;">Aperture size (ie, the size of the hole in the lens that lets in light)</span></li><li> Lens choice</li><li> Distance between the camera and your subject</li><li> Distance between the subject and the background</li><li> Quality of the background</li></ol><p> Let&#39;s look at each factor in turn, starting with:</p><h3 data-section id="aperture-size"> 1.

Ultimately, a wide aperture will create a better bokeh effect – because the wider the aperture, the more background blur the lens will produce.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255594" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-8.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bokeh effect in photography" class="wp-image-255594" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-8.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-8.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-8.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-8.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-8.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-8.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Creating an image like this one, which features a narrow plane of sharpness and exceptional bokeh, requires a wide aperture such as f/2.8.</figcaption></figure></div><p> A narrow aperture, on the other hand, produces images that are sharp from foreground to background; that&#39;s why landscape photographers nearly always shoot at f/8 and beyond.

Other lenses are rather underwhelming in their bokeh quality.为什么？</p><p> It has to do with several factors.</p><p> First, the larger the lens&#39;s maximum aperture, the better the bokeh quality. As discussed above, if you can open your lens&#39;s aperture really wide, the bokeh will look great – whereas a closed-down aperture will produce nervous, distracting bokeh that doesn&#39;t complement the subject.</p><p> Second, some lenses offer more <em>circular</em> apertures, whereas other lenses have hexagonal, septagonal, or octagonal apertures. Because aperture shape generally determines the shape of the bokeh, the more circular the aperture, the smoother the bokeh effect.</p><p> (Note that aperture shape is primarily determined by the aperture <em>blade</em> count, which you can find on the specification sheet of every lens. More blades equal a more circular aperture, which in turn corresponds to more pleasing bokeh. Got it?)</p><p> Third, the longer the lens, the more it compresses the background, and the blurrier the background becomes. With bokeh, <em>longer</em> equals <em>better</em> .</p><p> So for the best bokeh, purchase a lens with a long focal length (eg, 200mm), a wide maximum aperture (eg, f/2.8), and plenty of aperture blades (9+).</p><h3 data-section id="distance-between-the-camera-and-your-subject"> 3.

You&#39;re not alone! Many photographers, especially when choosing a new camera, want to know if there&#39;s a link between sensor size and beautiful background bokeh.</p><p> Let&#39;s start with the basics. If you compare side-by-side images from APS-C and full-frame cameras, both using 50mm lenses, you&#39;ll notice that the photos are different. The image from the APS-C camera will look tighter, while the full-frame image will be wider. This difference is not because of the sensor&#39;s inherent properties but rather because the smaller sensor effectively crops the image.</p><p> Technically, the images reaching the back of the camera will be identical, but as they&#39;re captured by the sensor, the APS-C file gets cropped. This means that the depth of field (the area in focus) will match perfectly in both files, even though the APS-C image appears tighter. To achieve the same composition as the full-frame image, the APS-C camera would need to be moved forward several feet.</p><p> So what&#39;s the bottom line? The larger the sensor size, the better the bokeh will look in a similar composition. It&#39;s not a property inherent to larger sensors but a result of the internal cropping that happens with smaller sensors. Understanding this will help you get the most out of your camera, no matter the sensor size.</p><h2 data-section id="how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-the-step-by-step-process"> How to achieve nice bokeh: the step-by-step process</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255605" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-13.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bokeh effect in photography" class="wp-image-255605" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-13.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-13.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-13.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-13.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bokeh-effect-photography-13.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> I&#39;ve already explained the theory behind good bokeh, but in this section, I&#39;d like to share, in practical terms, how to get the best possible bokeh for any given situation.</p><h3 data-section id="step-use-the-right-lens"> Step 1: Use the right lens</h3><p> Bokeh starts with lens choice.

The term refers to the hour just after sunrise or before sunset when the sun bathes everything in a warm, soft light; the warm light casts a wonderful glow on backgrounds, which looks simply stunning when rendered as bokeh.</p><p> One of the techniques you can try during the golden hour is backlighting. Positioning your subject between the camera and the sun can create a luminous effect that makes the bokeh look extraordinary. Experiment with different angles and lighting positions; you&#39;ll often be rewarded with some truly breathtaking images.</p><p> And if you&#39;ve never taken photos during the golden hour before, don&#39;t worry! There are plenty of apps and websites that can tell you exactly when the golden hour occurs in your location. With a bit of practice and an eye for lighting, you&#39;ll find that the golden hour is one of the most beautiful times to create eye-catching bokeh.</p><h3 data-section id="try-using-a-macro-lens"> 2.

As I explained above, the closer you are to your subject, the better the bokeh usually appears – so because macro lenses have this unique ability to focus on subjects that are very close, they open up a whole new world of creative possibilities.</p><p> You can use a macro lens and dial in an ultra-wide aperture to create a very narrow window of sharpness. This allows for creamy background bokeh, paving the way for soft-focus images of flowers, plants, insects, and more. If you haven&#39;t tried this before, you&#39;re in for a treat!</p><p> Choosing the right macro lens for your camera system can be a fun exploration. Look for one that offers a wide aperture and suitable focal length for your subjects. Experimenting with different lenses and settings can lead to some surprising and delightful results!</p><h3 data-section id="make-sure-to-focus-carefully"> 3.

When you&#39;re working with a shallow depth of field, the margin for error in focusing is slim. If your focus is even slightly off, it can ruin the image, causing the main subject to go out of focus.</p><p> To avoid this issue, you&#39;ll want to be very deliberate in where you set your focus. Using autofocus can sometimes lead to errors, especially if you&#39;re close to your subject. Manual focus can give you more control.</p><p> Regardless, start by choosing the point of focus carefully. If you&#39;re photographing a person, for example, focusing on the eyes is usually a good strategy. Use your camera&#39;s zoom-in feature in Live View mode to really hone in on the focus point and adjust it as needed (either manually or using your camera&#39;s autofocus).</p><p> Practicing is key. Try working with different subjects at different distances, and use both autofocus and manual focus to see what works best for you. Over time, you&#39;ll develop a feel for getting it just right. You&#39;ll find that the effort is well worth it, as the precise focus will make your bokeh photography truly stand out.</p><h3 data-section id="create-some-bokeh-abstracts"> 4.

In my experience, you can use bokeh to capture abstract images that are both mysterious and visually appealing. The process of creating bokeh abstracts is creative, fun, and a little unconventional.</p><p> You&#39;ll need a subject with small points of light, like Christmas lights, car headlights, or fairy lights. Wait until it&#39;s dark out or find a dark room, and then dial in a wide aperture on your lens. You&#39;ll also want to switch your lens over to manual focus.</p><p> Now, here&#39;s where it gets interesting: Deliberately focus in front of your subject. This will cause the pinpricks of light to turn into soft, glowing orbs, creating the bokeh effect. You can experiment with different angles, distances, and focus points to see how the appearance of the bokeh is changed.</p><p> Bokeh abstracts are a fantastic way to explore your creativity. You can display them on their own, or you can combine these abstract patterns with other elements or use them as backgrounds in composite images. No two bokeh abstracts are the same, so don&#39;t be afraid to experiment and find your own unique style.</p><h3 data-section id="create-custom-bokeh-shapes"> 5.

This technique allows you to transform ordinary bokeh orbs into various shapes like hearts, stars, or even letters.</p><p> First, you&#39;ll need to cut out a lens-sized piece of paper, then cut out a custom shape within that piece. Place the paper directly on top of your front lens element (like a filter), and make sure to use a wide aperture. Finally, identify a subject that can produce strong bokeh (such as fairy lights), adjust the focus until the subject becomes a background blur, and start shooting!</p><p> Experimentation is key here. Play around with the size and shape of your cutout, the distance to your subject, and your focus settings. You might need to adjust and tweak things to get the results you want.</p><p> The beauty of custom bokeh shapes is that they add a unique flair to your photos and can be tailored to fit the theme of your image. Whether it&#39;s hearts for a romantic portrait or stars for a magical night scene, custom bokeh shapes offer endless possibilities for creativity.</p><p> Remember to be patient and enjoy the process. It may take some trial and error, but once you master this technique, you&#39;ll be over the moon.</p><h2 data-section id="bokeh-photo-examples"> Bokeh photo examples</h2><p> Below, I&#39;ve included a few images with nice bokeh so you can see exactly what you can achieve with the right approach.</p><p> First, we have a photo with the lens focused somewhere <em>between</em> the foreground grasses and the background people. Note that both the foreground and background are blurred in a nice bokeh pattern, though the blur isn&#39;t <em>extremely</em> strong. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Annie-Tao-Photography-bokeh-Ex2.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Bokeh photography example family in the grass" title="Annie-Tao-Photography-bokeh-Ex2.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> In this next shot, I&#39;ve focused on the subject&#39;s feet and used a wide aperture. Note how the feet are sharp, but the rest of the image is blurred (it&#39;s a fun trick that I highly recommend you try!): </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Annie-Tao-Photography-bokeh-Ex3.jpg?ssl=1" alt="selective focusing bokeh" title="Annie-Tao-Photography-bokeh-Ex3.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Also, I occasionally prefer my bokeh in the foreground, not the background. Instead of focusing on a close subject, I focus on a distant subject (the father and son) but include a large object in the foreground (the tree). A wide aperture serves to blur out the foreground object, and the background subject looks nice and sharp. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Annie-Tao-Photography-foreground-bokeh.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Bokeh in foreground example" title="Annie-Tao-Photography-foreground-bokeh.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Of course, there will be times when bokeh <em>isn&#39;t</em> desirable.

Class-leading sports cameras offer 20, 30, or 60 frames per second. And the average camera offers 6-12 frames per second.</p><p> Unfortunately, most camera burst modes are <em>not</em> unlimited.

The type of shutter you&#39;re using will affect the speed as well, but I&#39;ll delve into that later.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255541" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-102.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Burst mode photography" class="wp-image-255541" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-102.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-102.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-102.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-102.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-102.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-102.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Now, you might see two burst speeds often labeled “high-speed continuous” and “low-speed continuous.” High-speed continuous generally offers a few additional frames per second compared to low-speed continuous, but from a practical perspective, what&#39;s the difference? In other words, how do you choose one mode over the other?</p><p> If you&#39;re working with ultra-fast action, such as a car race or a bird in flight, selecting the higher-speed option is essential. Otherwise, lower-speed continuous shooting will likely be sufficient. Remember, it&#39;s about matching the speed to the subject to create the perfect shot.</p><h2 data-section id="when-should-you-use-burst-mode"> When should you use burst mode?</h2><p> Technically, you can use burst mode all the time. Assuming you don&#39;t hold down the shutter button for too long at any one time, you can capture a burst of images every time you find a new subject.</p><p> However, I don&#39;t recommend you use your continuous shooting mode constantly. For one, this will encourage you to get lazy with your photography – you&#39;ll shoot in bursts and you&#39;ll never learn how to time beautifully composed images. Plus, constant burst mode will produce a huge number of files. Your memory cards will fill up insanely fast, and so will your hard drives.</p><p> Instead, I suggest turning on burst mode when you <em>know</em> you&#39;re photographing action, or when you&#39;re about to see a once-in-a-lifetime moment.</p><p> For instance, if you&#39;re shooting a sports game, you might leave burst mode on for the entire event; that way, whenever something interesting happens – a slam dunk, a turnover, a buzzer-beater – you&#39;re ready to capture the essential moments. Same if you&#39;re photographing fast-moving wildlife or birds, a child&#39;s soccer game, or a dog doing an agility course.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255542" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-104.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Burst mode photography" class="wp-image-255542" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-104.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-104.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-104.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-104.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-104.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-104.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Burst mode is also perfect for capturing moments that are unmissable (even if they don&#39;t involve action). If you&#39;re photographing your child walking across the stage at graduation, burst mode will all but guarantee a shot of them accepting their diploma. If you&#39;re photographing a portrait subject, burst mode will increase your chances of capturing an evocative expression or pose. And if you&#39;re photographing a street scene, burst mode will help you record split-second interactions, such as spouses making eye contact.</p><p> By the way, you can also use burst photography to capture <em>technically</em> difficult scenes.

For action photography, it&#39;s best to use your camera&#39;s continuous focusing mode, known as AI Servo on Canon and AF-C on most other camera brands (including Nikon and Sony). Continuous focus will constantly track moving objects even as you hold down the shutter button, helping to maintain sharp focus as your subject moves across the scene and you capture bursts of images.</p><p> Alternatively, if you&#39;ve already composed a shot but want to guarantee a good pose, a beautiful moment, etc., I&#39;d recommend using your camera&#39;s single-shot autofocus mode, known as One-Shot on Canon and AF-S on most other brands.

It&#39;s a reliable method that&#39;s been around for decades.</p><p> But in recent years, mirrorless cameras have pivoted toward electronic shutters. With this technology, the sensor automatically exposes the photo when the shutter button is pressed, removing the necessity for a mechanical element. It&#39;s a major advancement that provides some distinct advantages, but it also comes with a potential drawback.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255545" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="996" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-103.jpg?resize=1500%2C996&#038;ssl=1" alt="Burst mode photography" class="wp-image-255545" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-103.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-103.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-103.jpg?resize=600%2C398&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-103.jpg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-103.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-103.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-103.jpg?resize=717%2C476&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> First, the advantages: Electronic shutters are generally faster than mechanical shutters, which means you can shoot at impossibly fast shutter speeds like 1/40000s, and you get elevated continuous shooting speeds, too.</p><p> Electronic shutters are also far quieter – even silent – and this makes a huge difference in event photography. Imagine working a quiet ceremony like a wedding in a church; thanks to the near-silent electronic shutter, you can shoot nonstop without worrying about distracting the attendees. Also, since there&#39;s limited mechanical wear and tear to deal with, electronic shutters tend to last longer than mechanical shutters.</p><p> However, as I mentioned, electronic shutters do have a drawback: the rolling shutter effect. Basically, the electronic shutter exposes lines of the sensor one by one, so if the exposure process is slow enough and the subject is moving quickly, the final shot can show a distorted subject. The good news is that camera manufacturers are getting better at speeding up the exposure process, and some modern mirrorless cameras do a great job of preventing or reducing the rolling shutter!</p><p> Therefore, when you need lightning-fast shooting speeds, an electronic shutter is usually a good choice. But if you&#39;re photographing action, especially something moving quickly across the frame, make sure you either shoot with an electronic shutter designed to eliminate the rolling shutter effect or switch over to the mechanical shutter.</p><p> Note: Understanding when to use each shutter type can significantly impact your photography, so don&#39;t be afraid to experiment and see what works best for you!</p><h2 data-section id="tips-for-using-your-cameras-continuous-shooting-mode"> Tips for using your camera&#39;s continuous shooting mode</h2><p> Looking to improve your burst mode shooting? Here are a few handy tips to help you level up your images:</p><h3 data-section id="dont-hammer-the-shutter-button"> 1. Don&#39;t hammer the shutter button</h3><p> Burst mode is powerful, but to get the best results, you need to handle the shutter button with care. It&#39;s easy to press down hard on the button when using continuous shooting mode, but this actually leads to increased blurriness due to camera shake.</p><p> Instead, lightly press the shutter button, almost as if your finger is rolling off its surface.</p><p> The idea behind this gentle touch is to eliminate as much vibration as possible. This becomes especially important when you&#39;re working at slower shutter speeds or when shooting at high magnifications. Think of it like holding a glass of water filled to the brim – any sudden movement can cause a spill. By treating the shutter button with finesse, you reduce the chances of a “spill” in your photo, keeping those images sharp and clear.</p><h3 data-section id="think-about-your-compositions"> 2. Think about your compositions</h3><p> While the excitement of action photography and the use of burst mode might draw your attention to shutter speeds and timing, composition remains a key factor in creating stunning images. You might think that capturing the perfect moment is everything, but how you frame that moment is equally crucial.</p><p> As you shoot, it&#39;s essential to ask yourself: Where should each element be placed for maximum impact? What are the relationships between the objects in the frame?</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255547" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:56.2%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="843" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-105.jpg?resize=1500%2C843&#038;ssl=1" alt="Burst mode photography" class="wp-image-255547" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-105.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-105.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-105.jpg?resize=600%2C337&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-105.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/burst-mode-photography-105.jpg?resize=717%2C403&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Even in the midst of fast-paced shooting, guidelines like the rule of thirds can help inform your compositions. Similarly, the rule of space, which involves leaving space in the direction your subject is moving or looking, can add dynamism to your shots.</p><p> Remember, every shot, even the ones taken in a split second, tells a story. Make sure your story is visually compelling by thinking about composition – even when using burst mode.</p><h3 data-section id="bring-plenty-of-memory-cards"> 3. Bring plenty of memory cards</h3><p> Continuous shooting mode will fill up your memory cards far faster than you might expect. Imagine shooting at 10 FPS for just one minute. You&#39;ll end up with a whopping 600 photos! So if you plan on capturing action and using burst mode, make sure to carry plenty of memory cards.</p><p> I recommend grabbing a memory card case and filling it up with 64 GB (or larger) cards. Take the entire set with you whenever you plan to photograph action. It&#39;s like packing extra batteries for a long journey; you never know when you&#39;ll need them, but having them on hand can be a lifesaver.</p><p> Burst mode is an exciting feature that opens up new photographic possibilities, but without enough storage, you could find yourself missing out on incredible moments. Make sure you&#39;re well-equipped to handle the excitement and intensity of continuous shooting!</p><h3 data-section id="shoot-in-good-light-for-maximum-sharpness"> 4. Shoot in good light for maximum sharpness</h3><p> We all know the importance of light in photography, but when capturing action, light becomes even more vital. The lower the light, the slower your shutter speed, leading to softer, less sharp images. Even when using burst mode, having insufficient light can lead to disappointing results.</p><p> For truly sharp shots, you need to keep your shutter speed fast – and to do that, you need good lighting. The golden hours, the time shortly after sunrise or before sunset, are perfect for capturing well-lit photographs. The middle of the day also provides strong light, but be careful, as this light can be harsh and unflattering.</p><p> If you find yourself needing to shoot in low light, boosting your ISO instead of slowing down your shutter speed can be a viable option. It might increase the visible noise in your images, but a bit of noise is preferable to a blurry mess.</p><h3 data-section id="use-burst-mode-in-low-light"> 5.

In those situations, burst mode can actually be your ally in getting sharper shots.</p><p> When you press the shutter button, you create vibrations that may lead to blur. The harder you press, the more the camera shakes. Burst mode minimizes this issue because you need to press the shutter button only <em>once</em> for each burst. The subsequent images in a burst-mode series are likely to be sharper than the first shot.</p><p> It may seem counterintuitive to think that burst mode, which is often associated with action and sports photography, can be handy in low-light situations. But understanding this principle can save a shoot when the light isn&#39;t cooperating.</p><h2 data-section id="burst-mode-in-photography-final-words"> Burst mode in photography: final words</h2><p> Now that you&#39;ve finished this article, you know all about continuous shooting photography – and how it can improve your results.</p><p> So spend some time testing it out.

When is the golden hour? And how can you use it to capture beautiful photos?</p><p> Golden hour is a special time for photographers. The sun is low in the sky, and the light looks soft, warm, and absolutely <em>magical</em> . By combining proper photographic technique with golden hour lighting, you&#39;re practically guaranteed to capture stunning images – which is what this article is all about.</p><p> Below, I&#39;m going to share everything you need to know about golden hour photography. I&#39;ll answer all your burning questions, and I&#39;ll explain how to improve your golden hour images with a few expert tips and techniques.</p><p> Let&#39;s dive right in!</p><h2 data-section id="what-is-the-golden-hour-in-photography"> What is the golden hour in photography?</h2><p> The golden hour refers to (roughly) the first hour after sunrise and the last hour before sunset. It&#39;s a time that&#39;s great for photography; hence, the golden hour is also referred to as the <em>magic hour</em> .</p><p> During the golden hour, the sun hits the world at a lower angle – and because the light must travel a greater distance to reach the Earth, it looks softer, more flattering, and redder. (Compare this to sunny midday lighting, which beams down from directly overhead to produce hard, generally unflattering illumination.)</p><p> Here&#39;s a typical golden hour photo:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-125788" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Golden_Hour_19.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="golden hour photography dog in grass" class="wp-image-125788" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Golden_Hour_19.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Golden_Hour_19.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Golden_Hour_19.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Golden_Hour_19.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Golden_Hour_19.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Notice the beautiful yellow hues and unbelievably flattering light? That&#39;s what golden hour offers for photographers.</p><h2 data-section id="when-is-the-golden-hour"> When is the golden hour?</h2><p> While the standard definition of the golden hour – see above! – emphasizes the hour or two before sunset and after sunrise, the golden hour actually fluctuates over the year, and its length depends on your geographical location.</p><p> If you live near the equator, the golden hour tends to last one or two hours, and the time won&#39;t change too much as you go from winter to summer and back. But if you live closer to the North or South Pole, you&#39;ll notice a massive change in the golden hour timing, <em>and</em> the golden hours often last far longer.</p><p> Really, if you&#39;re serious about taking advantage of beautiful golden hour light, I&#39;d just recommend paying careful attention to the sun for a few days. Ask yourself: When does it rise? When does it set? When does the light start to get warm and soft in the evening? And when does the light start to get hard in the morning? While you can calculate exact golden hour times using astronomical charts, it&#39;s often best to simply observe the light; pretty soon, you&#39;ll be very attuned to the sun&#39;s changes, and you&#39;ll know when you can (and can&#39;t) expect magic-hour lighting.</p><h2 data-section id="why-is-the-golden-hour-so-special"> Why is the golden hour so special?</h2><p> I&#39;ve already emphasized the low, soft, warm light produced by a magic-hour sun – but what makes it so great for photography?</p><p> Well, generally speaking, <a aria-label="soft light (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/the-magic-of-soft-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">soft light</a> is a photographer&#39;s best friend.

While portrait photographers, wildlife photographers, and landscape photographers love magic-hour light, street photographers generally prefer to shoot around midday, when the hard light of the sun produces lots of crunchy contrast and shadows. And many macro photographers prefer to shoot when the sky is overcast; that way, they can capture saturated colors and lots of detail.</p><p> So don&#39;t feel like you <em>must</em> work during the golden hour. Just know that it&#39;s a great way to enhance many types of photos.

During the blue hour, the sky turns beautiful <em>cool</em> colors – blues and purples – which look great in landscape and even portrait photos. Unfortunately, the lack of strong light during the blue hour can cause technical problems, but if you choose the right gear, set your ISO carefully, and/or use a tripod, your photos will be spectacular.</p><h2 data-section id="five-key-lighting-techniques-for-golden-hour-photography"> Five key lighting techniques for golden hour photography</h2><p> The golden hour offers five powerful lighting techniques:</p><h3 data-section id="front-light"> Front light</h3><p> Front lighting is when your subject faces directly into the sun: </p><div class="wp-block-image caption-align-left wp-image-124796 size-full is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-124796" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Golden-Hour-23.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="front light during golden hour" class="wp-image-124796" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Golden-Hour-23.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Golden-Hour-23.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Golden-Hour-23.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Golden-Hour-23.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Golden-Hour-23.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> During the golden hours, front light offers a warm, flattering effect that&#39;s perfect for photographing people, wildlife, and birds.

During golden hour, there&#39;s usually plenty of soft, warm light, so a low ISO will suffice.</p><p> Choosing the right ISO setting for golden hour depends on the other settings you&#39;re using, like shutter speed and aperture. A lower ISO, like 100 or 200, is typically a good starting point.</p><p> Balancing ISO with other settings means you may need to adjust your shutter speed or aperture to compensate for the lower sensitivity to light.

How you arrange elements within the frame impacts how a viewer&#39;s eye moves through the image. The golden hour&#39;s soft light can emphasize these elements, enhancing their appeal.</p><p> The rule of thirds is a handy guideline for golden hour shots. Imagine your frame divided into nine equal parts by two vertical and two horizontal lines. Placing key elements at the intersections of these lines creates a more balanced and visually engaging photo.</p><p> Leading lines and visual pathways can guide the viewer through the image. Roads, fences, or streams can lead the eye toward the subject, especially in the glowing light of the golden hour.</p><p> Framing the subject using natural elements like trees or windows can add depth.

Don&#39;t be! You&#39;ll first want to understand the basic definition: long-exposure photography is the process of holding the camera&#39;s shutter open for a longer time, allowing more light to hit the sensor.</p><p> Using a tripod is essential. A long exposure means the camera needs to be perfectly still; even a tiny movement can blur the image. A sturdy tripod will ensure sharp pictures, allowing you to experiment with different shutter speeds.</p><p> The dreamy effect you can achieve on water or clouds is stunning. By keeping the shutter open for a longer time, movement in the scene becomes a blur, giving water a smooth appearance and clouds a streaked look. It&#39;s all about capturing the flow of time.</p><p> Note that selecting the right shutter speed is a matter of experimentation. Start with a few seconds and make adjustments until you achieve an effect you like. (Pro tip: Use a remote shutter release or your camera&#39;s self-timer to avoid shake when pressing the shutter button!)</p><h3 data-section id="experiment-with-post-processing"> 13.

Glass skyscrapers can reflect the colors of the sunset, and playing with these reflections can yield incredible results.</p><p> Emphasize the vibrant colors of the sunset. They can range from deep oranges to soft pinks, and you can use these to create a warm and inviting photograph. Consider adjusting your white balance settings to enhance these colors.</p><p> Finally, the transition from day to night is a magical time. By staying at your chosen spot even as the golden hour fades, you can capture the city as it moves into the blue hour, with artificial lights starting to glow and enhance the city&#39;s character.</p><h3 data-section id="backlit-portraits"> 2.

Incorporate rocks, waves, and even pier structures to add interest to your shot. You can create a tranquil image with still water or add drama with crashing waves by adjusting your shutter speed. Capturing reflections on wet sand or shallow water adds an extra layer of beauty.</p><p> If you&#39;re aiming for a specific effect, don&#39;t hesitate to use filters. A graduated neutral density filter can help balance the exposure between the sky and the water, while a neutral density filter can help you reduce your shutter speed for striking long-exposure shots.</p><h3 data-section id="shadowy-street-scenes"> 5.

You might notice how light plays on the streets, reflecting off windows and creating interesting patterns.</p><p> Capturing pedestrians in motion can add life to your photos. A slight blur as they move can contrast nicely with the static surroundings.</p><p> Architectural elements, such as old buildings, lampposts, or archways, can become key features in your composition. Think about the mood or atmosphere you want to create. Is it nostalgic? Mysterious? Romantic? The golden hour provides a versatile backdrop for all of these emotions (and more!).</p><h3 data-section id="boats-and-harbors"> 6.

Composing your shots with boats, their reflections, and the interplay of water and light can produce some truly stunning images.</p><p> Capture the hustle and bustle of the harbor as fishermen prepare or return from their journeys. Focus on the boats at rest, reflecting in the calm water; also spend some time capturing the boats at full sail. The water&#39;s movement, whether calm or choppy, can be used to great effect, echoing the sky&#39;s colors and the sun&#39;s descent.</p><p> Including the colors of the sky, especially during sunset, adds another layer of beauty. And at the end of the day, the harbor scene during the golden hour can give you a rich sense of place and time, turning a common scene into something magical.</p><h2 data-section id="capturing-golden-hour-photos-final-words"> Capturing golden hour photos: final words</h2><p> The golden hours are full of limitless possibilities, and no two files will look the same.</p><p> So get out during golden hour – and take plenty of shots!</p><p> Don&#39;t keep your golden hour experiences to yourself, either; share them with others and encourage fellow photographers to explore this magical time.

It&#39;s one of the most accessible forms of photography – after all, you can find flowers pretty much anywhere – plus it allows you to create a wide variety of images, including abstracts, close-up shots, landscape scenes, and more.</p><p> But while flowers are stunning subjects, creating great flower photography is about more than finding a nice flower and pressing the shutter button. You have to work in the right light, find a solid composition, choose the right camera settings, and post-process your files, all in pursuit of that top-notch final image.</p><p> Fortunately, I&#39;ve been exactly where you are, and in this article, I share all the key tips and tricks I&#39;ve learned, including:</p><ul><li> The <a aria-label="best light for flower photography (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-using-light-in-flower-photography-for-awesome-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">best light for flower photography</a></li><li> How to choose the right aperture</li><li> A simple way to create a beautiful soft-focus effect</li><li> My secret for amazing foregrounds</li><li> Much more!</li></ul><p> So if you&#39;re ready to capture some gorgeous flower shots? Then let&#39;s dive right in!</p><h2 data-section id="the-best-flower-photography-gear"> The best flower photography gear</h2><p> Flower photography is highly accessible, and you don&#39;t need lots of fancy equipment to get started. As a beginner, you can work with a smartphone or a point-and-shoot camera without issue; however, as you become more experienced, you may wish to upgrade in order to enhance your shooting capabilities. Here&#39;s what I would recommend:</p><h3 data-section id="an-interchangeable-lens-camera"> An interchangeable lens camera</h3><p> An interchangeable lens camera will allow you to work with a wide variety of lenses, each offering a different perspective. In other words, you can use one lens to capture wide images of flower fields, then you can switch lenses and zoom in for highly detailed close-up shots.</p><p> The best interchangeable lens cameras for flower photography offer larger sensors (full frame is best, but it&#39;s certainly not a must-have) and higher megapixel counts (the latter is important if you plan to create large prints of your flower images).</p><p> Also look for cameras that include in-body image stabilization, a fully articulating screen, and a high-quality viewfinder. Personally, I&#39;d recommend grabbing a mirrorless camera – the electronic viewfinder is helpful when selecting your exposure – but a DSLR works great, too.</p><h3 data-section id="a-macro-lens"> A macro lens</h3><p> Not all flower photography needs to be done at high magnifications, but a lot of the best shots do involve getting close (as I discuss below). Therefore, your main flower photography lens should ideally offer 1:1 magnification, which allows you to magnify your subject until the image on the camera sensor is life-size.</p><p> To achieve 1:1 magnifications, you&#39;ll need a dedicated macro lens. Fortunately, these lenses are extremely sharp, and there are a handful of nice macro lenses that are relatively cheap, including some great products from third-party manufacturers like Tamron, Sigma, and Tokina.</p><p> I&#39;d recommend picking a lens with a focal length in the 80-120mm range; it&#39;ll let you photograph up close without needing to get millimeters from the edge of your subject, but it won&#39;t have the heft or the price tag of a longer macro lens.</p><h3 data-section id="a-tripod"> A tripod</h3><p> Some flower photographers refuse to work without a tripod, while others only photograph handheld. Whether or not a tripod is right for you depends on your approach to flower photography, as well as your approach to photography more generally.</p><p> A tripod can be useful if you prefer to work slowly and deliberately. It&#39;s also helpful if you want to shoot at high magnifications but keep the entire flower in focus (as opposed to allowing certain portions of the flower to blur in a pleasing way).</p><p> On the other hand, if you want to work more quickly and flexibly, and you don&#39;t mind – or you specifically want – a softer focus effect where only a small portion of the flower is sharp, then ditching the tripod and photographing handheld is a better move.</p><h2 data-section id="the-best-flower-photography-settings"> The best flower photography settings</h2><p> Flower photography requires precise control over your exposure settings. That&#39;s why I recommend working in Manual mode, where you can set your aperture, ISO, and shutter speed independently. Aperture Priority mode is also a good choice if you&#39;re not totally comfortable working in Manual.</p><p> Start by setting your ISO to its base value to keep your images as high quality as possible.</p><p> Next, choose the aperture that gives you the depth of field effect you want. Wider apertures (smaller f-numbers) create a smaller window of focus, while narrower apertures (larger f-numbers) provide a larger window of focus. Whether you prefer a softer-focus effect with artistic blur, like setting your aperture in the f/2.8 to f/5.6 range, or a sharp effect where the entire subject is crisp, like using f/8 to f/16, is up to you. And if you&#39;re unsure, don&#39;t hesitate to experiment and see what appeals to you.</p><p> Dial in the shutter speed value that gives you the proper exposure. Make sure it&#39;s fast enough to ensure a sharp final image, especially at high magnifications. Typically, you&#39;ll want at least 1/160s, but sometimes you can get away with 1/100s and faster.</p><p> If the shutter speed isn&#39;t fast enough, you&#39;ll need to boost it accordingly and then adjust the aperture or ISO to compensate for the reduced exposure.</p><p> One more key piece of advice: switch your lens to manual focus when working at high magnifications. It may seem strange at first, but it allows you to specify your point of focus very precisely, and you&#39;ll get the hang of it pretty fast.</p><h2 data-section id="photograph-flowers-in-the-right-light"> 1. Photograph flowers in the right light</h2><p> Did you know that overcast skies are <em>perfect</em> for flower photography?</p><p> It&#39;s true. The soft light of an overcast day complements the delicate petals – plus, there are no shadows and no harsh bright spots, so you can get a nice, even exposure.</p><p> So if you&#39;re planning a flower photoshoot, it&#39;s often a good idea to check the weather first and aim to photograph on a cloudy day.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-48694" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/butterfly_gardens_20090219_085.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Flowers in soft light" class="wp-image-48694" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/butterfly_gardens_20090219_085.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/butterfly_gardens_20090219_085.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/butterfly_gardens_20090219_085.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> You do need to be careful, however. Toward the beginning and end of a cloudy day, the light gets pretty limited, which leads to unwanted blur (especially when shooting at high magnifications). So if the skies are overcast, aim to photograph at midday, then pack up before the sky gets too dark.</p><p> Of course, cloudy weather isn&#39;t the only time you can capture great flower photos. Clear skies at golden hour – when the sun is low in the sky – can also make for great images. The setting sun will produce warm, soft light that&#39;ll beautifully illuminate your subject, though you will need to be careful to avoid overexposure (the combination of bright light and colorful petals can be difficult to manage).</p><p> But while clear skies can work well early and late in the day, I encourage you to actively avoid shooting flowers around noon on sunny days. The high sun will beat down on the flowers, producing unpleasant shadows that rarely look good. Whenever possible, stick to softer, more flattering light!</p><h2 data-section id="use-backlight-to-make-your-flowers-glow"> 2. Use backlight to make your flowers glow</h2><p> As I explained in the previous section, you can create gorgeous flower photos around sunrise and sunset – which means you&#39;ll need to consider the lighting direction. In other words, does the light come from in front of your flower? Behind your flower? Off to the side of your flower?</p><p> Different lighting directions will give different effects, and while you can get beautifully detailed shots by using frontlight, and you can create wonderfully dramatic images by using sidelight, I highly recommend you try out backlight.</p><p> Yes, it&#39;s a bit unconventional, but backlight – which you can achieve by ensuring that the flower is between you and the sun – will make translucent petals glow, like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-48695" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:74.17%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="445" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cattle_pt_20090430_003.jpg?resize=600%2C445&#038;ssl=1" alt="backlit flower photography" class="wp-image-48695" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cattle_pt_20090430_003.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cattle_pt_20090430_003.jpg?resize=300%2C223&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The effect is gorgeous, and it&#39;s a great way to elevate your flower photography portfolio.</p><p> Try to photograph late in the day when the sun is close to the horizon; that way, the backlight will hit your flower petals directly, plus it&#39;ll cast a nice, warm light over the rest of your image. (You might even be able to catch some rays of light filtering through the trees!)</p><h2 data-section id="make-sure-your-subject-is-in-good-condition"> 3. Make sure your subject is in good condition</h2><p> After a good rain shower, the world outside takes on a fresh appearance that&#39;s especially captivating for flower photography. Cloudy skies create soft, diffused light, which adds a beautiful touch to your images. But what&#39;s even more enticing are the tiny water droplets left on the flowers.</p><p> These droplets create a sense of freshness and enhance the overall aesthetics of the flower. It&#39;s a magical time to head out with your camera, just as the rain stops, to capture these beauties. The reflection and sparkle of water on the petals add a unique dimension to your photographs.</p><p> Some photographers prefer to carry a small spray bottle to recreate this rain effect even when it&#39;s dry outside. It&#39;s an optional trick that you might want to explore.</p><p> Getting up close to highlight the details of water droplets on petals can be thrilling. Experiment with different angles and perspectives to see how the light plays off the water. You might discover a whole new way to see and photograph flowers.</p><h2 data-section id="watch-out-for-wind"> 4. Watch out for wind</h2><p> When photographing flowers, wind is your enemy. It&#39;ll blow your subjects in every direction, which makes it annoyingly difficult to focus (and if you&#39;re shooting with a slow shutter speed, it&#39;ll introduce plenty of blur).</p><p> The easiest way to avoid wind? Do your photography early in the morning when the weather is still calm. And a little wind is manageable; just bring a piece of cardboard or a reflector, then hold it up next to your flower.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-48687" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gerbera_20100113_IMG_7143.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="close-up of gerbera" class="wp-image-48687" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gerbera_20100113_IMG_7143.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gerbera_20100113_IMG_7143.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gerbera_20100113_IMG_7143.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you prefer not to get up early, or if you need to take photos on a windy day, you do have a second option:</p><p> Bring your flowers inside. You don&#39;t need a complex studio setup to get beautiful shots indoors – just put the flowers near a window and find a solid backdrop to set behind them. I photographed the flower below by taking it inside and placing it in front of a white sheet:</p><h2 data-section id="get-closer"> 5. Get closer</h2><p> Here&#39;s one of the easiest ways to create stunning, <em>unique</em> flower photos:</p><p> Get as close as you can. In other words, don&#39;t just settle for a nice frame from a few feet away. Instead, endeavor to fill the frame with your subject!</p><p> You can do this in a number of ways:</p><p> First, you can use a telephoto lens and zoom in on the flower. You&#39;ll want to pay attention to the magnification ratio of the lens because some lenses just can&#39;t focus especially close. A ratio of 1:1 is outstanding, though you&#39;ll only find that on dedicated macro lenses – but you can still achieve good results with a ratio of 1:2, 1:4, or even 1:6. (If you&#39;re not sure how much magnification your lens offers, you can look it up online, or you can do some tests.)</p><p> If you&#39;re lucky, your telephoto lens will focus close, and you can use it for beautiful flower shots. But what if you can&#39;t get as close as you&#39;d like?</p><p> You have several choices. You can use <a aria-label="extension tubes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/extension-tubes-close-up-photography-lesson-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">extension tubes</a> , which mount on your camera and let the lens focus closer. Or you can use a <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/macro-photography-budget-introduction-close-filters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">close-up filter</a> , which attaches to the end of your lens and works like a magnifying glass.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-48682" style="width:333px"><span class="space" style="width:333px; padding-top:150.15%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="333" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/backyard_20100403__MG_9103.jpg?resize=333%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="tulips with beautiful background" class="wp-image-48682" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/backyard_20100403__MG_9103.jpg?w=333&amp;ssl=1 333w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/backyard_20100403__MG_9103.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Honestly, both of these options come with pretty significant drawbacks; extension tubes are inconvenient, while close-up filters reduce image quality. Sure, they work, and if you&#39;re just getting started with flower photography, either method will help you take interesting close-up shots.</p><p> But if you want to really improve your images, I&#39;d recommend a dedicated <a aria-label="macro lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/choose-perfect-macro-lens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">macro lens</a> , which will let you capture intimate images without the need for accessories. These lenses can be purchased for reasonably low prices (especially if you grab a wider lens in the 40mm to 60mm range). They&#39;ll let you get extremely close to your subject, and they tend to offer outstanding image quality, as well!</p><h2 data-section id="try-using-a-reflector"> 6. Try using a reflector</h2><p> Here&#39;s a quick tip:</p><p> Shaded flowers can make for some stunning photos, especially when you combine a shaded subject and a well-lit background in the early morning or late evening.</p><p> But this sun-shade effect can result in an underexposed flower (or an overexposed background) if you&#39;re not careful. The trick here is to keep your flower relatively bright; that way, you can reduce the dynamic range of the overall scene, and your camera will have a much easier time capturing the full array of tones.</p><p> So if your subject is in the shade, use a <a aria-label="reflector (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-ways-use-5-1-reflector/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">reflector</a> to bounce some light. You can purchase a cheap pop-up option online or simply carry a piece of white card. Simply adjust the position until you get some nice light on the flower, then snap away! (Bonus: A reflector will also make your flowers appear more vibrant!).</p><h2 data-section id="avoid-a-cluttered-background"> 7. Avoid a cluttered background</h2><p> In flower photography, the background can make or break the image. A uniform background can look great – whereas a cluttered, distracting background will draw the eye and prevent the viewer from appreciating your main subject.</p><p> So before you hit the shutter button, take a minute to contemplate the area behind your flower. Look through the camera viewfinder, and ask yourself:</p><p> Does my background complement the flower? Or does it distract?</p><p> If the background adds to the image – or, at the very least – doesn&#39;t detract from it, then go ahead and capture your image. But if the background does seem even slightly distracting (eg, there are jagged branches or unsightly patches of color behind the flower), then it&#39;s probably a good idea to adjust your shot.</p><p> One option is to change your position until the distractions are gone. For instance, you can get down to the ground until the flower is surrounded by clear sky, or you can move slightly to the right or the left to get rid of problematic areas.</p><p> Another move, however, is to use a shallow depth of field to blur the distractions away, as I discuss in the next section:</p><h2 data-section id="use-a-shallow-depth-of-field"> 8. Use a shallow depth of field</h2><p> Shallow depth of field flower photos can look great – but what is a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shallow depth of field</a> , and how do you achieve it?</p><p> A shallow depth of field features only a sliver of sharpness. If you use the effect carefully, you can capture images that feature a sharp flower but a blurry background:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-48696" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/hatley_20090617_006.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="flower photography tips blue flowers with water droplets" class="wp-image-48696" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/hatley_20090617_006.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/hatley_20090617_006.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/hatley_20090617_006.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> As you can perhaps imagine, this does make nailing focus more difficult. Since the plane of sharpness is so narrow, there is very little room for error – but for most flower shooters, the beautiful effect is absolutely worth the effort.</p><p> To get a shallow depth of field, make sure to use a wide <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> (ie, a low f-number) such as f/2.8 or f/4. (This will also allow you to use a faster shutter speed, which will increase the probability that you capture a tack-sharp shot.)</p><p> You should also aim to get as close as you can to your subject; the closer you are to the in-focus area, the stronger the background blur.</p><p> Finally, aim to increase the distance between the flower and the background. More distant backgrounds will be rendered with greater blur, and while the depth of field technically won&#39;t change, it generally looks great. You can look for subjects that sit far in front of background elements, or you can get down low to the ground to ensure the background is composed of distant trees.</p><h2 data-section id="keep-a-part-of-your-flower-sharp"> 9. Keep a part of your flower sharp</h2><p> If you want to master the shallow depth of field effect, it&#39;s important that you keep part of the flower sharp so that your viewer&#39;s eye has an anchor point. Otherwise, people won&#39;t know where to look, and they&#39;ll quickly dismiss the image and move on.</p><p> So do what&#39;s necessary to keep a portion – even if it&#39;s just a <em>small</em> portion – of your images crisp. If you&#39;re shooting in good light, raise your shutter speed and focus carefully. If you&#39;re shooting in poor light, use a tripod and a remote release to avoid camera shake, or boost your ISO as required.</p><p> Remember: Even if there doesn&#39;t seem to be wind, flowers always move a little. It&#39;s often a good idea to check images on your camera&#39;s LCD. Make sure you zoom in, and if your flower isn&#39;t sharp, try raising the shutter speed a stop or two.</p><p> Finally, check your focus. If necessary, <a aria-label="focus manually (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dont-afraid-manual-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">focus manually</a> . Make sure you&#39;ve sharply rendered the most important parts of the flower, such as the petals and the flower center, before you move on to other subjects and compositions.</p><h2 data-section id="change-your-point-of-view"> 10. Change your point of view</h2><p> If you&#39;re after unique flower photos, don&#39;t just take a standard shot. Sure, you can start with conventional angles, but once you&#39;ve captured a few safety images, move around and try some different perspectives and focal lengths.</p><p> For instance, shoot the flower from below to capture an interesting point of view. You may get pretty muddy in the process, but if all goes well, you&#39;ll create a beautiful image featuring a rarely-seen angle. (Getting down low will also help you frame your subject against a white, blue, or even orange sky.)</p><p> You might also try shooting down from above, getting unusually up close and personal, or zooming out for a wider environmental image. The key is to experiment as much as possible, review the results, and try again – with modifications – the next day.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-48686" style="width:333px"><span class="space" style="width:333px; padding-top:150.15%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="333" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/florida_20111215__MG_5075-Edit.jpg?resize=333%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Morning Glory flower" class="wp-image-48686" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/florida_20111215__MG_5075-Edit.jpg?w=333&amp;ssl=1 333w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/florida_20111215__MG_5075-Edit.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="try-intentional-camera-movement-for-flower-abstracts"> 11. Try intentional camera movement for flower abstracts</h2><p> As I&#39;ve emphasized throughout this article, flower photography doesn&#39;t always need to be about sharp and clear images. Sometimes, breaking the rules and trying something unconventional can lead to breathtaking results. One such technique is intentional camera movement (ICM).</p><p> By slowing down your shutter speed to around 1/15s and moving your camera intentionally when pressing the shutter button, you can create abstract shots filled with pure colors and interesting geometries. Side-to-side or up-and-down movements can generate different effects.</p><p> The key here is to turn off any camera or lens image stabilization, as you actually want the shake. The results can certainly be unpredictable, but that&#39;s part of the charm. You&#39;ll need to experiment with different types of movement and shutter speeds, and this can be a <em>lot</em> of fun.</p><p> Sometimes, the unexpected outcomes are the most stunning. Embrace the unpredictability, and don&#39;t be afraid to try various approaches. You might just stumble upon an incredible shot that captures the essence of a flower in a way you never thought possible!</p><h2 data-section id="focus-through-another-flower"> 12. Focus through another flower</h2><p> The <em>shoot-through</em> approach is loved by quite a few professional flower photographers, and for good reason:</p><p> It looks really, <em>really</em> cool, especially when you get a lot of colorful foreground blur.像这样：</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-48683" style="width:333px"><span class="space" style="width:333px; padding-top:150.15%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="333" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/butchart_20090901_102.jpg?resize=333%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="flowers photographed with the shoot-through technique" class="wp-image-48683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/butchart_20090901_102.jpg?w=333&amp;ssl=1 333w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/butchart_20090901_102.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> But how does it work?</p><p> You simply find a flower you want to photograph, then adjust your position until <em>another</em> flower sits between the lens and the flower. (The closer the foreground flower is to the lens, the better the look.)</p><p> Ultimately, the secondary flower will become a blur of color, and your final image will have a more professional feel.</p><p> Make sure you pay careful attention to the position of the foreground flower – it&#39;s important that you don&#39;t completely overwhelm the main subject with a wash of blur. You can also experiment with different apertures and see how they modify the effect.</p><h2 data-section id="photograph-after-the-rain"> 13. Photograph after the rain</h2><p> After a good rain shower, the world outside takes on a fresh appearance that&#39;s especially captivating for flower photography. Cloudy skies create soft, diffused light, which adds a beautiful touch to your images. But what&#39;s even more enticing are the tiny water droplets left on the flowers.</p><p> These droplets create a sense of freshness and enhance the overall aesthetics of the flower. It&#39;s a magical time to head out with your camera, just as the rain stops, to capture these beauties. The reflection and sparkle of water on the petals add a unique dimension to your photographs.</p><p> Some photographers prefer to carry a small spray bottle to recreate this rain effect even when it&#39;s dry outside. It&#39;s an optional trick that you might want to explore.</p><p> Getting up close to highlight the details of water droplets on petals can be thrilling. Experiment with different angles and perspectives to see how the light plays off the water. You might discover a whole new way to see and photograph flowers.</p><h2 data-section id="go-wide"> 14. Go wide</h2><p> Flower photography isn&#39;t just about capturing the intricate details of each petal. While close-up shots have their charm, there&#39;s a whole world of beauty waiting to be explored by going wide. It&#39;s easy to think of flower photography solely in terms of close-up photos. But flowers look amazing from a distance, too. By going wider, you&#39;ll discover not only the allure of a single flower but the visual harmony they create together in a scene.</p><p> You can photograph a patch of flowers to highlight the variety of colors and species within a small area. This approach creates a vibrant and lively scene. Or you can go even wider and capture a field of flowers at sunset, crafting a sort of flower landscape image that tells a more expansive story.</p><p> Even the closest-focusing macro lenses are capable of capturing beautiful wide images, but feel free to experiment with a wide-angle lens or a standard zoom like an 18-55mm kit lens if you&#39;re aiming to capture an expansive scene. Swapping lenses can offer new perspectives, inviting you to see the world of flowers in a fresh, enchanting way!</p><h2 data-section id="dont-forget-about-post-processing"> 15. Don&#39;t forget about post-processing</h2><p> Flower photos can look pretty incredible straight out of the camera, even if you shoot in RAW (which I highly recommend). But if you want the best results, you should definitely spend a bit of time processing your images.</p><p> You see, a few tweaks in editing software can dramatically improve the tones, colors, and overall feel of your shots. The particular adjustments you use will depend on your preferences and goals, but it&#39;s often a good idea to subtly boost the saturation or vibrance for enhanced colors. You might also consider raising the shadows to bring some detail into the darker areas of your shots, dropping the highlights to recover any missing detail in the lighter areas, and boosting the contrast for some extra pop.</p><p> Once you become more familiar with flower photo editing, you can test out more dramatic color alterations, and you can play with local adjustments (where you selectively darken and lighten portions of the shot to help lead the viewer&#39;s eye in a certain direction).</p><h2 data-section id="tips-to-improve-your-flower-photography-final-words"> Tips to improve your flower photography: final words</h2><p> Well, there you have it:</p><p> 15 easy tips to take your flower photos to the next level.</p><p> Hopefully, at least one or two of the tips speaks to you – and you feel inspired to get out and start shooting!

Pick an area that is out of the way of road and foot traffic, where you&#39;re unlikely to be disturbed. If you can, head to the location a few days before the shoot and ensure your view of the horizon will be unobstructed and free of any hazards. (Also make sure that you&#39;ll be able to easily access the location; you&#39;ll be walking around with your camera in the dark, after all!)</p><p> As the photoshoot nears, frequently check the <a aria-label="weather (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/time-for-landscape-weather-and-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">weather</a> . If your shooting time coincides with an approaching or recently ended storm, the results can be staggering. Rain and storm clouds can add a dramatic layer of dimension to the scene. But you should also take steps to stay safe; don&#39;t go out if lightning is visible, and make sure you carry a flashlight to help you find your way in the dark.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255485" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-106.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Sunrise photography" class="wp-image-255485" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-106.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-106.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-106.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-106.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-106.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-106.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> It&#39;s also important that you pay careful attention to the sunrise time. You don&#39;t want to arrive on location only to find that the sun is already above the horizon! I&#39;d recommend pinpointing the perfect time to shoot by using an online tool or smartphone app that displays precise sunrise times for your location.

You can shoot straight into the sunrise, yes – but you can also try turning your camera until you get beautiful texture and drama in the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/using-layers-foreground-interest-better-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="foreground elements (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">foreground elements</a> (eg, rocks, trees, or ocean waves).</p><p> You should also try turning around completely; for one, the display to the west is often equally stunning, plus the area behind you will be <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/front-light-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="front lit (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">front lit</a> rather than <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/backlighting-in-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="backlit (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">backlit</a> and therefore offer a completely different sense of atmosphere.</p><p> By the way, if you&#39;re after ethereal, even <em>surreal</em> photos, make sure you start shooting before the sun rises. The time just before the sun comes up is known as the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-quick-tips-for-better-blue-hour-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="blue hour (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">blue hour</a> , and it&#39;s a favorite of <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/11-surefire-tips-for-improving-your-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="landscape photographers (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">landscape photographers</a> .</p><p> Also, bear in mind that your camera will try to neutralize the warming effect produced by sunrise lighting. If you <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/raw-vs-jpeg/" target="_blank" aria-label="shoot in RAW (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shoot in RAW</a> , you can always remove this <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/introduction-to-white-balance/" target="_blank" aria-label="white balance setting (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">white balance setting</a> in post-processing – but it&#39;s often a good idea to adjust your in-camera white balance options so you can get an accurate image preview on your LCD. Try setting the camera to one of its cooler presets (such as Shade) and see whether you like the results.</p><h2 data-section id="plan-your-sunrise-photos-in-advance"> 3.

Do I want to capture a clear subject lit by the sunlight? Or will the sunrise itself be the star of the show? You don&#39;t have to commit to an approach in advance – and you can always try out multiple options once you&#39;re in position – but the sunrise will occur quickly, and if you&#39;re not prepared, you&#39;ll miss out on the action.</p><p> When planning beforehand, you should also think about any other special considerations.

(I&#39;d recommend packing your bag the night before; that way, you don&#39;t accidentally forget any equipment in the rush to leave!)</p><p> First and foremost, you&#39;ll want to bring your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-tripods-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="tripod (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">tripod</a> . The first handful of minutes before the sun has fully risen won&#39;t offer much light, so you&#39;ll need a steady base for your camera. This is even more important if you plan to shoot in the blue hour before sunrise or if you need to do HDR bracketing.</p><p> Second, you&#39;ll want to bring the <a aria-label="right lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lens-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">right lens</a> for the shoot. While beautiful landscapes can be captured using a 50mm to 85mm focal length, a <a aria-label="wide-angle lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-reasons-love-ultra-wide-lenses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">wide-angle lens</a> is generally best. If you&#39;re just starting out, a kit zoom lens (such as an 18-55mm model) will get the job done, but if you have a prime lens in the 12mm to 24mm range, you&#39;ll have a better chance of capturing a sharper image, and you&#39;ll be able to capture a vast, sweeping portion of the scene.</p><p> Third, make sure you&#39;re using a decent camera. Sensor size and megapixel count make a big difference, especially if you want to create prints of your sunrise photos. Comfort matters, too, and it can be helpful to hold a few cameras in your hands before buying.</p><p> Battery life is a crucial but often overlooked aspect. The cold morning air can drain batteries quickly, and the last thing you want is for your camera to die just as the sun breaks the horizon. (If your camera doesn&#39;t offer impressive battery life, you can compensate by carrying several spare batteries; it&#39;s a simple precaution that I highly recommend!)</p><p> Finally, although filters can subtly degrade image quality, some can be useful for sunrise photography. As I mentioned above, a GND (graduated neutral density) filter will balance the scene by darkening the upper portion of the sky so you can capture a well-exposed and dramatic shot. And a neutral density filter will block out light, which is helpful if you want to use <a aria-label="long-exposure techniques (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/step-by-step-guide-to-long-exposure-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">long-exposure techniques</a> to blur clouds and/or water.</p><h2 data-section id="use-the-right-sunrise-camera-settings"> 5.

As with smaller apertures, this shouldn&#39;t be a problem if you&#39;re using a tripod, but if you&#39;re handholding your camera, you&#39;ll need to bump up the ISO to get a shutter speed fast enough to avoid a blurry photo (generally at least 1/60s).</p><p> And although you can shoot in <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> , I personally prefer to shoot almost everything in <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-versus-shutter-priority-which-shooting-mode/" target="_blank" aria-label="Aperture Priority (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Aperture Priority</a> . That way, I can lock my aperture and let the camera choose the shutter speed that will create a balanced exposure. Since low-light situations can confuse the camera and cause overexposure, you can always use your camera&#39;s <a aria-label="exposure compensation settings (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-exposure-compensation-to-take-control-of-your-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure compensation</a> to subtly reduce the brightness.</p><p> I also recommend choosing your white balance in advance. As I mentioned above, you can use this setting to boost (or reduce) the warmth of your shot. If you&#39;re after a warm, orangish image, set your white balance to Shade or Daylight. If you&#39;re after a cooler effect, try using the Tungsten preset.</p><p> And, of course, <em>always</em> shoot in RAW! That way, you can adjust the white balance in post-processing, and you can even recover missing shadows and highlights after the fact.</p><h2 data-section id="capture-sunrise-silhouettes"> 6.

But how do you get the best results?</p><p> First, capturing the perfect silhouette during sunrise requires you to identify a strong subject. This could be a tree, a building, or even a person; you want to showcase a clear outline that stands out and really catches the viewer&#39;s eye.</p><p> Position your subject between yourself and the sun. Finding the right position may require some trial and error, so don&#39;t be afraid to move around and try different angles.</p><p> Finally, make sure you expose for the sky, not the silhouetted subject. So set your exposure using the sky just behind your subject. It may feel counterintuitive, but exposing for the sky helps maintain the silhouette effect while preserving the delicate hues of the sunrise.</p><h2 data-section id="compose-to-add-interest"> 7.

While this <em>can</em> make for a nice photo, it normally creates too much symmetry and can make the picture seem static and boring. An alternative is to <a aria-label="use the rule of thirds (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">use the rule of thirds</a> , which encourages you to position the horizon a third of the way into the scene; that way, you end up with a more dynamic, engaging shot.</p><p> Don&#39;t just apply the rule of thirds thoughtlessly, however. Take a moment to look your scene over. Ask yourself: What part of the sunrise or sunset is the most dramatic? Are there any parts that aren&#39;t that interesting?</p><p> Once you&#39;ve done this, simply compose the shot to include <em>more</em> of the most dramatic scenery. If you have an angry, cloudy sky that accentuates the sunlight, let that occupy the upper two-thirds of the scene. If you have an interesting foreground but a less intriguing sky, let that occupy the bottom two-thirds of the image.</p><p> It&#39;s generally best to <em>draw</em> the viewer into the composition, then let their eyes slowly move toward the stunning sunrise.</p><h2 data-section id="add-compelling-foreground-elements"> 8.

Foreground elements will give your sunrise photos depth and interest. Look for rocks, flowers, or other natural elements to include in the frame. By adding these elements, you can create a compelling composition that draws the eye through the image.</p><p> Position your foreground elements thoughtfully. You want them to add to the composition, not distract from the sunrise. Consider the lines and shapes that these elements create and how they interact with the rest of the scene.</p><p> In a previous tip, I mentioned the value of a wide-angle lens, but when working with foreground elements, the wide perspective becomes more important than ever. This can create a grand, sweeping view that encapsulates not just the sunrise, but the entire landscape. A wide-angle lens can make the foreground seem more prominent, so it&#39;s essential to compose your shots carefully to keep the balance.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255494" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-1010.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="Sunrise photography" class="wp-image-255494" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-1010.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-1010.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-1010.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-1010.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-1010.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Focus close to the foreground elements to ensure they&#39;re sufficiently sharp with the sunrise serving as a beautiful backdrop. And experiment with different depths of field. A wide aperture (like f/2.8 or f/4) can blur the sunrise slightly and make your foreground elements stand out. Alternatively, a smaller aperture (like f/8 or f/11) can keep everything in focus, creating a more detailed and layered image.</p><h2 data-section id="wait-for-the-right-shot"> 9.

Other times, however, waiting is the name of the game. Due to the dynamics of natural lighting, a scene can completely change from one hour to the next (sometimes even from one <em>minute</em> to the next).</p><p> That&#39;s why you should arrive on location before the sunrise starts and stay until the sunrise ends. Sure, you&#39;ll be there for a while, but you can spend that time testing out different settings and being creative. Try different exposure times and play with your aperture. Let the clouds and sun change positions or move your camera higher or lower for a slightly different angle. And include additional subjects in the frame; put them in the foreground so they contrast with the sunrise.</p><p> The longer you&#39;re on location shooting, the more variety you&#39;ll end up with – and the better your chances of capturing an <em>incredible</em> shot.</p><h2 data-section id="try-hdr-techniques"> 10.

(Note that you <em>can</em> create the same effect using a graduated neutral density filter, but these accessories are often expensive and less flexible.)</p><p> You&#39;ll want to use a tripod to ensure that your camera is stable because HDR requires multiple shots at different exposures. The shooting process is pretty simple: compose your image, then capture a handful of shots at different exposure levels. Make sure at least one file exposes for the sky, one file exposes for the midtones, and another exposes for the shadows.</p><p> You&#39;ll then need to merge the files in software like Photoshop. When merging the images, play around with the settings in your software to make it look natural.

Don&#39;t rely on your camera to pick the shutter speed. Instead, choose a shooting mode that lets <em>you</em> dial in the shutter speed directly – either <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/" target="_blank" aria-label="Shutter Priority mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Shutter Priority mode</a> or <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> .</p><p> Shutter Priority mode lets you select the shutter speed and the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> (which essentially refers to the sensitivity of the camera sensor to light), while the camera automatically picks the aperture. If you set your camera to Shutter Priority, I recommend setting the ISO as high as you can without risking image-ruining noise. (I have no problem going to ISO 3200 on my camera, though you should test out your own camera model to get a sense of its high-ISO capabilities.)</p><p> Then you&#39;ll need to set your shutter speed. I&#39;d recommend starting at 1/125s; you want to set a shutter speed that&#39;s fast enough to freeze the action but no faster than necessary. If the shutter speed is too fast, your images will be sharp, but they&#39;ll be dark (ie, underexposed).</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255449" style="width:2250px"><span class="space" style="width:2250px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2250" height="1500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-12.jpg?resize=2250%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Tips for breathtaking aquarium photography" class="wp-image-255449" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-12.jpg?w=2250&amp;ssl=1 2250w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-12.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-12.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-12.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-12.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-12.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-12.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-12.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Manual mode, on the other hand, lets you select your ISO, your shutter speed, <em>and</em> your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> . It&#39;s a good mode for more seasoned photographers, so if you&#39;re comfortable with such an approach, I recommend setting your ISO as high as you can stomach, opening the lens aperture as much as you can (or are comfortable doing from a creative perspective), and then set your shutter speed to 1/125s or faster.</p><p> You&#39;ll then need to adjust the shutter speed to ensure a perfect <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure</a> ; it&#39;s important to pay attention to the exposure bar in the viewfinder, though you can also capture several shots, view them on the LCD screen, and make adjustments accordingly.</p><p> Here are my typical aquarium photography settings:</p><ul><li> ISO 3200</li><li> f/2.8</li><li> 1/60s</li></ul><p> However, shooting at 1/60s takes practice <em>and</em> only works with slower subjects, so don&#39;t be afraid to widen your aperture, boost your ISO, and bump your shutter speed as required.</p><h2 data-section id="the-best-aquarium-photography-gear"> The best aquarium photography gear</h2><p> Aquarium photography is an exciting endeavor, but having the right gear is often essential to success. Here are a few key items to consider:</p><h3 data-section id="a-powerful-camera"> A powerful camera</h3><p> I encourage you to you opt for a DSLR or a mirrorless camera; these models generally give you manual control over settings so you can adjust different elements to suit different aquarium environments. They offer the flexibility to play with exposure, focus, and other essential elements so you can capture stunning underwater aquarium images.</p><p> Low-light performance is another crucial aspect to consider. Aquariums are often dimly lit, and using flash can create unnecessary reflections. A camera with an impressive high ISO performance allows you to shoot in these conditions without compromising on clarity.</p><p> Finally, shooting in RAW can be a lifesaver. It provides more latitude in post-processing, enabling you to correct colors, balance exposure, and ensure that your photos look exactly how you envisioned.</p><h3 data-section id="a-carefully-chosen-lens"> A carefully chosen lens</h3><p> The lens you choose can significantly impact the quality and creativity of your aquarium photographs. A versatile zoom lens gives you the flexibility to compose shots, particularly in confined spaces where moving around might be restricted. With a good zoom range, you can capture both close-ups and wider shots without needing to switch lenses continually.</p><p> If you plan on taking detailed shots of smaller species, a macro lens becomes essential. It enables you to get up close and personal with the subjects, capturing every intricate detail. Pair this with a wide maximum aperture like f/2.8, and you&#39;re equipped to shoot in especially dark environments. (A wide aperture lets in more light, allowing for faster shutter speeds and reducing the risk of motion blur.</p><p> When investing in lenses, remember that quality matters and that reputable brands generally offer superior performance and build.</p><h3 data-section id="best-accessories-for-aquarium-photography"> Best accessories for aquarium photography</h3><p> Aquarium photography doesn&#39;t technically <em>require</em> any accessories; that said, many photographers do prefer to work with a tripod when possible. Not only do tripods keep your camera stable in low light, but they can also be a big help when composing each image.</p><p> Unfortunately, tripods are often off-limits at most aquariums. If tripods are not allowed or impractical, a monopod can be a good alternative. It provides some stabilization without being as intrusive as a full tripod.</p><p> Additional accessories can also play a vital role in a successful aquarium photography session. Extra batteries and memory cards are essential, as aquarium photography can be time-consuming and you don&#39;t want to miss that perfect shot. Keeping your lens clean from smudges, especially when shooting close to the glass, will ensure your images remain clear, so don&#39;t forget your lens cleaning supplies.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255454" style="width:2135px"><span class="space" style="width:2135px; padding-top:70.26%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2135" height="1500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=2135%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Tips for breathtaking aquarium photography" class="wp-image-255454" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-5-1.jpg?w=2135&amp;ssl=1 2135w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=300%2C211&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=600%2C422&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=768%2C540&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C1079&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=2048%2C1439&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=717%2C504&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="essential-tips-for-aquarium-photography"> Essential tips for aquarium photography</h2><p> Now that you&#39;re familiar with the basic gear and settings for photographing aquariums, let&#39;s take things to the next level with a handful of my best tips, starting with:</p><h3 data-section id="turn-off-your-flash-and-get-close"> 1.

But while aquariums <em>are</em> extremely dark, you definitely don&#39;t want the flash to fire; it&#39;ll create a huge reflection on the glass that&#39;ll almost certainly ruin your photo.</p><p> So before you even enter the aquarium, make sure to disable your flash.</p><p> Even with the flash deactivated, however, you still might encounter some ambient light reflecting off the glass, which will distract the viewer and can make your subjects appear less sharp.

To combat this, you&#39;ll likely need to use slower shutter speeds, which in turn can lead to camera shake and blurry images. As I discussed above, if the aquarium&#39;s rules allow it, a tripod or monopod is a great solution. But if not, there are still ways to stabilize your camera.</p><p> First, utilize any built-in stabilization that your camera or lens might offer. This technology can significantly reduce the effect of small movements and vibrations. If your camera doesn&#39;t have this feature, pay close attention to your posture and grip. Holding the camera with both hands and tucking your elbows into your body can provide extra stability.</p><p> Another useful method is to find support within the environment. Leaning against a wall or resting the camera on a solid surface can help. Remember, practicing and finding what works best for you in different situations is key. Every aquarium is unique, and mastering the art of handheld shooting can open up new opportunities in this fascinating world of underwater photography.</p><h3 data-section id="try-manual-focus"> 3.

This is where utilizing manual focus can make all the difference. Unlike autofocus, which frequently accidentally targets reflections or smudges on the glass, manual focus puts you in control, allowing you to pinpoint exactly what part of the scene you want to be sharp.</p><p> If you&#39;re new to manual focus, it might seem intimidating at first. Start by practicing on larger, more stationary subjects within the aquarium. Many modern cameras offer features like focus peaking, which highlights the in-focus areas on your screen and helps guide your adjustments. These aids can be incredibly effective as you learn to navigate manual focus.</p><p> Keep in mind that mastering manual focus is a skill that takes time and patience to develop. However, once you&#39;ve honed this skill, the creative control it offers can be incredibly rewarding. Whether you&#39;re trying to capture a detailed close-up of a coral or track a fast-moving shark, manual focus enables you to decide what&#39;s important in the scene, ensuring that your photos turn out exactly as you envisioned them.</p><h3 data-section id="adjust-your-angle-to-make-your-shots-more-interesting"> 4.

You often simply need to angle your camera to include bright light in the background, then wait for a subject to swim over. Fire off a shot, then check your camera LCD. If the image is too bright, simply raise your shutter speed or add in some <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-exposure-compensation-to-take-control-of-your-exposure/" target="_blank" aria-label="negative exposure compensation (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">negative exposure compensation</a> until the subject turns into a perfect silhouette!</p><p> You can also capture gorgeous silhouettes of people standing by the aquarium glass. Children, for instance, are often captivated by sea creatures, and parents are often captivated by watching their kids! This next silhouette shot happened quite naturally because the aquarium tank was really bright compared to the people in the foreground:</p><p> Depending on its settings, your camera may produce a similar result, or you may need to make the exposure adjustments discussed above. Unfortunately, when shooting toward glass from a distance, you&#39;ll often end up with some ambient light reflections, but if they bother you, you can always remove them during post-processing.</p><h3 data-section id="consider-the-direction-of-the-light"> 7.

Enhance your photos with a bit of editing</h3><p> It&#39;s always important to capture the best possible images while you&#39;re actually at the aquarium. But once the chaos of your trip is over, you can relax, sift through your photos, and – if you want to really take the files to the next level – spend some time editing.</p><p> Note that editing isn&#39;t necessarily about creating unrealistic, over-the-top results. Instead, it&#39;s often about recreating the scene as it was.

While this creates a lively atmosphere, it also means that as a photographer, you must be mindful of your surroundings. Being considerate of others, ensuring you&#39;re not blocking views, and avoiding bumping into fellow visitors is paramount. Always be aware of where your camera equipment is, use straps to secure it, and be careful not to obstruct pathways or exhibits.</p><p> Sometimes, the most unique angles and captivating shots are found in unexpected places. Look beyond the main exhibits and explore different viewpoints, and don&#39;t be afraid to venture into lesser-visited tanks or corners of the aquarium. This exploration can lead you to hidden gems and offer great photo opportunities away from the crowds.</p><p> An interesting aspect of aquarium photography is capturing human interaction with the exhibits. Observing how children marvel at a giant fish tank or how a couple enjoys a tranquil jellyfish display can add a new layer of storytelling to your photography. These candid shots can convey emotions and human connection to the aquatic world, making your photos more engaging and relatable.</p><p> Lastly, it&#39;s essential to understand and respect the rules and guidelines of the aquarium. From keeping tripods and monopods out of the way to obeying any flash photography restrictions, adhering to the aquarium&#39;s policies ensures a pleasant experience for everyone. Plus, it reflects well on the photography community so everyone can maintain a good relationship with these amazing venues.</p><h2 data-section id="tips-for-aquarium-photography-final-words"> Tips for aquarium photography: final words</h2><p> Well, there you have it:</p><p> My top tips for improving your aquarium images!
