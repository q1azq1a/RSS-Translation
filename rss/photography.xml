HDR 转换有几个优点：</p><ol><li><strong>你省钱了。</strong>大多数 HDR 插件都不是免费的，如果您在工作流程中依赖不同的编辑器或专用 HDR 程序，则可能需要支付大量费用。但如果您已经订阅了 Lightroom，则内置 HDR 合并功能。</li><li> <strong>Lightroom 的 HDR 合并可创建自然的 HDR 图像。</strong>并不是每个人都会认为这是一个优势，但 Lightroom 在避免花哨、过度饱和的 HDR 照片方面做得很好。</li><li><strong>您不需要大量<a aria-label="bracketed images (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/bracketing-what-is-it-and-what-to-do-with-the-images/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">括号内的图像</a>。</strong>根据我的经验，两个就足以获得良好的结果：一个在 -2 档曝光，另一个在 +2 档曝光。 （如果需要，您可以使用更多括号内的文件，如果您有一个对比鲜明的场景，这可能是一个好主意 - 但一般来说，两个应该可以很好地工作。）</li><li><strong>最终的 HDR 图像保存为 DNG 文件。</strong> DNG 文件不仅比 TIFF 文件小，而且您可以像处理任何其他 DNG 或 RAW 文件一样在 Lightroom 中处理它。主要区别在于“曝光”滑块从 -10 到 + 10 档运行，而不是正常的 -4 到 +4。当您使用“阴影”和“高光”滑块进行调整时（以及使用 Lightroom 的遮罩工具应用有针对性的调整时），该文件中还提供了更多信息供 Lightroom 使用。</li><li><strong>您可以手持拍摄带括号的序列，Lightroom 会自动对齐它们。</strong> Lightroom 的自动对齐选项可让您处理多张不具有相同取景框的照片。话虽如此，我发现最好的结果确实来自使用三脚架安装的相机拍摄的包围照片！ </li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading"

图像预览。请注意，加载预览可能需要一些时间，特别是当您选择了很多图像进行合并时。</p><p>您可能会惊讶地发现没有太多需要调整的设置。这是经过深思熟虑的 - 目的是让 Lightroom 生成看起来自然的 HDR 图像，然后您可以<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/steps-for-getting-started-in-the-lightroom-develop-module/">在“修改照片”模块中对其进行处理</a>以实现您想要的外观。但你确实有几个选择：</p><p>默认情况下， <strong>“自动对齐”</strong>和<strong>“自动设置”</strong>框将被选中，并且“<strong>去重影量”</strong>将设置为<strong>“无”</strong> 。 （如果您更改设置，Lightroom 会记住您最后的输入，因此请务必确保在继续之前使用正确的设置！）</p><p>这些 HDR 合并设置有什么作用？</p><p>如果相机在曝光之间移动（这通常发生在手持时），自动对齐非常有用。如果选中此框，Lightroom 将排列不同的图像，使混合文件看起来自然。</p><p>自动设置与修改照片模块的基本面板中的自动设置执行类似的功能。</p><p>我发现 HDR 合并在勾选“自动对齐”和“自动设置”框时效果最佳（见下文）。还有更改去<strong>重影量的</strong>选项 - 此处的目标是防止因帧之间的主体移动而导致的任何伪影（例如线条或模糊）。如果您的场景完全静止，只需将设置保留为<strong>“无”</strong>即可；但是，如果镜头之间存在运动，例如一棵树在风中摇曳或一个人在风景中小跑，您可以将“消重影量”设置为<strong>“低</strong>”、 <strong>“中</strong>”或<strong>“高”</strong> 。</p><p>您无法在 HDR 合并预览窗口中放大至 100%，因此只有在进入“修改照片”模块并放大至 1:1 后，您可能才会意识到重影。如果您在该阶段发现重影，您可以随时返回并重新处理图像。您可以勾选<strong>“显示重影叠加”</strong>框以显示 Lightroom 检测到重影的区域。</p><p> （你怎么知道哪个 Deghost 量最好？老实说，你只需要反复试验——每组图像都是不同的。）</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-98997" style="width:717px"><span class="space"

data-section id="jpegs"> JPEG</h2><p>当您拍照时，您的相机实际上正在获取从图像传感器接收的数据并创建文件。在数字化的早期，一群专家聚集在一起，商定了一种每个人都可以使用的文件格式。它被称为“JPEG”，代表“联合摄影专家组”。</p><p>这个想法是每个人都可以使用相同的格式，因此很容易共享。你知道吗？效果很好。 JPEG 或多或少无处不在。如果您拿起相机并开始拍摄，您通常会创建 JPEG 文件。它几乎是每个专用相机的默认设置。由于互联网浏览器开发人员始终在其软件中内置 JPEG 支持，因此您在网上看到的几乎所有图片都采用这种格式。</p><p>但是当您的相机创建 JPEG 时，会发生一些事情。首先是相机对图片数据进行了压缩，因此文件大小更小。 JPEG 只会使用相机捕获的大约四分之一的数据，因此会丢弃大量数据。其中一些是颜色数据，这是通过减少可用颜色的数量来完成的（尽管 JPEG 中仍然有很多可用的颜色）。您会看到最大影响的是高光和阴影，其中可能会丢失一些细节。</p><p>此外，当创建 JPEG 时，您的相机会对图片进行一些处理。相机制造商知道您希望相机发出的照片看起来清晰且色彩丰富。因此，它们在渲染 JPEG 文件时添加了一些效果，例如清晰度、对比度和饱和度。好处是你的照片通常看起来更好一点，但缺点是你无法控制整个过程，有时你的相机的处理与你想要的不匹配。</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image

RAW的优势</h2><p>在大多数相机中，您可以进入菜单并将文件格式更改为“RAW”。不，实际上并不存在某种称为 RAW 的通用文件格式。相反，每台相机都有自己的方式来捆绑从图像传感器接收的数据，以创建自己的专有文件（尼康为 NEF，佳能为 CRW 或 CR2，富士为 RAF 等）。生成的文件称为“RAW”。</p><p>您可能已经注意到一个问题：由于 RAW 文件的格式不同，因此它们不容易共享。此外，RAW 文件很大，通常是 JPEG 文件大小的 3-4 倍。</p><p>那么为什么几乎每个人都建议拍摄 RAW 格式呢？因为它们包含更多信息。还记得 JPEG 如何丢弃数据来创建更小的文件吗？ RAW 文件保留所有这些数据。这意味着您保留所有颜色数据，并以高光和阴影细节的方式保留所有内容。</p><p>此外，虽然相机在创建 JPEG 时会添加处理，但在创建 RAW 文件时不会发生这种情况。这意味着您可以控制整个过程。您可以添加您想要的任何级别的清晰度、对比度、饱和度等（当然，假设您可以访问 RAW 处理程序）。相机不会为你做出这些决定。</p><p>当然，RAW 文件更大，但效果更好。<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-save-images-using-export-in-lightroom/">稍后您可以随时从 RAW 文件创建 JPEG</a> ，完成编辑后可以使用该文件在线共享照片。 </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-132875 size-full

id="shooting-both-raws-and-jpegs">同时拍摄 RAW 和 JPEG</h2><p>所以 RAW 文件是正确的选择，对吧？您将保留所有颜色数据，更不用说高光和阴影细节了。您可以完全控制图片的处理。这一定是值得的，对吧？</p><p>一般来说，这是事实：RAW 文件值得创建。但如果您根本不打算处理照片怎么办？然后以 JPEG 格式拍摄是否有意义，因为从相机中出来的文件看起来效果最好？或者，如果您需要立即分享照片，但没有时间进行任何编辑，该怎么办？</p><p>这就是为什么我鼓励您同时拍摄 RAW 和 JPEG 文件！您的相机可能有一个设置，允许您同时执行这两种操作 - 这样每次拍照时，相机都会创建一个 RAW 文件和一个 JPEG 文件。这将使您拥有<em>两种</em>文件类型的所有优点。</p><p>这对你有什么好处？以下是RAW+JPEG拍摄的优点：</p><ul><li><strong>您有一个 JPEG 可以立即使用</strong>。假设您的相机中有 Wi-Fi，或者想要快速将图像传输到计算机并立即共享照片。 JPEG 对此很有意义。 RAW 文件则不然。它们不容易分享，而且从相机里出来的效果也不是最好的。</li><li><strong>它使照片能够面向未来</strong>。如果您使用佳能相机创建 RAW 文件，但 10 年后佳能倒闭了怎么办？随着时间的推移，您的 RAW 文件会失去支持吗？这似乎不太可能，但 Adob​​e 一直在推出自己的跨平台解决方案，称为 DNG（数字负片），这已经是一个大问题了。如果您有 JPEG，那么这不太可能成为问题。虽然一些相机现在提供以 HEIC 格式拍摄的选项（类似于 JPEG，但在图像质量方面更出色），但 JPEG 仍然更受欢迎且得到更好的支持。</li><li><strong>您可以看到相机如何处理文件</strong>。如果计算机上的 RAW 文件旁边有 JPEG，您可以看到相机决定如何处理照片。换句话说，您可以看到添加了多少锐化、对比度和饱和度，如果您喜欢， <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/match-image-processing-reference-view-lightroom/">可以在自己进行处理时模仿该效果</a>。当您刚刚开始并尝试决定向照片添加多少处理时，这可能会很有帮助。</li><li><strong>您可以获得准确的 LCD 预览</strong>。当您在 LCD 上查看照片时，您会看到该照片的 JPEG 版本，即使您实际上是以 RAW 格式拍摄的。您可以通过<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/customize-your-images-camera-picture-styles/">“图片样式”</a>添加不同的处理效果，包括黑白，并且无论如何您都会看到这些效果 - 但如果您以 RAW 格式拍摄，当您将文件导入 Lightroom 或 Capture One 等程序时，这些效果将会消失。但是，如果您同时拍摄 RAW 和 JPEG，则相机将生成添加了效果的 JPEG 以及不添加效果的 RAW。因此，如果您想在保持 RAW 文件完整性的同时查看效果，那么捕获两者可能会有所帮助。 </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="why-not-shoot-only-raw">为什么不只拍摄RAW？</h2><p>但等一下，你可能会想。当然，这些 JPEG 优势相当小，特别是如果您无论如何都打算编辑图像的话。何必为这一切烦恼呢？为什么不直接用 RAW 格式拍摄呢？</p><p>是的，JPEG 的优势<em>很小</em>，但与此同时，成本是多少？几乎什么也没有。随着时间的推移，数据变得越来越便宜。添加 JPEG 几乎不需要任何成本。现在的存储卡可以保存数百甚至数千张照片，而且它们现在非常便宜。现在您可以<a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Extreme-UHS-I-Memory-SDSDXXG-064G-GN4IN/dp/B01J5RHD58/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503256803&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=64gb+sd+card&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dpsgeneral-20&amp;linkId=994eeac49d199352bc7d586d5b069e75"

target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenersponsored nofollow noopener" class="ek-link">只需 200 美元即可获得可存储 TB 数据的</a>硬盘。这些价格继续下降。与 RAW 文件相比，JPEG 占用的空间很小。因此，虽然我同意添加 JPEG 对于大多数拍摄者来说并没有太大的好处，但它也没有太大的缺点。</p><p>然而，还有一个方面我没有提到，那就是速度。请记住，您的相机必须将所有数据写入您的卡。如果您一次拍摄几张照片（或一次一张），这将不是一个因素。但如果您<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/capturing-action-wildlife-photos/">拍摄体育运动或野生动物，</a>非常需要每秒最大帧数，那么就会产生额外的费用。写入附加文件的时间会减慢您的速度。在这种情况下，我绝对可以想象放弃额外的文件并选择仅以 RAW 格式拍摄。但对于我们大多数人来说，这并不适用。</p><div

data-section id="the-materials">材料</h3><p>正如我上面所说，DIY 地面吊舱的材料根本不应该花费太多。你会需要：</p><ol><li><strong>一个便宜的煎锅</strong>，直径约 10-12 英寸。您可以选择适合您的任何直径的煎锅，但较宽的煎锅将提供更多支撑，尤其是当您使用较大的长焦镜头时。平底锅的深度应约为 1-1.5 英寸 - 任何更深的深度都会使调整三脚架头变得更加困难，但任何更浅的深度都会减少对水溅、泥土和沙子的保护。</li><li> <strong>3/8” 内六角螺栓</strong>，长约 0.5 英寸。优选圆头或大圆头螺栓。如果锅足够厚，沉头是理想的选择；然而，便宜的平底锅通常太薄，无法实用。注意：在一些国际五金店很难买到英制尺寸的螺栓，因此，如果您位于美国境外，这可能需要一些互联网搜索。</li><li><strong>一个三脚架头</strong>。这在技术上是可选的。您可以将相机直接连接到地面吊舱，但这会限制您的拍摄动作，并且在尝试确保镜头脱离垫唇时也可能会遇到问题。因此，我喜欢使用三脚架云台（我在写这篇文章时就考虑到了三脚架云台的使用）。如果您还没有三脚架云台，可以在 eBay

Model releases are usually brief – no more than a paragraph – but they can get quite long, especially if the model wants to add additional conditions to the release (eg, no Photoshop).</p><p> We&#39;ll get into the specific contents of the model release in a bit. For now, though, know that a model release is a crucial piece of paper for any photograph that&#39;s used commercially. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-do-i-know-if-i-need-a-model-release"> How do I know if I need a model release?</h2><p> Not all photoshoots that include people require model releases, so it&#39;s important to start by understanding whether a release is necessary for the type of photography you&#39;ll be doing.</p><p> You should always start with a basic premise:</p><p> Whether you need a model release does <em>not</em> primarily depend on the content of the image. Rather, it depends on the image&#39;s <em>use</em> .</p><p> When you start with this premise – that the need is primarily dictated by the use and not the content – you are left with a pretty basic set of questions: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="question-will-the-photo-be-used-commercially"> Question 1: Will the photo be used commercially?</h3><p> The first question you should ask when determining the importance of a model release is “Will this photo be used commercially?” If the answer is “Yes,” you need a model release. If the answer is “No,” you do not need a model release.很简单，对吧？不完全的！ （继续阅读。）</p><p> Just because an image is published does not, in and of itself, automatically mean that the use is commercial. For instance, work that will only appear in newspapers, educational books, and consumer or trade publications does not need a model release because it is editorial use, sometimes referred to as “fair use.”</p><p> Commercial usage, on the other hand, can include advertisements, brochures, web use, greeting cards, catalogs, newsletters, etc. For commercial, licensed use, you absolutely, positively <em>must</em> have a model release.</p><p> What is and isn&#39;t commercial use can sometimes be confusing. Assume that you have taken a photo of a popular local chef, but you haven&#39;t obtained a signed model release. Your friend is the publisher of a local newspaper and he pays you for the photograph for use in an article they are running about the restaurant. Because the photo is being used as part of a news story, this constitutes editorial use. The fact that money changed hands does not automatically render it a commercially used photograph, and the lack of a model release isn&#39;t a problem.</p><p> If, however, the restaurant&#39;s PR agency wants to use the same photo as part of an ad campaign, you will need a model release. Remember, whether a model release is necessary depends on the use, not the content – here, we&#39;re talking about the same photo, but with two different uses. One needs the release and one does not. Ultimately, there is no way of knowing whether you need a model release until you can answer the question of <em>how the photo will be used</em> .</p><p> The examples below illustrate the importance of the intended use when determining whether you need a model release. The protest image (on the left) was taken as part of a news story about cuts to the state budget for publicly funded art programs. It was editorial use, and therefore no model release was required. The chess game photo (top right) was for a commercial publication on local tourism. It required a model release for its original use, though it does <em>not</em> require a model release for its editorial publication here on dPS. The crowd shot at the bottom appeared in a news article about public education, which, as you now know, requires no model release.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/002-model-release-examples1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-58471"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-58471" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:71.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="429" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/002-model-release-examples1.jpg?resize=600%2C429&#038;ssl=1" alt="The intended use determines whether you need a model release." class="wp-image-58471" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/002-model-release-examples1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/002-model-release-examples1.jpg?resize=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The intended use determines whether you need a model release!

But just like the shifting boundaries mentioned above, what does and does not constitute “uniquely identifiable” is not always cut and dry. Remember, there are ways to identify or recognize someone in a photo other than just their face. Sometimes a silhouette, a tattoo, a uniform, or even a location can identify a person without necessarily showing their face – and in those situations, you&#39;ll still need a model release.</p><p> At first glance, the three photos below appear to have no recognizable subjects, which might lead you to think that model releases wouldn&#39;t be necessary, regardless of whether the image use was commercial or editorial.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/003-model-release-examples2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-58472"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-58472" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:71.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="429" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/003-model-release-examples2.jpg?resize=600%2C429&#038;ssl=1" alt="Are your subjects identifiable?

You may think they aren&#39;t – but you might have to think again.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Let&#39;s assume that all three images are indeed designated for commercial use. As far as the Parkview High School students (the top image) are concerned, let&#39;s face it: parents and friends can identify each student easily, body paint, wigs, and sunglasses notwithstanding.</p><p> Tattoos (bottom left) are also fairly distinctive, rendering it a moot point that you can&#39;t see the tattoo artist&#39;s face in the photograph. The ink on her arms could be enough for someone to recognize her.</p><p> Finally, the artist in the park can theoretically be recognized, not because of anything distinctive about her from this angle, but because of the distinctive nature of her painting.</p><p> In other words, all three of the example images will require a model release, plain and simple (assuming they&#39;re going to be used commercially). </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="question-how-and-where-was-the-photo-taken"> Question 3: How and where was the photo taken?</h3><p> At first glance, it doesn&#39;t seem like this question should make a difference, but it does. This is where things like travel, candid, and street photography come into play. Photos I take in public places – streets, fairs, parks, festivals, etc. – generally do not require model releases, especially if they&#39;re destined to reside only in my portfolio or on my walls.</p><p> Again, however, if I think there&#39;s even a <em>chance</em> that I might someday want to use that photo commercially (see the first question!), I have to get a model release. That&#39;s why I always suggest that photographers play it safe and get a model release whenever someone is recognizable and clearly the subject of the photo. You just never know what money-making images might be lurking in your archives until someone comes looking for them. It&#39;s always easier to get the model release first rather than to retrace your steps later and hope for the best.</p><p> In this final set of examples, we see how photos taken in public places may or may not require model releases. As noted, street photography – regardless of recognizable faces – will not require releases unless they are intended for commercial use. From a legal standpoint, you can photograph anyone in a public setting, as long as you are not violating any other laws by doing so. That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s always a good idea, but that doesn&#39;t make it illegal.</p><p> (Note: This does vary by location, and while it&#39;s legal to photograph in public settings within the United States, it may not be true in other parts of the world – so always check the local laws before doing people photography in an unfamiliar location. ）</p><p> When photographing children under the age of 18 for commercial purposes, however, a parent or legal guardian must sign the model release. Getting the minor&#39;s signature doesn&#39;t count.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/004-model-release-examples3.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-58473"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-58473" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:71.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="429" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/004-model-release-examples3.jpg?resize=600%2C429&#038;ssl=1" alt="004-model-release-examples3" class="wp-image-58473" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/004-model-release-examples3.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/004-model-release-examples3.jpg?resize=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Be aware of special considerations for candids, children, and public places. </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-is-commercial-use-a-simple-definition"> What is commercial use? A simple definition</h2><p> Simply put, commercial use is that which is intended to enhance a business interest. I listed some common commercial uses earlier, but it all boils down to whether someone&#39;s use of the photos in question is aimed at generating revenue.</p><p> When I photograph an author for their book cover, it is clearly commercial. In addition to appearing on the back of the book, the photo may appear in advertisements for the book. It might also appear in bookstore windows promoting the book, the author&#39;s appearance at signings, and other promotional events. All of this activity is clearly aimed at making money, so identifying commercial use is pretty simple.</p><p> What complicates the issue, however, is the photo you take for no reason other than to post it in one of the galleries on your professional website. Clearly, you&#39;re not selling the actual image, so no money is changing hands. You are, however, using that person&#39;s likeness as an example of the type of work you do in order to hopefully bring in more business. Your interest in using the photo is clearly commercial in nature.</p><p> There is no actual monetary gain from the image itself in this context, so the lines are blurred, but you do have a commercial goal in featuring it on your website. The same reasoning applies to hanging client photos in your studio. There is a commercial benefit to the extent that displaying samples of your work will encourage other potential clients to hire you. It is much better to err on the side of caution and have your subject sign a model release than to spend your time defending against lawsuits and cease &amp; desist letters. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-should-a-model-release-say"> What should a model release say?</h2><p> This is where a bit of a disclaimer is in order:</p><p> A model release is a contract. Most of the applicable principles are widely accepted, but laws do vary from state to state and from country to country. There are many excellent resources for creating model releases out there, so I strongly caution against simply writing your own document. Why reinvent the wheel if you don&#39;t have to? If you have questions or are unsure about any aspect of this, play it smart and consult with an attorney.</p><p> The most basic tenet of contract law is that there must be a “meeting of the minds.” In other words, a valid contract is a two-way street, obligating each party in some way. Hand in hand with this requirement is that of “consideration.” In a legal context, “consideration” simply means something of value. As the photographer, you are asking the person you are photographing to surrender any right or claim they may have to how, where, and when these photos are used. That can be a big deal, and you should be prepared to offer them something of value in return. It can be a nominal sum of money, it can be prints, or it can be something else to which the two of you can agree. Contracts have been upheld for consideration as low as one dollar. The model release must acknowledge this consideration.</p><p> It is also important to remember that the photographer is hardly ever the actual publisher of the photo. The model release must therefore indicate that the subject is not only consenting to your use of the photos, but also that of whomever you authorize to use the photos.</p><p> Let&#39;s go back to our example photo of the chef. Assume that the chef&#39;s agent or publicist hired you to photograph the chef for the cover of their upcoming cookbook. Obviously, you are not the publisher. You will, however, be licensing the photo for use by the publisher. The only way you can do so is to make sure that the model release authorizes you to grant usage rights to a third party.</p><p> As noted, a model release can – and should – be short, sweet, and to the point. I keep a stack of <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Model-Release-Update.pdf" class="ek-link">this model release</a> printed on 3″x5″ card stock in my camera bag. It&#39;s short enough to be effective and valid, and it doesn&#39;t confuse the subject to the point that they refuse to sign it. I rely on this short release for more spur-of-the-moment photography, whereas I use <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Model-Release-Long.pdf" class="ek-link">this longer version</a> for commissioned work.</p><p> One additional note on the paperwork: keep it forever. Model releases aren&#39;t records you can throw out after a certain amount of time. You will need the release if you ever want to license the image. And more importantly, you&#39;ll need to release to defend yourself if you are ever sued.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="model-releases-matter"> Model releases matter!</h2><p> Some people may be hesitant, or even unwilling, to sign a model release. <em>You have to be prepared to respect that decision</em> . It is certainly easier to get a person to sign a release when you have been hired to take their photos, rather than when you are roaming the streets, just shooting what interests you.</p><p> I always make sure that my clients sign the release before we start the shoot – assuming that a release is needed in the first place! Keep in mind that what can seem like a complicated process can be easily broken down into a fairly quick analysis. Ask yourself if the photo is going to be used commercially in any way. If the answer is “No,” the inquiry stops right there and you are free to hang that photo as big as you want on your living room wall. If you think, though, that there is any chance that you might one day want to license the photo for commercial use, obtaining a signed model release is an absolute necessity.</p><p> And once again, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Model-Release-Update.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">here is my “quick” model release</a> , which I use for spur-of-the-moment photography.</p><p> And <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Model-Release-Long.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="here is my longer model release (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">here is my longer model release</a> , which is used for commissioned work.</p><p> Hope that helps, and good luck!</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/model-releases-need-know/">Model Releases in Photography: What You Need to Know (With Samples)</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com">Digital Photography School</a> .

Indeed, all the time and all over the world, professional photographers are asked to immortalize the happiest times of people&#39;s lives: beginnings of families and lives, important rituals, celebrated accomplishments. Photographing a funeral is very different – on many levels.</p><p> Although a funeral may not seem like the kind of event people would seek to remember, it often is. After all, it&#39;s an important ritual, a celebration of a life, and a gathering of people who may not know each other well, but who are united in their mourning.</p><p> In my experience, many people find it important to have their loved one&#39;s funeral documented, even though it&#39;s a photography service that isn&#39;t advertised or discussed as much or in the same way as others (eg, senior portraits, family photoshoots, etc) 。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photographing-a-funeral-what-you-need-to-know"> Photographing a funeral: what you need to know</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133505" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-01.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to do Photography of a Funeral Tastefully and with Respect" class="wp-image-133505" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-01.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-01.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-01.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-01.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-01.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> <strong>Note:</strong> <em>All the images in this article have been approved for use here by the families.

But there are obviously some unique considerations, and in this article, I&#39;ll discuss both the similarities and the important differences.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133506" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-02.jpg?resize=750%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to do Photography of a Funeral Tastefully and with Respect" class="wp-image-133506" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-02.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-02.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-02.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-02.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-02.jpg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-02.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> One thing I want to emphasize:</p><p> Don&#39;t photograph a funeral as your first photography job, or even as your second. Funeral photography requires a professional and calm attitude, a lot of experience, and high-quality work. It&#39;s important that it&#39;s done correctly – so if you&#39;ve been asked to document a funeral and you&#39;ve never really done any serious <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/organize-photograph-events-like-pro/" target="_blank" aria-label="event photography (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">event photography</a> before, you should gently encourage the client to ask someone with more photoshoots under their belt. (At the very least, emphasize that you&#39;ve never done something like this before; you want to make sure they know what they&#39;re getting.)</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="before-the-funeral"> Before the funeral</h3><p> The funeral is a foundational life-cycle event, and for the person looking to hire you, it undoubtedly brings up a lot of emotions.</p><p> Funeral photography isn&#39;t discussed as much as other types of photography – there are no magazines or fairs about it, and there&#39;s little sharing of funeral photos on social media. Therefore, good communication with the client is even more important than usual. Remember that the person you&#39;re dealing with may not be able to express exactly what they&#39;re looking for, and that they will naturally be stressed and upset.</p><p> So make sure you ask lots of questions, and try to offer input and advice if the client seems to be struggling. Of course, you should do all this with the utmost sensitivity; the goal isn&#39;t to show off your professionalism or expertise but to understand what to expect and what the client wants. </p><figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133507" style="width:500px"><span class="space" style="width:500px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="500" height="750" data-id="133507" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-03a.jpg?resize=500%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to do Photography of a Funeral Tastefully and with Respect" class="wp-image-133507" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-03a.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-03a.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-03a.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133508" style="width:500px"><span class="space" style="width:500px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="500" height="750" data-id="133508" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-03b.jpg?resize=500%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to do Photography of a Funeral Tastefully and with Respect" class="wp-image-133508" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-03b.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-03b.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-03b.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></figure><p> <em>If possible, take some photos before the mourners enter. That way, you can capture the wider scene. Always ask before entering, though.</em></p><p> Here are the most important things to find out before the day of the funeral:</p><ul><li> When and where will the ceremony take place? If possible, visit the place beforehand to familiarize yourself with the venue. (When you&#39;re there, scope out the light situation. Think about how the lighting might change depending on the weather and the time of day, especially if the venue includes large windows.)</li><li> What kind of ceremony will it be? If you&#39;ll be photographing a ceremony that&#39;s unfamiliar to you, make sure you learn all you can about it. This is for a few key reasons: so you can have a better sense of what will happen on the day, so you can know which elements of the ceremony are most important (and should therefore be most carefully documented), and so you can avoid doing anything inappropriate or disrespectful while photographing. Also, if you feel you can&#39;t confidently photograph a certain ceremony by the date of the funeral, communicate that to your client right away so they can find someone else instead. As I emphasized above, funeral photography must be done well, and if you&#39;re not sure you&#39;re up to the task, it&#39;s not the time to shrug and say, “Well, I&#39;ll do my best!”</li><li> What specific photographs are particularly important to the client? For instance, some might want you to focus on the sermon and the eulogy, while others might ask you to prioritize photos of the mourners or the religious details.</li><li> What kind of relationship does the customer have with the deceased? </li></ul><figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133510" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" data-id="133510" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-04b.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="如何拍摄葬礼（高雅且尊重）" class="wp-image-133510" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-04b.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-04b.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-04b.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133509" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" data-id="133509" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-04a.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="如何拍摄葬礼（高雅且尊重）" class="wp-image-133509" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-04a.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-04a.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-04a.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></figure><p> On the day of the funeral, wear something dark (and make sure that it&#39;s appropriate for the ceremony, based on your questions and research). Also, wear shoes that will let you move around without causing a disturbance.</p><p> Naturally, be sure to be at the venue on time, greet your client, and offer your condolences. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photographing-the-ceremony"> Photographing the ceremony</h3><p> The biggest challenge when photographing a funeral is finding the right balance between getting beautiful photos and not disturbing the ceremony. Make sure to be quiet and to avoid blocking the mourners&#39; view, but remember that you&#39;re being paid to capture the event. Your client has asked you to help family and friends remember a momentous day and the life of a loved one, so you must do your job, and you must do it well.</p><p> Look for areas of the space that allow you to create meaningful images while staying out of people&#39;s way – this is another way that visiting the venue in advance can be a big help – and whatever you do, <em>don&#39;t</em> work with a flash. Also, if your camera has a silent or electronic shooting mode, then use it; most <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/use-mirrorless-in-2020/" target="_blank" aria-label="modern mirrorless cameras (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">modern mirrorless cameras</a> offer this option, and it&#39;ll often make your shutter imperceptible. Keep noisy adjustments (like lens changes) to an absolute minimum – if you want to switch between focal lengths, carry two cameras, or use a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/zoom-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="high-quality zoom (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">high-quality zoom</a> .</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133511" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-05.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to do Photography of a Funeral Tastefully and with Respect" class="wp-image-133511" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-05.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-05.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-05.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-05.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-05.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The photos you absolutely <em>must</em> capture depend on the kind of ceremony in question, and they also depend on the client&#39;s desires. However, here are a few general types of images that you should strive to take:</p><ul><li> Mourners paying their respects</li><li> The essential parts of the religious (if it is religious) ceremony</li><li> The burial and final goodbyes</li></ul><p> You&#39;ve been asked to photograph a very intimate event, so remember that photographing the guests should be done discreetly and with respect. To many, images of the guests are some of the most important that you&#39;ll capture: they signify different parts of the deceased person&#39;s rich life and represent the people in whose memories the deceased will continue to live on. Some might want a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-take-great-group-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="group photo (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">group photo</a> of all the guests (if you&#39;re not sure whether this is of interest, ask in advance).</p><p> The details and specific parts of the ceremony are also important to photograph: the flower arrangements, the lowering of the coffin, and the priest or leader of the ceremony. </p><figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133513" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" data-id="133513" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-06b.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to do Photography of a Funeral Tastefully and with Respect" class="wp-image-133513" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-06b.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-06b.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-06b.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Details and important moments matter a great deal when photographing a funeral.</figcaption></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133512" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" data-id="133512" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-06a.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to do Photography of a Funeral Tastefully and with Respect" class="wp-image-133512" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-06a.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-06a.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-06a.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Again, don&#39;t overlook those details – but make sure that you focus on the big picture, too. </figcaption></figure></figure><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="after-the-funeral"> After the funeral</h3><p> When the ceremony (or the part of it you have been asked to photograph) is over, let your client know you&#39;re leaving, offer your condolences once again, and compliment them on how beautiful the event was.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133514" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-07.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to do Photography of a Funeral Tastefully and with Respect" class="wp-image-133514" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-07.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-07.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-07.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-07.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/photograph-funeral-07.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Immediately afterward, go home, and back up your photos.

You have to consider an array of questions, such as:</p><ul><li> Where should you exhibit your work?</li><li> How do you submit photos?</li><li> How do you price your work?</li><li> Do you purchase insurance?</li><li> How should you frame your photos (if at all)?</li></ul><p> Exhibiting your work can also be very expensive, so it&#39;s important to understand the basic costs before you take the leap.</p><p> In this article, I aim to answer all of these questions (and more!). That way, if you <em>do</em> decide to move forward with an exhibition, you know how to make it as successful as possible. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="why-do-a-photography-exhibit"> Why do a photography exhibit? </h2><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-114435 size-large is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114435" style="width:398px"><span class="space" style="width:398px; padding-top:150.75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="398" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-24.jpg?resize=398%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114435" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-24.jpg?resize=398%2C600&amp;ssl=1 398w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-24.jpg?resize=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1 199w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-24.jpg?w=498&amp;ssl=1 498w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> If I were to do an exhibit today, I would include this image!</figcaption></figure></div><p> Artists have been exhibiting their work for centuries, and today is no different – though some of the reasons for displaying your photos have changed.</p><p> Before the internet, exhibitions were one of the best ways to showcase your work, and artists used them to make money. They would invite special clients or benefactors to the openings, hoping they would buy one or a few pieces.</p><p> Selling art is harder these days, so if your sole reason for exhibiting is to sell your photos, then you may be very disappointed. However, if your goal is to put your work up on a wall to show people what you are capable of as an artist, then an exhibition can be very rewarding. Take it from me: Having all your best work up for everyone to see can feel like quite an achievement.</p><p> Another reason many artists exhibit is to put the exhibitions down on their artist&#39;s CV. The CV (or curriculum vitae) is a list of all your exhibitions, as well as your education and a few other things, similar to a résumé. It&#39;s what galleries look at when considering whether they&#39;ll show your work. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114442 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114442" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="501" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-31.jpg?resize=750%2C501&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114442" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-31.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-31.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-31.jpg?resize=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-31.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-31.jpg?resize=717%2C479&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> If I were to have an exhibit of only my macro photography, this image would be an ideal choice. </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="costs-and-budgeting"> Costs and budgeting</h2><p> Exhibitions are not cheap! Therefore, before you decide to go all-in on an exhibit, there are many factors you&#39;ll need to consider, including:</p><ul><li> What sort of space will you exhibit in and how much will access cost?</li><li> What other expenses will there be?</li><li> How many images will you prepare for the exhibit, and what will the reproduction outlays cost?</li><li> Should you have a solo exhibition or start with group shows?</li></ul><p> These are all questions you need to think about, and that I address in greater detail below.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="group-vs-solo-exhibits"> Group vs solo exhibits</h2><p> Solo shows are fantastic, and they&#39;re ultimately what every artist wants. (Imagine having an entire show dedicated to just your images!) But solo shows are also very expensive, especially because you won&#39;t have anyone with whom you can share the expenses.</p><p> Therefore, instead of diving headfirst into solo exhibiting, most artists start with group shows. Then, if they have some success, they move up to solo shows.</p><p> Group shows are a good way to get your feet wet and start building your artist&#39;s CV. There are a handful of different ways to get started with group shows, but I&#39;d encourage you to find some friends who are also interested in exhibiting, then apply together to galleries to see if you can get an exhibition.</p><p> Many galleries also hold group shows of their own, and they&#39;ll often advertise for artists to participate – so you can often look out for those and apply! </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114450 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114450" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:94.93%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="712" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-39.jpg?resize=750%2C712&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114450" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-39.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-39.jpg?resize=300%2C285&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-39.jpg?resize=600%2C570&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-39.jpg?resize=717%2C681&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> I exhibited this framed image in a group show for street photography. </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="where-to-exhibit-your-photos"> Where to exhibit your photos</h2><p> Honestly, you could probably create an endless list of exhibition possibilities, but the most common places are galleries that specialize in the type of work you create.</p><p> However, there are other places, like cafes or restaurants, that like to have exhibitions featuring different artwork on their walls. There are benefits and disadvantages to each of these approaches: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="exhibiting-at-cafes-restaurants-and-foyers"> Exhibiting at cafes, restaurants, and foyers</h3><p> These places often allow you to exhibit for free, and they don&#39;t always have schedules, so you can sometimes have your work up for longer than you could in a gallery.</p><p> Cafes and restaurants may not want a commission from the sale of work, but they may want you to handle all the sales, so you would need to leave contact information. And they usually won&#39;t take any responsibility for your art pieces, so be aware of that (in other words, loss and damage won&#39;t be covered). </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114446 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114446" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-35.jpg?resize=750%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114446" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-35.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-35.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-35.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-35.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-35.jpg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-35.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This is one of two images that I exhibited in a cafe down near the coast.</figcaption></figure></div><p> When exhibiting at one of these places, you won&#39;t have access to a mailing list, and you&#39;ll have to do all the advertising yourself. People generally don&#39;t just wander in to look at the work; sure, the customers will see your images, but they&#39;re there for specific reasons (eg, to eat lunch), and buying images isn&#39;t one of them. While you can sell pieces from a cafe exhibit, your audience isn&#39;t there to buy what you are selling, which makes this type of show a bit more passive.</p><p> Your work will most likely need to be framed for hanging, and you will probably have to install it yourself at the exhibit space. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114445 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114445" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-34.jpg?resize=750%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114445" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-34.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-34.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-34.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-34.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-34.jpg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-34.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The other image that I exhibited in the cafe by the coast! </figcaption></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="exhibiting-at-galleries"> Exhibiting at galleries</h3><p> There are many different types of galleries, and it&#39;s up to you to decide which type will work best for your photography. Here are the basic gallery categories to keep in mind:</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="artist-run-spaces"> Artist-run spaces</h4><p> The cheapest spaces to use are generally artist-run. You pay less to show your work, but you are expected to “sit the exhibition.” That means you have to be there when the gallery is open to watch your work and manage any sales.</p><p> Attending the entire time the gallery is open can be time-consuming. Many artists will get together for a group show, split the costs of renting the space, and draw up a roster to sit the exhibition. For artists starting out, this can be a much better option. If you want to do a group show with a split schedule but don&#39;t know anyone to exhibit with, try contacting the gallery; they may know some artists looking to share a show.</p><p> While artist-run spaces don&#39;t come with hefty upfront fees, you&#39;ll need to take on most of the remaining expenses. The cost of the opening is covered and organized by you. You must also pay for most of the advertising, though some galleries will have a mailing list for you to use. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114449 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114449" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:78.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="590" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-38.jpg?resize=750%2C590&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114449" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-38.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-38.jpg?resize=300%2C236&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-38.jpg?resize=600%2C472&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-38.jpg?resize=717%2C564&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> One of my images, still packaged from when it returned from an exhibition last year. </figcaption></figure></div><h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="staffed-galleries"> Staffed galleries</h4><p> Staffed galleries are the next level. They cost more, but you are relieved of the burden of having to sit the exhibition.</p><p> There are two types of staffed galleries – commercial and non-commercial – and they often work in different ways. </p><h5 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="non-commercial-galleries"> Non-commercial galleries</h5><p> These are often smaller galleries that charge you for renting the space and to sit the photography exhibit for you. They are often the most expensive galleries to use for an exhibition. Non-commercial galleries will help advertise the opening, but they are generally not interested in promoting you and your work beyond the exhibition; in other words, the relationship is short-term.</p><p> Non-commercial galleries make their money from your rental fee. They also take a commission from any work you sell (usually around 30%). These galleries are a good way to start getting work on your CV. Some also do a lot of group shows, so I&#39;d recommend seeing if you can get work into them.</p><p> Non-commercial galleries aren&#39;t typically picky about what they exhibit, as long as the quality of work is good. They won&#39;t mind if one exhibition is all abstract paintings and the next is all landscape photographs. It can be a lot easier to get a show at one of these galleries than at the commercial galleries. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114439 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114439" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-28.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114439" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-28.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-28.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-28.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-28.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-28.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Another great photo for a future macro exhibition! </figcaption></figure></div><h5 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="commercial-galleries"> Commercial galleries</h5><p> Commercial galleries are a lot harder to get exhibitions with. They have many artists to choose from and usually have a particular type of artist in mind. They&#39;re less interested in a short-term relationship, and are more interested in helping you establish yourself as one of their artists – in other words, they want to represent you.</p><p> Commercial galleries will keep some of your work in a stockroom and advertise what you do. They try to get collectors to view your work (so the collectors will begin collecting and supporting you, as well).</p><p> Commercial galleries usually represent a niche market. If you send your photos to a gallery that only deals with Indigenous art, they are <em>not</em> going to be interested. Therefore, when approaching these galleries, you need to do your research. Make sure your work fits in with the other artists they represent. At the same time, if they have another artist who does work that is almost the same as yours, then they&#39;re not going to be interested, either. The trick is to find galleries where your photos fit but are <em>also</em> somewhat unique.</p><p> Commercial galleries often cost a lot less for an exhibition. However, they are harder to get shows in and will take a higher commission. (Here in Australia, that rate is usually around 40%, compared to the 30% taken by non-commercial galleries.) </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114441 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114441" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="501" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-30.jpg?resize=750%2C501&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114441" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-30.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-30.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-30.jpg?resize=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-30.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-30.jpg?resize=717%2C479&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Another image that I would include in an upcoming exhibition of my work. </figcaption></figure></div><h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="submitting-your-work-to-galleries"> Submitting your work to galleries</h4><p> Most galleries advertise when it&#39;s a good time to submit proposals. While you can send inquiries at other times, it is best to check their websites for submission dates (ie, times when they are <em>asking</em> people to send in exhibition proposals). </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="commissions-and-pricing-your-work"> Commissions and pricing your work</h2><p> All galleries charge a commission, and some cafes do, too. When pricing your work, you need to consider this amount. Make sure you find out the commission percentage when first inquiring about exhibiting in the space.</p><p> Also, when it comes to pricing, you should be realistic. If you are new to the art world, charging thousands of dollars for your work isn&#39;t feasible. Only established artists can command prices like that. To get an idea of what you can realistically charge, look at the space in which you&#39;ll be exhibiting and see how much previous artists have charged for similar work. If you are happy with the prices, you could try charging the same.</p><p> As your reputation grows and more people start buying your work, then you can consider charging more. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114447 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114447" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:81.6%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="612" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-36.jpg?resize=750%2C612&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114447" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-36.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-36.jpg?resize=300%2C245&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-36.jpg?resize=600%2C490&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-36.jpg?resize=717%2C585&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This framed piece is from an solo show I had in the foyer of a theater company. </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="handling-loss-due-to-damage-or-theft"> Handling loss due to damage or theft</h2><p> When you rent a space to show your work, you also take on the responsibilities of it as well. Even galleries are unlikely to cover any theft or damage to your artwork.</p><p> This is often in the contract or terms. Make sure you are aware, and if you&#39;re worried, then insurance could be an option.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="insuring-your-work"> Insuring your work</h3><p> As I said, most places will not cover your work if it&#39;s damaged or stolen. Therefore, insurance is something you need to consider when displaying your art. Do you <em>need</em> to purchase insurance? In truth, most artists don&#39;t worry about it, but that doesn&#39;t mean you should do the same. I&#39;d recommend doing some research; see how much it will cost and if it feels worth it.</p><p> Now, if the work has cost you a lot of money to produce, then insurance is more important. You can also talk to the gallery and see if they have had problems in the past, especially with theft.</p><p> Also, if the work is going into a high-traffic zone, like a walkway, where it can be damaged or someone could walk off with it, then it&#39;s definitely worth considering.</p><p> At the end of the day, whether you get an insurance policy should depend on the work itself, but also on the exhibition space. If your work is displayed in a cafe, then the staff may not have the time to watch the work at all, especially during busy periods. A gallery is going to be in a better position to watch – but only if they have the staff. If you have to sit the space yourself, can you watch everything? </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="should-you-frame-your-work"> Should you frame your work? </h2><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114448 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114448" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:68.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="514" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-37.jpg?resize=750%2C514&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114448" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-37.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-37.jpg?resize=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-37.jpg?resize=600%2C411&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-37.jpg?resize=717%2C491&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> I was testing out a framer and had this macro image printed on canvas.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Many places will answer the question of framing for you: They will either say the work has to be framed or that it can be pinned to the wall.</p><p> If the work has to be framed, then you must decide if that is something you can afford. Getting work custom-framed can be very expensive. For this reason, a lot of artists make all their work the same size (or use the same size frames and just alter the mat sizes according to the images). They then go to a place like Ikea and buy cheaper frames. If you do the framing yourself, then you can reuse the frames every time you want to do a show.</p><p> If you don&#39;t have to frame your prints and can pin the images on the wall, that doesn&#39;t mean you <em>can&#39;t</em> get the work framed. Again, you&#39;ll want to take your budget into account. However, if you choose to pin your images on the wall, you need to figure out the best way to do this. If the purpose of the show is to sell your work, then pinholes in your photos might not be desirable to potential buyers. Also, unframed prints don&#39;t look as professional or finished (the buyer can&#39;t just take home an unframed print and hang it on the wall). </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-many-images-should-you-exhibit-and-at-what-sizes"> How many images should you exhibit, and at what sizes? </h2><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114436 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114436" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-25.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114436" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-25.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-25.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-25.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-25.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-25.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Another photo that I would include in an upcoming exhibit!</figcaption></figure></div><p> Determining how much work to prepare and how big to print comes down to price and space. Your exhibition budget can only be determined by you – and how many pieces you can make, and the size at which you can get your work reproduced, is going to be determined by your budget.</p><p> It is also important to know how much space you have available for the exhibit. If the space has only 3 m (10 ft) of wall space, then putting up three images that are one meter (39 in) across will make it crowded and not allow enough space between each photo. However, if you have 10 m (33 ft) of space, and you put up four images that are only 50 cm (20 in) across, that will give you too much space between them.</p><p> Consider the space carefully. If you think your work looks great when enlarged, then perhaps having fewer, large pieces is better. But the larger they are, the more they will cost.</p><p> The same goes for the number of images. You don&#39;t want to completely fill the space – giving each image room will allow them to be shown better. Just because you paid for the space doesn&#39;t mean you have to fill it up. And if you choose to frame, consider the size of the frames, as well! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="editioning-your-photography">Editioning your photography </h2><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114444 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114444" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:74.93%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="562" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-33.jpg?resize=750%2C562&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114444" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-33.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-33.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-33.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-33.jpg?resize=717%2C537&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> I tried out different papers to see which one would work best for this image.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Editioning is also referred to as “limited editions” and is something to consider with photography. Printmakers have been doing this for centuries. It means that you&#39;re promising your potential clients that only a certain number of those images (prints) will be available for sale.</p><p> Editions can be a good way to make your work more valuable. If you have an image and do an edition of 20, then you need to make sure that the buyer knows what number in the edition they are receiving (8/20, for example). You need to keep records of this so you know how many prints of the image you&#39;ve sold. Once you&#39;ve sold 20, you can&#39;t sell anymore. You made a promise to those who bought the first 20 that you would only sell 20 of them. Think about how many prints of a photo you might sell from the start, and be realistic.</p><p> Another thing you need to be careful about with editioning is making sure the photos are all printed exactly the same. They all have to be consistent. If you put a piece in a show and sell it a few times, people won&#39;t be happy if the image they receive is not the same as the one they saw in the exhibition. You don&#39;t have to get them all printed at the same time, but make sure you use the same printer for all of them and that the printer knows how to replicate them identically. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="selecting-a-printing-medium">Selecting a printing medium</h2><p> The medium you choose for printing should be determined by your budget – but you should also consider how to make your work look its best. Do you want prints in frames? Or is canvas better for the type of image you&#39;ll be printing? Getting work printed on metal is becoming popular now as well, though it is also very expensive and (arguably) only suits some styles of photography.</p><p> Whatever you choose, you need to be careful. <em>You want to show off your work in the best way possible</em> . Consider printing some of your images a few different ways, then deciding which you like the best. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-114443 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-114443" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:75.07%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="563" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-32.jpg?resize=750%2C563&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to exhibit your photos" class="wp-image-114443" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-32.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-32.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-32.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/leannecole-exhibiting-your-artwork-32.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> My new printer did lots of tests so I could see which of my images would work the best on what medium. </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="choosing-which-images-to-exhibit"> Choosing which images to exhibit</h2><p> Choosing the images to include in the exhibit is the hardest part for most people.

There is no real way to tell.</p><p> If you are working with a gallery that employs a curator, you can likely get a lot of help from them; they can use their experience with the gallery and what sells to give you advice. If a curator isn&#39;t available, you might have to enlist the help of friends. Ask them to identify their favorite pieces. Perhaps your social media sites will also help you see the images that were most popular online.</p><p> When it comes to curating the show, there should be a cohesiveness to the work and to the final exhibition. Make sure all the work fits together and flows well. Be clear on your vision for the exhibition.

Digital images were shot only with pricey DSLRs or dedicated pocket cameras, stored on desktop computers, backed up to external hard drives, and emailed or posted on social media for sharing with others. Cloud storage was expensive, slow, and burdensome to set up and manage – and often designed for IT professionals and not photographers.</p><p> But modern photography, as the saying goes, requires modern solutions. Cloud storage is now well within reach of even the most casual photographer, and it can also meet the needs of demanding professionals. In fact, there are plenty of cloud storage options available to photographers, and they&#39;re capable of suiting a variety of workflows and storage requirements.</p><p> Price, speed, and storage capacity are still worth considering, but they&#39;re not the barrier to entry they used to be. Now it&#39;s not a matter of deciding <em>whether</em> cloud storage is right for you (it probably is!). Instead, the question is <em>which</em> cloud storage is best for you, and thankfully, there are a lot of great options.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-259273" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-mockingbird.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="Best cloud storage for photographers bird on a boxwood bush" class="wp-image-259273" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-mockingbird.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-mockingbird.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-mockingbird.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-mockingbird.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-mockingbird.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-mockingbird.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Today&#39;s cloud storage services let you store tens of thousands of images, and some even sync your RAW files! </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-best-cloud-storage-for-iphone-photographers-icloud"> The best cloud storage for iPhone photographers: iCloud</h2><p> While it might seem like a bit of a cop out or an overly simple answer, I really do think that the best cloud storage for iPhone photographers is <a href="https://www.icloud.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Apple's iCloud service (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">Apple&#39;s iCloud service</a> . iCloud automatically backs up all the photos on your iPhone and makes them available across all your other Apple devices (including iPads, iMacs, and Macbooks).</p><p> Your edits also sync across devices, so if you crop a photo on your iPhone, it will appear cropped everywhere else, too. Photos stored in iCloud can be shared with others, and you have the option of storing originals in iCloud while keeping small thumbnails on your iPhone. It&#39;s a great way to free up space on your phone, and it&#39;ll also keep down your costs, since you won&#39;t need to spend hundreds of extra dollars on a phone with more internal storage.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-259325" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:55.07%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="826" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-icloud.jpg?resize=1500%2C826&#038;ssl=1" alt="Best cloud storage for photographers iCloud photos" class="wp-image-259325" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-icloud.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-icloud.jpg?resize=300%2C165&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-icloud.jpg?resize=600%2C330&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-icloud.jpg?resize=768%2C423&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-icloud.jpg?resize=620%2C340&amp;ssl=1 620w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-icloud.jpg?resize=160%2C88&amp;ssl=1 160w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-icloud.jpg?resize=717%2C395&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> iPhone users will find a lot to like, especially iCloud Photo&#39;s easy setup and management.</figcaption></figure></div><p> All iPhone users get 5 GB of iCloud storage for free. This is hardly enough to store more than a handful of photos and videos, and it almost certainly won&#39;t meet your needs if you also need to back up essential iPhone data and documents.</p><p> Fortunately, the price of iCloud storage is quite reasonable: the lowest-tier option costs just 99 cents/month and gives you 50 GB of cloud storage, while the next tier (and the one I recommend for most people) offers 200 GB of storage for $2.99/month. </p><div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex"><p> <strong>iCloud pros:</strong></p><ul class="is-style-default"><li> A reasonable price makes it more affordable than other cloud storage options</li><li> Requires almost no effort to set up and use</li><li> Seamless integration with other Apple devices </li></ul></div><div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-8 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex"><p> <strong>iCloud cons:</strong></p><ul class="is-style-default"><li> Not a good option for Android users</li><li> Sharing options can be frustrating</li><li> Cost increases significantly if you need more than 200 GB of storage </li></ul></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-best-cloud-storage-for-android-photographers-google-one"> The best cloud storage for Android photographers: Google One</h2><p> In the same vein as my iCloud recommendation above, the best cloud storage for Android photographers is Google One. It&#39;s inexpensive, easy to use, and integrates seamlessly with Google Photos, one of the most widely used photography platforms in the world.</p><p> Anyone with a Google account gets 15 GB of storage for free, though while this is more free storage than iCloud offers, it&#39;s pretty limited once you start filling it up with high-resolution photos and videos. It&#39;s also a little frustrating that the free 15 GB version locks users out of some of Google&#39;s photo-editing tools, such as Magic Eraser and Portrait Blur.</p><p> Fortunately, additional storage is only $2/month for 100 GB. (Once that is exhausted, the next available option is significantly more expensive at $10/month for 2 TB.)</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-259327" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:52.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="784" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-google-photos.jpg?resize=1500%2C784&#038;ssl=1" alt="Best cloud storage for photographers Google photos" class="wp-image-259327" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-google-photos.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-google-photos.jpg?resize=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-google-photos.jpg?resize=600%2C314&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-google-photos.jpg?resize=768%2C401&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-google-photos.jpg?resize=717%2C375&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Google Photos is a great choice for Android users and will easily let you access all your photos from any device or web browser.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Google One is easy to recommend for Android users because, like its iCloud counterpart on iPhones, it&#39;s incredibly easy to use.

These <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/synology-nas-streamline-workspace/" target="_blank" aria-label="NAS (Networked Attached Storage) options (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">NAS (Networked Attached Storage) options</a> won&#39;t save your photos if your house burns down, but they do let you access your images from anywhere and often include mobile apps and sharing functionality. Personal cloud services don&#39;t require subscriptions since you manage the device and the storage on it, and if you run out of space, you can just add another hard drive or SSD. The learning curve is a little steep, so I don&#39;t recommend them for beginners, but these tools are a good option for photographers who don&#39;t mind a high upfront cost and are willing to do a bit of work to manage things on their自己的。</p><p> <strong>One-time-purchase services:</strong> There are plenty of subscription-based cloud storage options for photographers, but there are also services that promise essentially the same thing but for a one-time fee. This can sound appealing, but I never recommend such a route. It costs money to maintain servers, develop software, fix software vulnerabilities, and adapt to rapidly changing technologies. Subscription fees offer a way for companies to do all of this, so I would not recommend trusting your photos or other data to any company that claims to do the same for a one-time price.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="final-words">最后的话</h2><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-259361" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-dog-frisbee.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Best cloud storage for photographers dog running with a frisbee" class="wp-image-259361" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-dog-frisbee.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-dog-frisbee.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-dog-frisbee.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-dog-frisbee.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-dog-frisbee.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/best-cloud-storage-dog-frisbee.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The worst cloud storage is no cloud storage.

It&#39;s all about taking a photograph of a real-world scene and making it look like a miniature scene.

Tilt-shift lenses do a great job of creating the effect that we&#39;re after. The problem is that they&#39;re very expensive, and there aren&#39;t very many options to choose from. That&#39;s why most photographers prefer to create the effect using the second technique:</li><li> In post-processing, generally using Photoshop. The procedure in Photoshop is not complicated, and once you become relatively familiar with the steps, it can be accomplished in as little as one minute.</li></ol><p> I recommend the post-processing route, but it&#39;s worth mentioning that you don&#39;t even need to own Photoshop (or any editing program) to make a tilt-shift photo. <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://tiltshiftmaker.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">Tiltshiftmaker.com</a> has a free service that lets you create the effect with an uploaded photo.

And once a candidate photo is picked, the tilt-shift post-processing procedure must <em>also</em> be done correctly.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-259474" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tilt-shift-photography-16.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="A tilt-shift photo example" class="wp-image-259474" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tilt-shift-photography-16.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tilt-shift-photography-16.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tilt-shift-photography-16.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tilt-shift-photography-16.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tilt-shift-photography-16.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tilt-shift-photography-16.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> So what constitutes a good photo for a tilt-shift treatment? Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve discovered:</p><ul><li> <strong>The photo should be taken from above, but <em>not</em> directly overhead.</strong> This reflects what someone taking a photo of a miniature scene would likely do; it&#39;s unlikely they would (or even could) be directly above the subject. And if you <em>do</em> have a direct overhead shot, you generally won&#39;t end up with a deep depth of field, which is very important. You can capture this type of image using a drone, but an easier approach is to shoot city scenes from the window of a building or the top of a parking garage.</li><li> <strong>A simple scene is usually better than a complicated scene.</strong> This is because miniature scenes are usually simple, and we&#39;re trying to mimic a toy model. You wouldn&#39;t find a dense city block, for example, in a model railroad scene.</li><li> <strong>The photo must be tack-sharp and well-lit.</strong> There will be enough blur in the photo from the tilt-shift effect. Your focal point must be sharp; otherwise, the impact will be lost. You also want to ensure you have plenty of depth of field in your initial file, and that the shot is well-exposed, without deep shadows. (The goal is to keep things relatively bright!)</li><li> <strong>If people are in the scene, they need to be relatively small and light on detail.</strong> Once again, this is to reflect what you&#39;d see in a real miniature scene. People are small and not well-detailed in miniature scenery!</li><li> <strong>Make sure the scene is interesting</strong> . You can create a convincing tilt-shift effect with a variety of aerial photos, but for the most impact, you should go for an image with <em>interest</em> . An aerial photo of a cathedral with spires and flying buttresses is interesting, while an aerial photo of a flat-topped shopping mall is a lot less eye-catching.</li></ul><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-259475" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tilt-shift-photography-14.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="A tilt-shift photo example" class="wp-image-259475" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tilt-shift-photography-14.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tilt-shift-photography-14.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tilt-shift-photography-14.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tilt-shift-photography-14.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tilt-shift-photography-14.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tilt-shift-photography-14.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Was this scene a good candidate for tilt-shift photography? In some ways, yes. It&#39;s taken from above but not directly overhead, the buildings are well-lit, and there are plenty of interesting elements.
