<a aria-label="best light for flower photography (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-using-light-in-flower-photography-for-awesome-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">花卉摄影的最佳光线</a></li><li>如何选择合适的光圈</li><li>创建美丽柔焦效果的简单方法</li><li>我的惊人前景的秘密</li><li>多得多！</li></ul><p>那么，您准备好拍摄一些绚丽的花朵照片了吗？那么让我们开始吧！</p><h2 data-section id="the-best-flower-photography-gear">最好的花卉摄影装备</h2><p>花卉摄影非常容易上手，您不需要很多花哨的设备就可以开始。作为初学者，您可以毫无问题地使用智能手机或傻瓜相机；然而，随着您经验的增加，您可能希望升级以增强您的拍摄能力。这是我的推荐：</p><h3 data-section id="an-interchangeable-lens-camera">可更换镜头相机</h3><p>可互换镜头相机将允许您使用多种镜头，每种镜头都提供不同的视角。换句话说，您可以使用一个镜头拍摄宽广的花田图像，然后您可以切换镜头并放大以拍摄细节丰富的特写镜头。</p><p>用于花卉摄影的最佳可互换镜头相机提供更大的传感器（全画幅是最好的，但它肯定不是必备的）和更高的百万像素数（如果您计划创建花卉图像的大型打印，后者很重要）。</p><p>还要寻找具有内置图像稳定、全铰接屏幕和高品质取景器的相机。就我个人而言，我建议使用无反光镜相机 - 电子取景器在选择曝光时很有帮助 - 但数码单反相机也很棒。</p><h3 data-section id="a-macro-lens">微距镜头</h3><p>并非所有花卉摄影都需要在高倍率下完成，但许多最好的照片确实需要近距离拍摄（正如我在下面讨论的）。因此，您的花卉摄影主镜头理想情况下应该提供 1:1 的放大倍率，这样您就可以放大拍摄对象，直到相机传感器上的图像达到真人大小。</p><p>要实现 1:1 的放大倍率，您需要专用的微距镜头。幸运的是，这些镜头非常锐利，而且有一些不错的微距镜头相对便宜，包括腾龙、西格玛和图丽等第三方制造商的一些出色产品。</p><p>我建议选择焦距在80-120mm范围内的镜头；它可以让你近距离拍摄，而无需距离拍摄对象边缘几毫米，但它不会有较长微距镜头的重量或价格标签。</p><h3 data-section id="a-tripod">三脚架</h3><p>一些花卉摄影师拒绝在没有三脚架的情况下工作，而另一些则只手持拍摄。三脚架是否适合您取决于您​​的花卉摄影方法以及更广泛的摄影方法。</p><p>如果您喜欢缓慢而谨慎地工作，三脚架可能会很有用。如果您想以高倍率拍摄但要保持整个花朵清晰对焦（而不是让花朵的某些部分以令人愉悦的方式模糊），它也会很有帮助。</p><p>另一方面，如果您想要更快、更灵活地工作，并且您不介意（或者您特别想要）更柔和的焦点效果（其中只有花朵的一小部分清晰），那么放弃三脚架并手持拍摄是最好的选择。更好的举动。</p><h2 data-section id="the-best-flower-photography-settings">最佳花卉摄影设置</h2><p>花卉摄影需要精确控制曝光设置。这就是为什么我建议在手动模式下工作，您可以独立设置光圈、ISO 和快门速度。如果您不太习惯使用手动模式，那么光圈优先模式也是一个不错的选择。</p><p>首先将 ISO 设置为其基本值，以尽可能保持图像的高质量。</p><p>接下来，选择能够提供所需景深效果的光圈。较宽的光圈（较小的 f 值）会产生较小的焦点窗口，而较窄的光圈（较大的 f 值）会提供较大的焦点窗口。无论您是喜欢带有艺术模糊的柔焦效果（例如将光圈设置在 f/2.8 至 f/5.6 范围内），还是喜欢整个拍摄对象清晰的锐利效果（例如使用 f/8 至 f/16），都可以选择给你。如果您不确定，请毫不犹豫地尝试一下，看看什么对您有吸引力。</p><p>拨入可提供适当曝光的快门速度值。确保其速度足够快，以确保最终图像清晰，尤其是在高放大倍率下。通常，您至少需要 1/160 秒，但有时您可以使用 1/100 秒甚至更快。</p><p>如果快门速度不够快，您需要相应地提高快门速度，然后调整光圈或 ISO 以补偿减少的曝光。</p><p>还有一个重要建议：在高倍率下工作时将镜头切换为手动对焦。一开始可能看起来很奇怪，但它可以让您非常精确地指定焦点，并且您会很快掌握它的窍门。</p><h2 data-section id="photograph-flowers-in-the-right-light"> 1.在合适的光线下拍摄花朵</h2><p>您知道阴天非常<em>适合</em>花卉摄影吗？</p><p>这是真的。阴天的柔和光线与精致的花瓣相得益彰，而且没有阴影，也没有刺眼的亮点，因此您可以获得良好、均匀的曝光。</p><p>因此，如果您计划拍摄花卉照片，通常最好先检查天气并争取在阴天拍摄。</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-48694" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/butterfly_gardens_20090219_085.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="柔和灯光下的花朵"

https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/butterfly_gardens_20090219_085.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>不过，您确实需要小心。在阴天的开始和结束时，光线变得非常有限，这会导致不必要的模糊（尤其是在高倍率拍摄时）。因此，如果天空阴沉，请在中午拍摄，然后在天色太暗之前收拾行李。</p><p>当然，多云天气并不是拍摄精美花卉照片的唯一时机。黄金时段（当太阳在天空中很低时）晴朗的天空也可以拍出很棒的照片。夕阳会产生温暖、柔和的光线，美丽地照亮你的拍摄对象，但你需要小心避免过度曝光（明亮的光线和彩色花瓣的组合可能很难管理）。</p><p>但是，虽然晴朗的天空在一天中的早晚都可以很好地发挥作用，但我建议您积极避免在阳光明媚的日子中午前后拍摄花朵。强烈的阳光会照射在花朵上，产生令人不愉快的阴影，而且很少看起来很好看。只要有可能，坚持使用更柔和、更讨人喜欢的光线！</p><h2 data-section id="use-backlight-to-make-your-flowers-glow"> 2.使用背光让你的花朵发光</h2><p>正如我在上一节中所解释的，您可以在日出和日落时拍摄华丽的花朵照片 - 这意味着您需要考虑照明方向。换句话说，光线是从你的花前面来的吗？在你的花后面吗？离开你的花的一边？</p><p>不同的照明方向会产生不同的效果，虽然使用前光可以拍摄出精美细致的照片，使用侧光可以创建精彩的戏剧性图像，但我强烈建议您尝试逆光。</p><p>是的，这有点不传统，但是背光（可以通过确保花朵位于您和太阳之间来实现）将使半透明的花瓣发光，如下所示：</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-48695" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:74.17%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="445" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cattle_pt_20090430_003.jpg?resize=600%2C445&#038;ssl=1" alt="逆光花卉摄影" class="wp-image-48695" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cattle_pt_20090430_003.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cattle_pt_20090430_003.jpg?resize=300%2C223&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>效果非常华丽，是提升您的花卉摄影作品集的好方法。</p><p>尝试在当天晚些时候太阳接近地平线时拍摄；这样，背光会直接照射到花瓣上，并且会在图像的其余部分投射出漂亮、温暖的光线。 （您甚至可以捕捉到透过树林的光线！）</p><h2 data-section id="make-sure-your-subject-is-in-good-condition"> 3. 确保您的拍摄对象状况良好</h2><p>一场大雨过后，外面的世界呈现出清新的面貌，这对于花卉摄影来说尤其迷人。多云的天空会产生柔和的漫射光，为您的图像增添美丽的感觉。但更诱人的是花朵上留下的微小水滴。</p><p>这些水滴营造出清新感，增强了花朵的整体美感。这是一个神奇的时刻，趁着雨停，带上相机出发，捕捉这些美丽的景色。花瓣上水的反射和闪烁为您的照片增添了独特的维度。</p><p>一些摄影师喜欢携带一个小喷雾瓶，即使在室外干燥的情况下也能重现这种下雨的效果。这是您可能想要探索的可选技巧。</p><p>近距离观察花瓣上水滴的细节会让人兴奋不已。尝试不同的角度和视角，看看光线在水面上的效果如何。您可能会发现一种全新的观赏和拍摄花朵的方式。</p><h2 data-section id="watch-out-for-wind"> 4.注意防风</h2><p>拍摄花朵时，风是你的敌人。它会从各个方向吹散你的拍摄对象，这使得对焦变得非常困难（如果你用慢快门速度拍摄，它会引入大量的模糊）。</p><p>最简单的避风方法？在清晨天气仍然平静的时候进行摄影。轻微的风是可以控制的；只需带一块纸板或反光板，然后将其放在您的花旁边即可。</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-48687" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img

/></span></figure></div><p>如果您不想早起，或者需要在大风天拍照，您还有第二种选择：</p><p>把你的花带进去。您不需要复杂的工作室设置就可以在室内拍摄出美丽的照片 - 只需将花朵放在窗户附近，并在它们后面找到一个坚实的背景即可。我把下面的花放在里面并放在一张白纸前面，拍摄了下面的花：</p><h2 data-section id="get-closer"> 5.靠近一点</h2><p>以下是创建令人惊叹、<em>独特的</em>花卉照片的最简单方法之一：</p><p>尽可能靠近。换句话说，不要只满足于几英尺外的漂亮框架。相反，努力让你的主题充满画面！</p><p>您可以通过多种方式执行此操作：</p><p>首先，您可以使用长焦镜头放大花朵。您需要注意镜头的放大率，因为有些镜头无法聚焦得特别近。 1:1 的比例非常出色，尽管您只能在专用微距镜头上发现这一点，但使用 1:2、1:4 甚至 1:6 的比例仍然可以获得良好的效果。 （如果您不确定您的镜头提供多少放大倍率，您可以在网上查找，或者可以做一些测试。）</p><p>如果幸运的话，您的长焦镜头会近距离对焦，您可以用它来拍摄美丽的花朵。但如果你不能像你想要的那样接近怎么办？</p><p>你有几种选择。您可以使用安装在相机上的<a aria-label="extension tubes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/extension-tubes-close-up-photography-lesson-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">延长管</a>，让镜头聚焦得更近。或者您可以使用<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/macro-photography-budget-introduction-close-filters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">特写滤镜</a>，它安装在镜头的末端，就像放大镜一样。</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-48682" style="width:333px"><span class="space" style="width:333px; padding-top:150.15%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="333" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/backyard_20100403__MG_9103.jpg?resize=333%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="郁金香与美丽的背景" class="wp-image-48682" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/backyard_20100403__MG_9103.jpg?w=333&amp;ssl=1 333w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/backyard_20100403__MG_9103.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>老实说，这两种选择都有相当明显的缺点。延长管不方便，而特写滤镜会降低图像质量。当然，它们是有效的，如果您刚刚开始花卉摄影，这两种方法都可以帮助您拍摄有趣的特写镜头。</p><p>但如果您想真正改善图像，我建议您使用专用的<a aria-label="macro lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/choose-perfect-macro-lens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">微距镜头</a>，它可以让您无需任何配件即可拍摄亲密图像。这些镜头可以以相当低的价格购买（特别是如果您购买 40 毫米至 60 毫米范围内的更宽镜头）。它们可以让您非常接近拍摄对象，而且还可以提供出色的图像质量！</p><h2 data-section id="try-using-a-reflector"> 6.尝试使用反光板</h2><p>这是一个快速提示：</p><p>阴影花朵可以拍出一些令人惊叹的照片，尤其是当您在清晨或傍晚将阴影主体和光线充足的背景结合在一起时。</p><p>但如果您不小心，这种遮阳效果可能会导致花朵曝光不足（或背景曝光过度）。这里的技巧是让你的花保持相对明亮；这样，您可以减少整个场景的动态范围，并且您的相机将更容易捕获完整的色调。</p><p>因此，如果您的拍摄对象位于阴影中，请使用<a aria-label="reflector (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-ways-use-5-1-reflector/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">反光板</a>反射一些光线。您可以在线购买便宜的弹出选项，或者只需携带一张白卡。只需调整位置，直到花朵上有漂亮的光线，然后拍摄即可！ （奖励：反光镜还会让你的花朵显得更加充满活力！）。</p><h2 data-section id="avoid-a-cluttered-background"> 7.避免杂乱的背景</h2><p>在花卉摄影中，背景可以成就或破坏图像。统一的背景看起来很棒，而杂乱、分散注意力的背景会吸引眼球，妨碍观众欣赏你的主要主题。</p><p>因此，在按下快门按钮之前，请花一点时间思考一下花朵后面的区域。看着相机取景器，然后问自己：</p><p>我的背景与花朵相得益彰吗？或者它会分散注意力？</p><p>如果背景添加到图像中 - 或者至少 - 不会减损图像，那么就继续拍摄你的图像。但如果背景看起来确实有点分散注意力（例如，花朵后面有锯齿状树枝或难看的色块），那么调整拍摄可能是个好主意。</p><p>一种选择是改变你的位置，直到干扰消失。例如，您可以趴到地上，直到花朵被晴朗的​​天空包围，或者您可以稍微向右或向左移动以消除有问题的区域。</p><p>然而，另一个举措是使用浅景深来模糊干扰，正如我在下一节中讨论的那样：</p><h2 data-section id="use-a-shallow-depth-of-field"> 8.使用浅景深</h2><p>浅景深花卉照片看起来很棒 - 但什么是<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">浅景深</a>，如何实现它？</p><p>浅景深仅具有一点清晰度。如果仔细使用该效果，您可以捕获具有清晰花朵但背景模糊的图像：</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-48696" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/hatley_20090617_006.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="花卉摄影技巧 带有水滴的蓝色花朵" class="wp-image-48696" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/hatley_20090617_006.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/hatley_20090617_006.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/hatley_20090617_006.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>正如您可能想象的那样，这确实使集中注意力变得更加困难。由于锐度平面非常狭窄，因此出错的空间很小——但对于大多数花卉拍摄者来说，美丽的效果绝对值得付出努力。</p><p>要获得浅景深，请确保使用大<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">光圈</a>（即低 f 值），例如 f/2.8 或 f/4。 （这还允许您使用更快的快门速度，从而增加拍摄清晰照片的可能性。）</p><p>您还应该致力于尽可能接近您的主题；距离对焦区域越近，背景模糊越强。</p><p>最后，旨在增加花朵和背景之间的距离。更远的背景将以更大的模糊程度渲染，虽然景深在技术上不会改变，但通常看起来很棒。您可以寻找距离背景元素较远的拍摄对象，也可以低至地面以确保背景由远处的树木组成。</p><h2 data-section id="keep-a-part-of-your-flower-sharp"> 9. 保持花朵的一部分锋利</h2><p>如果您想掌握浅景深效果，请务必保持花朵的一部分清晰，以便观看者的眼睛有一个锚点。否则，人们将不知道该往哪里看，他们会很快忽略该图像并继续前进。</p><p>因此，请采取必要的措施来保持图像的一部分（即使只是一<em>小</em>部分）清晰。如果您在光线充足的情况下拍摄，请提高快门速度并仔细对焦。如果您在光线较差的情况下拍摄，请使用三脚架和遥控快门以避免相机抖动，或根据需要提高 ISO。</p><p>请记住：即使看起来没有风，花朵也总是会移动一点。检查相机液晶显示屏上的图像通常是个好主意。确保放大，如果你的花朵不清晰，请尝试将快门速度提高一两档。</p><p>最后，检查你的注意力。如有必要， <a aria-label="focus manually (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dont-afraid-manual-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">请手动对焦</a>。在继续其他主题和构图之前，请确保您已经清晰地渲染了花朵最重要的部分，例如花瓣和花心。</p><h2 data-section id="change-your-point-of-view"> 10.改变你的观点</h2><p>如果您想要拍摄独特的花卉照片，请不要只拍摄标准照片。当然，您可以从传统角度开始，但是一旦拍摄了一些安全图像，就可以四处走动并尝试一些不同的视角和焦距。</p><p>例如，从下面拍摄花朵以捕捉有趣的视角。在此过程中您可能会变得非常混乱，但如果一切顺利，您将创建一个具有罕见角度的美丽图像。 （降低高度还可以帮助您在白色、蓝色甚至橙色的天空中拍摄拍摄对象。）</p><p>您也可以尝试从上方向下拍摄，异常近距离地拍摄个人照片，或者缩小以获得更广阔的环境图像。关键是尽可能多地进行实验，检查结果，然后在第二天再次尝试（进行修改）。</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span

11.尝试有意识地移动相机来拍摄花卉摘要</h2><p>正如我在整篇文章中强调的那样，花卉摄影并不总是需要锐利清晰的图像。有时，打破规则并尝试一些非传统的东西可能会带来惊人的结果。其中一种技术是有意相机移动（ICM）。</p><p>通过将快门速度减慢至 1/15 秒左右，并在按下快门按钮时有意移动相机，您可以创建充满纯色和有趣几何形状的抽象镜头。左右或上下移动可以产生不同的效果。</p><p>这里的关键是关闭任何相机或镜头的图像稳定功能，因为您实际上想要抖动。结果当然是不可预测的，但这就是魅力的一部分。您需要尝试不同类型的运动和快门速度，这会<em>很</em>有趣。</p><p>有时候，意想不到的结果才是最令人震惊的。拥抱不可预测性，不要害怕尝试各种方法。您可能会偶然发现一张令人难以置信的照片，以您从未想过的方式捕捉花朵的本质！</p><h2 data-section id="focus-through-another-flower"> 12.通过另一朵花聚焦</h2><p><em>直拍法</em>受到不少专业花卉摄影师的喜爱，这是有充分理由的：</p><p>它看起来真的<em>非常</em>酷，尤其是当你得到很多彩色前景模糊时。像这样：</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-48683" style="width:333px"><span class="space" style="width:333px; padding-top:150.15%"></span><img decoding="async"

/></span></figure></div><p>但它是如何运作的呢？</p><p>您只需找到一朵想要拍摄的花，然后调整位置，直到<em>另一朵</em>花位于镜头和花之间。 （前景花离镜头越近，效果越好。）</p><p>最终，次生花将变得颜色模糊，您的最终图像将具有更专业的感觉。</p><p>确保仔细注意前景花朵的位置 - 重要的是不要用一抹模糊完全淹没主要拍摄对象。您还可以尝试不同的光圈，看看它们如何改变效果。</p><h2 data-section id="photograph-after-the-rain"> 13. 雨后拍照</h2><p>一场大雨过后，外面的世界呈现出清新的面貌，这对于花卉摄影来说尤其迷人。多云的天空会产生柔和的漫射光，为您的图像增添美丽的感觉。但更诱人的是花朵上留下的微小水滴。</p><p>这些水滴营造出清新感，增强了花朵的整体美感。这是一个神奇的时刻，趁着雨停，带上相机出发，捕捉这些美丽的景色。花瓣上水的反射和闪烁为您的照片增添了独特的维度。</p><p>一些摄影师喜欢携带一个小喷雾瓶，即使在室外干燥的情况下也能重现这种下雨的效果。这是您可能想要探索的可选技巧。</p><p>近距离观察花瓣上水滴的细节会让人兴奋不已。尝试不同的角度和视角，看看光线在水面上的效果如何。您可能会发现一种全新的观赏和拍摄花朵的方式。</p><h2 data-section id="go-wide"> 14. 走得更远</h2><p>花卉摄影不仅仅是捕捉每个花瓣的复杂细节。虽然特写镜头有其魅力，但通过广角拍摄，还有一个美丽的世界等待着我们去探索。人们很容易将花卉摄影仅仅视为特写照片。但从远处看，花朵也看起来很神奇。通过更广泛的观察，您不仅会发现单朵花的魅力，还会发现它们在场景中共同创造的视觉和谐。</p><p>您可以拍摄一片花朵，以突出小区域内的各种颜色和物种。这种方法创造了一个充满活力和活泼的场景。或者，您可以走得更远，捕捉日落时的一片花田，制作出一种花卉风景图像，讲述一个更广阔的故事。</p><p>即使是最近对焦的微距镜头也能够拍摄出美丽的广角图像，但如果您想要拍摄广阔的场景，请随意尝试使用广角镜头或标准变焦镜头（例如 18-55 毫米套件镜头）。更换镜头可以提供新的视角，邀请您以新鲜、迷人的方式看到花卉世界！</p><h2 data-section id="dont-forget-about-post-processing"> 15.不要忘记后期处理</h2><p>即使您以 RAW 格式拍摄（我强烈推荐），直接从相机中取出的花卉照片看起来也非常令人难以置信。但如果你想要最好的结果，你绝对应该花一些时间处理你的图像。</p><p>您会发现，编辑软件中的一些调整可以显着改善镜头的色调、颜色和整体感觉。您使用的具体调整取决于您的喜好和目标，但巧妙地提高饱和度或鲜艳度以增强颜色通常是个好主意。您还可以考虑提高阴影以将一些细节带入照片​​的较暗区域，降低高光以恢复较亮区域中丢失的细节，并提高对比度以获得额外的流行效果。</p><p>一旦您更加熟悉花卉照片编辑，您就可以测试更戏剧性的颜色变化，并且可以进行局部调整（有选择地使镜头的某些部分变暗和变亮，以帮助将观看者的眼睛引向某个方向）。</p><h2

Pick an area that is out of the way of road and foot traffic, where you&#39;re unlikely to be disturbed. If you can, head to the location a few days before the shoot and ensure your view of the horizon will be unobstructed and free of any hazards. (Also make sure that you&#39;ll be able to easily access the location; you&#39;ll be walking around with your camera in the dark, after all!)</p><p> As the photoshoot nears, frequently check the <a aria-label="weather (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/time-for-landscape-weather-and-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">weather</a> . If your shooting time coincides with an approaching or recently ended storm, the results can be staggering. Rain and storm clouds can add a dramatic layer of dimension to the scene. But you should also take steps to stay safe; don&#39;t go out if lightning is visible, and make sure you carry a flashlight to help you find your way in the dark.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255485" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-106.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Sunrise photography" class="wp-image-255485" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-106.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-106.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-106.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-106.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-106.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-106.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> It&#39;s also important that you pay careful attention to the sunrise time. You don&#39;t want to arrive on location only to find that the sun is already above the horizon!

(I&#39;d recommend packing your bag the night before; that way, you don&#39;t accidentally forget any equipment in the rush to leave!)</p><p> First and foremost, you&#39;ll want to bring your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-tripods-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="tripod (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">tripod</a> . The first handful of minutes before the sun has fully risen won&#39;t offer much light, so you&#39;ll need a steady base for your camera. This is even more important if you plan to shoot in the blue hour before sunrise or if you need to do HDR bracketing.</p><p> Second, you&#39;ll want to bring the <a aria-label="right lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lens-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">right lens</a> for the shoot. While beautiful landscapes can be captured using a 50mm to 85mm focal length, a <a aria-label="wide-angle lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-reasons-love-ultra-wide-lenses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">wide-angle lens</a> is generally best. If you&#39;re just starting out, a kit zoom lens (such as an 18-55mm model) will get the job done, but if you have a prime lens in the 12mm to 24mm range, you&#39;ll have a better chance of capturing a sharper image, and you&#39;ll be able to capture a vast, sweeping portion of the scene.</p><p> Third, make sure you&#39;re using a decent camera. Sensor size and megapixel count make a big difference, especially if you want to create prints of your sunrise photos. Comfort matters, too, and it can be helpful to hold a few cameras in your hands before buying.</p><p> Battery life is a crucial but often overlooked aspect. The cold morning air can drain batteries quickly, and the last thing you want is for your camera to die just as the sun breaks the horizon. (If your camera doesn&#39;t offer impressive battery life, you can compensate by carrying several spare batteries; it&#39;s a simple precaution that I highly recommend!)</p><p> Finally, although filters can subtly degrade image quality, some can be useful for sunrise photography. As I mentioned above, a GND (graduated neutral density) filter will balance the scene by darkening the upper portion of the sky so you can capture a well-exposed and dramatic shot. And a neutral density filter will block out light, which is helpful if you want to use <a aria-label="long-exposure techniques (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/step-by-step-guide-to-long-exposure-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">long-exposure techniques</a> to blur clouds and/or water.</p><h2 data-section id="use-the-right-sunrise-camera-settings"> 5.

I encourage you to select most of these settings before you even arrive at your photoshoot destination; that way, when the sunrise begins, you&#39;re ready to start shooting!</p><p> So what settings are best for sunrise photoshoots?</p><p> I&#39;d recommend using a smaller <a aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> , such as f/8 or f/11, to maximize the <a aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> and capture sharp detail throughout the image. If you&#39;re using a tripod, this shouldn&#39;t be a problem!</p><p> If possible, use a low <a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> such as 100 or 200 to avoid noise in the final file. As with smaller apertures, this shouldn&#39;t be a problem if you&#39;re using a tripod, but if you&#39;re handholding your camera, you&#39;ll need to bump up the ISO to get a shutter speed fast enough to avoid a blurry photo (generally at least 1/60s).</p><p> And although you can shoot in <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> , I personally prefer to shoot almost everything in <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-versus-shutter-priority-which-shooting-mode/" target="_blank" aria-label="Aperture Priority (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Aperture Priority</a> . That way, I can lock my aperture and let the camera choose the shutter speed that will create a balanced exposure. Since low-light situations can confuse the camera and cause overexposure, you can always use your camera&#39;s <a aria-label="exposure compensation settings (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-exposure-compensation-to-take-control-of-your-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure compensation</a> to subtly reduce the brightness.</p><p> I also recommend choosing your white balance in advance. As I mentioned above, you can use this setting to boost (or reduce) the warmth of your shot. If you&#39;re after a warm, orangish image, set your white balance to Shade or Daylight. If you&#39;re after a cooler effect, try using the Tungsten preset.</p><p> And, of course, <em>always</em> shoot in RAW! That way, you can adjust the white balance in post-processing, and you can even recover missing shadows and highlights after the fact.</p><h2 data-section id="capture-sunrise-silhouettes"> 6.

But how do you get the best results?</p><p> First, capturing the perfect silhouette during sunrise requires you to identify a strong subject. This could be a tree, a building, or even a person; you want to showcase a clear outline that stands out and really catches the viewer&#39;s eye.</p><p> Position your subject between yourself and the sun. Finding the right position may require some trial and error, so don&#39;t be afraid to move around and try different angles.</p><p> Finally, make sure you expose for the sky, not the silhouetted subject. So set your exposure using the sky just behind your subject. It may feel counterintuitive, but exposing for the sky helps maintain the silhouette effect while preserving the delicate hues of the sunrise.</p><h2 data-section id="compose-to-add-interest"> 7.

Take a moment to look your scene over. Ask yourself: What part of the sunrise or sunset is the most dramatic? Are there any parts that aren&#39;t that interesting?</p><p> Once you&#39;ve done this, simply compose the shot to include <em>more</em> of the most dramatic scenery.

Foreground elements will give your sunrise photos depth and interest. Look for rocks, flowers, or other natural elements to include in the frame. By adding these elements, you can create a compelling composition that draws the eye through the image.</p><p> Position your foreground elements thoughtfully. You want them to add to the composition, not distract from the sunrise. Consider the lines and shapes that these elements create and how they interact with the rest of the scene.</p><p> In a previous tip, I mentioned the value of a wide-angle lens, but when working with foreground elements, the wide perspective becomes more important than ever. This can create a grand, sweeping view that encapsulates not just the sunrise, but the entire landscape. A wide-angle lens can make the foreground seem more prominent, so it&#39;s essential to compose your shots carefully to keep the balance.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255494" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-1010.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="Sunrise photography" class="wp-image-255494" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-1010.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-1010.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-1010.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-1010.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sunrise-photography-1010.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Focus close to the foreground elements to ensure they&#39;re sufficiently sharp with the sunrise serving as a beautiful backdrop. And experiment with different depths of field. A wide aperture (like f/2.8 or f/4) can blur the sunrise slightly and make your foreground elements stand out. Alternatively, a smaller aperture (like f/8 or f/11) can keep everything in focus, creating a more detailed and layered image.</p><h2 data-section id="wait-for-the-right-shot"> 9.

Other times, however, waiting is the name of the game. Due to the dynamics of natural lighting, a scene can completely change from one hour to the next (sometimes even from one <em>minute</em> to the next).</p><p> That&#39;s why you should arrive on location before the sunrise starts and stay until the sunrise ends. Sure, you&#39;ll be there for a while, but you can spend that time testing out different settings and being creative. Try different exposure times and play with your aperture. Let the clouds and sun change positions or move your camera higher or lower for a slightly different angle. And include additional subjects in the frame; put them in the foreground so they contrast with the sunrise.</p><p> The longer you&#39;re on location shooting, the more variety you&#39;ll end up with – and the better your chances of capturing an <em>incredible</em> shot.</p><h2 data-section id="try-hdr-techniques"> 10.

(Note that you <em>can</em> create the same effect using a graduated neutral density filter, but these accessories are often expensive and less flexible.)</p><p> You&#39;ll want to use a tripod to ensure that your camera is stable because HDR requires multiple shots at different exposures. The shooting process is pretty simple: compose your image, then capture a handful of shots at different exposure levels. Make sure at least one file exposes for the sky, one file exposes for the midtones, and another exposes for the shadows.</p><p> You&#39;ll then need to merge the files in software like Photoshop. When merging the images, play around with the settings in your software to make it look natural. A heavy-handed approach to HDR can make your sunrise look surreal, so take your time and make adjustments until it looks right.</p><h2 data-section id="come-back-to-the-same-location"> 11.

Each visit offers an opportunity to deepen your connection with the landscape. You&#39;ll start to notice the subtle changes in light, shadows, and weather conditions that create a unique scene every time. This familiarity not only aids in capturing remarkable images but also fuels your creative instincts.</p><p> Consider creating a series of images that examine a location in different conditions. Shoot the location in both winter and summer; shoot just before sunrise, at the moment the sun comes up, and a few minutes after the sun has risen. Try out different compositions.</p><p> A great benefit of revisiting a spot is the ability to learn from your previous experiences. If a shot didn&#39;t work out the last time, you have a chance to refine it. Keeping notes on what you learned can be incredibly helpful. It&#39;s like a conversation with your past self, guiding you to make better choices and ultimately capturing that perfect sunrise photo.</p><h2 data-section id="dont-forget-to-process-your-sunrise-files"> 12.

RAW files allow for greater manipulation without losing quality; that way, you can bring out the best in your sunrise photos when editing.</p><p> Adjusting the white balance can really make the sunrise colors pop. The white balance setting affects how your camera interprets different colors of light, so tweaking it can enhance the warmth and richness of the sunrise. Play around with the temperature in your editing software until you find what looks best for your particular image.</p><p> Try enhancing the contrast, which helps the foreground and clouds stand out without looking unnatural. Just be mindful not to overdo it, or you might lose subtlety in the image.</p><p> If the sky is too bright, lower the highlights in your editing software. This will reveal more color and detail in the brightest parts of the image, helping to balance the exposure. That way, you can achieve a more harmonious and pleasing result.</p><h2 data-section id="sunrise-photography-final-words"> Sunrise photography: final words</h2><p> Now that you&#39;ve finished this article, you should be ready to capture some stunning images at sunrise.

Don&#39;t rely on your camera to pick the shutter speed. Instead, choose a shooting mode that lets <em>you</em> dial in the shutter speed directly – either <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/" target="_blank" aria-label="Shutter Priority mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Shutter Priority mode</a> or <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> .</p><p> Shutter Priority mode lets you select the shutter speed and the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> (which essentially refers to the sensitivity of the camera sensor to light), while the camera automatically picks the aperture. If you set your camera to Shutter Priority, I recommend setting the ISO as high as you can without risking image-ruining noise. (I have no problem going to ISO 3200 on my camera, though you should test out your own camera model to get a sense of its high-ISO capabilities.)</p><p> Then you&#39;ll need to set your shutter speed. I&#39;d recommend starting at 1/125s; you want to set a shutter speed that&#39;s fast enough to freeze the action but no faster than necessary. If the shutter speed is too fast, your images will be sharp, but they&#39;ll be dark (ie, underexposed).</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255449" style="width:2250px"><span class="space" style="width:2250px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2250" height="1500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-12.jpg?resize=2250%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Tips for breathtaking aquarium photography" class="wp-image-255449" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-12.jpg?w=2250&amp;ssl=1 2250w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-12.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-12.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-12.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-12.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-12.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-12.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-12.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Manual mode, on the other hand, lets you select your ISO, your shutter speed, <em>and</em> your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> . It&#39;s a good mode for more seasoned photographers, so if you&#39;re comfortable with such an approach, I recommend setting your ISO as high as you can stomach, opening the lens aperture as much as you can (or are comfortable doing from a creative perspective), and then set your shutter speed to 1/125s or faster.</p><p> You&#39;ll then need to adjust the shutter speed to ensure a perfect <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure</a> ; it&#39;s important to pay attention to the exposure bar in the viewfinder, though you can also capture several shots, view them on the LCD screen, and make adjustments accordingly.</p><p> Here are my typical aquarium photography settings:</p><ul><li> ISO 3200</li><li> f/2.8</li><li> 1/60s</li></ul><p> However, shooting at 1/60s takes practice <em>and</em> only works with slower subjects, so don&#39;t be afraid to widen your aperture, boost your ISO, and bump your shutter speed as required.</p><h2 data-section id="the-best-aquarium-photography-gear"> The best aquarium photography gear</h2><p> Aquarium photography is an exciting endeavor, but having the right gear is often essential to success. Here are a few key items to consider:</p><h3 data-section id="a-powerful-camera"> A powerful camera</h3><p> I encourage you to you opt for a DSLR or a mirrorless camera; these models generally give you manual control over settings so you can adjust different elements to suit different aquarium environments. They offer the flexibility to play with exposure, focus, and other essential elements so you can capture stunning underwater aquarium images.</p><p> Low-light performance is another crucial aspect to consider. Aquariums are often dimly lit, and using flash can create unnecessary reflections. A camera with an impressive high ISO performance allows you to shoot in these conditions without compromising on clarity.</p><p> Finally, shooting in RAW can be a lifesaver. It provides more latitude in post-processing, enabling you to correct colors, balance exposure, and ensure that your photos look exactly how you envisioned.</p><h3 data-section id="a-carefully-chosen-lens"> A carefully chosen lens</h3><p> The lens you choose can significantly impact the quality and creativity of your aquarium photographs. A versatile zoom lens gives you the flexibility to compose shots, particularly in confined spaces where moving around might be restricted. With a good zoom range, you can capture both close-ups and wider shots without needing to switch lenses continually.</p><p> If you plan on taking detailed shots of smaller species, a macro lens becomes essential. It enables you to get up close and personal with the subjects, capturing every intricate detail. Pair this with a wide maximum aperture like f/2.8, and you&#39;re equipped to shoot in especially dark environments. (A wide aperture lets in more light, allowing for faster shutter speeds and reducing the risk of motion blur.</p><p> When investing in lenses, remember that quality matters and that reputable brands generally offer superior performance and build.</p><h3 data-section id="best-accessories-for-aquarium-photography"> Best accessories for aquarium photography</h3><p> Aquarium photography doesn&#39;t technically <em>require</em> any accessories; that said, many photographers do prefer to work with a tripod when possible. Not only do tripods keep your camera stable in low light, but they can also be a big help when composing each image.</p><p> Unfortunately, tripods are often off-limits at most aquariums. If tripods are not allowed or impractical, a monopod can be a good alternative. It provides some stabilization without being as intrusive as a full tripod.</p><p> Additional accessories can also play a vital role in a successful aquarium photography session. Extra batteries and memory cards are essential, as aquarium photography can be time-consuming and you don&#39;t want to miss that perfect shot. Keeping your lens clean from smudges, especially when shooting close to the glass, will ensure your images remain clear, so don&#39;t forget your lens cleaning supplies.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255454" style="width:2135px"><span class="space" style="width:2135px; padding-top:70.26%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2135" height="1500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=2135%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Tips for breathtaking aquarium photography" class="wp-image-255454" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-5-1.jpg?w=2135&amp;ssl=1 2135w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=300%2C211&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=600%2C422&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=768%2C540&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C1079&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=2048%2C1439&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/aquarium-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=717%2C504&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="essential-tips-for-aquarium-photography"> Essential tips for aquarium photography</h2><p> Now that you&#39;re familiar with the basic gear and settings for photographing aquariums, let&#39;s take things to the next level with a handful of my best tips, starting with:</p><h3 data-section id="turn-off-your-flash-and-get-close"> 1.

But while aquariums <em>are</em> extremely dark, you definitely don&#39;t want the flash to fire; it&#39;ll create a huge reflection on the glass that&#39;ll almost certainly ruin your photo.</p><p> So before you even enter the aquarium, make sure to disable your flash.</p><p> Even with the flash deactivated, however, you still might encounter some ambient light reflecting off the glass, which will distract the viewer and can make your subjects appear less sharp.

To combat this, you&#39;ll likely need to use slower shutter speeds, which in turn can lead to camera shake and blurry images. As I discussed above, if the aquarium&#39;s rules allow it, a tripod or monopod is a great solution. But if not, there are still ways to stabilize your camera.</p><p> First, utilize any built-in stabilization that your camera or lens might offer. This technology can significantly reduce the effect of small movements and vibrations. If your camera doesn&#39;t have this feature, pay close attention to your posture and grip. Holding the camera with both hands and tucking your elbows into your body can provide extra stability.</p><p> Another useful method is to find support within the environment. Leaning against a wall or resting the camera on a solid surface can help. Remember, practicing and finding what works best for you in different situations is key. Every aquarium is unique, and mastering the art of handheld shooting can open up new opportunities in this fascinating world of underwater photography.</p><h3 data-section id="try-manual-focus"> 3.

This is where utilizing manual focus can make all the difference. Unlike autofocus, which frequently accidentally targets reflections or smudges on the glass, manual focus puts you in control, allowing you to pinpoint exactly what part of the scene you want to be sharp.</p><p> If you&#39;re new to manual focus, it might seem intimidating at first. Start by practicing on larger, more stationary subjects within the aquarium. Many modern cameras offer features like focus peaking, which highlights the in-focus areas on your screen and helps guide your adjustments. These aids can be incredibly effective as you learn to navigate manual focus.</p><p> Keep in mind that mastering manual focus is a skill that takes time and patience to develop. However, once you&#39;ve honed this skill, the creative control it offers can be incredibly rewarding. Whether you&#39;re trying to capture a detailed close-up of a coral or track a fast-moving shark, manual focus enables you to decide what&#39;s important in the scene, ensuring that your photos turn out exactly as you envisioned them.</p><h3 data-section id="adjust-your-angle-to-make-your-shots-more-interesting"> 4.

If the image is too bright, simply raise your shutter speed or add in some <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-exposure-compensation-to-take-control-of-your-exposure/" target="_blank" aria-label="negative exposure compensation (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">negative exposure compensation</a> until the subject turns into a perfect silhouette!</p><p> You can also capture gorgeous silhouettes of people standing by the aquarium glass.

Always be aware of where your camera equipment is, use straps to secure it, and be careful not to obstruct pathways or exhibits.</p><p> Sometimes, the most unique angles and captivating shots are found in unexpected places. Look beyond the main exhibits and explore different viewpoints, and don&#39;t be afraid to venture into lesser-visited tanks or corners of the aquarium. This exploration can lead you to hidden gems and offer great photo opportunities away from the crowds.</p><p> An interesting aspect of aquarium photography is capturing human interaction with the exhibits. Observing how children marvel at a giant fish tank or how a couple enjoys a tranquil jellyfish display can add a new layer of storytelling to your photography. These candid shots can convey emotions and human connection to the aquatic world, making your photos more engaging and relatable.</p><p> Lastly, it&#39;s essential to understand and respect the rules and guidelines of the aquarium. From keeping tripods and monopods out of the way to obeying any flash photography restrictions, adhering to the aquarium&#39;s policies ensures a pleasant experience for everyone. Plus, it reflects well on the photography community so everyone can maintain a good relationship with these amazing venues.</p><h2 data-section id="tips-for-aquarium-photography-final-words"> Tips for aquarium photography: final words</h2><p> Well, there you have it:</p><p> My top tips for improving your aquarium images!

I also share plenty of 24-70mm photo examples, so you know what to expect after buying.</p><p>让我们开始吧。</p><h2 data-section id="what-is-a-mm-lens"> What is a 24-70mm lens?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255400" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="24-70mm lens photography" class="wp-image-255400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-1.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> You might have heard photographers raving about the 24-70mm lens – and for good reason. Let&#39;s dig into what exactly this lens is.</p><p> A 24-70mm lens isn&#39;t exactly a <a aria-label="wide-angle lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/7-ways-to-get-more-out-of-a-wide-angle-lens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">wide-angle lens</a> , nor is it a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-tips-for-great-telephoto-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="telephoto lens (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">telephoto lens</a> . It&#39;s what&#39;s often called a <em>standard zoom</em> or a <em>wide-to-telephoto zoom</em> .为什么？ Because it starts at a wide-angle focal length of 24mm and goes all the way up to a short-telephoto focal length of 70mm. It&#39;s a lens that covers a lot of ground in one package.</p><p> If you&#39;re using an APS-C camera, things change a bit. A 24-70mm lens on an APS-C camera offers an effective focal length of roughly 35-105mm. In other words, it tones down the wide-angle perspective and gives you a bit more reach on the long end.</p><p> The 24-70mm zoom is incredibly popular. In fact, I would say it&#39;s one of the most common, if not the most common, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/zoom-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="zoom lenses (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">zoom lenses</a> used by enthusiasts and professionals. It&#39;s a go-to lens for many because of its amazing versatility, impressive optics, and great design.</p><p> And it&#39;s not just one or two manufacturers making these lenses. All the big names in the lens world offer 24-70mm glass, which tells you something about its importance in photography.</p><h2 data-section id="common-subjects-for-mm-photography"> Common subjects for 24-70mm photography</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-138270" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-11.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="24-70mm lens photography" class="wp-image-138270" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-11.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-11.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-11.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-11.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-11.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The 24-70mm lens is highly versatile, so it&#39;s used to photograph in a wide variety of scenarios. Here are a few genres where this lens really shines:</p><p> <strong>Portrait photography:</strong> The 24-70mm lens can capture stunning wide-angle portraits as well as full-body poses and tight headshots. It&#39;ll also prevent you from needing to change lenses while shooting. Imagine the flow and the connection you can maintain with your subject without pausing to swap glass.</p><p> <strong>Wedding and event photography:</strong> The 24-70mm focal length range allows for both wider and tighter compositions so you can capture the grandeur of a wedding ceremony at 24mm and then zoom in for intimate shots of the bride and groom at 70mm. Planning to photograph indoor or nighttime events? The f/2.8 version of this lens ensures quality images in challenging lighting conditions.</p><p> <strong>Landscape photography:</strong> While the 24mm end doesn&#39;t offer the ultra-wide perspective loved by many landscape shooters, it still provides a reasonably wide field of view. Imagine a breathtaking mountain range or a vast desert; you can capture the entire expanse at 24mm and then zoom in to 50mm or 70mm for more intimate compositions.</p><p> <strong>Still-life photography:</strong> 24-70mm lenses can also come in handy when photographing food, products, and other still-life subjects; as I explore in greater detail below, these lenses tend to offer surprisingly solid close-focusing capabilities. Plus, the optics are impressively sharp – always a benefit when doing close-up photography!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255401" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:67.47%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1012" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-3-rotated.jpg?resize=1500%2C1012&#038;ssl=1" alt="24-70mm lens photography" class="wp-image-255401" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-3-rotated.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-3-rotated.jpg?resize=300%2C202&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-3-rotated.jpg?resize=600%2C405&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-3-rotated.jpg?resize=768%2C518&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-3-rotated.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-3-rotated.jpg?resize=436%2C293&amp;ssl=1 436w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-3-rotated.jpg?resize=717%2C484&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Bottom line: A 24-70mm lens won&#39;t limit you to specific types of photography, and it&#39;s like having several lenses in one.

Maybe you&#39;re struggling to decide which version to buy. Let me help clear things up for you.</p><p> The 24-70mm lens is generally offered in two variations: f/2.8 and f/4. This number refers to the maximum <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> offered by the lens: the f/2.8 version is able to use a wider f/2.8 aperture, whereas the f/4 version can only widen the aperture to f/4. As a result, the f/2.8 version can take in more light compared to the f/4 version.</p><p> The optical difference between 24-70mm f/2.8 and f/4 lenses might not seem massive. For some photographers, it isn&#39;t. But it <em>can</em> matter significantly in a few specific scenarios. And when choosing between an f/2.8 and f/4 lens, there are some additional consequences that you&#39;ll want to consider.</p><p> First of all, because the f/2.8 version can gather more light, it allows for better handheld images in darker scenarios. Thanks to the light boost, you won&#39;t need to drop your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> or <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="raise your ISO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">raise your ISO</a> , and this means you can capture images that are sharper and less noisy. (It&#39;s the reason why many wedding and event photographers only work with a 24-70mm f/2.8.)</p><p> Second, wider apertures produce a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-get-shallow-depth-of-field-in-your-digital-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="shallower depth of field effect (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shallower depth of field effect</a> , so the f/2.8 version allows for more intense <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" aria-label="background bokeh (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">background bokeh</a> . This is especially important in portrait photography. If you&#39;re serious about portraits, I recommend purchasing the 24-70mm f/2.8 over the 24-70mm f/4. Can you still produce nice background blur with an f/4 lens? Yes, but it&#39;ll be a lot harder to do, and often won&#39;t look quite as good.</p><p> On the other hand, these wide-aperture zooms do tend to be heftier than their narrow-aperture counterparts. And they are far, far pricier.</p><p> Therefore, unless you specifically need an f/2.8 version of the 24-70mm lens for handheld low-light shooting or background bokeh effects, it&#39;s a good idea to go for the f/4 version. It&#39;ll get you the same results – at half the price, and with half the heft.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255403" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-5.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="24-70mm lens photography" class="wp-image-255403" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-5.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-5.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-5.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-5.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/24-70mm-lens-5.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> 24-70mm f/2.8 lenses tend to be larger and heavier than 24-70mm f/4 lenses.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Making the right choice between these two versions requires you to know what you&#39;re after.

You can spot interesting subjects, bring your camera to your eye, and snap away – whereas ultra-wide lenses and telephoto lenses force you to think about the field of view, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/why-are-my-buildings-falling-over-a-short-guide-to-perspective-distortion-and-correction-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">distortion</a> , <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-focal-length-and-background-compression-to-enhance-your-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compression</a> , and how they change the scene.</p><p> Even at 24mm, distortion is limited. So you can do wide-angle photography <em>without</em> worrying about wide-angle effects. And at 70mm, you can zoom in for tighter compositions while still capturing a relatively neutral perspective.</p><p> Plus, the 50mm focal length is outstanding for portrait photography: not so long that you lose intimacy, and not so wide that you stretch the subject. Instead, it&#39;s <em>just right</em> .</p><h3 data-section id="mm-lenses-offer-close-focusing"> 2. 24-70mm lenses offer close focusing</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-138260" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-1.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="24-70mm wolf close-up shot" class="wp-image-138260" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-1.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> 24-70mm lenses are designed for <em>standard</em> -sized subjects, right?</p><p> Well, yes…and no.</p><p> You see, while these lenses are often created with portrait, landscape, and nature subjects in mind, they also offer impressive close-focusing capabilities. The minimum focusing distance does vary from model to model, but it&#39;s generally around 15 inches (38 centimeters).</p><p> In other words, you can use a 24-70mm lens to capture stunning close-up shots – of flowers, leaves, portrait details, and more. What&#39;s especially exciting is how flexible a 24-70mm lens can be; if you&#39;re photographing a portrait subject, you can step back for a nice full-body shot, move in slightly for a head-and-shoulders composition, then move in even closer for a detail photo of your subject&#39;s eyes, ears, or clothing.</p><p> Event photographers use this close-focusing flexibility <em>all the time</em> . Zoom out for a shot of the wedding guests, step in for a shot of the centerpieces, zoom out for a shot of the ceiling, step in for a shot of the place settings.</p><p> And if you like to shoot landscapes, you can capture sweeping scenics at 24mm, then zoom in to 70mm and get in close for details of rocks, sand patterns, etc.</p><p> It&#39;s so convenient, and it&#39;s all thanks to the power of a 24-70mm lens.</p><h3 data-section id="the-focal-length-range-is-incredibly-versatile"> 3. The focal length range is <em>incredibly</em> versatile</h3><p> I&#39;ve already touched on this, but it&#39;s arguably the most important benefit of a 24-70mm lens, so it deserves its own section.</p><p> You see, with a 24-70mm lens, you can shoot at a slew of different focal lengths, from wide to standard to telephoto, and this range offers limitless possibilities in the face of demanding photoshoots.</p><p> First of all, when doing a single photoshoot, you can easily go from a wide angle to a zoom, adjusting quickly as the scene and your subjects change. And you won&#39;t have to switch out your lens <em>at all</em> , which will keep the flow of the photoshoot intact and will prevent you from missing key moments as you switch from one lens to the next. </p><figure class="is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-138263" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" data-id="138263"  src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-4.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="24-70mm lens photography" class="wp-image-138263" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-4.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-4.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-4.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-138268" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" data-id="138268"  src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-9.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="24-70mm lens photography" class="wp-image-138268" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-9.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-9.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-9.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></figure><p> Plus, the versatility of a 24-70mm lens means that you can work with it and nothing else, even as you go gallivanting across the world for destination shoots and vacations.

Manufacturers know that these are “walkaround” lenses, so they&#39;ve made sure a 24-70mm can handle anything you might face, from rain and snow to blowing sand and dust.</p><p> If you frequently shoot in deserts, near waterfalls, or at the beach, then a 24-70mm lens will be a <em>lifesaver</em> , allowing you to capture all sorts of compositions without worrying about ruining your precious optics. Of course, you should always practice proper lens care; I don&#39;t recommend you drop your lens in the water, let it get soaked, and so on. But as far as lenses go, 24-70mm options tend to be very solid.</p><p> (And you&#39;ll need a well-built camera, too; while 24-70mm lenses are amazing, they can&#39;t protect your camera electronics!)</p><p> Additionally, 24-70mm lenses feel <em>great</em> in the hands. They&#39;re not so long that you&#39;ll get tired after a few hours, and they&#39;re not so short that you have nothing to grip. You can comfortably use a 24-70mm lens for day-long photoshoots, and you&#39;ll always feel like you&#39;re working with an actual, solid <em>lens</em> .</p><h3 data-section id="the-size-and-weight-are-perfect-for-pretty-much-everything"> 5. The size and weight are perfect for pretty much everything</h3><p> On average, 24-70mm lenses measure around 3.3 x 3.3 x 4.9 inches (8.4 x 8.4 x 12.4 centimeters), and they weigh approximately 2 pounds (900 grams).</p><p> While these lenses aren&#39;t <em>tiny</em> , they&#39;re certainly not large, nor are they heavy. They fit in pretty much any camera bag you&#39;ll ever encounter, even when they&#39;re attached to a camera – so you can carry your setup in a shoulder-sling bag or a backpack without any trouble. Plus, because 24-70mm lenses are pretty short, you can hang your camera around your neck and you won&#39;t feel like you&#39;re carrying a brick.</p><p> In fact, my 50mm (f/1.2) lens weighs more than my 24-70mm lens, even though it&#39;s shorter. And I&#39;ve even managed to put my camera and 24-70mm lens in a regular old purse (which can come in handy in quite a few situations).</p><p> Bottom line: A 24-70mm lens is sized for photographic adventures of all types, from treks in the mountains to casual walks around the city to travel photography across the globe.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-138269" style="width:500px"><span class="space" style="width:500px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="500" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-10.jpg?resize=500%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="24-70mm lens man playing cello" class="wp-image-138269" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-10.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-10.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24-70mm-lens-10.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="tips-for-working-with-a-mm-lens"> Tips for working with a 24-70mm lens</h2><p> You&#39;ve got your 24-70mm lens and you&#39;re excited to use it.

See how they affect your compositions.</p><p> Try photographing a single subject at 24mm, then at 35mm, then at 50mm, then at 70mm. Pull up the images on your computer and observe them side by side. Ask yourself: How does each focal length change the view of the subject?</p><p> Soon, you&#39;ll get to know how each focal length will look – even before you look through the viewfinder.

It&#39;s a handy little feature that helps counteract camera shake; that way, you can photograph handheld at slower shutter speeds in the 1/20s-1/60s range, which is especially useful in low-light scenarios such as evening portrait sessions and indoor events.</p><p> So whenever you&#39;re photographing a relatively stationary subject and you don&#39;t have access to a tripod (or you simply don&#39;t want to use one), switch on that image stabilization.</p><p> That said, there are a couple of caveats to bear in mind. First, if you <em>are</em> using a tripod, make sure that you switch that image stabilization off. Otherwise, you might find that it actually increases the blur in your photos.</p><p> And second, be aware that image stabilization generally won&#39;t help you capture sharp photos of moving subjects. For that, you&#39;ll need a fast shutter speed.</p><h3 data-section id="watch-the-background"> 5.

And when shooting wide-angle compositions, you might notice that the background in your shots often turns out relatively sharp, even if you&#39;re using a wide aperture.</p><p> What does this mean for you?</p><p> It means you need to pay careful attention to what&#39;s happening behind your subject. A distracting background can easily take the focus away from your main subject. Maybe it&#39;s a bright sign in a street scene or a branch sticking out in a nature shot. Whatever it is, you&#39;ll want to make the effort to keep it out of your shots.</p><p> If you find yourself in an area where the background might cause some issues, try moving around your subject. Walk to the right or left, get down low, or even climb up high if you can. It&#39;s all about finding the right angle that lets your subject shine without any background interference.</p><h3 data-section id="consider-using-a-lens-filter-for-protection"> 6.

Even their application icons are nearly identical! But which one is right for you?</figcaption></figure></div><p> In the early days of digital photography, nascent editing applications like Adobe Photoshop and Corel PaintShop Pro let photographers edit, alter, and otherwise manipulate their images. The process was often slow and painstaking, but over time those types of programs improved – and now they&#39;re indispensable tools of the trade.</p><p> However, as digital photography increased in popularity and image libraries ballooned to tens and hundreds of thousands of files, it was clear that photographers needed more than just an editing solution. They needed a digital asset management solution.</p><p> Adobe solved this problem in 2007 with the release of Photoshop Lightroom, an all-in-one program that handled every element of a true end-to-end digital photography workflow: importing, organizing, editing, and exporting. While its suite of editing options was not nearly as comprehensive as traditional Photoshop, it quickly became the de facto solution for photographers who wanted one program to manage and tweak all their digital images.</p><p> Everything changed again ten years later when Adobe rewrote Lightroom from the ground up to meet the changing needs of modern photographers. The company kept the traditional Lightroom but renamed it “Lightroom Classic” and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/adobe-announces-new-lightroom-cc-what-features-are-you-most-excited-about/" target="_blank" aria-label="named the new program &quot;Lightroom CC.&quot; (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">named the new program “Lightroom CC.”</a> More recently, Adobe dropped the “CC” from the newer program&#39;s name, making it just “Lightroom.”</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255013" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:55.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="829" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-lightroom-classic-eye.jpg?resize=1500%2C829&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom vs. Lightroom Classic: The editing interface of Lightroom Classic, with image thumbnails at the bottom." class="wp-image-255013" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-lightroom-classic-eye.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-lightroom-classic-eye.jpg?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-lightroom-classic-eye.jpg?resize=600%2C332&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-lightroom-classic-eye.jpg?resize=768%2C424&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-lightroom-classic-eye.jpg?resize=160%2C88&amp;ssl=1 160w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-lightroom-classic-eye.jpg?resize=717%2C396&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Lightroom Classic has an extensive, refined set of tools for managing all aspects of a digital photography production workflow.

While it doesn&#39;t have the sheer depth of features or the number of users as Lightroom Classic, its cloud-first design, impressive phone and tablet support, and integrated features like <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/share-your-edit-feature/" target="_blank" aria-label="Discover (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Discover</a> have won over a new generation of photographers who want to do more with their digital images.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254990" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:69.47%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1042" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-editing.jpg?resize=1500%2C1042&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom vs. Lightroom Classic: The editing interface of Lightroom, with a red Indian Paintbrush flower and sliders such as Temp, Tint, Vibrance, and Saturation." class="wp-image-254990" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-editing.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-editing.jpg?resize=300%2C208&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-editing.jpg?resize=600%2C417&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-editing.jpg?resize=768%2C534&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-editing.jpg?resize=717%2C498&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Lightroom contains many of the same editing tools as Lightroom Classic, but they&#39;re revised to be more streamlined and easy to use.</figcaption></figure></div><p> In addition to an all-new user interface, Lightroom also completely reimagines the idea of digital photo storage. Instead of keeping images on a computer or external hard drive, Lightroom imports all your images to the cloud and stores them on Adobe&#39;s servers.</p><p> If you use a DSLR or mirrorless camera, your photos are uploaded from your memory card, and if you shoot with an iPhone or other mobile device, you can have all your files automatically sent to Lightroom as well. This means that all your photos are always available on every device and you never have to think about creating backups or buying more hard drives for your computer.</p><p> Lightroom&#39;s cloud-first design means you can easily share photos with others, create public and private albums, and invite people to edit your images or create remixes of your edits. This approach also allowed Adobe to create a program that remains (nearly) functionally identical whether you use the mobile app, iPad app, desktop app, or Lightroom in a browser.</p><p> Additionally, the Discover interface in Lightroom functions kind of like a social network; you can follow photographers, see their images, and step through each individual edit they made to their public photos. It&#39;s an incredible learning tool since you never have to wonder how a particularly stunning image was edited – instead, you can see all the edits one by one. You can also import these images into your library and share your own images to Discover.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254991" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:69.47%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1042" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-lightroom-discover.jpeg?resize=1500%2C1042&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom vs. Lightroom Classic: The Discover interface of Lightroom with 11 image thumbnails shown." class="wp-image-254991" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-lightroom-discover.jpeg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-lightroom-discover.jpeg?resize=300%2C208&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-lightroom-discover.jpeg?resize=600%2C417&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-lightroom-discover.jpeg?resize=768%2C534&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-lightroom-discover.jpeg?resize=717%2C498&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The Discover interface in Lightroom lets you follow photographers, see images they have shared, and step through individual edits on any image to see exactly how the final result was achieved.

I rely on it for personal work, client photoshoots, and family snapshots. It does everything I need – and a lot that I don&#39;t.</p><p> However, its wide range of tools and options is also its Achilles heel. Lightroom Classic&#39;s biggest barrier to entry, especially for new photographers, is that it&#39;s just not very easy to use. Its dizzying array of modules, panels, drop-down arrows, dialog boxes, and preferences takes months or years to understand, and many actions are powerful but unintuitive.</p><p> Lightroom is much easier to understand for photographers who have not used either program, and its cloud-based, mobile-friendly nature means that people who are comfortable doing everything from an iPhone or iPad will feel right at home. Editing is simple and intuitive, and the entire application has a simpler interface that removes some of the more complicated tools offered in Lightroom Classic in order to create a streamlined but still very powerful set of options that will please most photographers.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255020" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:58.13%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="872" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-crop-rotate.jpg?resize=1500%2C872&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom vs. Lightroom Classic: The editing interface of Lightroom.

Adobe has refined Lightroom Classic immensely over the years and newer versions are certainly better, but even something as simple as scrolling through large photo libraries or changing the size of image thumbnails can result in hiccups. Normal operations like applying edits, converting to DNG, and exporting are plenty fast, but other features – such as the facial-recognition tool – can bring even the most powerful computer to its knees.</p><p> Lightroom, by contrast, absolutely sails through anything you throw at it. Scrolling through tens of thousands of photos is fast and smooth, flipping from one photo to the next is practically instantaneous, and working with edits is as zippy as anything.</p><p> If sheer performance is all you want out of a digital asset management tool, Lightroom is the preferred choice. However, if you prefer a richer set of editing and organizational tools but don&#39;t mind some performance hiccups, Lightroom Classic will probably be more to your liking.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255023" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:55.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="829" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-facial-recognition.jpg?resize=1500%2C829&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom vs. Lightroom Classic: The facial recognition interface of Lightroom Classic." class="wp-image-255023" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-facial-recognition.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-facial-recognition.jpg?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-facial-recognition.jpg?resize=600%2C332&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-facial-recognition.jpg?resize=768%2C424&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-facial-recognition.jpg?resize=160%2C88&amp;ssl=1 160w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-facial-recognition.jpg?resize=717%2C396&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> If you want to slow Lightroom Classic to a crawl, just use the facial-recognition tool on a large collection of images.

Here, Lightroom is positively anemic compared to Lightroom Classic, and even several years after it was released, it is still missing what many would consider to be very basic organization features.</p><p> Lightroom organizes images using a simple Album/Folder structure: Photos are physically stored in Folders but one image can be in several Albums. Images can also contain star ratings and Flags such as Pick or Reject and be sorted on the fly to show only the photos that match these specific criteria.</p><p> But in terms of sheer photo organizational capability, Lightroom Classic wins hands-down – it&#39;s not even <em>remotely</em> close. Lightroom Classic has a bewildering assortment of methods that can be used to organize, sort, filter, and manage your pictures. You can use the Filter bar in the Library module to instantly narrow down all your shots according to specific criteria, and you can also search by Flag, Rating, and Color status. Smart Collections can be created that contain all images which match (or don&#39;t match) certain rules, and these are continually updated in real-time. When you import images, you can add metadata, change filenames, and specify exactly where you want your shots to be located.</p><p> Therefore, if organization and file management are your priorities, look no further than Lightroom Classic.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-with-caption"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255025" style="width:1496px"><span class="space" style="width:1496px; padding-top:69.05%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1496" height="1033" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-smart-collection.png?resize=1496%2C1033&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom vs. Lightroom Classic: The Smart Collection configuration dialog box in Lightroom Classic." class="wp-image-255025" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-smart-collection.png?w=1496&amp;ssl=1 1496w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-smart-collection.png?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-smart-collection.png?resize=600%2C414&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-smart-collection.png?resize=768%2C530&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-smart-collection.png?resize=717%2C495&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The sheer amount of parameters you can apply to a Lightroom Classic Smart Collection is mind-boggling.

It could only do basic operations and did not have much in the way of masking, grading, and other editing functions that photographers relied on for their workflows. Since then, Adobe has dramatically improved Lightroom&#39;s editing features, and it now covers nearly all of the operations that most photographers need.</p><p> Lightroom and Lightroom Classic offer basic tools like exposure and color adjustments, tone curves, color grading, and lens correction. Lightroom Classic goes a bit deeper on a few things – for instance, it lets you have pixel-precise control over chromatic aberration, whereas Lightroom does CA-removal automatically – but those kinds of operations are outliers.</p><p> Lightroom Classic&#39;s AI-powered masking features are incredibly impressive, and they&#39;re not available in Lightroom – but they almost certainly will be added to Lightroom in the near future. Lightroom Classic does also give you much greater control when copying edits from one photo to another or when syncing edits across many photos at once.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255035" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:60.13%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="902" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-editing-point-curve.png?resize=1500%2C902&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom vs. Lightroom Classic: The editing interface of Lightroom.

The winner here is difficult to say; it really comes down to what you need, not which program does more.</p><p> If you shoot professionally, you will likely appreciate the greater level of control and flexibility offered by Lightroom Classic, but if you value simplicity and ease of use, then Lightroom will probably suit you better.</p><h2 data-section id="lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-versatility"> Lightroom vs. Lightroom Classic: Versatility</h2><p> Once my kids are in bed, there are few things I enjoy more than sitting down in front of my 27-inch screen, putting on some music, and going through photos in Lightroom Classic. It&#39;s my happy place, and I can get lost in a state of photography flow for so long that time just slips away. Lightroom Classic offers everything I need right in one app, and it&#39;s versatile enough to handle any type of photoshoot and any type of photo. From importing to editing to exporting, it&#39;s all right where I need it, and it&#39;s organized in a way that makes sense to me.</p><p> Lightroom is equally versatile but in an entirely different way. It doesn&#39;t have the same level of microscopic control over every minute detail of the image management and editing process, but it <em>does</em> allow you to edit all your photos from any device or web browser. You never have to think about where your images might be located or whether you synced specific shots to the cloud. With Lightroom, everything is at your fingertips any time you want it.</p><p> Additionally, Lightroom&#39;s integration with the iPad and Apple Pencil is outstanding, and editing using this method is not just efficient but fun and enjoyable. Both Lightroom and Lightroom Classic are versatile in different ways.

But before we delve into the nitty gritty of smartphone photography, I&#39;d like to emphasize a few particular reasons why a mobile phone can outcompete a professional camera.</p><p> First and foremost, the portability and convenience of having a camera at all times are hard to beat. Your smartphone is always with you and is <em>always</em> ready to capture those unexpected moments, whether you&#39;re on a train, a plane, stopped at a light, or in the middle of your lunch break.</p><p> Second, the various built-in features and modes offered by smartphones – such as Portrait mode, HDR settings, and Night mode – can enhance the average beginner&#39;s images above and beyond the shots they can take with, say, a DSLR. Yes, an experienced photographer with an expensive camera could create similar effects with a careful approach and equally careful editing, but it takes time and a lot of effort to get to that point.</p><p> Third, a smartphone allows you to capture, edit, and share photos all in one place; in other words, it&#39;s a one-stop shop for photography. Imagine being on a trip, capturing a breathtaking sunset, editing the image, and sharing it with friends and family on Facebook – all in the span of about 10 minutes. This type of ultra-integrated shooting certainly isn&#39;t possible on a DSLR and is one of the unique benefits of smartphone photography.</p><p> Finally, the cost-effectiveness of smartphones compared to professional camera gear is also a significant advantage. Non-smartphone photography can be an expensive hobby, especially when you factor in lenses, tripods, and other accessories. However, most folks already own a smartphone that takes solid photos – and even if you&#39;re looking to upgrade so you can achieve the best possible shots, it still won&#39;t cost you an arm and a leg.</p><h2 data-section id="how-to-pick-a-smartphone-for-photography"> How to pick a smartphone for photography</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255278" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:56.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="844" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-103.jpg?resize=1500%2C844&#038;ssl=1" alt="Smartphone photography" class="wp-image-255278" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-103.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-103.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-103.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-103.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-103.jpg?resize=717%2C403&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> You can capture great photos with pretty much any smartphone. But if you&#39;re looking to capture ultra-clean images and gain access to cool features, you might want to consider an Android or iPhone device with photo-centric capabilities.</p><p> Here are a few key factors to consider when choosing the best smartphone camera:</p><h3 data-section id="image-quality"> Image quality</h3><p> Not all smartphone cameras produce equally high-quality photos. Resolution is one factor to consider here; more megapixels are often better, especially if you want to be able to crop your shots without dramatically degrading the quality.</p><p> You should also look for a larger sensor, which will – all else being equal – allow you to get sharper, more natural images when photographing in darker areas. Image stabilization can also come in handy, especially if you often end up with blurry photos in low-light situations.</p><h3 data-section id="focal-length-flexibility"> Focal length flexibility</h3><p> Many smartphones offer more than one camera. In addition to the ubiquitous standard camera, you might find a phone with a wide-angle and a telephoto camera, or even an ultra-wide or an ultra-telephoto camera. Wider cameras are perfect for landscapes, while telephoto cameras are ideal if you want to photograph tight portraits and distant subjects.</p><p> As you consider different options, think about the camera type(s) that best suit your interests. More cameras usually mean more flexibility, but make sure to look at the specs of each one. The image quality can often vary from one camera to the next, meaning that a 48 MP standard camera does <em>not</em> guarantee 48 MP telephoto images.</p><h3 data-section id="additional-features-and-modes"> Additional features and modes</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255285" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-108.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Smartphone photography" class="wp-image-255285" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-108.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-108.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-108.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-108.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-108.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-108.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Think about additional features that might help you with your photography. If you want to photograph stationary scenes at night – such as cityscapes from an apartment window – a night mode can make a huge difference. Portrait mode can add depth of field effects, while panorama mode is perfect for those wide scenic shots.</p><p> These additional modes and features can take your photography to the next level, but not every smartphone boasts every feature. Make sure that the device you pick gives you everything you need to capture the shots <em>you</em> want to create.</p><h3 data-section id="cost"> Cost</h3><p> Determining your budget is crucial, as smartphones can vary wildly in price. You&#39;ll want to think about a range that you&#39;re willing to spend, then look for the best value within that range. And don&#39;t just think about the cost of the phone itself. Consider the total cost, including potential accessories, image-editing app subscriptions, and so on.</p><p> If you don&#39;t have the budget to purchase a shiny new model, older models with strong camera features are definitely worth considering. It&#39;s all about finding the right balance between what you want and what you can afford!</p><h2 data-section id="smartphone-photography-accessories-are-they-necessary"> Smartphone photography accessories: Are they necessary?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255279" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-100.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="Smartphone photography" class="wp-image-255279" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-100.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-100.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-100.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-100.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-100.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you&#39;re just getting started with smartphone photography, it&#39;s fine to shoot with only your smartphone. However, once you become more familiar with your phone camera, and especially if you want to specialize in certain photographic genres, you may want to consider purchasing an accessory or two.</p><p> Now, I&#39;m not saying you should rush out and buy every gizmo and gadget on the market. Far from it. Instead, start by understanding your interests. Are you into sprawling landscapes or close-up flower photos? Depending on your answer, your smartphone setup should look quite different.</p><p> As you grow more confident and your skills start to increase, you can begin to build your kit. As you do, here are a few items worth considering:</p><h3 data-section id="a-tripod"> A tripod</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255280" style="width:450px"><span class="space" style="width:450px; padding-top:133.33%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="450" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-106.jpg?resize=450%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Smartphone photography" class="wp-image-255280" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-106.jpg?resize=450%2C600&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-106.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-106.jpg?resize=768%2C1025&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-106.jpg?resize=717%2C957&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-106.jpg?w=1124&amp;ssl=1 1124w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Stability is key in photography, especially for long-exposure shots, and that&#39;s where a tripod comes in handy. If you&#39;re shooting a scene and you want to show off movement – like a stream running through a valley – a tripod will keep your smartphone camera motionless as it records a photo for several seconds.</p><p> Additionally, a tripod allows for consistent framing when capturing several shots that you hope to blend together; this is key if you want to create stunning time-lapses.</p><p> Look for portable and adjustable options. Some tripods even come with Bluetooth remotes, allowing you to take photos from a distance without touching your phone. You can simply mount your smartphone on the tripod, step back, and use the remote to capture the perfect moment <em>without</em> worrying about camera shake.</p><h3 data-section id="clip-on-lenses"> Clip-on lenses</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255281" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-101.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Smartphone photography" class="wp-image-255281" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-101.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-101.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-101.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-101.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-101.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Perhaps you&#39;re looking to capture ultra-wide landscapes, detailed macro images, or photos of skittish subjects? If that&#39;s the case, clip-on lenses can help you out by enhancing your smartphone&#39;s capabilities. They come in various types, including wide-angle, fisheye, macro, and telephoto, and they can certainly give you some extra focal length flexibility when shooting.</p><p> Before buying a clip-on lens, however, ensure compatibility with your smartphone model. Additionally, the quality varies wildly from lens to lens – this is something that I have plenty of experience with! – so it&#39;s wise to read reviews and maybe even test out a few options before investing.</p><h3 data-section id="portable-lighting"> Portable lighting</h3><p> While professional photographers often love to use studio lighting, even serious iPhone and Android photographers tend to shy away from most forms of artificial light. It cuts down on portability, and it generally doesn&#39;t look that great.</p><p> That said, portable lighting solutions are sometimes useful for smartphone portrait and smartphone product photography; in particular, they can significantly improve lighting for indoor or low-light shots.</p><p> If you need an artificial light boost, consider LED ring lights or small portable LED panels. Some even come with adjustable color temperature for creative control. These tools can help you manage shadows and highlights in a way that helps you craft the mood you want to create, and they&#39;re designed to be ultra-lightweight and compact.</p><h2 data-section id="tips-to-level-up-your-smartphone-photos"> 15 tips to level up your smartphone photos</h2><p> Now let&#39;s take a look at the tips, tricks, and techniques you can use to capture beautiful photos using your smartphone, starting with:</p><h3 data-section id="clean-your-lens"> 1. Clean your lens</h3><p> This tip is extremely basic, but you will be <em>amazed</em> by the dirt and grime that accumulate on your smartphone lens.

Tap the screen to set focus</h3><p> Typically, when you point your smartphone at a subject, the camera will guess what you want to photograph. For instance, if it recognizes faces, it&#39;ll focus on the faces; if it recognizes a person, it&#39;ll focus on the person.</p><p> This method of autofocusing can work well, especially if you&#39;re photographing a clear scene with an obvious main subject. But when the scene is more complex – you&#39;re photographing a bird surrounded by trees, for example – your smartphone may get the focusing wrong, and the shot will turn out blurry.</p><p> So what do you do?</p><p> Instead of letting your smartphone&#39;s algorithms determine your point of focus, simply tap on your subject, and then – voila! – you&#39;ll get a sharp result.</p><p> Note: If you want extremely fine control over your smartphone&#39;s focusing – such as when you&#39;re doing close-up photography – there are a variety of camera apps that allow you to focus manually so that you can rack the plane of focus back and forth until you get the results you&#39;re after!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-173319" style="width:450px"><span class="space" style="width:450px; padding-top:133.33%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="450" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-4.jpg?resize=450%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="smartphone photography tips" class="wp-image-173319" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-4.jpg?resize=450%2C600&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-4.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-4.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-4.jpg?resize=717%2C956&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-4.jpg?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="dont-use-flash"> 3. Don&#39;t use flash</h3><p> Your smartphone camera has a flash, but it really, <em>really</em> sucks! Sorry – there simply isn&#39;t a way to sugarcoat it: The flash on your phone camera is not flattering for photos, whether you&#39;re shooting in the daytime, late at night, <a aria-label="landscapes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/smartphone-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">landscapes</a> , flowers, or portraits.</p><p> So whenever you&#39;re shooting, keep that flash <em>off</em> . Instead, use natural light for great results. For instance, shoot in the early morning or the late evening to get <a aria-label="beautiful golden lighting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-photograph-golden-hour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">beautiful golden lighting</a> , or work on cloudy days for soft, evenly lit images.</p><p> And if you desperately need extra light, invest in lighting accessories designed for smartphones, such as an LED ring light.</p><h3 data-section id="discreetly-take-photos-by-pressing-the-volume-buttons"> 4. Discreetly take photos by pressing the volume buttons</h3><p> Sometimes, the perfect shot requires a touch of subtlety – such as when you notice a beautiful scene while out walking, or if you&#39;re watching your kids do something especially cute. In such instances, using the volume button to take photos is a great way to capture the image without disturbing the subjects or making them feel self-conscious.</p><p> How does this work? Some smartphones automatically set the volume buttons as an alternative shutter control, while others don&#39;t default to this option but do let you set it up on your own (this process is simple and usually involves togging an item in the camera settings). Then, with your smartphone set, you can discreetly raise your camera and nudge a volume button upward or downward.</p><p> Remember, the key here is to use this technique with care and ethics. The goal isn&#39;t to make your subjects feel uncomfortable!</p><h3 data-section id="manually-set-the-image-brightness"> 5. Manually set the image brightness</h3><p> Did you know that you can set image brightness (ie, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="image exposure (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">image exposure</a> ) manually?</p><p> It&#39;s true, and you can use this function to control the level of detail that will appear in the final photo.</p><p> The details depend on your specific smartphone model, but try tapping on the screen, then look for some sort of exposure symbol (such as a sun). Swipe up (or drag the corresponding slider) to brighten the exposure, and swipe down (or drag the corresponding slider) to darken it.</p><p> Note that the general goal is to keep as much detail as possible in the final image. However, you can also deliberately brighten or darken an image for creative effect, like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-173321" style="width:450px"><span class="space" style="width:450px; padding-top:133.33%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="450" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-2.jpg?resize=450%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="smartphone photography tips" class="wp-image-173321" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-2.jpg?resize=450%2C600&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-2.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-2.jpg?resize=717%2C956&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-2.jpg?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="make-sure-your-smartphones-hdr-function-is-on"> 6. Make sure your smartphone&#39;s HDR function is on</h3><p> HDR is a handy feature found in most smartphones today, and you might be surprised to learn how much it can enhance your photos. It stands for <em>high dynamic range</em> , and its primary purpose is to bring out the details in the shadows and highlights. It works by taking multiple shots at different exposures and then merging them together to create a balanced image.</p><p> Most modern phones offer some sort of HDR option, which can often be toggled on and off in your phone&#39;s settings. (It&#39;s usually tucked away in the camera app settings.)</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255282" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-105.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Smartphone photography" class="wp-image-255282" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-105.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-105.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-105.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-105.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-105.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-105.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> What&#39;s important is that you make sure HDR is active when you&#39;re photographing scenes with significant contrast between bright and dark areas. It&#39;s especially useful for landscapes where the sky is bright but the land is shrouded in shadow, or for subjects that are lit from behind. As long as it&#39;s enabled, HDR will work its magic to even out those contrasts and make the image look more like how your eyes see it.</p><p> On the other hand, there are times when you might want to turn HDR off, such as when you&#39;re aiming for a more dramatic or moody effect. It&#39;s good to know how to control the feature so you can make a choice that fits your creative vision.</p><h3 data-section id="compose-your-photos-creatively"> 7.

This is great for individual or couple photos and can give a professional touch, similar to what you could achieve with a high-end camera.</p><p> Night mode is another powerful feature. If you&#39;ve ever tried to take a photo in low light, you know how difficult it can be, but Night mode takes several images and blends them together for a clear and bright shot.</p><p> And then there&#39;s Panorama. Want to capture a breathtaking landscape? Panorama mode lets you take a series of photos and stitch them together into one wide image.</p><p> You don&#39;t need to be a technical whiz to use these modes. Just find them in your camera app, select the one that fits your scene, and shoot. Over time, you&#39;ll get a feel for when to use each mode, but experimenting is the best way to learn!</p><p> So don&#39;t hesitate to try these modes and see what works best for you. The more you play with them, the more you&#39;ll understand what they can do. That&#39;s the first step in becoming a more skilled and confident smartphone photographer.</p><h3 data-section id="straighten-the-horizon"> 10. Straighten the horizon</h3><p> A common beginner smartphone photography mistake is a crooked horizon. After all, it&#39;s so easy to accidentally tilt your phone when shooting!</p><p> Unfortunately, crooked horizons are a major problem, and unless you know how to handle them (either in the field or in post-processing), you&#39;ll be stuck with a set of bad photos.</p><p> Fortunately, dealing with crooked horizons isn&#39;t difficult. Simply take a moment to turn on your camera grid; this will display a set of lines across the screen, which you can then use to level your horizons in the field.</p><p> You can also handle crooked horizons in post-processing. Most editing apps include some sort of straightening option, though you will lose pixels in the process, so it&#39;s always best to get it right in the field!</p><h3 data-section id="use-leading-lines"> 11.

And these lines, if used correctly, are insanely powerful.</p><p> When you&#39;re shooting with your smartphone, look around for roads, buildings, or even furniture that can help lead the eye to the subject. Technically, a leading line can be pretty much anything, from outstretched arms and tree branches to road signs and buildings, so even if you can&#39;t see any obvious lines, I encourage you to keep looking!</p><p> Once you find a leading line, adjust your position so that it points to the main subject.

Photograph in natural light</h3><p> Earlier in the article, I mentioned the value of natural light, but it&#39;s so important that it deserves its own section. You see, there is something so <em>pure</em> and <em>clean</em> about photographing in natural light. It looks great, it produces beautiful photos, and it&#39;s always available.</p><p> I love morning and evening light because of its golden hues and soft, flattering effect. Overcast light is nice, too. And even high-contrast light produced by the harsh sun can look amazing (especially in black and white).</p><p> If you shoot in heavy shade or at night, you can still use natural light, but you&#39;ll need to use a tripod to prevent image blur. (Fortunately, there are plenty of high-quality yet relatively cheap smartphone tripods to choose from!)</p><p> This next image, of a foggy morning out on Lake Michigan, shows the beauty of soft natural light:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-173324" style="width:450px"><span class="space" style="width:450px; padding-top:133.33%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="450" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-1.jpg?resize=450%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="smartphone photography tips" class="wp-image-173324" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-1.jpg?resize=450%2C600&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-1.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-1.jpg?resize=717%2C956&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="try-not-to-zoom"> 13. Try not to zoom</h3><p> Unless your smartphone offers a proper telephoto camera, I recommend you do as little zooming as possible.</p><p> You see, most zoom functions use <em>digital</em> zoom, which simply crops the image to magnify the subject. In other words, it doesn&#39;t actually get you closer to the subject; instead, it just removes pixels. Recently, smartphone manufacturers have developed algorithms that allow for slightly better results when zooming digitally, but it&#39;s still always better to get close to your subjects instead of relying on your device&#39;s digital zoom capabilities.</p><p> If you own a smartphone with a zoom capability, and you&#39;re not sure whether the images are simply cropped or whether the device boasts a genuine telephoto lens, go ahead and read the specifications sheet (you can find this on the manufacturer&#39;s website). In general, this should clear things up, and you can determine the best approach for photographing distant subjects.</p><h3 data-section id="consider-using-a-sophisticated-camera-app"> 14. Consider using a sophisticated camera app</h3><p> I know that you might be comfortable with the built-in camera app on your smartphone. But as you grow in your photography skills, you&#39;ll find that more sophisticated camera apps can provide you with greater control and creativity.</p><p> Many advanced camera apps offer manual controls. Imagine being able to adjust the shutter speed, ISO, and white balance, just like professional photographers do with their DSLRs. And as I mentioned in a previous tip, some of these apps let you focus manually to pinpoint <em>exactly</em> where you want the sharpest details in your image.</p><p> Some apps also allow for a more artistic shooting process. They&#39;ll apply filters to your camera feed in advance so you can see the world in high-contrast black and white, intense grunge, monochromatic blue, and much more. If you&#39;re in a creative rut, trying such an app can certainly help you out.</p><p> Note that camera apps like Adobe Lightroom Mobile and ProCam offer significant manual capabilities and are generally user-friendly, so don&#39;t be afraid to experiment with them and see what you think.</p><h3 data-section id="process-your-images-using-an-editing-app"> 15.

And the best part? You don&#39;t need to be a Photoshop wizard to do it. Most smartphones come with a range of easy-to-use editing apps that can help you enhance your pictures.</p><p> I&#39;d recommend starting with the basics: Crop your photo to improve the composition, then adjust brightness and contrast to make the image pop. You might also tweak the white balance or add a bit of sharpening. Don&#39;t be afraid to play around with these settings. Often, a little tweak here and there can make a world of difference.</p><p> Many of these apps also offer filters and presets. These are ready-made settings that apply a particular look to your image with just a single tap. They can be a fun way to explore different styles, but be sure to use them judiciously. Sometimes, less is more.</p><p> If you want to dive a little deeper, some apps allow more advanced editing like layering and blending. You might find these options a bit more challenging if you&#39;re new to editing, but don&#39;t be discouraged. There are plenty of tutorials online that can guide you through the process.</p><p> What&#39;s vital here is to maintain the <em>quality</em> of your image during editing. If the app doesn&#39;t offer non-destructive processing, always work on a copy of the photo rather than the original file, and be cautious not to over-edit. Subtlety often works best.</p><p> Editing isn&#39;t about changing what you captured; it&#39;s about enhancing it. Think of it as the final touch that brings your photo to life. And most importantly, have fun with it! Experimenting with different techniques can be an enjoyable and rewarding part of the photographic process.</p><h2 data-section id="how-to-take-amazing-smartphone-photos-final-words"> How to take amazing smartphone photos: final words</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255286" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-104.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="Smartphone photography" class="wp-image-255286" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-104.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-104.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-104.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-104.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-104.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-104.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> With a bit of practice, you can capture amazing smartphone photos of landscapes, people, and so much more – even if you&#39;re an absolute beginner.</p><p> Keep in mind that photographing with a smartphone should be <em>simple</em> .

While some horses may be exceedingly gentle, others can be unpredictable or even aggressive. A single kick from a horse can cause serious injuries, so caution is essential.</p><p> Never stand behind a horse or catch them by surprise. Sudden movements or even wearing bright colors can startle them. It&#39;s essential to be aware of the horse&#39;s presence and ensure they know where you are.</p><p> Before diving into the photography session, have a chat with the owner or handler about the horse&#39;s personality. Is the horse flighty or bitey? Have they ever seen a camera before? Understanding these aspects can help you approach with caution.</p><p> Flash photography is generally a no-no around horses unless you&#39;re sure they are used to it. A flash could endanger not just you but also the horse and the handler. I advise avoiding it as much as possible.</p><h2 data-section id="learn-the-horses-language"> 2.

This language is understood by horse owners and trainers, but it might be new to you. Spend some time researching horse body language before your first shoot. You&#39;ll want to understand how the horse is feeling to predict their behavior and avoid danger.</p><p> Horse owners often prefer certain positioning of ears, legs, and heads. For example, pinned-back ears signify an unhappy horse, while relaxed, forward ears can mean the horse is content. Understanding this language will not only keep you safe but also ensure you capture shots that the owners will love.</p><p> If you&#39;re familiar with this equine language, you&#39;ll have a better sense of what the owners want, and your photo shoot will be more successful.

It requires a delicate approach. When you first meet the horse, it&#39;s essential to create a calm environment.</p><p> Let the handler introduce you if the horse is calm enough. Allow the horse to approach you, sniff the camera, and become familiar with your presence. Talk softly and move slowly; a gentle pat might be welcomed if the handler deems it appropriate.</p><p> Are you unsure how the horse will react to the sounds of your camera? Organize a few test shots with the handler. Ensuring that everyone is in a safe position during these test shots is vital. If the horse reacts negatively, a sudden buck or kick can be dangerous.</p><p> If your camera has a silent shooting mode, this is a great time to use it. But remember, “silent” doesn&#39;t always mean entirely noiseless. Test it out to gauge the horse&#39;s reaction.</p><h2 data-section id="choose-the-right-lens-for-horse-photography"> 4.

It can be influenced by various factors, including the horse&#39;s temperament and the type of shots you&#39;re aiming for.</p><p> If you&#39;re doing a portrait session and the horse is comfortable with you getting close, a wide-to-standard zoom lens, like a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/every-photographer-needs-24-70mm-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="24-70mm (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">24-70mm</a> with a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="maximum aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">maximum aperture</a> of f/2.8, can be a great choice. With it, you can capture wide-angle shots or zoom in for tighter images.</p><p> A 50mm or 85mm prime lens is also a fantastic option. These lenses often offer quality at an affordable price, with a wide aperture like f/1.8 for <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" aria-label="beautiful background blur (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">beautiful background blur</a> .</p><p> When photographing from the sidelines or with a skittish horse, a longer telephoto lens is a must. A 70-200mm lens will allow you to capture detailed images from a distance.</p><p> Sometimes, having a good telephoto zoom handy, even with a more approachable horse, can enhance your shots. It allows you to get those close-up details without invading the horse&#39;s personal space.</p><h2 data-section id="dial-in-the-right-horse-photography-settings"> 5.

Capturing that connection between horse and rider in your lens? Even more so. Every horse owner has a bond with their companion that is unique, personal, and full of emotion. As a photographer, your mission is to capture that bond, that shared love, in a way that transcends the physical frame.</p><p> Take a moment to observe. Notice the horse and its owner, their interactions, their unspoken communication. Look for the soft moments, the shared glances, the loving gestures. It&#39;s in these fleeting moments that the true essence of their relationship lies. Patience is key here, and waiting for these tender moments can often reward you with the most touching and powerful images.</p><p> An integral part of this process involves integrating the rider into your photoshoot. It&#39;s essential for you to keep them engaged, keep them relaxed. Encourage them to interact with their horse naturally, as they would when no one is watching. These candid shots often result in the most authentic images, brimming with raw emotions and moments of connection. Remember, horse lovers are often just as excited to be part of the shoot as they are to have their equine companions photographed.</p><h2 data-section id="dont-forget-about-the-details"> 7.

These can range from the gleaming shine in their coat to the distinct patterns of their markings, the flowing mane, the softness in their eyes, and so much more.</p><p> I always find it useful to have a chat with the owner before I start clicking away. Get to know the horse through their eyes, understand what makes their horse special to them. They might have a fondness for certain features – the curve of the horse&#39;s neck, the unique color of their eyes, the way their mane catches the light. Your job as a photographer is to capture these personal favorites in the best light possible.</p><p> Use your lens wisely for these detail shots. A telephoto lens works great if you want to maintain a safe distance, especially if the horse is a little skittish. However, with a calm and friendly horse, feel free to move closer and use a standard lens. Experiment with varying your aperture to create a range of effects, from an overall sharp image to a focused shot with a beautifully blurred background.</p><h2 data-section id="take-your-time"> 8.

Spend a day, if possible, with the horse and the owner. Get to know them, understand their dynamics, build a rapport. Patience and understanding go a long way in establishing trust, which in turn helps capture the best possible images.</p><p> Observe the horse&#39;s habits, their likes and dislikes. Maybe they love a particular spot in the paddock, or they jump around gleefully after a good run. Keeping these nuances in mind will help you anticipate their actions and be prepared for spontaneous shots.</p><p> Slowing down also allows you to notice the small but significant details of the environment around you – interesting backgrounds, shifting light patterns, shadows, and reflections. All these elements can add depth and context to your photographs, turning a good picture into a great one.</p><p> Don&#39;t rush the process. Horse photography, like all good things in life, takes time. It requires patience, practice, and a keen eye for detail. But rest assured, the results will be worth your effort.</p><h2 data-section id="use-similar-techniques-to-photograph-equine-events"> 9.

Finding a safe spot is crucial, and one where the horse can see you from a distance. Always stay put and never move towards the horse and rider, and remember, using flash is a big no-no. Checking with any officials before you start is also a smart move.</p><p> To capture both horse and rider in mid-jump – a favorite of horse riders – you&#39;ll likely need a shutter speed around 1/650s to 1/800s. By setting your camera to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/burst-mode/" target="_blank" aria-label="continuous release (burst) mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">continuous release (burst) mode</a> , you can press the shutter just as the horse lifts off, increasing your chances of getting the perfect shot.</p><p> Focusing can be tricky, so you&#39;ll need to be extra attentive. Prefocusing in advance where you know the horse will be is an option, but I find using your camera&#39;s AF tracking to follow the horse generally better. It lets you shoot a variety of images as the horse moves in different directions, giving you a range of dynamic shots to choose from.</p><h2 data-section id="work-fast-for-horse-race-photography"> 10.

Horses at top speeds are incredibly fast, so I&#39;d recommend the fastest shutter speed the light will allow. Use your camera&#39;s continuous shooting mode, and don&#39;t hesitate to take hundreds of shots. Among the failures and near-duplicates, you&#39;ll find those magical moments that make it all worth it.</p><p> Getting close to the finish line at smaller race meets can make for breathtaking photos, but you&#39;ll need permission. Assure the officials that you don&#39;t use flash and that you understand how easily horses can be spooked. Your diligence can grant you access to some unique vantage points.</p><p> Here&#39;s a pro tip: try panning shots during the races. It captures the sense of movement and speed, giving your photos an artistic flair. Lower your shutter speed to around 1/30s and move your camera along with your subject as you fire the shutter. If done right, you&#39;ll end up with a sharp horse and rider against a stunning blur of motion in the background.</p><p> This technique might take a few tries to master, but the resulting images can be truly spectacular. Combining both standard and panning shots during horse races can provide you with an exciting and varied portfolio of images, each illustrating a different aspect of the race!</p><h2 data-section id="horse-photography-tips-final-words"> Horse photography tips: final words</h2><p> From understanding a horse&#39;s personality and body language to choosing the right lens and settings, we&#39;ve explored essential tips and techniques so you can capture beautiful images of horses.</p><p> Remember to approach each photo session with care and patience; with some perseverance, you&#39;ll capture plenty of horse photos you can be proud of – whether it&#39;s a tender moment between rider and horse, or the thrilling speed of a race.</p><p> Now it&#39;s your turn to grab a camera and explore the world of equine photography.

The pioneering modernist photographer Andre Kertesz captured beautiful nighttime street shots in Paris in the 1920s – and he inspired another skillful Parisian photographer, Brassai, to create breathtaking night street shots in the 1930s.</p><p> Nighttime street photographers don&#39;t have the luxury of strong sunlight, so they&#39;re forced to use a variety of different approaches to compensate. These include technical and equipment-based techniques such as long shutter speeds, high ISOs, flashes, and fast lenses, as well as visual techniques, such as adjusted aesthetics that embrace blur and grain.</p><p> Night street photography tends to be wonderfully atmospheric, and it&#39;s proven itself to be very popular in the 21st century, especially as low-light camera technology continues to improve.</p><h2 data-section id="the-benefits-and-drawbacks-of-photographing-the-streets-at-night"> The benefits and drawbacks of photographing the streets at night</h2><p> Nighttime street photography comes with several major benefits – in other words, there&#39;s a reason for its popularity!</p><p> For one, the streets tend to be emptier at night, allowing you to isolate a subject or two without difficulty – this can make for more powerful minimalistic shots.</p><p> Photographing at nighttime with streetlights also adds a different mood to images, giving a sense of mystery, nostalgia, drama, and even horror, depending on how you approach your shots.</p><p> And budding street photographers – and even more accomplished shooters – sometimes struggle with fear or discomfort when photographing strangers. Working at night, however, lends a sense of distance and anonymity that makes for less anxiety.</p><p> Of course, night street photography comes with several significant challenges. Cameras rely on light to capture sharp, well-exposed images, and nighttime – as you are undoubtedly aware! – doesn&#39;t offer much light. To address this, it&#39;s important to have a real technical mastery of the camera; otherwise, you&#39;ll end up with images that are blurry, grainy, or dark (or a combination of the three).</p><p> And while I do talk about this in greater depth at the end of the article, photographing at night in certain areas can be genuinely dangerous. Obviously, this depends on the location, and it also depends on the approach you take. Below, I offer tips for taking proper safety precautions at night, but it really is important to keep this in mind so you don&#39;t go in unprepared.</p><h2 data-section id="the-best-camera-settings-for-night-street-photos"> The best camera settings for night street photos</h2><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2_st_marks_skateboarder_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-63063" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2_st_marks_skateboarder_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="street night photography person in the snow" class="wp-image-63063" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2_st_marks_skateboarder_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2_st_marks_skateboarder_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2_st_marks_skateboarder_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> 1/125s | f/2.5 | ISO 6400</figcaption></figure></div><p> Capturing sharp street photos is mostly about the shutter speed, so that&#39;s where I&#39;d like to start. To freeze motion during the day, I prefer to use a shutter speed of 1/320s (with 1/160s as my lower threshold). But at night, this changes. In the brightest areas – lit by streetlights or car headlights – you can comfortably photograph at 1/250s, but most of the time, you&#39;ll need to use a shutter speed between 1/160s and 1/60s. Otherwise, you&#39;ll be forced to boost your ISO to ridiculous heights, and you&#39;ll risk ruining your images with noise.</p><p> Note that when your shutter speed is set to 1/60s, you&#39;ll need steady hands. (A lens or camera with image stabilization can help, too!) In fact, to photograph handheld at 1/60s, you need to stop your own motion completely. Fortunately, with some practice, this can be done.</p><p> As for your aperture setting: The wider the aperture, the faster you can make your shutter speed (or the lower you can drop your ISO). It&#39;s possible to shoot at f/4 in brighter areas at night, but if you can shoot at f/2.8, f/2, or even f/1.8, you&#39;ll have a much easier time. In other words, the wider your aperture for night street photography, the better.</p><p> Finally, you&#39;ll need to raise your ISO to 1600, 3200, or even 6400. With modern digital cameras, you can photograph at high ISOs and come away with decent images, and while it&#39;s always best to keep the ISO as low as possible, you just won&#39;t manage to get well-exposed shots at night otherwise. (I personally shoot at ISO 3200, and I sometimes go to ISO 6400 in especially dark areas or when I&#39;m photographing fast-moving subjects.)</p><p> What camera mode should you use? If you&#39;re doing fast-paced shooting in a variety of different lighting scenarios (ie, moving in and out of the street lights), Aperture Priority can work well – just set your camera to your widest aperture and highest tolerable ISO, then let it choose the shutter speed for you. (If the shutter speed drops below 1/60s, then you&#39;ll either need to accept some blurriness or boost that ISO further.)</p><p> And as for your method of focusing: Normally, zone focusing is a great method for street photography, but when using an ultra-wide aperture at night, you&#39;ll end up missing a lot of images. You can try using manual focus to prefocus in a certain area if you can anticipate a shot in advance, but working with continuous AF and one of your camera&#39;s tracking modes might be the better option, depending on your camera&#39;s capability. (If you&#39;re not sure what will work best, try to do some experimentation!)</p><h2 data-section id="essential-gear-for-nighttime-street-photography"> Essential gear for nighttime street photography</h2><p> The best nighttime street photography gear is broadly similar to daytime street photography gear in that you want your equipment to be lightweight, compact, and inconspicuous. That said, there are a few things to keep in mind when purchasing new equipment for those nighttime adventures:</p><h3 data-section id="pick-a-camera-with-good-high-iso-capabilities"> Pick a camera with good high-ISO capabilities</h3><p> Since you&#39;ll often be shooting at ISO 3200, ISO 6400, and even beyond, it&#39;s essential that you use a street photography camera that won&#39;t ruin your shots with an explosion of noise. Consider investing in a compact full-frame camera or a top-notch APS-C model, and try to keep the megapixel count on the lower side, as ultra-high MP cameras tend to actually perform worse when shooting at high ISOs compared to the lower MP siblings (assuming the technology is from the same generation).</p><p> Low-light focusing capabilities are also very handy – many cameras struggle to acquire focus in the dark, while others are high performers in this area. If your camera can&#39;t focus in near darkness, that&#39;s not an absolute dealbreaker – you can focus manually or shoot in the streetlights – but it&#39;ll certainly limit your flexibility.</p><h3 data-section id="pick-a-lens-with-a-wide-maximum-aperture"> Pick a lens with a wide maximum aperture</h3><p> As I mentioned above, you&#39;ll want to make sure you pick a compact lens for shooting the streets at night. But while most daytime street photography is shot at an aperture of around f/8, nighttime is a whole different ball game. You&#39;ll need to widen your lens&#39;s aperture to its maximum, which means that the wider the maximum aperture that&#39;s offered by the lens, the better.</p><p> Therefore, I&#39;d recommend grabbing a lens with a maximum aperture of at least f/2.8 (and f/1.8 or f/1.4 can be even better, assuming the models are still relatively compact).</p><p> It can also help to grab a slightly wider prime than you might be inclined to use otherwise, such as a 35mm, 28mm, or – if you&#39;re interested in a more unique look – 24mm. Wider lenses are less prone to camera shake, and they&#39;re also easier to use at night since the darkness and lack of activity results in fewer distractions throughout a broader scene.</p><p> Of course, you can still use a standard 50mm lens for nighttime street photography – a 50mm f/1.8, for instance, is great in nearly every street-photography scenario – but if you have the opportunity to go wide, I&#39;d recommend at least testing it out!</p><h2 data-section id="tips-for-night-street-photography"> 10 tips for night street photography</h2><p> Now that you understand the best settings and equipment for photographing the streets at night, let&#39;s take a look at a few tips – for both beginners and advanced street shooters – to enhance your results.</p><h3 data-section id="seek-out-light-sources"> 1. Seek out light sources</h3><p> Always pay attention to the main light sources in a scene. This is true no matter where or when you are photographing, but it becomes even more important at night. So instead of hunting for subjects, start by finding a beautiful light source or an area with good lighting, then wait around for something to happen.</p><p> Note that night street photography lighting can be anything: car headlights, streetlights, neon signs, window lighting, or even smartphone light. Simply look for noticeable illumination, then pay careful attention to how these light sources hit potential subjects. Adjust your angle until you get the lighting effect you want, then shoot away!</p><p> When I was <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/street-photographers-guide-new-york-city/" target="_blank" aria-label="photographing the streets of New York City (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">photographing the streets of New York City</a> , I found a beautiful restaurant with bright windows. I used the restaurant lighting to bring out detail in the passersby: </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/3-Noodletown-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-62980" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/3-Noodletown-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=600%2C399&#038;ssl=1" alt="people outside NYC restaurant at night" class="wp-image-62980" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/3-Noodletown-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/3-Noodletown-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/3-Noodletown-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/3-Noodletown-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> 1/60s | f/2.8 | ISO 3200</figcaption></figure></div><h2 data-section id="take-plenty-of-shots"> 2. Take plenty of shots</h2><p> Sometimes, street photographers like to use a more deliberate approach, capturing only a couple of images of each subject. This works fine during the day, especially if you can confidently nail the focus and exposure – but at night, it&#39;s a recipe for a lot of failed images.</p><p> So instead of just taking one or two images of each subject or scene, when you&#39;re out at night, push things a bit. Don&#39;t be afraid to capture 5-10 shots of the same subject, and if you&#39;re willing to sort through all the shots later, you might even consider using your camera&#39;s burst mode to fire off dozens of shots in a few seconds.</p><p> The idea here is to simply maximize your chances of success. The more you shoot, the more likely you are to hit on that moment when your subject is moving slowly enough to stay sharp, even at 1/60s – and the more likely are you to nail the focus even with a razor-thin depth of field.</p><h3 data-section id="photograph-nightlife"> 3. Photograph nightlife</h3><p> Certain parts of the city – such as the business district – can empty out at night; they&#39;ll make for a poor night street photography experience. Other areas, however, will get busier after sunset, and they&#39;ll offer plenty of opportunities.</p><p> So seek out the nightlife and shoot it! You might consider doing some internet searches for bars and clubs in your area, then make sure you head on over as the night begins. Alternatively, if you&#39;re after more formal-looking subjects, go for a walk near some upscale restaurants and see what you can find!</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-62984" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="photographing the nightlife" class="wp-image-62984" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> 1/125s | f/2 | ISO 6400</figcaption></figure></div><p> And don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re restricted to photographing people on the street outside clubs and restaurants. You can capture all sorts of stunning effects by shooting through windows (plus, if you&#39;re feeling a bit nervous about photographing people, the window can act as a barrier and reduce your anxiety).</p><h3 data-section id="alternate-between-getting-close-and-stepping-back"> 4. Alternate between getting close and stepping back</h3><p> I&#39;m a big proponent of Robert Capa&#39;s advice that “if your photos aren&#39;t good enough, you&#39;re not close enough.” However, I often violate this rule at night.</p><p> You see, while I do try to get close to many of my subjects – and I encourage you to do the same – I also try to create compositions where the subjects are small aspects of the overall scene. At night, backgrounds can be much more beautiful than during the day, so it often pays to have people become the secondary element in the scene, rather than the primary focus.</p><p> This approach comes with a technical advantage: When your subjects are off in the distance, you won&#39;t need to use a fast shutter speed to capture their motion. A nearby subject can be frozen at 1/125s or faster; a distant subject can often be photographed at 1/60s and turn out sharp, even if it&#39;s on the move.</p><h3 data-section id="experiment-with-a-tripod-for-creative-effects"> 5. Experiment with a tripod for creative effects</h3><p> When doing street night photography, it&#39;s usually best to go handheld. After all, you never know what interesting things are about to happen, and you want to be able to react fast.</p><p> That said, it can be useful to bring along a tripod, especially if you&#39;re interested in capturing some <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/long-exposure-street-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="long-exposure street photography (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">long-exposure street photography</a> .</p><p> The idea here is to find a busy area, mount your camera on a tripod, then use a slow shutter speed to capture people in motion. You&#39;ll need to experiment with different shutter speeds (1/8s is a good starting point), and you&#39;ll need to shoot a <em>lot</em> of photos, but you&#39;ll eventually end up with some gorgeous motion blur effects:</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/5-lower_east_side_nightlife_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-62987" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/5-lower_east_side_nightlife_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="motion blur night street photography" class="wp-image-62987" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/5-lower_east_side_nightlife_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/5-lower_east_side_nightlife_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/5-lower_east_side_nightlife_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> 1/8s | f/4 | ISO 800 | Tripod</figcaption></figure></div><p> It took me a long time to capture the image displayed above; I wanted the people spread throughout the entire scene, and I also wanted an interesting foreground subject (in the end, I was satisfied by the pose of the woman in the street and the man looking at her).</p><h3 data-section id="try-working-with-a-flash"> 6. Try working with a flash</h3><p> Some street photographers love using a flash, while others hate it. Whether you decide to try flash at night is up to you; on the one hand, it&#39;ll provide extra illumination so you can use a faster shutter speed, a narrower aperture, and a lower ISO. On the other hand, it&#39;ll give a very intense deer-in-the-headlights look, plus it can lead to confrontation (people don&#39;t like being flashed, especially in the dark!).</p><p> Personally, I prefer to work with the constraints of natural light, and I also get uncomfortable flashing strangers in dark settings. But if you feel confident enough to shoot with flash, then by all means, try it and see what you think. It can give a fantastic look when done well.</p><p> Note that you can have the flash do all the work lighting the scene (so that the foreground area turns out lit and the background is completely dark). But you can also set your camera to slightly underexpose the scene, then use the flash to add some fill light to your main subjects in the foreground.</p><h3 data-section id="be-careful-when-boosting-the-exposure"> 7.

And when this happens, you&#39;ll have no choice but to raise the exposure when editing. <em>Just make sure you do it carefully</em> .</p><p> Here&#39;s my recommendation: First, ignore the noise and get the exposure and look correct. If you have to raise the exposure a significant amount, the noise will be terrible, so you&#39;ll need to apply some <a aria-label="noise reduction (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-do-noise-reduction-in-lightroom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">noise reduction</a> .</p><p> There are many excellent noise reduction programs, but I like Lightroom&#39;s built-in noise reduction. If the noise is still bad after applying the noise reduction algorithm, try bringing the image into Photoshop to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tips-blur-filters-photoshop/" target="_blank" aria-label="add a very slight Gaussian blur (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">add a very slight Gaussian blur</a> .</p><p> At that point, I often use Lightroom&#39;s grain settings to add texture back into the photo. The result looks much more pleasing to the eye than extreme digital noise, and it can hide some of the technical deficiencies of underexposed images. The photo will not look perfectly sharp, but it can still be beautiful.</p><h3 data-section id="dont-be-afraid-of-blur-and-imperfection"> 8. Don&#39;t be afraid of blur and imperfection</h3><p> Most street photographers aim to get their photos as sharp as possible. Sharpness certainly isn&#39;t a bad thing – but know that a photo can still look fantastic even if it isn&#39;t incredibly crisp.</p><p> You see, when photographing at night, you don&#39;t need to freeze motion perfectly to get a stunning result. Personally, I hold my day images to a higher standard than my night images. My day images need to look sharp, while my night photos simply need to be interesting and look good, even if they&#39;re a little blurry in places.</p><p> Also, at shutter speeds from around 1/60s to 1/30s, it can be fun to shoot handheld. Your subjects will turn out somewhat sharp, yet there will be a little motion, too. It&#39;s a great way to add a sense of energy to your compositions.</p><h3 data-section id="let-your-night-street-photos-look-dark"> 9.

They should be dark, with deep shadows and areas that are hard to see. When you <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-read-and-use-histograms/" target="_blank" aria-label="look at the histogram (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">look at the histogram</a> of a night image, it should be skewed toward the far left, especially relative to your day images.</p><p> But when you point your camera toward a street scene at night, it&#39;ll often overexpose the photo. The resulting file will look bright and you&#39;ll be able to see plenty of detail, but the scene just won&#39;t feel real. (You&#39;ll also end up with blown-out streetlights and store windows.) In such cases, you&#39;ll want to lower the <a aria-label="exposure compensation (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-exposure-compensation-to-take-control-of-your-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure compensation</a> on your camera slightly or – if you&#39;re shooting in <a aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> – boost the shutter speed, narrow the aperture, or widen the ISO.</p><p> I do think that bright night images <em>can</em> look good. But dark, realistic night images are generally better, so carefully monitor the histogram and don&#39;t be afraid to drop that exposure compensation as needed.</p><h3 data-section id="be-careful"> 10. Be careful</h3><p> Depending on where you live, heading out at night with a camera is not always the safest idea. Travel light, keep your equipment to a minimum, and be careful about where you go. Make sure you pay attention to your surroundings, and if you start to feel uncomfortable, head in the other direction.</p><p> If you&#39;re not sure whether you can safely photograph on the streets at night, do some research. I&#39;d recommend messaging veteran street shooters in the area, though you can also look at general articles and statistics covering city crime rates.</p><p> Use your best judgment regarding who to photograph, and think about bringing a friend along. Don&#39;t stay in one place for too long, and avoid putting down your gear to change lenses. Finally, if you desire greater peace of mind, insure your gear before you head out!</p><h2 data-section id="tips-for-night-street-photography-final-words"> Tips for night street photography: final words</h2><p> Well, there you have it:</p><p> Everything you need to know for stunning night street shots.</p><p> Getting beautiful street photos at night isn&#39;t always easy.

I can help.</p><p> For most photographers, <em>nothing</em> compares to shooting in the fog. The mysterious shapes, the silky textures, the ethereal light – it&#39;s a uniquely magical experience, and it&#39;s a recipe for breathtaking photos.</p><p> But capturing stunning fog photography isn&#39;t always easy. Fog can be unpredictable, it can cause focusing and sharpness issues, and it generally appears during camera-shake-promoting low-light conditions. To create the best fog photos – the kind that you&#39;ll often find hanging on gallery walls – you need a well-planned approach. You should set out during the right conditions, use the optimal gear, choose the perfect settings, and more.</p><p> Fortunately, as a veteran fog photographer, I&#39;ve developed plenty of strategies to ensure that you can capture consistently great shots in the fog. And in this article, I share my 13 best tips – so if you&#39;re ready to start creating ethereal, mysterious images, then let&#39;s dive right in, starting with:</p><h2 data-section id="predict-the-fog-before-it-happens"> 1. Predict the fog before it happens</h2><p> What&#39;s the most challenging part of fog photography? Finding the fog, of course! In many areas, fog is a rare occurrence – and you, as a photographer, have no control over the weather. So you need to learn to predict fog in advance; that way, you&#39;re in a position to capture beautiful compositions when the right conditions occur. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/8-2.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Fog photography tips" title="8.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> The simplest way to anticipate fog is to check the weather. Fog happens almost exclusively in the morning, so before you head to bed each night, take a quick look at your favorite weather app. Scroll through the hourly predictions for the next morning, and if you see the “fog” icon, choose a good location, set your alarm clock, and make sure you set off in the dark.</p><p> Another option is to wake up before the sun rises and look outside for foggy conditions (assuming, of course, that you plan to shoot near your house). The problem with this approach is that fog can burn off quickly, and by the time you&#39;ve determined that fog is present, you may have missed the main event.</p><p> A third (and better) strategy is to learn to predict fog in advance. If you can understand the conditions that lead to fog, you can be prepared, no matter <em>what</em> the weather forecasters say. In particular, fog often occurs when:</p><ul><li> The ground is wet (due to the previous day&#39;s rain)</li><li> The temperatures are low</li><li> The wind is weak</li><li> Skies are relatively clear</li></ul><p> Make sure you pay special attention to the weather in late fall, winter, and early spring. While fog technically can occur at any time of the year, it happens far more regularly during the cooler seasons.</p><p> Pro tip: If you have a specific shot in mind and want to check the progress of the fog, see if you can monitor it using public webcams. That way, you can see exactly how the fog looks and whether it&#39;ll work for the image you want to capture.</p><h2 data-section id="bring-a-tripod-and-a-remote-release"> 2. Bring a tripod and a remote release</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255239" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-104.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="13 Fog Photography Tips for Magical Images" class="wp-image-255239" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-104.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-104.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-104.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-104.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-104.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-104.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Since fog often occurs at sunrise <em>and</em> because fog tends to heavily diffuse the ambient light, you should definitely expect darker conditions. The darker the scene, the lower you&#39;ll need to drop your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> – so to prevent camera shake, make sure you carry both a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-tripods-for-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="tripod (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">tripod</a> and a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/8-benefits-using-wireless-remote-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="remote release (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">remote release</a> .</p><p> The tripod will keep your camera steady at shutter speeds of 1/60s and below. (It also comes in handy if you plan to capture long-exposure fog shots, which I highly recommend; see the tips presented elsewhere in this article!) And the remote release will prevent camera shake when you press the shutter button. (It isn&#39;t a requirement – you can use your camera&#39;s <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/remote-shutter-vs-delayed-shutter/" target="_blank" aria-label="two-second self-timer (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">two-second self-timer</a> instead – but a remote release can make your shooting process faster and more precise.)</p><p> By the way, make sure you lock up the mirror before shooting (if you&#39;re using a DSLR).

It&#39;s a natural tool for creating negative space, which in turn allows you to simplify the scene and place the focus on your subject. In other words, you can use the fog as a blank canvas to create beautiful minimalistic shots.</p><p> But how exactly does this work? In minimalism, the goal is to lean into the empty, negative space – but then include a clear main subject <em>somewhere</em> within the scene. So by surrounding your main subject with pure expanses of fog, you direct the viewer&#39;s gaze to what really matters.</p><p> Note that negative space doesn&#39;t just simplify photos; it adds a layer of emotion. By using fog to eliminate distracting details, you can evoke feelings of mystery, solitude, or even tranquillity. The emptiness around the subject adds a powerful atmosphere and as a result, the entire image benefits.</p><p> You don&#39;t have to stop at simply isolating your subject. Fog gives you a chance to experiment with abstract compositions, too. By getting in close, especially in areas with heavy fog, shapes and silhouettes can become exciting elements to play with. A lone tree branch in the fog or a building surrounded by mist can result in a minimalistic geometry that makes for beautiful abstract photos.</p><p> Bottom line: When the fog comes, try a minimalistic approach. Focus on the simple yet striking elements of your scene. Let the fog guide your eye, and create compositions that you might otherwise have overlooked.</p><h2 data-section id="get-above-the-fog"> 5. Get above the fog</h2><p> If you want to capture breathtaking foggy landscape shots, instead of working from <em>within</em> the fog, see if you can rise above it.

It can seep into your equipment and cause damage such as corrosion or mold. You might think a weather-sealed camera and lens are immune, but no weather-sealing is perfect and even the most rugged gear <em>can</em> be susceptible to fog-related damage.</p><p> So here&#39;s a simple rule to follow: When photographing fog, keep your camera in your bag until you&#39;re ready to use it. It&#39;s all about limiting exposure to moisture.</p><p> Additionally, silica gel is something you should always have in your camera bag. You can find it online or (if you ask nicely!) acquire some from local shoe stores. By placing several packets throughout the compartments of your bag, you can absorb any moisture that your gear brings into the backpack.</p><p> Pro tip: Don&#39;t forget to replace or regenerate the silica gel regularly, because it <em>can</em> get oversaturated and stop working. And by the way, keeping silica gel on hand isn&#39;t just about fog photography; it&#39;s also useful for photographing in tropical areas, in the rain, or even in the snow. Plus, its benefits can extend to other sensitive accessories like memory cards and batteries.</p><p> Finally, when you get home from a morning photographing fog, let your camera bag air out. Placing your gear in an airtight container with a few silica gel packets is also a wise choice.</p><p> And if you find yourself photographing in moist conditions regularly, consider investing in a dry cabinet. It may seem like a lot, but bad weather can genuinely damage equipment, and taking these precautions is how you can keep your gear operating smoothly for years to come.</p><h2 data-section id="dont-forget-about-the-ordinary-subjects"> 7.

So while you can capture more traditional subjects on foggy days – such as seascapes and skyscrapers – you can also take a second look at the everyday, the boring, and the cliché.</p><p> For instance, you can get great shots simply by heading to your local park and photographing trees, cattails, and fields. Or you can take a walk through your neighborhood streets and point your camera at fog-shrouded streetlights, houses, and cars.</p><p> On a related note, you can use fog to capture original images of frequently photographed locations. Everyone photographs the Golden Gate Bridge, but the Golden Gate Bridge <em>plus</em> some morning fog can lead to unique (and spectacular) shots: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/9-2.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Fog photography tips" title="9.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 data-section id="use-a-neutral-density-filter"> 8.

Put a strong ND filter over your lens, and you can drop the shutter speed to 1/10s, 1s, and even several minutes without issue – even if you&#39;re working in brighter conditions.</p><p> Why is this useful for fog photography? Well, if you can slow down your shutter speed, you can capture smooth, silky fog that looks incredible in landscape shots. Long-exposure fog appears like waves of water: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/6-1.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Fog photography tips" title="6.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Note that ND filters come in many different strengths, and you&#39;ll need to choose your filter based on the time of day and the lighting conditions. If you&#39;re shooting before the sun has crested the horizon, you&#39;ll probably need a relatively weak filter (or no filter at all). But if you&#39;re working from above the fog and the sun is bright, you may want to bring out a 10-stop or even 15-stop filter.</p><p> Pro tip: When you&#39;re working with an ND filter, make sure you set up your composition and focus carefully <em>before</em> slotting the filter onto your lens. Strong ND filters are extremely dark, so by taking such an approach, you can make sure the shot looks great while the scene is still visible in your camera viewfinder.</p><h2 data-section id="shoot-in-the-fall"> 9.

Autumn is a magical time for fog photography, and it&#39;s not just because fog is often generated by cooler temperatures. The combination of a foggy mood with the rich colors of fall leaves makes for genuinely breathtaking shots.</p><p> In addition to the colors, autumn offers unique subjects that pair well with the fog ambiance. Falling leaves, harvest themes, withering plants, and Halloween vibes all go great with fog, due to the sense of nostalgia, the emphasis on endings, and even the spookiness.</p><p> So when fall rolls around, make sure you take advantage of any foggy days! To get started, try photographing in forests when fall colors are at their peak and see how the combination of gray fog and colorful leaves creates visually striking images.</p><p> Additionally, think about the specific details that come alive in the fall. Dew-kissed spider webs, mist-covered fields, and solitary structures all take on a unique beauty in the fog. Allow the combination of fog and fall to guide your creative eye, and capture some wonderful – and wonderfully moody! – images.</p><h2 data-section id="try-a-mix-of-wide-angle-and-telephoto-fog-compositions"> 10. Try a mix of wide-angle and telephoto fog compositions</h2><p> Wide-angle lenses are most photographers&#39; go-to for fog shots, and understandably so: the sweeping views you can achieve with these lenses are often instantly arresting to the viewer. In other words, a wide-angle perspective can capture the grandeur of a fog-covered landscape in a way that&#39;s both breathtaking and immersive.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255243" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-108.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="13 Fog Photography Tips for Magical Images" class="wp-image-255243" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-108.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-108.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-108.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-108.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-108.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-108.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> But don&#39;t let your fog photography start and end with wide-angle compositions. Telephoto lenses may not be the most obvious choice to capture a foggy forest, but trust me when I say that they offer a wonderful perspective.</p><p> In particular, telephoto focal lengths – in the 70-200mm range – are perfect for more intimate fog images. Try focusing on specific details like a lone tree standing in a foggy field or the delicate dew on a spider web. At 200mm, you can isolate the subjects among the fog and create a powerful composition that draws the viewer in.</p><p> You can also capture photos of distant landscapes using a 70-200mm lens. These longer focal lengths can compress space, making the fog appear denser and giving your landscape shots an enhanced level of moodiness:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255244" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:55.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="833" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-105.jpg?resize=1500%2C833&#038;ssl=1" alt="13 Fog Photography Tips for Magical Images" class="wp-image-255244" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-105.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-105.jpg?resize=300%2C167&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-105.jpg?resize=600%2C333&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-105.jpg?resize=768%2C426&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-105.jpg?resize=160%2C88&amp;ssl=1 160w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-105.jpg?resize=717%2C398&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> And, above all, don&#39;t be afraid to experiment with different focal lengths.

Because while lengthy shutter speeds can certainly create stunning ethereal effects, they can also make the fog lose its shape and turn into a flat mess.</p><p> That&#39;s why I encourage you to experiment with different shutter speeds whenever possible. If you&#39;re confronted by a foggy scene and you have the time, test out a few different settings, then view the results on your LCD.

Don&#39;t be afraid to adjust your aperture or exposure as the light changes with the fog&#39;s movements!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255247" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:51.93%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="779" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-107.jpg?resize=1500%2C779&#038;ssl=1" alt="13 Fog Photography Tips for Magical Images" class="wp-image-255247" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-107.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-107.jpg?resize=300%2C156&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-107.jpg?resize=600%2C312&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-107.jpg?resize=768%2C399&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fog-photography-107.jpg?resize=717%2C372&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Patience is a real virtue in fog photography. Keep your camera at the ready and watch as the various stages of a foggy cityscape or landscape unfold. You never know when a truly once-in-a-lifetime scene will present itself, especially at sunrise or sunset as beams of light break through the foggy environment.</p><p> Pro tip: Don&#39;t forget to check a weather app on your phone every hour or so.

The more adaptable you can be, the more you&#39;ll maximize the potential of a foggy day!</p><h2 data-section id="edit-your-fog-photos-for-the-best-results"> 13.

Get in the habit of sorting through your images after every shoot, identifying your best files, and <em>then</em> spending time editing each one.</p><p> Start by experimenting with basic adjustments like contrast, exposure, and white balance. These tweaks can keep the colors and details looking natural, and they can also help balance the emptiness of the shot with the main subject to create a more compelling composition.</p><p> Local adjustments such as dodging and burning can accentuate details in the fog. They can even be used to add depth to the fog itself, and while you&#39;ll need to build up the adjustments slowly and subtly, the results can be spectacular.</p><p> Color grading is another creative tool at your disposal. Enhance the mood of the foggy scene by playing with different color tones. The right hue can elevate the emotions and atmosphere captured in your image, so take your time to find what resonates.</p><p> And no matter what, don&#39;t shy away from trying something new. While there are standard adjustments that are frequently effective, you can never know for certain what will really level up a fog shot.</p><p> Remember, you don&#39;t need to be a Photoshop wizard to make these changes. Many beginner-friendly tools – like Lightroom and Luminar – can help you achieve professional results. The key is to practice, play around, and most of all, have fun with the process. Your fog photographs will only get better as you grow more comfortable with editing.</p><h2 data-section id="fog-photography-tips-final-words"> Fog photography tips: final words</h2><p> Fog photography is an incredible opportunity to stretch your creative muscles, and by following the simple guidelines I&#39;ve laid out, you&#39;ll find yourself producing gorgeous shots that really do communicate the mood and feel of a foggy scene.</p><p> And keep in mind that you don&#39;t need to be a professional or own the latest gear to capture great shots. All you need is your passion, a sense of adventure, and the willingness to see the world through a foggy lens.</p><p> Even if you struggle at first, don&#39;t give up.
