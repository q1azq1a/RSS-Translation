Put them in your bag, mount them on your camera, and see what you can come up with.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-235191" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/summer-photography-10.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="summer photography ideas and tips" class="wp-image-235191" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/summer-photography-10.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/summer-photography-10.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/summer-photography-10.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/summer-photography-10.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/summer-photography-10.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/summer-photography-10.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Working with different focal lengths is a great way to get out of your comfort zone, and it can help you produce highly creative images.</p><p> One tip, however: If you have a lot of unused lenses, just pick two or three and stick to those. Working with too many lenses will prevent you from really getting to know their specific focal lengths – and that will hold back your photos.</p><p> Some photographers even advocate using a single prime lens until you really get to know its field of view and how it renders the scene. I&#39;m not so stringent, myself (I enjoy the flexibility of my standard zoom lens a little too much), but I can definitely see how such an approach would be beneficial. If it&#39;s of interest you to, then by all means, give it a try! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="enjoy-some-silhouette-photography"> 9.

For me, it&#39;s the beauty of a clear blue sky – but an orange-hued silhouette is probably second. So why not take advantage of the gorgeous weather and have a <a aria-label="silhouette photoshoots (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-photograph-silhouettes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">silhouette photoshoot</a> or two?</p><p> If you&#39;ve never captured deliberate silhouette shots before, I&#39;m happy to share that it&#39;s pretty easy. The secret is to time it just right; specifically, make the most of the early mornings or late evenings when the sun is low on the horizon. Position yourself strategically, with your subject between you and the bright sky.</p><p> Also, when shooting silhouettes, make sure you expose for the background. That way, your foreground subject will turn out ultra-dark, while the sky will look wonderfully vibrant. And don&#39;t hesitate to click away, experimenting with different angles and adjusting the brightness levels until you achieve that magical balance. If you&#39;re shooting in RAW, you&#39;ll have even more flexibility in post-processing, allowing you to recover or remove details as needed.</p><p> You can start by capturing stunning silhouette portraits, but don&#39;t limit yourself. Let your creativity run wild! Try creating enchanting silhouettes of buildings, wildlife, people strolling down the streets, and more.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="explore-your-local-area">10.

In other words, summer is the best time to head outside, have fun under the sun, and appreciate the power of nature.</p><p> I think, however, that many photographers feel that, to capture amazing photos, they need to head to classic photographic locations: Yosemite National Park, the Swiss Alps, Icelandic waterfalls, etc.</p><p> But I&#39;m a firm believer that you can capture beautiful shots of pretty much anything, even your everyday surroundings. You just have to really keep those eyes open!</p><p> That&#39;s why I recommend you spend at least half an hour every day exploring the area around your house. You might start by going on a walk or a bike ride. Then see where you end up!</p><p> If you have good parks in your area, consider taking a weekend camping trip. Be sure to take plenty of photos, and dedicate some time to getting off the beaten path.</p><p> Pro tip: If you&#39;re looking for places to photograph near your house, check Flickr, 500PX, or Instagram. You can simply search for your location, then scroll through the photos until you find something interesting. (If the location isn&#39;t fully disclosed in the image caption, you can always try messaging the photographer.) </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photograph-in-bad-weather"> 11.

Instead of putting away your camera, see if you can capture something unique!</figcaption></figure></div><p> Bad weather can be a bummer for most photographers. I myself have a big problem with this: If I have a photography outing planned, I&#39;ll check the weather obsessively while wishing for clear skies.</p><p> But while I&#39;ve never managed to completely get over my frustration with bad weather, I have found that gloomy skies and intense rain come with significant advantages.</p><p> For one, bad weather causes the crowds to disperse, which means you can visit places that are normally bustling with people. It&#39;s a great way to get tourist-free shots of national-park classics, plus it can make for a more enjoyable experience. And if you like street photography, rain causes pedestrians to bring out their umbrellas, which in turn allows you to capture all sorts of interesting images!</p><p> Bad weather can also create puddles, plenty of cloud drama, powerful light, and more – so the next time you sense bad weather, see if you can brave the unpleasantness and head outside with your camera.</p><p> I&#39;ve done a lot of shooting in less-than-ideal conditions (including one memorable trip where I experienced clouds and rain for the entire week), and I do have a couple of additional items I want to mention.</p><p> First, if you&#39;re used to photographing in relatively strong light, you&#39;ll need to bear in mind that stormy skies will require very different exposure settings. If you shoot handheld, I recommend widening your aperture substantially and boosting your ISO if you can&#39;t get the shutter speed you want. Photographing with a tripod in these darker conditions can be a good idea, but watch out for heavy winds, which can shake your setup and result in camera blur (or, in <em>really</em> bad situations, blow over your entire setup).</p><p> Second, rain can damage your equipment, especially if it&#39;s not weatherproof. I like to carry a waterproof camera cover at all times, and if the forecast is looking grim, I&#39;ll be extra careful to include it in my bag.</p><p> Third, whatever you do, don&#39;t change lenses in sandy, windy, or wet conditions! You don&#39;t want to end up with debris inside your camera or lens.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shoot-the-action"> 12.

So why not have some fun capturing those thrilling events?</p><p> To achieve the best results, it&#39;s crucial to get your camera settings just right. Start by using a fast shutter speed to freeze the movement of your subjects. And shoot in <a aria-label="burst mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/burst-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">burst mode</a> ; it&#39;ll let you fire off a rapid succession of shots.</p><p> With burst mode, you&#39;ll be able to capture those split-second instances that make your heart race. But don&#39;t go crazy and spray shots indiscriminately. Time your bursts carefully to capture the perfect compositions.</p><p> Keep in mind that while modern cameras are impressive, they have limits, and your unit probably can&#39;t capture an unlimited number of photos in a single burst; therefore, it&#39;s important to make sure you don&#39;t go overboard! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="do-summer-themed-portrait-photoshoots"> 13.

Parks are another good location – or, if you don&#39;t mind working in a more chaotic environment, head into the city with your subject.</p><p> If you&#39;re focused on conveying that sense of summer, bring along a handful of props that scream summer vibes. Think sunglasses, flowers, colorful umbrellas, or even everyone&#39;s favorite treat: ice cream! These props will give your photos that extra oomph and help you capture the summer feeling.</p><p> (Imagine your model rocking a stylish pair of shades, playfully twirling an umbrella, or taking a delicious bite out of an ice cream cone…)</p><p> Of course, always be mindful of the sun and heat. Make sure that both you and your subject stay hydrated, photograph during the cooler parts of the day if you can, and if the temperatures are too extreme, try shooting inside instead. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="summer-photography-tips-and-ideas-final-words"> Summer photography tips and ideas: final words</h2><p> Now that you&#39;ve finished this article, you&#39;re ready to have plenty of summer photography fun!

The parents may or may not have one, but 9 times out of 10, the baby&#39;s parents will be able to tell you the time of day their baby tends to be at its best, calmest state.</li><li> If you&#39;re shooting the baby at home, be sure to get specifics as far as where the parents would like you to shoot. If you don&#39;t have extensive studio lighting (I personally don&#39;t!), you&#39;ll want to make sure you know which way the windows in the chosen room are facing at the time of day you&#39;ll be shooting. You want to ensure you&#39;ll have adequate light!</li><li> You should also get a sense of how the parents are feeling about clothing for the baby. I love a naked, pink, wrinkly baby booty; however, not all parents share my affinity. Be sure to discuss this before you get to a shoot! You don&#39;t want to find yourself in a situation where you ask the parents to strip the baby down, and then have to deal with awkward tension when they say “No way!” </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="consider-your-timing"> 2.

Here are three things to be aware of:</p><ul><li> <strong>First</strong> , babies can lose the adorable newborn baby curl within about 10 days of birth. If you&#39;re looking for that little rump to be up and the baby to be moldable, try to shoot within this window.</li><li> <strong>Second</strong> , coordinate with the parents beforehand to ensure you come when the baby is sleepy. The sleepier, the better!</li><li> <strong>Third</strong> , if you&#39;re planning to photograph the baby naked, make sure the infant is dressed in something easy to take off without disturbing the baby. Clothing that doesn&#39;t have to go over the head is good, though a swaddle is great, too. You need to be able to undress the baby without losing the deep slumber. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask a parent to help you move and mold the baby. With practice, you will feel more comfortable with newborns and babies, but in the beginning, advise the parents on how they can help you position the baby, then start shooting away! </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="come-up-with-a-few-simple-baby-photography-ideas"> 3. Come up with a few simple baby photography ideas</h2><p> If you are a fan of Anne Geddes or an avid baby photo lover, it&#39;s easy to set your expectations too high and overload your photo session with so many “concept” shots that you end up with a big headache and little to show for it. So keep it simple. Choose two or three poses <em>only</em> , and if you nail those, take a break and try a couple more later.</p><p> As always, I recommend doing a quick Google Image search for baby photographs to stir the creative juices. For babies, I really do think that simple is best. Unless you have a human-sized flower or clamshell lying around, don&#39;t go prop-crazy; babies are so new and perfect that they can easily stand alone as the center of your photograph. Have fun with them (and make sure the parents know they have the cutest baby on Earth!).</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="come-prepared"> 4. Come prepared</h2><p> Make sure that you have everything you need very well-organized and easily accessible. Babies are fidgety, fussy, and very impatient, and you&#39;ve got to maximize your shooting time.</p><ul><li> If you&#39;re using studio lighting, you should be set up at least 10 minutes before you&#39;re scheduled to start shooting. That will give you time to run a few test shots before the baby is brought into the room.</li><li> This next one is a given, but remember that sensors and lenses should be <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-clean-your-photography-gear-and-keep-it-in-good-shape/" target="_blank" aria-label="checked before the shoot and cleaned if necessary (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">checked before the shoot and cleaned if necessary</a> . You can&#39;t afford to stop in the middle of a newborn shoot because you notice a spot on your sensor. Babies are not as forgiving as their adult counterparts – they&#39;re like ticking time bombs! (I guarantee that any parents reading this are currently nodding in agreement!)</li><li> Get a good night&#39;s sleep! You have got to arrive with a vision of patience and with energy to spare. Remember, you&#39;re likely walking into a home where no one has gotten more than an hour of consecutive sleep for days on end. The last thing everyone needs is another exhausted, grumpy adult whose patience has run dry! As the photographer, you should set the tone. Come with a full tummy and a good night&#39;s rest. (The full tummy thing is <em>particularly</em> important for me as I tend to have low blood sugar. My patience, not to mention my creativity, goes out the window if I don&#39;t have something in my belly.)</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="heat-up-the-room"> 5. Heat up the room</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-261216" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.6%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="999" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-202.jpg?resize=1500%2C999&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to photograph babies" class="wp-image-261216" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-202.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-202.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-202.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-202.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-202.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-202.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> As a baby photographer, the shots you will generally be attempting to capture will include cute baby buns, baby feet, and baby bellies. All this clotheless shooting can quickly result in a cold, cranky baby. You might want to invest in a small space heater to get a little extra heat in the baby&#39;s direction. Be sure to turn the heat up to around 74 degrees about an hour before the shoot.</p><p> If you are shooting in a client&#39;s home, this will require prior planning. Regardless, I would suggest bringing your space heater because the baby is usually not used to hanging around in just a diaper!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="bring-some-handy-props"> 6. Bring some handy props</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-258298" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/baby-photography-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to photograph babies" class="wp-image-258298" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/baby-photography-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/baby-photography-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/baby-photography-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/baby-photography-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/baby-photography-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/baby-photography-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> As mentioned above, the baby usually provides enough aesthetic appeal for most shots. But <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/using-props-in-portraits-make-them-interesting/" target="_blank" aria-label="props (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">props</a> , when used tastefully, are wonderful. They help convey perspective, size, and fragility, and they add a hint of color that can also be nice.</p><p> But just be aware that things won&#39;t always go to plan, and prepare for your props to get peed (or pooped!) on.</p><p> In one of my sessions, we wanted to create the popular “baby on a stack of ultra-soft towels” look. The list of what I needed for this was short: clean white towels, pink ribbon, and some baby wipes.</p><p> But things happen, and when I took the baby&#39;s diaper off, a quick cleaning was in order. (It saved me from staring at baby poop particles magnified at 10x in Photoshop!)</p><p> A couple of shots into the pose, the baby decided she didn&#39;t like her bedding and peed on the top layer of towels. Fortunately, she was lying on a large stack of replacements. Although I didn&#39;t notice until the shoot was over, after Mom lifted the baby and I rotated the top two towels, I wasn&#39;t as precise in layering them back neatly.</p><p> It didn&#39;t completely ruin the shot, but remember to take your time and be delicate with the baby and the props. Babies can sense when there is stress or tension. This is not high fashion; it should mellow and beautiful!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="find-the-right-angle"> 7. Find the right angle</h2><p> In the days following birth, it can be especially difficult to capture great baby photos, as your subject tends to be kept swaddled in bunny rugs and all you end up seeing of them 99% of the time is a little head. Add to that the complication of the bumps, marks, scratches, and misshapen heads that newborns also tend to arrive with, and finding a flattering angle that will make more than just the proud parents “ooh!” and “aah!” can be difficult.</p><p> Don&#39;t give up, though! All is not lost. Here are a number of things that you might want to try to help with the above problems:</p><ul><li> <strong>Get down low.</strong> One key to many natural baby shots is to get down on their level. I&#39;ve spent quite a bit of time lying on the floor next to my own baby. It&#39;s something I think we both enjoy, but it&#39;s also a great place to use your camera. Getting down low and getting in close does present some challenges in terms of focal length, but it means you end up with shots that feel like you&#39;ve entered the baby&#39;s world rather than looking down on it from above.</li><li> <strong>Try some close-ups.</strong> Another way to improve the angles and make your shots seem more intimate is to get in close by either physically moving in or by using a longer focal length. I personally like using a longer lens for the really close shots as shoving a camera in your baby&#39;s face could freak them out a little.</li><li> <strong>Try nursed shots.</strong> Some of the best shots I&#39;ve taken of my baby have been when he is being nursed by people. This puts him into a more upright position, which makes him look a little more human-like and opens up the angles for your photos. Try a number of positions (over the shoulder, sitting them up, laying them back in arms, lying them on their tummy, etc.) as each one opens up different possibilities. Also remember that your baby is not the only potential subject; parents, grandparents, siblings, and friends can all add context to the shots, and parents will undoubtedly appreciate having more than just photos of the baby by themself! </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="create-a-shallow-depth-of-field"> 8. Create a shallow depth of field</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-261217" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-201.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to photograph babies" class="wp-image-261217" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-201.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-201.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-201.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-201.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-201.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-201.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Most images I shoot of babies are captured with very low <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="f-numbers (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">f-numbers</a> (I often photograph wide-open) to create a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-get-shallow-depth-of-field-in-your-digital-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="very shallow depth of field (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">very shallow depth of field</a> . I&#39;m not by any means saying that this is right for everyone, but it&#39;s my particular style, and I do it for many reasons:</p><ul><li> The baby will only be tiny for a very short time. With a shallow depth of field effect, I can focus on and emphasize little feet and toes, for example, before they slip away into roller skates and ballet slippers.</li><li> Shallow depth of field creates a mood of tenderness and intimacy. This is very appropriate for a shoot of this nature!</li><li> But the main reason that I shoot the majority of my infant sessions with such a shallow depth of field is that shallow DOF shots, in my humble opinion, help show how the parents&#39; world is suddenly all about that little person. Though everything else around the baby may be out of focus, the one thing that matters will be perfectly clear! </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="consider-the-outfit"> 9. Consider the outfit</h2><p> It&#39;s special for the parents to have you there to photograph their baby because it&#39;s something they can&#39;t generally do themselves. Advise them on having their baby&#39;s preferred outfit clean and ready in advance, as well as a back-up in case of accidents.</p><p> In order to feel safe and warm, babies also do well with accompanying blankets, bottles, beanies, and soft toys. Check that the items all work well together in terms of colors. If you have some clashes on the day and can&#39;t make changes while shooting, then photograph anyway and consider black and white for post-production to help strip it back a notch. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-the-right-baby-photography-settings"> 10. Use the right baby photography settings</h2><p> The ideal camera settings for photographing babies will depend on your particular situation and style, but here&#39;s some basic advice:</p><p> <strong>Aperture</strong> : Use a wide aperture, such as f/2.8, to isolate the beautiful child from the background. This will also help you capture well-exposed photos without needing to boost your ISO to an extreme value.</p><p> <strong><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="Shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Shutter speed</a></strong> : I generally like to handhold my camera when photographing babies, as it allows me to have greater mobility and flexibility. That&#39;s why I always use a minimum shutter speed of 1/125s. But if the baby is moving, I&#39;d recommend using a faster shutter speed like 1/200s and beyond.</p><p> <strong><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a></strong> : This should be chosen after you dial in your aperture and shutter speed. Basically, choose the ISO that gives you a good exposure, but go no higher! If you&#39;re using studio lighting, maintaining a low ISO should be easy, but if you&#39;re working with natural light, one easy way to keep the ISO down is to place the child near a window. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="pay-attention-to-the-light"> 11. Pay attention to the light</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-261218" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-205.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to photograph babies" class="wp-image-261218" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-205.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-205.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-205.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-205.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-205.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/baby-photography-205.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Lighting is essential to any photograph – it illuminates your subject, adds dramatic contrast or subtle texture, and creates the mood. You can use strobes or flashes to photograph the baby, but be careful not to overdo it!</p><p> Personally, I often work with natural sunlight, which I think is very flattering for human subjects, especially the warm, soft rays just after dawn and just before dusk. This gentle lighting bathes photos in a romantic glow.</p><p> Noon sunlight can add energy and drama. Dappled sunlight, filtered through the leaves of a tree, can even create a bouncy rhythm in your photos.</p><p> If sunlight is not available, a soft shaded desk lamp can also set an intimate scene. If I need to use a flash, I like to experiment with the slow flash setting.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="set-the-scene"> 12. Set the scene</h2><p> Considering your surroundings will greatly improve your shots! If you&#39;re photographing your own baby, I recommend selecting a space in advance, then clearing out the clutter and ridding yourself of visual distractions. (One of my biggest disappointments is when I capture the perfect smile, only to notice a lamp growing out of my baby&#39;s head!) Remember that most of the action with a baby will be down low, so consider that when selecting your location.</p><p> And if you&#39;re photographing a client&#39;s baby, communicate the importance of a clean environment in advance. And when you arrive, spend a couple of minutes checking out the different locations and (with the client&#39;s permission) making adjustments as needed.</p><p> Depending on the age of the baby, don&#39;t forget to think about the outdoors and its seasonal settings.

Discourage well-meaning assistants (ie, other relatives) from trying to get the baby to look at them – I&#39;ve noticed that this usually results in a vacant stare above or past the camera.</p><p> I prefer instead to make the baby&#39;s favorite sounds or ask questions about the other objects in the frame (What do flowers do? Which color is your favorite?). Babies learn fairly quickly that you are behind the camera, and with this technique, you can often get cute shots of babies laughing or those special expressions they make when you say their favorite words.</p><p> That said, the baby does not always have to be looking in the camera to make a great shot. A child&#39;s concentration as they study a new mystery or the joy that lights up a grandparent&#39;s face as they hold the baby can tell its own story.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="take-some-wider-images"> 14.

In this case, you want to tell a story about the feelings surrounding the birth of a new child: The welcome of another little person into an already established family unit. Each family unit will be different than the next, but each is special and should be documented as such.</p><p>例如：</p><ul><li> If you&#39;re shooting in a home, most likely you&#39;ll be in a nursery. Grab a shot of that! Establish the environment. It will be a treasure for the family to remember what their home was like at the time that they welcomed their little sweetheart into their heart and home.</li><li> Whether you&#39;re in a studio or on location, try to grab a shot that shows the whole family as they looked at the time of the birth. </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="edit-your-baby-images"> 15.

The reality is that many babies are not quite so “perfect” (however much their parents think they are). Little scratches, sleep in the eyes, snotty noses, dried milk around the mouth, blotchy skin, birthmarks, and bumps are common for all babies.</p><p> You might like to keep a warm, wet face washer handy to wipe away some of those things, but in some instances, they&#39;ll end up in your photos.</p><p> I don&#39;t mind them most of the time – I think they show the baby as they really look, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that. But some parents prefer images without such distractions, and even if you&#39;re photographing your own child, you might be inclined to do <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-edit-newborn-photo-using-lightroom/" target="_blank" aria-label="a bit of editing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">a bit of editing</a> on those images that you plan to print and give as gifts.</p><p> Most post-processing programs have some sort of retouching tool. Learn to use it, even if it&#39;s just to smooth over the most obvious marks, and you&#39;ll be amazed by the results!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="be-flexible"> 16.

There are so many variables when shooting a tiny human, and they can be so unpredictable.记得：</p><ul><li> Lovingly handle each hiccup. I am convinced that babies can sense our tension and frustration and that they will respond in kind. Likewise, if we can remain calm and collected, they will find it easier to relax as well.</li><li> If you have to stop, stop! If the baby is on the brink of a full-blown freakout, take a break. Let the parents cut in and calm the baby down, do some feeding, burping, change a messy diaper, whatever. Never push a baby to the point of no return. If you let a baby get to the point of a total freak out. 。 。 well, you may be plum out of luck, and with no one to blame but yourself. Be in tune with the baby and let them run the show.</li><li> If the baby is fussing just a bit, you may not be bothered by it. The parents, on the other hand, may be totally on edge. Part of your job is to be aware of that! Ask the parents if they&#39;d feel more comfortable continuing after they&#39;ve had a little snuggle break. The last thing you need is a parent worried about their cub.</li><li> Give yourself plenty of time. I have never had an infant shoot that has lasted longer than an hour or so, but I always schedule a two-hour block so there is time to feed, change, or soothe the baby between shots if necessary. </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-photograph-babies-final-words"> How to photograph babies: final words</h2><p> Now that you&#39;ve finished this article, you know how to capture plenty of outstanding baby photos – and you&#39;re ready to create some amazing shots of your own, your friend&#39;s, or your clients&#39; children!</p><p> So remember what I&#39;ve shared.

Congratulations, and welcome to the fold!</p><p> Things are nice over here in RAW land. And now that you&#39;ve firmly decided once and for all to shoot in RAW, you can stop thinking about file formats and get back to making beautiful images, right?</p><p>嗯，有点像。</p><p> Turns out there&#39;s yet <em>another</em> layer to this file-format cake, and it adds one more twist to the mix: RAW compression formats. Many cameras offer the option to shoot in either 12-bit RAW or 14-bit RAW, and you need to decide which setting to use.</p><p> “什么？！” I can hear you saying now. “What&#39;s a compression format? What&#39;s the difference between 14-bit RAW and 12-bit RAW files? And why does it matter? Can&#39;t I just shoot in RAW and be done with it?” Yes – and no.</p><p> Before I wade into the details, I want to make one thing clear: Your camera is a very capable imaging device, one that would have been the envy of every photographer in the world just a few years ago. You don&#39;t have to understand everything about <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-all-the-different-image-file-formats/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">RAW, JPEG, and other formats</a> to take great shots, and you don&#39;t have to think about file formats if you&#39;re spending time taking photos that you like.</p><p> But if you would like to know more about how all this works so you can capture the RAW files that best suit your photographic goals, then by all means, read on. You might want to sit down and grab a cup of coffee, however, because things are about to get a bit tricky! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-camera-file-formats-work"> How camera file formats work</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-96885" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="501" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-sunrise-corrected.jpg?resize=750%2C501&#038;ssl=1" alt="12-bit vs 14-bit RAW files" class="wp-image-96885" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-sunrise-corrected.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-sunrise-corrected.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-sunrise-corrected.jpg?resize=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-sunrise-corrected.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-sunrise-corrected.jpg?resize=717%2C479&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> When you take a photo with any camera (DSLR, mirrorless, point-and-shoot, or even your smartphone) a massive amount of color information is captured by the camera&#39;s image sensor. This information is immediately sent to a computer chip that analyzes it, and it&#39;s ultimately saved to your memory card as a picture.</p><p> If you shoot in JPEG, a great deal of the captured data is discarded to save storage space and facilitate easier sharing. But if you shoot in RAW, most of that color data is retained. As a result, you have much more flexibility to edit the resulting file in a program like Lightroom or Photoshop. Photographing in RAW does also result in file sizes that are quite large and not at all conducive to emailing. Plus, RAW files need to be converted to a <a aria-label="format such as JPEG or TIFF (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/jpeg-vs-tiff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">format such as JPEG or TIFF</a> before they can be displayed online. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-96902 size-post-large-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-96902" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="478" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-leaves-both.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#038;ssl=1" alt="12-bit vs 14-bit RAW files" class="wp-image-96902" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-leaves-both.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-leaves-both.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-leaves-both.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-leaves-both.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-leaves-both.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The original photo (left) was somewhat bland and flat, and shooting in RAW gave me the flexibility I needed to properly edit my original file into an image I really liked (right).</figcaption></figure></div><p> The file format used by your camera isn&#39;t set in stone. Most cameras – including virtually all interchangeable-lens models on sale today – include a file-format menu, where you can toggle between various format options. However, once an image is captured, you cannot change the file format in-camera; instead, you&#39;ll need to use file-conversion software, and your options may be limited depending on the original file format. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="common-file-formats-offered-by-cameras"> Common file formats offered by cameras</h2><p> The specific file formats available to you will depend on your camera. However, many cameras allow you to choose between file formats such as:</p><ul><li> <strong>JPEG:</strong> Every camera offers this format, which stores 256 tonal values for each color but compresses the file in such a way that a significant portion of the photo data is discarded. The JPEG format is ideal for photographers who do not do much editing in Photoshop or Lightroom, and the file sizes are much smaller than RAW, which makes them very easy to share.</li><li> <strong>12-bit RAW lossy compressed:</strong> This format stores 4,096 tonal values for each color (red, green, and blue) per pixel, but then throws away some information it deems unnecessary. With your camera set to 12-bit RAW lossy compressed, an algorithm compresses the file so it&#39;s a bit smaller and takes up less space on your memory card. Most of the discarded data is on the right (light) side of the histogram, which makes sense, since digital cameras typically capture much more information in the midtones and highlights to begin with. Thus, there is a great deal more leeway when performing a lossy compression algorithm. Since the algorithm removes some data from a part of the image where there is so much to begin with, the loss of information will not matter to most users.</li><li> <strong>12-bit RAW uncompressed:</strong> This format also stores 4,096 tonal values for each color, but it does <em>not</em> throw out any data to shrink the file size.</li><li> <strong>14-bit RAW lossy compressed:</strong> This format stores 16,384 tonal values for each color. Note that this is far more tonal values than the 12-bit RAW format is capable of storing. (Why? 12 bit means 2 to the power of 12 or 2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2, while 14 bit is 2 to the power of 14, so it&#39;s multiplied by another 2×2!) The 14-bit RAW lossy compressed format discards some data it deems gratuitous to compress the file so it&#39;s a bit smaller.</li><li> <strong>14-bit RAW uncompressed:</strong> This is the highest-quality file format most cameras offer. (Some ultra-high-end models do have 16-bit RAW files, but they usually cost a ridiculous amount.) Uncompressed 14-bit RAW files store 16,384 tonal values for each color per pixel and do not throw any data away, giving you the highest possible amount of information to work with in post-production. </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="so-should-you-use-bit-raw-or-bit-raw"> So should you use 14-bit RAW or 12-bit RAW?</h2><p> Looking at the data I shared above, the answer seems clear, right? Just shoot in 14-bit uncompressed RAW because it&#39;s obviously better! Well again, yes and no.</p><p> Due to the increase in the amount of data offered by a 14-bit file, the resulting RAW images take up much more space on your memory card and computer and are much slower to load in a program such as Lightroom or Photoshop. If you shoot with a high-megapixel camera like the <a aria-label="Canon EOS R5 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://geni.us/CanonEOSr5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Canon EOS R5</a> , you can easily get RAW files approaching 100 MB each. The extra information is great when you need it, but it can be quite a burden if you decide that all the additional data is not worth the tradeoff in storage space.</p><p> Another issue that comes into play when comparing formats is whether the increased data is useful. Does a 14-bit RAW file really give you more flexibility when <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/raw-photo-editing-in-lightroom/" target="_blank" aria-label="editing an image (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">editing an image</a> compared to a 12-bit RAW file? It should in theory, but in practice, having 16,384 tonal values for each color could be overkill for most people. If you generally get your exposure correct in-camera and you don&#39;t want to make dramatic color adjustments in post-processing, then you may not need the sheer quantity of data provided by a 14-bit uncompressed RAW-format file.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="real-life-examples"> Real-life examples</h2><p> Some camera makers have other RAW formats, such as sRAW and mRAW, that actually decrease the pixel count of your images while still giving you the flexibility of a RAW file. But, at the end of the day, one thing is clear: shooting in RAW will always give you significantly more freedom to edit your images than shooting in JPEG. The question then becomes: Which RAW format should you use?</p><p> There are benefits and drawbacks to each one, but all RAW types allow you to have an extraordinary degree of flexibility in post-production. Like almost everything in photography, there is no single correct answer to the question, and it is largely dependent on your shooting style and needs as a photographer.</p><p> To see how this plays out in a real-life scenario, here&#39;s a picture I took overlooking the Formal Gardens at Oklahoma State University: </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-96876 size-post-large-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-96876" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:66.81%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="479" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-garden-correct.jpg?resize=717%2C479&#038;ssl=1" alt="12-bit vs 14-bit RAW files" class="wp-image-96876" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-garden-correct.jpg?resize=717%2C479&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-garden-correct.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-garden-correct.jpg?resize=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-garden-correct.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-garden-correct.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> 35mm | f/4 | 1/350s | ISO 100</figcaption></figure></div><p> I re-shot the same picture using massive over- and under-exposures in four different RAW formats, then corrected them in Lightroom.

If you have to zoom in this far to see any noticeable differences between 12-bit and 14-bit RAW files that were overexposed by three whole stops to begin with, then to me it does not offer a significantly compelling reason to shoot 14-bit RAW most of the time.</p><p> To continue with the comparison, here&#39;s the same picture underexposed by three stops in-camera by increasing the shutter speed to 1/3000s: </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-96881 size-post-large-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-96881" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="478" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-garden-underexposure-compared.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#038;ssl=1" alt="12-bit vs 14-bit RAW files" class="wp-image-96881" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-garden-underexposure-compared.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-garden-underexposure-compared.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-garden-underexposure-compared.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-garden-underexposure-compared.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-garden-underexposure-compared.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Underexposed by three stops to test shadow recovery.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Since almost no data was clipped, which I could tell by looking at the histogram, adjusting the exposure by three stops in Lightroom results in an image that is virtually identical to the correct one at the top of this section.

When doing this comparison, I tried to pick something that was generally representative of a typical photographic scenario, and not a situation that was far outside the realm of what most people would encounter when taking pictures.

If your pictures regularly require the type of extreme editing that can only be saved by heavily editing a 14-bit uncompressed RAW file, I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and say there are probably other things that you need to work on to improve your photography besides choosing the right file format. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-96903 size-post-large-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-96903" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="478" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-train-crossing.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#038;ssl=1" alt="12-bit vs 14-bit RAW files" class="wp-image-96903" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-train-crossing.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-train-crossing.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-train-crossing.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-train-crossing.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/raw-formats-compared-train-crossing.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Even black-and-white photography can benefit from using the RAW format due to the additional data available in each individual pixel.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Of course, I want to reiterate that the RAW format is beneficial for far more than just fixing images that are way too bright or dark. RAW gives you significant flexibility when editing the colors of an image and allows you to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/3-tips-for-getting-great-skin-tones-using-adobe-camera-raw/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">bring out more natural skin tones</a> , display the deep rich blues hidden in a dull gray sky, find the intricate details of a flower petal that would be lost in a JPEG, and perform all sorts of other edits that have nothing to do with making a dark photo a little brighter. Any RAW format is better than none, if you&#39;re the kind of person who likes to edit your images after you take them, but if you want a nice balance between having lots of data while still keeping file sizes down, 12-bit compressed will most likely suffice just fine.</p><p>你呢？ I&#39;m curious what your experiences have been with compressed and uncompressed RAW. I&#39;d like to hear about your experiences in the comments below, especially if you have encountered times when shooting 14-bit uncompressed RAW has come in handy.

Animals tend to move around a lot, and it helps if you can track them from location to location. If your camera does a good job handling <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/reasons-why-shoot-high-iso/" target="_blank" aria-label="high-ISO levels (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">high-ISO levels</a> , that&#39;s even better.</p><p> You&#39;ll also want to bring a longer <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/primes-versus-zoom-lenses/" target="_blank" aria-label="prime or zoom lens (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">prime or zoom lens</a> . I&#39;d recommend carrying a lens that extends to at least 200-300mm (bearing in mind sensor crop factors). A kit zoom, such as a 55-200mm unit, will work well, or you can take a more expensive <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/every-photographer-needs-70-200mm-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="70-200mm f/4 or f/2.8 lens (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">70-200mm f/4 or f/2.8 lens</a> . That way, you&#39;ll be able to capture detailed shots of the animals no matter their distance.</p><p> And if you have a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lenses-for-macro-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="macro lens (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">macro lens</a> , bring it along! It can be handy in a number of enclosures (such as a butterfly house).</p><p> Pro tip: Make sure you use your lens&#39;s hood. It&#39;ll help reduce or eliminate flare if you&#39;re shooting into the sun, and it can also cut down on reflections when photographing through glass.</p><p> Finally, consider using a <a aria-label="tripod or monopod (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tripod-versus-monopod-comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">tripod or monopod</a> .

Avoid using flash</h2><p> The moment you step into the zoo with your camera, you might feel tempted to use flash.不。 Using flash in a zoo setting creates a whole host of problems.</p><p> First up, it&#39;s the animals. Many animals are sensitive to sudden bursts of light. Flash photography can cause them distress or alter their natural behavior.</p><p> Next, think about your fellow zoo-goers. The bright light from your flash can be disruptive. It can spoil the viewing experience for others who are <em>also</em> trying to enjoy the animals.</p><p> Then there&#39;s the issue of glass enclosures. A lot of zoo animals are behind glass, and flash can create harsh reflections on these surfaces.结果？ Unpleasant, amateur-looking photos that you&#39;ll likely want to delete as soon as you see them.</p><p> The good news is that you can still get quality shots without flash. The trick lies in leveraging natural light. Use it to highlight your subject and create interesting shadows.</p><p> Later on, I&#39;ll dig into how to adjust your camera settings for tricky lighting situations.

Include a key point of interest</h2><p> Most beginners, upon arriving at the zoo, start snapping away – but if you spend time really thinking about your composition, you&#39;ll get much better results. In particular, make sure to include a single clear point of interest, the thing that the viewer should focus on above all else.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-208459" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zoo-photography-tips-2-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Zoo photography tips" class="wp-image-208459" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zoo-photography-tips-2-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zoo-photography-tips-2-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zoo-photography-tips-2-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zoo-photography-tips-2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zoo-photography-tips-2-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zoo-photography-tips-2-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> So before you start photographing an animal, ask yourself: <em>What is it about this creature that interests me? What drew me to this animal? Does it have great color? Is it in a humorous pose? Does it have interesting surroundings?</em></p><p> Then use the information to help you compose the shot. Make your point of focus the centerpiece of the composition, and try to eliminate all other areas that might detract from the scene.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="get-in-close"> 4. Get in close</h2><p> The closer you can get to your subject, the more emotional, intimate, and beautiful your final photos will turn out. You&#39;ll also be able to capture more detail, which is generally a good thing!</p><p> So whenever you get the opportunity, move in close. With animals in cages, this can be a challenge, and you&#39;ll generally need to zoom with your lens rather than your feet. But do try to get as physically close to the animals as possible – without breaking any zoo rules, of course! – and use your lens&#39;s longer focal lengths to create a tight composition around the animal&#39;s body or even face.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-242871" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoo-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Zoo photography tips" class="wp-image-242871" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoo-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoo-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoo-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoo-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoo-photography-tips-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Also, take advantage of situations where you <em>can</em> get physically close to the animals.

Focus on the eyes</h2><p> This zoo photography tip is a quick one, but it&#39;s absolutely critical:</p><p> Make sure your camera consistently focuses on the subject&#39;s <em>eyes</em> .</p><p> The eyes are, as they say, the window to the soul. If the eyes are sharp, then nailing sharpness throughout the rest of the frame becomes much less important – but if the eyes are soft, then the whole image is (generally) ruined.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-208460" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zoo-photography-tips-3-1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Zoo photography tips" class="wp-image-208460" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zoo-photography-tips-3-1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zoo-photography-tips-3-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zoo-photography-tips-3-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zoo-photography-tips-3-1.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/zoo-photography-tips-3-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> So do what you can to get the eyes in focus. If your camera offers Animal Eye AF, test it out and see how well it works. Otherwise, carefully position your camera&#39;s AF point right over the animal&#39;s eyes.</p><p> That way, you&#39;ll create a far more personal connection between the subject and the viewer! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-the-lighting-to-your-advantage"> 6. Use the lighting to your advantage</h2><p> One of the most crucial elements in photography is lighting. For zoo photography, this is especially true. It&#39;s all about working with what you&#39;ve got, which is often a mix of sun and shade.</p><p> You&#39;ll get your best shots when the light is soft. Try shooting during the early morning or late afternoon. The golden hour, right after sunrise or before sunset, offers some of the most flattering light conditions.</p><p> Let&#39;s say you&#39;re an early riser. Get to the zoo as the gates open. You&#39;ll catch soft, warm light that can make your photos look dreamy. It&#39;s worth it, assuming the zoo is open at those hours, of course.</p><p> Not a morning person? Aim for late afternoon. You&#39;ll get a similar quality of light and the bonus of capturing the animals as they become more active.</p><p> But what if you&#39;re at the zoo mid-day, with harsh sunlight beating down? Try to find animals that are in shaded areas. The shade can act as a natural diffuser, softening the light and reducing harsh shadows.</p><p> Indoor exhibits offer a different kind of lighting challenge. Reptiles, amphibians, and marine species often reside in darker environments. These areas give you a chance to experiment with different settings on your camera, which we&#39;ll delve into later.</p><p> Just remember: whether you&#39;re dealing with the golden glow of morning or the diffuse light of a cloudy day, paying attention to lighting can significantly improve your zoo photography game. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="keep-your-shutter-speed-high"> 7. Keep your shutter speed high</h2><p> Animals can move quickly, leading to image blur – unless you keep your shutter speed fast enough.</p><p> I&#39;d recommend using a shutter speed of at least 1/250s when dealing with slow-moving animals, and you should boost this to 1/500s, 1/1000s, or even higher as you encounter action. (Small birds flying through the air, for instance, often require shutter speeds of 1/2000s and beyond.)</p><p> It often helps to switch to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/" target="_blank" aria-label="Shutter Priority mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Shutter Priority mode</a> , which will let you select your desired shutter speed while your camera chooses a reasonable aperture for a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="good exposure (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">good exposure</a> .

Boost your ISO in dark enclosures</h2><p> We&#39;ve all been there: you step into a dimly lit enclosure, and your heart sinks. How do you photograph this beautiful but poorly lit subject? The key lies in your camera&#39;s ISO settings.</p><p> ISO controls your camera&#39;s sensitivity to light. In well-lit conditions, you should generally keep this at a base level – usually around ISO 100. Doing so minimizes noise, which can ruin image quality.</p><p> But let&#39;s say you&#39;re in an area that&#39;s shadier. Maybe you&#39;re photographing nocturnal creatures, or perhaps the enclosure mimics an animal&#39;s natural, darker habitat. That&#39;s when you need to consider boosting your ISO. A higher setting will brighten the image.</p><p> You may be wondering, “How high should I go?” Most modern cameras can comfortably handle ISO 400 to 800. Some can even push it to ISO 1600 with minimal noise. It&#39;s about finding a balance. You don&#39;t want your photos washed out, but a bit of manageable noise is better than a blurred subject.</p><p> (Don&#39;t forget that ISO is just one part of the exposure triangle, which also includes aperture and shutter speed. When you adjust ISO, consider revisiting these other settings!)</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="get-down-low"> 9. Get down low</h2><p> The more intimacy you can include in your images, the better – and a great way to create a sense of intimacy and closeness is to get down on your subject&#39;s level.</p><p> If you&#39;re photographing a giraffe or a camel, you can shoot from a standing height, of course. But if you&#39;re capturing penguins, wolves, or small monkeys, you&#39;ll want to get down on your knees or even lie flat against the ground.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-242873" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoo-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Zoo photography tips" class="wp-image-242873" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoo-photography-tips-6.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoo-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoo-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoo-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoo-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoo-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Pay attention to the people around you – you don&#39;t want to create a traffic hazard! – but don&#39;t be afraid to look a little silly or even get dirty.

Capture animal interactions</h2><p> We all enjoy a good portrait of a lion or a perfectly timed shot of a bird spreading its wings. But there&#39;s something captivating about two or more animals in a single frame, especially when they&#39;re interacting.</p><p> A variety of interactions can fill your portfolio with engaging images. Think about a mother gorilla tenderly grooming her baby. The love and care in such moments can be extraordinarily touching, creating a photograph that tells a much richer story than a solitary animal could.</p><p> Interactive action shots have their own kind of allure. Picture two young cheetah siblings play-fighting. The resulting images from such scenes are both visually striking and packed with drama!</p><p> Anticipating animal interactions takes some practice and a whole lot of patience. You can&#39;t exactly direct your subjects like in a studio shoot. You need to be prepared, finger on the shutter button, waiting for the right moment. The more you understand about animal behavior, the better your chances of capturing these decisive moments. Often, the behavior leading up to the interaction can give you clues. Is one animal approaching another? Are there young ones involved? The more you photograph animals interacting, the better you&#39;ll get at predicting behavior!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photograph-the-people"> 13.

It&#39;ll give you the best chance of nailing a split-second moment.)</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="visit-repeatedly"> 15. Visit repeatedly</h2><p> Making a single trip to the zoo can provide a treasure trove of photographic opportunities. But if you can, don&#39;t stop at just one visit.我得到它; frequent trips can be time-consuming and costly. Zoo tickets aren&#39;t cheap, and we all have busy lives. But the investment can be so worthwhile.</p><p> Each visit gives you a new chance to photograph animals that might have eluded you the first time around. Maybe the elusive snow leopard was hiding during your last visit, but is out and about this time. Or perhaps there&#39;s a new addition to the zoo – an adorable baby panda or a majestic bald eagle. These are opportunities you don&#39;t want to miss.</p><p> Regular visits also allow you to witness and capture changes over time. The baby zebra you photographed a month ago? Now it&#39;s boldly venturing farther from its mother. Such developmental milestones offer fresh perspectives and add depth to your portfolio.</p><p> Plus, as I explained above, familiarity breeds skill. The more often you visit, the more you&#39;ll understand the patterns and behaviors of the animals you&#39;re photographing. You&#39;ll start to realize the best times to capture the tigers prowling or the penguins feeding, and you&#39;ll be able to predict when they&#39;re most likely to gift you with a perfect shot.</p><p> Some zoos offer memberships or season passes. These can be a more economical way to make repeated visits. They might also come with added perks like early entry, allowing you to take advantage of that soft morning light I mentioned earlier!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="plan-your-day"> 16. Plan your day</h2><p> I&#39;m a fairly spontaneous person, but when it comes to zoo photography, I&#39;ve learned that it&#39;s worth thinking ahead.</p><p> As soon as you arrive, make sure you grab a map and identify the animals you wish to add to your shot list. (You can also do this in advance if you want to save time.) Make note of any publicized feeding times, which can make for great action shots. And if it&#39;s an option, ask a zoo keeper when your favorite animals are more active.</p><p> Another good strategy is to head to the gift shop and take a quick look at the postcards and picture books. These can offer a little inspiration and a few handy zoo photography ideas, which are always useful to have.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="be-patient"> 17. Be patient</h2><p> When photographing at zoos, you&#39;ll occasionally stumble upon animals in the perfect pose…</p><p> …but more often than not, you&#39;ll need to spend time waiting for the money shot.</p><p> So once you pick out the animals you want to photograph, give yourself plenty of time to camp out at their enclosures. If waiting frustrates you, take a deep breath, and tell yourself that it&#39;s worth sticking around for a good image.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-242881" style="width:401px"><span class="space" style="width:401px; padding-top:149.63%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="401" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoo-photography-tips-3.jpg?resize=401%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Zoo photography tips" class="wp-image-242881" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoo-photography-tips-3.jpg?resize=401%2C600&amp;ssl=1 401w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoo-photography-tips-3.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoo-photography-tips-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1150&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoo-photography-tips-3.jpg?resize=717%2C1073&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/zoo-photography-tips-3.jpg?w=1002&amp;ssl=1 1002w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> With enough patience, you&#39;ll see the animals in a variety of positions and with different expressions.

Think about the context</h2><p> One of the best things about zoo photography is that you can get relatively close to the animals, which is obviously difficult to do in the wild.</p><p> A key challenge, however, is that the environment isn&#39;t natural. On many occasions, enclosures will include fake rocks and trees, and you&#39;ll often end up with distracting artificial elements in the backgrounds and foregrounds (eg, fences).</p><p> So whenever possible, try to adjust your angle until natural-looking elements are included, such as grass, trees, and flowers.</p><p> And whenever distractions do present themselves, try using wide apertures (such as f/2.8 or f/4) to narrow the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> and throw the foregrounds and backgrounds out of focus.</p><p> You can also try zooming in to avoid distractions – or, if that isn&#39;t an option, cropping later when editing. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="zoo-photography-tips-final-words"> Zoo photography tips: final words</h2><p> You&#39;ve now armed yourself with various techniques to elevate your zoo photography game! From utilizing natural light to zeroing in on dynamic animal interactions, these tips can make a big difference for anyone looking to photograph wildlife within a zoo setting.</p><p> Going beyond the basics allows you to connect with your subject matter more deeply. You&#39;ll find yourself not only improving as a photographer but also gaining a better understanding of the animals you photograph. Return trips to the zoo, thoughtful observation, and technical adaptability can turn a casual day out into a truly rewarding experience.</p><p> Zoo photography is an art as much as it is a science. While technical aspects like ISO settings and lighting conditions are critical, your ability to anticipate and capture fleeting moments is what will set your work apart. So, pack up your gear, head to your local zoo, and put these tips into action.你不会失望的！</p><p> <em>What animals do you plan to photograph on your next zoo visit? Which of these tips will you use?

Instead, a virtual copy is only a copy of the Develop settings, represented as a new image within the Lightroom catalog.</p><p> In other words, a Virtual Copy is a replica of the original photo, including all edits made in Lightroom.

Stack your Virtual Copies</h3><p> When you create Virtual Copies, your Lightroom interface might start to feel a little cluttered – but you can use Stacks to simplify the thumbnails displayed in Grid View. In this example, I&#39;m going to create two Stacks of my Virtual Copies: one containing color photos, and the other containing black-and-white images.</p><p> First, select the photos you want to place in the same stack. Click and drag thumbnails to rearrange them in Grid View if you need to. Here, I grouped all the color photos together:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-92873" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:62.48%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="448" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/virtual-copies-lightroom-05.jpg?resize=717%2C448&#038;ssl=1" alt="Virtual Copies in Lightroom" class="wp-image-92873" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/virtual-copies-lightroom-05.jpg?resize=717%2C448&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/virtual-copies-lightroom-05.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/virtual-copies-lightroom-05.jpg?resize=600%2C375&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/virtual-copies-lightroom-05.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Go to <strong>Photo>;Stacking>;Group into Stack</strong> .

Given that both functions are used to save different looks for an image, these can seem similar. However, in reality, these two functions are very different, particularly when it comes to exporting.</p><p> When you create different looks via Snapshots, only the “active” or selected Snapshot Develop settings will be exported to the final image. Let&#39;s illustrate with an example.</p><p> Let&#39;s say we have an image with 3 different looks created with Snapshots, and another image with 3 different looks created with Virtual Copies.</p><p> When we export the image with the three different Snapshots, Lightroom will create one exported image with the Develop settings from the active snapshot.</p><p> When we export the image with the three different Virtual Copies, Lightroom will actually create three separate exported images using the Develop settings from each Virtual Copy.</p><p> To keep it simple: Virtual Copies will create additional exported images while Snapshots will not. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="lightroom-virtual-copies-final-words"> Lightroom Virtual Copies: final words</h2><p> Now that you&#39;ve finished this article, you know all about Virtual Copies in Lightroom – what they are, how to create them, and most importantly, how to use them for the best Lightroom workflow.</p><p> My advice is to head over to Lightroom and test out the Virtual Copy function.

It&#39;s undoubtedly the best kit lens I&#39;ve ever used, and for photographers in search of a lightweight lens that takes amazing images in a variety of situations, it&#39;s a great pick.</p><p> Below, I share my review of the Fujifilm XF 18-55mm f/2.8-4, based on my experience using the lens in the field. Bear in mind that this isn&#39;t a lab-heavy, spec-focused review; instead, I explain exactly what I love so much about this lens, and I discuss shooting scenarios where it excels.

It has a nice weight in hand and fits easily in your pocket, which is convenient when you don&#39;t want to carry around a camera bag (you can put your Fujifilm 18-55mm lens in one pocket and your Fujifilm camera in the other! ）。 The compact size is ideal for on-the-go photography and casual shooting, but it&#39;s also a big benefit if you travel regularly and don&#39;t want to lug around a big, bulky setup.</p><p> When I hold my Fujifilm XF 18-55mm, I get a real sense of robustness. Out of all the kit lenses I&#39;ve used, this level of durability is only perhaps matched by the matched perhaps only by the Nikon 18-55mm. Therefore, you can use it comfortably in the great outdoors, at events where you sometimes get jostled, around rambunctious pets, and at sports games.</p><p> And if you&#39;re the type of photographer who doesn&#39;t like to baby your equipment, the impressive robustness will prevent you from needing to purchase a new kit lens a few months down the line.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="optical-performance"> Optical performance </h3><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-112484 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-112484" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fujifilm-kit-lens-xf18-55-3.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Fujifilm XF 18-55mm f/2.8-4 kit lens sample image" class="wp-image-112484" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fujifilm-kit-lens-xf18-55-3.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fujifilm-kit-lens-xf18-55-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fujifilm-kit-lens-xf18-55-3.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fujifilm-kit-lens-xf18-55-3.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fujifilm-kit-lens-xf18-55-3.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Another shot from the parade at 18.8mm.

It&#39;s so good that people might not be inclined to get the more “serious” <a href="https://geni.us/FujifilmXF16-55mmf2-8" target="_blank" aria-label="Fujifilm XF 16-55mm f/2.8 R LM WR (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Fujifilm XF 16-55mm f/2.8 R LM WR</a> , which costs around double the 18-55mm kit lens.</p><p> (Comparing the two lenses, the extra 2mm at the wide end and the fixed maximum f/2.8 aperture are definitely appealing, but with the 18-55mm being so good, I&#39;ve easily resisted the temptation to make that purchase. I probably will go for it in the future, but I&#39;ll keep the kit lens and carry it with me in my travel photography bag.)</p><p> I&#39;ll also note that I&#39;ve observed no distortion when using the XF 18-55mm f/2.8-4. In other words, the optics are very solid, and you don&#39;t have to worry about capturing amateurish-looking pictures like you might with a lower-quality kit lens. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="maximum-aperture-and-image-stabilization"> Maximum aperture and image stabilization </h3><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-112486 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-112486" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fujifilm-kit-lens-xf18-55-5.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Fujifilm XF 18-55mm f/2.8-4 kit lens sample image" class="wp-image-112486" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fujifilm-kit-lens-xf18-55-5.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fujifilm-kit-lens-xf18-55-5.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fujifilm-kit-lens-xf18-55-5.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fujifilm-kit-lens-xf18-55-5.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fujifilm-kit-lens-xf18-55-5.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> An environmental business portrait for a local magazine shot at 18mm.</figcaption></figure></div><p> As I mentioned above, finding a kit lens with an f/2.8-4 maximum aperture is fantastic. Most kit lenses can&#39;t open the aperture very wide, which makes it difficult to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/low-light-photography-shoot-without-tripod/" target="_blank" aria-label="shoot in low light (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shoot in low light</a> (eg, in your home, at night, in the shade, etc.). But when shooting the XF 18-55mm f/2.8-4 at 18mm, you get a maximum f/2.8 aperture. This offers the flexibility needed to capture sharp, high-quality images in tough lighting conditions.</p><p> The wider maximum aperture comes with a second benefit: you can create <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-get-shallow-depth-of-field-in-your-digital-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="shallow depth-of-field photos (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shallow depth-of-field photos</a> with a very nice background blur. It&#39;s something that very few kit lenses provide, and it allows you to capture portraits with a refined, professional look. (To see what I mean, check out the sample images below!)</p><p> There&#39;s one other feature that&#39;s certainly worth a mention: the optical image stabilization. This counteracts camera shake and allows you to capture handheld photos at slow shutter speeds, which can be helpful in low light or when shooting with a narrow aperture. Most of Fujifilm&#39;s cameras don&#39;t include in-body image stabilization, so the value of this technology shouldn&#39;t be overlooked. The OIS is pretty good, too; I&#39;ve found that it gives me about four stops more than the 1/focal length rule (ie, <a aria-label="the reciprocal rule (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/back-to-basics-what-is-the-reciprocal-rule-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">the reciprocal rule</a> ) you&#39;ve probably heard about. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-fujifilm-xf-mm-lens-in-use"> The Fujifilm XF 18-55mm lens in use</h2><p> The 18-55mm focal-length range (27-84mm in 35mm terms) is the perfect zoom for anyone getting their first camera. It covers wide-angle focal lengths for landscapes and scenic shots, but it still has enough reach on the long end to make a great portrait. (You get nearly 85mm when zoomed in completely, which is a hugely popular focal length for portraiture.) And shooting portraits at f/4 will get you some very nice <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" aria-label="background bokeh effects (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">background bokeh effects</a> ; you just have to make sure there&#39;s a decent amount of separation between the subject and the background.</p><p> How you set the aperture on the XF 18-55mm is different from most other lenses. Using a fly-by-wire system, you change the aperture using a ring on the lens. But because of the variable aperture, there are no markings on the lens (unlike most other lenses from Fujifilm). It means you are dependent on the screen or <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/optical-versus-electronic-viewfinders-best/" target="_blank" aria-label="electronic viewfinder (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">electronic viewfinder</a> to see what the aperture is set to. When you half-press to focus, the aperture opens up, focuses the shot, then goes to the set aperture. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-112485 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-112485" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fujifilm-kit-lens-xf18-55-4.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Fujifilm XF 18-55mm f/2.8-4 kit lens sample image" class="wp-image-112485" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fujifilm-kit-lens-xf18-55-4.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fujifilm-kit-lens-xf18-55-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fujifilm-kit-lens-xf18-55-4.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fujifilm-kit-lens-xf18-55-4.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fujifilm-kit-lens-xf18-55-4.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> While this may look like a wide shot, it&#39;s actually shot at 55mm from further back to help compress the scene.
