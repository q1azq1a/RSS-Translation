target="_blank" aria-label="choose your camera carefully (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">仔细选择相机</a>。</p><p>首先，确保您拥有数码单反相机或无反光镜型号。与固定镜头傻瓜相机相比，这些相机具有很大的优势；其一，您可以使用各种镜头来捕捉各种视角和外观。无论您选择全画幅、APS-C 还是微型三分之四相机，都取决于您的兴趣程度、预算和便携性要求。</p><p>一般来说，全画幅相机将提供最佳的图像质量，特别是如果您想在弱光下拍摄（例如，在黎明和黄昏时拍摄空灵的蓝色小时照片）。但 APS-C 相机也拥有专业的效果，微型三分之四型号的功能非常强大（而且非常紧凑）。无论您如何选择，请确保选择一款握在手中感觉舒适的相机。没有什么比尝试连续几个小时使用不舒服的相机更令人讨厌的了！</p><p>另一项需要寻找的功能是眼球追踪自动对焦。即使您在快节奏或动作场景中拍摄，它也会锁定拍摄对象的眼睛，让您的照片看起来清晰锐利。不，这不是必需的——几个世纪以来肖像摄影师一直在没有眼部自动对焦的情况下工作——但它肯定会让你的工作变得更轻松。</p><h3

data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>焦距和镜头的选择可能看起来并不重要，但它们对您的照片的影响是<em>巨大的</em>。您会看到，不同的焦距要求您离拍摄对象更近或更远，距离越近，透视失真就越大。如果不加以控制，透视变形往往会导致身体比例不讨人喜欢——如果你不小心，你最终会遇到一群不满意的客户。 （毕竟，你最不想听到客户说的是，“为什么我的头看起来肿了？”）</p><p>这就是为什么我鼓励您避免使用更宽的焦距，例如 28 毫米、35 毫米，甚至 45 毫米。相反，选择 50 毫米至 85 毫米范围内的镜头，这样您可以拍摄更紧凑的图像<em>，而不会出现</em>失真问题。</p><p>请注意，您不需要出去购买专用的人像镜头；几乎每个套装镜头都涵盖其中<em>一些</em>焦距，因此即使您只拥有相机附带的镜头，也没有问题。</p><p>也就是说，如果您想真正提升户外人像潜力，值得考虑使用 50 毫米或 85 毫米定焦镜头，尤其是当它们提供较宽的最大光圈（例如 f/2.8、f/1.8 或 f/1.4）时。较长的镜头自然会提供更好的背景模糊效果，但最大光圈越宽，您就越能利用这种效果来获得专业的效果。</p><p>虽然具体的<a aria-label="portrait lens recommendations (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lens-for-portrait-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">人像镜头建议</a>超出了本文的范围，但请记住，50 毫米镜头往往更适合全身拍摄，而 85 毫米镜头将帮助您捕捉更紧密的图像（例如，爆头照片）。如果您喜欢拍摄特写镜头，也可以选择 70-200mm f/2.8 镜头；虽然它们并不便宜，但结果却很出色。</p><h3 data-section id="consider-a-few-useful-accessories">考虑一些有用的配件</h3><p>只需使用相机和镜头即可拍摄出色的肖像。但与摄影中的许多事情一样，有时正是小事情造成了一切不同。一些精选的配件可以提升您的肖像标准，增强图像的质量和创造力。</p><p>例如，如果您在强光下拍摄，您可能会发现自己无法以所需的光圈进行拍摄，而这正是中性密度 (ND) 滤镜的价值所在。 ND 滤镜就像镜头的太阳镜，在极其明亮的条件下，它可以帮助您利用更大的光圈，并获得美丽的散景背景，而不会过度曝光您的照片。</p><p>但光不仅仅与强度有关，还与强度有关。它还涉及方向和质量，而这就是手持式反光镜可以成为您最好的朋友的地方。无论您是要与拍摄对象鼻子下的深阴影作斗争，还是尝试为背光拍摄对象添加一些细节，反光板都可以帮助您完美地平衡光线。考虑投资五合一套餐；这些反射器套件通常具有多种反射器颜色，例如用于冷色调的银色或用于暖色调的金色，并且通常包括扩散板。</p><p>最后，虽然许多摄影师都坚信自然光（并且有充分的理由），但在您的武器库中拥有热靴闪光灯并没有什么坏处。即使您主要是自然光拍摄者，了解闪光灯的基础知识也可以改变游戏规则。当安装在灯架上时，热靴闪光灯可以填充阴影，平衡不均匀的光线，并为您的肖像增添一些额外的活力。</p><h2 data-section id="essential-outdoor-portrait-photography-settings">户外人像摄影的基本设置</h2><p>户外人像摄影是动态的、不可预测的。太阳不会等待，转瞬即逝的表情也不会等待。这就是为什么拨入正确的设置可以发挥重要作用。虽然许多因素会影响您的选择，但我发现一些设置始终能产生出色的结果：</p><h3 data-section

noopener" class="ek-link">RAW 文件格式</a>是曝光期间传感器数据的未经修改的汇编。这是您的数码负片。它为您提供了巨大的后处理灵活性，更不用说提高了图像质量。</p><p>另一方面，当您以 JPEG 格式拍摄时，您捕获的大部分内容都会被删除。您会丢失许多关键信息，包括颜色细微差别和色调范围。<em>这是灾难的根源</em>。</p><p>例如，RAW 文件可让您恢复剪切的高光和阴影，这在拍摄对比鲜明的户外场景时可能很重要。如果您想要对照片进行大量颜色修改（例如，您想要进行艺术色彩分级），RAW 文件也是必不可少的。但 JPEG 不允许恢复太多细节，并且 JPEG 将严重限制照片的颜色分级潜力。</p><p>所以坚持使用 RAW 文件。是的，它们更大并且需要处理。但除非您是一名截止日期非常紧迫的摄影记者，否则额外的努力是值得的。</p><p> （如果您喜欢 JPEG 的可共享性，并且无法在没有它的情况下进行拍摄，那么请考虑使用相机的 RAW+JPEG 模式，该模式在拍摄时<em>同时</em>保存 RAW 文件和 JPEG 文件。）</p><h3 data-section id="use-aperture-priority-or-manual-mode">使用光圈优先或手动模式</h3><div

ISO，并且您的相机会根据情况智能选择快门速度可用的光线。换句话说，您<em>和</em>您的相机共同努力才能获得良好的效果。</p><p>当在变化的光照条件下工作时，例如当云层交替遮挡和露出太阳时，此模式也很有用；光圈优先为您控制快门速度，让您能够专注于构图并与拍摄对象建立联系。</p><p>也就是说，对于那些希望完全控制曝光、景深和图像质量的人来说，手动模式就是答案。在手动模式下，您可以根据自己的喜好<em>直接</em>调整光圈、快门速度和 ISO。此模式特别适合光线稳定的情况，并可确保多次拍摄的一致性。</p><p>但请注意，如果您担心进入手动模式，也没关系。您始终可以从光圈优先开始，并在获得信心后切换到手动。永远记住，这<em>两种</em>模式都有各自的优点。许多专业人士根据情况来回切换。</p><h3 data-section

秒的快门速度开始。这应该足以冻结任何微小的动作，例如头发的轻微摇摆或衣服的轻微飘动。</p><p>然而，如果您正在尝试拍摄更动态的镜头——也许捕捉运动中的模型或奔跑的孩子——建议将快门速度提高一个档次。目标是大约 1/500 秒甚至更快，以确保全面清晰。</p><p>最后，如果光线有限，您可能会想大幅降低快门速度。虽然将其降至 1/100 左右即可，但请谨慎行事。在低速快门下，即使拍摄对象发生最轻微的移动，也可能会导致不必要的模糊，从而使原本迷人的肖像变成错失的机会。</p><h3 data-section id="use-a-low-iso-for-the-best-image-quality">使用低 ISO 以获得最佳图像质量</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure

100。这可以确保您获得最清晰、最干净的图像质量。</p><p>不过，必要时不要太害怕增加 ISO。如果您发现自己在树冠下或太阳落到地平线以下时拍摄，将 ISO 调至 400、800 甚至 1600 仍然可以产生很好的效果。现代相机在这些级别上可以很好地处理噪点，因此虽然从低 ISO 开始是理想的选择，但请毫不犹豫地根据情况需要进行调整。另外，稍微有颗粒感的图像总是比模糊的图像好！</p><h3

in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/introduction-to-white-balance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">白平衡</a>。通常，它是某种吸管器，您可以使用它来单击图像中您认为是<em>中性灰色的</em>部分。</p><p>现在，想象一下这样一个世界：您的照片拍摄涉及 4 个地点，总共 800 张图像，并且您的相机整天都设置为自动白平衡。您最终可能会得到 800 个不同的白平衡值，这是后期制作的噩梦。</p><p>但如果在每个地点，您都让拍摄对象在第一次拍摄时握住灰卡，您将节省数小时的工作时间。当您在最喜欢的后期制作应用程序中打开图像时，您所要做的就是单击灰卡上的吸管，选择该位置的所有照片，然后同步编辑。宝贵的时间将被节省。</p><p>顺便说一句，明智的做法是每 30 分钟左右拍摄一次灰卡，以补偿白天光线的变化，如果您在晚上或清晨工作，您可能需要添加这一点灰卡更加频繁。</p><p>注意：如果您忘记使用灰卡，或者您没有足够频繁地进行灰卡拍摄，这也不是世界末日。您仍然可以在后期处理中修复任何白平衡问题；只是需要更长的时间。</p><h3 data-section id="shoot-when-the-light-is-soft">

Seek out areas of contrast to focus</h2><p> Camera AF systems often struggle to get clouds in focus. On overcast days, for instance, skies tend to be very flat and low contrast; this is an absolute nightmare, and your camera&#39;s autofocus system will spend long seconds hunting for perfect focus (and often failing to find it).</p><p> So what do you do? You have a few options.</p><p> First, as I mentioned above, the real difficulty with autofocusing in cloud photography is <em>contrast</em> . If you don&#39;t have contrast, your AF system won&#39;t know what to do, which will lead to lots of frustration and out-of-focus photos.</p><p> So set your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/choosing-a-focus-mode/" target="_blank" aria-label="AF mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">AF mode</a> to AF-S (also known as One-Shot AF); this tells your AF system to find focus and then lock it. And set your AF area mode to its single-point option. You want to be able to carefully target areas of contrast.</p><p> Next, take a long look at the sky and see if you can identify any clear contrast. Carefully position your single AF point over the high-contrast edge, then half-press the shutter button to lock focus.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-208525" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cloud-photography-1001.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="cloud photography tips" class="wp-image-208525" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cloud-photography-1001.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cloud-photography-1001.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cloud-photography-1001.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cloud-photography-1001.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cloud-photography-1001.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Finally – while keeping the focus locked! – adjust your composition until you get the result you want.

Look for powerful compositions</h2><p> If you want to capture the best cloud photography, you can&#39;t just notice an interesting cloud, fire off a shot or two, then call it a day.

In particular, ask yourself:</p><ul><li> What is it about this cloud scene that I find interesting?

In cloud photography, less is often more – so instead of filling the frame with complex elements, focus on simplicity.</p><p> A few clouds set against a vast sky can be incredibly impactful. You&#39;re not just capturing the clouds; you&#39;re capturing a balance of clouds and negative space, which helps emphasize the subject while giving the viewer&#39;s eye a place to rest.</p><p> Note that minimalist cloud photography can evoke a sense of calm, grandeur, or even isolation. So next time you&#39;re out with your camera, see if you can capture just one or two clouds in a sky full of emptiness.</p><p> Pro tip: Tinker with your composition to see how positioning the clouds in different areas changes the feeling of the images. A slight reframe can turn a good photo into an unforgettable one!</p><h2 data-section id="think-about-geometry"> 6.

While this is a fun exercise, I&#39;d actually recommend you take your cloud photography in the other direction. That is, instead of thinking about <em>objects</em> in the clouds, think about <em>shapes</em> ; that is, try to view them as lines, circles, or even swirls.</p><p> This geometric approach can elevate your photography from mere representation to a form of visual poetry. With practice, you&#39;ll find yourself arranging the geometric shapes in ways that are not only visually pleasing but also emotionally resonant.</p><p> And if you&#39;re not sure how to arrange shapes within a frame, that&#39;s okay! Start by using the compositional techniques I described above – utilize the rule of thirds to make the geometries pop, work with negative space to make certain shapes stand out, and so on. Imagine you&#39;re an abstract painter and the sky is your canvas. Whether you&#39;re creating tension or harmony, your photograph will elicit more than just a cursory glance.

These beams, often referred to as crepuscular rays, are created when light filters through gaps in the clouds and hits dust and other particles on its way through the atmosphere. The visual result? Shafts of sunlight that pierce the sky, providing a dramatic effect.</p><p> It&#39;s not just about randomly stumbling upon these light beams, though. You should actively seek them out. Sunrise and sunset are the best times to find crepuscular rays, plus the light during the golden hours really makes the beams pop. The sky often has a range of colors during these times, which further enhances the effect.</p><p> Note that cloud cover plays a huge role here. If the sky is too clear, there won&#39;t be any gaps to produce the beams. On the other hand, if it&#39;s completely overcast, the light can&#39;t break through. Aim for a sky that&#39;s mostly cloudy but not fully covered. You want those little gaps!</p><p> And when you do spot a light beam, be sure to act quickly. The rays last for fleeting moments, and you often have only a few minutes – or even seconds – to capture that perfect shot before the clouds move and the beam disappears. Ready your camera settings in advance so that you&#39;re not fumbling around when an opportunity appears.</p><h2 data-section id="photograph-before-and-after-storms"> 9.

(Maybe you&#39;ll even get to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-photograph-a-rainbow/" target="_blank" aria-label="photograph a stunning rainbow (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">photograph a stunning rainbow</a> !)</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-243468" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:56.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="844" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cloud-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C844&#038;ssl=1" alt="cloud photography tips" class="wp-image-243468" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cloud-photography-tips-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cloud-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cloud-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cloud-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cloud-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=717%2C403&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> You can even try shooting during the storm, but make sure you stay safe at all times, and also take steps to protect your camera equipment. If you want to capture storm clouds in peak action, consider shooting through the window of your house; that way, you get plenty of photo opportunities, but you don&#39;t have to worry about lightning or rain.</p><h2 data-section id="try-a-long-exposure-technique"> 10.

(Bear in mind that clouds will move, so once you&#39;ve chosen a composition, you&#39;ll need to work quickly.)</p><p> Switch your camera to Manual mode. Then dial in a longer shutter speed to capture the cloud movement. Next, set your camera&#39;s lowest ISO; finally, pick your aperture based on exposure considerations. (In other words, choose the aperture value so that you can capture a bright – but not too bright! – image.) Then use a remote release to trigger the shutter.</p><p> What shutter speed is ideal? That depends on the speed of the clouds and your focal length, so you&#39;ll need to do some experimentation. However, 20 seconds is a good starting point; I encourage you to take a few shots, check the results on your camera LCD, then adjust the shutter speed accordingly. Eventually, you&#39;ll hit on a speed that works, and you&#39;ll end up with some amazing fine-art cloud photos!</p><h2 data-section id="dont-be-afraid-to-include-foreground-subjects"> 11.

That said, it&#39;s okay to sometimes include other elements. By including a foreground subject, you can make your cloud photography not just about the sky but also about its relationship with the earth, and you can also elevate your compositions.</p><p> For instance, a solitary bird flying through the sky can add depth to a shot. It gives the audience an anchor point, a place to rest their eyes before they wander back to the clouds. So if you spot a bird soaring through the sky, don&#39;t hesitate. Capture the moment!</p><p> Objects on the ground can also add flair to your cloud images. Think tree branches or flowers waving in the wind. They make the clouds look grander and more expansive, though caution is key. You&#39;re still aiming to capture the beauty of the clouds, so make sure the foreground elements don&#39;t dominate the frame. It&#39;s all about balance!</p><h2 data-section id="post-process-your-cloud-photography"> 12.

Understanding what you&#39;re capturing elevates it from a visual experience to a more in-depth one.</p><p> You don&#39;t need a degree in meteorology to appreciate the difference between cloud formations, and you don&#39;t need to read dozens of textbooks, either.

Cloud formations can indicate specific weather patterns, but they can also dramatically change the mood of your photos.</p><p> So get curious. Learn the basics. I guarantee that the more you know about clouds, the more you&#39;ll want to spend time photographing. Plus, once you get the hang of identifying different types of clouds, you can start to predict the kinds of clouds that will appear in advance, which can certainly come in handy!</p><h2 data-section id="cloud-photography-tips-final-words"> Cloud photography tips: final words</h2><p> I love photographing clouds – and I&#39;m guessing you do, too!

You can also do some Googling for a list of wildlife in the area, and do some <em>more</em> Googling to learn about the peculiarities of different wildlife subjects.</p><p> Also, pro tip: Check to see what <em>other</em> photos have been taken at your destination. Here, Instagram and Google Places are incredibly helpful. Use other photographers&#39; images to find inspiration and to determine specific subjects and areas to focus on.</p><p> Of course, you can never be totally prepared for a nature photoshoot, and that&#39;s okay. The preparation process isn&#39;t about choreographing your excursion down to the individual photo; instead, it&#39;s about determining what to expect in <em>broad</em> terms and optimizing your time spent in the field.</p><h2 id="2-pack-the-right-nature-photography-gear"> 2. Pack the right nature photography gear</h2><p> While professional nature photographers do tend to load up on gear, you don&#39;t need the best cameras and lenses to capture stunning shots.</p><p> Instead, you can create beautiful images with a basic camera and a lens or two, as long as you&#39;re willing to apply plenty of patience and perseverance.</p><p> At the same time, before heading out, you should choose your equipment <em>carefully</em> ; that way, you maximize your chances of success.</p><p> Have you done your research (see the previous tip)? Then you should know what subjects to expect. So if your goal is to capture wildlife close-ups, be sure to pack your best zoom lens so you can capture full-body and even headshots of birds and animals. I recommend at least a 300mm lens when shooting large animals, and a 400mm or 500mm lens is essential if you&#39;re shooting skittish critters and small birds.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-230988" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nature-photography-tips-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="camera bag ready to go" class="wp-image-230988" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nature-photography-tips-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nature-photography-tips-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nature-photography-tips-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nature-photography-tips-1.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nature-photography-tips-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nature-photography-tips-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If your goal is to capture landscapes, pack your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/7-ways-to-get-more-out-of-a-wide-angle-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="widest lens (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">widest lens</a> . A wide zoom, such as a 16-35mm lens, will be highly effective, though you can also get away with a 24-70mm lens or even a 24mm prime.</p><p> Finally, if you hope to capture tighter scenes of flowers, tree details, ice on the water, and so on, then bring a <a aria-label="macro lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lenses-for-macro-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">macro lens</a> for a stunning close-up perspective.</p><p> As for cameras, any interchangeable lens model will work, though if you plan to photograph moving subjects, such as birds in flight, then the faster the autofocus system, the better. Higher-resolution sensors can also come in handy if you need to crop or create large prints, and durable, weather-sealed bodies are ideal for photographing in bad weather.</p><p> Whatever you do, though, don&#39;t overpack. If you take too much gear, you&#39;ll feel weighed down and you&#39;ll struggle to find the motivation to keep shooting. Instead, while it may be difficult, it&#39;s better to take too little gear than too much.</p><h2 id="3-be-sure-to-take-a-good-bag"> 3.

But while such gear does matter, it&#39;s important to remember the little things – for instance, a good bag.</p><p> Because all the gear in the world isn&#39;t worth much unless you can comfortably carry it with you.</p><p> There are many bags out there that are too small, are highly uncomfortable, and are liable to break after a bit of stress.<em> </em>Bags range greatly in price and quality, but in my experience, you get what you pay for.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-230989" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nature-photography-tips-8.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="camera bag with tripod" class="wp-image-230989" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nature-photography-tips-8.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nature-photography-tips-8.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nature-photography-tips-8.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nature-photography-tips-8.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nature-photography-tips-8.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/nature-photography-tips-8.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> So don&#39;t skimp! Consider the largest set of gear you&#39;d ever want to take on an outing and be sure that it all fits inside the new bag. In particular, make sure the bag is spacious enough to handle your biggest lenses.</p><p> And for added peace of mind, grab a bag that is weatherproof or at least water-resistant.</p><p> Here&#39;s my go-to lightweight bag for nature photography. It has a rain cover that I use when things start to get dicey, as you can see in the image on the right: </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/camerabag.jpg?ssl=1" alt="personal camera bag with rain cover" title="camerabag.JPG" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> These days, most photographers shop for bags online, and that&#39;s okay – but if you <em>do</em> go with an online order, be sure to read plenty of reviews. Alternatively, if you have a camera store nearby, go in and try on the various options. Ask the staff what they recommend for nature photographers.</p><p> And remember: Don&#39;t forget about comfort. Sure, a bag might not feel <em>that</em> bad after a few minutes on your back, but after a day of shooting while carrying an uncomfortable bag, you&#39;ll wish you had paid extra for a better option.</p><p> And speaking of comfort:</p><h2 id="4-don-t-forget-about-the-little-comfort-items"> 4.

In fact, I&#39;d go so far as to say that a <em>good pair of boots</em> is one of the most important pieces of nature photography gear that you&#39;ll <em>ever</em> encounter. Grit, dirt, mud, water, insects, rocks, and creepy crawlies; you need a pair of shoes or boots that can handle all of these and more.</p><p> I also recommend you research temperatures and pack the right clothing. (When in doubt, dress in layers; that way, you can always remove outerwear if you feel too hot.)</p><p> And bring plenty of water and snacks. If you&#39;ll be shooting all day, then it&#39;s essential to keep your energy up and your body hydrated.</p><h2 id="5-prepare-a-checklist"> 5.

You don&#39;t want to reach your prime photography location only to find that you forgot something crucial!</p><p> So ask yourself the following questions:</p><ul><li> <strong>Are any special permits or permissions required?</strong> Some national parks, state parks, and wildlife sanctuaries require special permits for access to certain areas, especially backcountry environments.</li><li><strong>我将把车停在哪里？</strong> This is very important. If you park your vehicle in an unauthorized area, then you will be stuck with a sizeable fine – believe me. (Or worse, you&#39;ll return to find your vehicle has been towed.)</li><li> <strong>Are there time restraints of any kind?</strong> Most natural areas and parks have hours of operation just like a business. You might arrive expecting to shoot a great sunrise, only to find that the location you chose isn&#39;t accessible until after daybreak. Also remember that wild creatures and critters are usually most active in the early morning and late evening, so pick a location that lets you make the most of your time.</li><li> <strong>What are the expected weather conditions?</strong> This one is a biggie. Check the forecast on your day of departure and keep tabs on it throughout the day, if possible. Never risk endangering yourself or your equipment by venturing out unprepared for bad weather. (Even if the weather is supposed to be nice and sunny, I do recommend you bring a rain cover for your camera and backpack. Better safe than sorry, right?)</li><li> <strong>What are the times for sunrise and sunset?</strong> Again, be sure the places you want to capture a sunrise or sunset are accessible. You also need to be aware of the sunrise-sunset schedule so that you allow enough time to reach your location and set up your gear before the magic happens.</li><li> <strong>Are there any commonly photographed animals, landmarks, or structures?</strong> I mentioned this one in a previous tip, but it&#39;s worth repeating. Research what is usually photographed around the area you plan to visit. Find a park ranger or staff member and ask about lesser-known spots. If you can discover what&#39;s popular and what has been done before, you can avoid shooting scenes the same old way. Consider how you can be creative!</li></ul><h2 data-section id="shoot-in-the-right-nature-photography-lighting"> 6.

In my experience, good light can be the difference between a failed photoshoot and a successful one – plus, if you learn to use the light to your advantage, your images will <em>really</em> stand out.</p><p> So what type of light is best?

But no matter the light situation, it&#39;s still important that you pay attention to the type of light you&#39;re working with and plan accordingly!</p><h2 id="6-shoot-in-raw"> 7.

Keep your ISO at your camera&#39;s base value to start with.

You should also spend time processing the files in your editing program of choice (such as Lightroom, Photoshop, Capture One, or ON1 Photo RAW).</p><p> Every RAW file needs a bit of processing; otherwise, it won&#39;t match what your eyes saw in the field. I&#39;d recommend doing some white balancing – to neutralize any color casts – and applying a bit of contrast and saturation, too. You might also add a vignette to draw attention to your subject and adjust the exposure and tones until you get a pleasing result.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256269" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.13%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="992" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nature-photography-110.jpg?resize=1500%2C992&#038;ssl=1" alt="Nature photography" class="wp-image-256269" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nature-photography-110.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nature-photography-110.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nature-photography-110.jpg?resize=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nature-photography-110.jpg?resize=768%2C508&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nature-photography-110.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nature-photography-110.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nature-photography-110.jpg?resize=717%2C474&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Editing is pretty subjective, and there are plenty of different approaches.

You can:</p><ol><li> Change color hues. You can make the reds more orange, the purples more pink, or the blues more green.</li><li> Change color saturation. You can make the blues more faded or the reds more intense.</li><li> Change color luminance.

Try the automatic slider adjustments</h2><p> Sometimes, it can be hard to know how to start (or continue) a Lightroom edit.</p><p> In such cases, I recommend a simple little trick:</p><p> Hold down the Shift key, then double click on the sliders in the Basic panel. Lightroom will analyze your image, then apply adjustments automatically.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236593" style="width:533px"><span class="space" style="width:533px; padding-top:112.57%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="533" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lightroom-tips-3.jpg?resize=533%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom Basic sliders" class="wp-image-236593" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lightroom-tips-3.jpg?resize=533%2C600&amp;ssl=1 533w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lightroom-tips-3.jpg?resize=266%2C300&amp;ssl=1 266w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lightroom-tips-3.jpg?w=659&amp;ssl=1 659w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> No, the edits won&#39;t always be perfect, but they often look nice – and if you hate the result, you can always double-click on the slider name to set it back to zero. Plus, you can always use the automatic settings as starting points, then edit from there.</p><p> By the way, if you want to see all of Lightroom&#39;s automatic edits at once, just click the <strong>Auto</strong> button above the <strong>Exposure</strong> slider:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236595" style="width:659px"><span class="space" style="width:659px; padding-top:112.59%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="659" height="742" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lightroom-tips-4.jpg?resize=659%2C742&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom Auto option" class="wp-image-236595" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lightroom-tips-4.jpg?w=659&amp;ssl=1 659w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lightroom-tips-4.jpg?resize=266%2C300&amp;ssl=1 266w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lightroom-tips-4.jpg?resize=533%2C600&amp;ssl=1 533w" sizes="(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> It&#39;ll instantly adjust the sliders in the Basic panel!</p><p> Now, these automatic adjustments don&#39;t work for all Lightroom sliders. They won&#39;t work outside the Basic panel, and they won&#39;t work on the Texture, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/four-ways-improve-photos-clarity-slider-lightroom/" target="_blank" aria-label="Clarity (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Clarity</a> , and Dehaze sliders.</p><p> But you <em>can</em> use it to automatically adjust the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/adjusting-white-balance-in-lightroom/" target="_blank" aria-label="white balance (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">white balance</a> , the exposure, the contrast, and even the saturation – so why not give it a try and see what you think?</p><h2 data-section id="use-the-clipping-masks-or-the-clipping-warnings"> 3. Use the clipping masks (or the clipping warnings)</h2><p> Clipping refers to a loss of detail in the highlights and/or the shadows of an image – and in general, clipping is pretty bad.</p><p>不幸的是，很难判断您在编辑时是否真的剪切了细节，并且在没有意识到的情况下将滑块推得太远可能会加剧剪切问题。 You can always keep an eye on the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understand-lightroom-histogram/" target="_blank" aria-label="histogram (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">histogram</a> , but it can be difficult to interpret, especially for beginners.</p><p> Fortunately, Lightroom has a solution: The clipping masks, which clearly indicate clipping <em>in real-time</em> .</p><p> Before you adjust the Exposure, Highlights, Shadows, Whites, or Blacks slider, simply hold down the <strong>Alt/Opt</strong> key. Then, when you increase or decrease the sliders, you&#39;ll see a white or a black overlay, like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-149689 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-149689" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:27.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="416" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adobe-lightroom-3.jpg?resize=1500%2C416&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom tips clipping masks" class="wp-image-149689" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adobe-lightroom-3.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adobe-lightroom-3.jpg?resize=300%2C83&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adobe-lightroom-3.jpg?resize=768%2C213&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adobe-lightroom-3.jpg?resize=600%2C166&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/adobe-lightroom-3.jpg?resize=717%2C199&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> A mask that reveals <em>zero</em> clipping will be all white or all black. But a mask that shows some clipping will change colors over the problem areas:</p><p> （请注意，当调整黑色或阴影时，剪裁将指示为<em>白</em>底色。另一方面，当调整曝光、白色或高光时，剪裁将指示为<em>黑</em>底色。）</p><p> As long as you have no clipping, you&#39;re good to go – but as soon as you start to see a loss of detail, you&#39;ll want to dial back the intensity of your edits. Make sense?</p><p> One more quick Lightroom tip: If you want to identify clipping but you <em>don&#39;t</em> want to spend time looking at the masks, you can always click the arrows at the top of the histogram:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236597" style="width:652px"><span class="space" style="width:652px; padding-top:35.74%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="652" height="233" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lightroom-tips-5.jpg?resize=652%2C233&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom clipping indicators" class="wp-image-236597" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lightroom-tips-5.jpg?w=652&amp;ssl=1 652w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lightroom-tips-5.jpg?resize=300%2C107&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lightroom-tips-5.jpg?resize=600%2C214&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> This will activate the clipping <em>indicators</em> , which will cause clipped shadows to turn blue and clipped highlights to turn red:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236599" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:56.2%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="843" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lightroom-tips-6.jpg?resize=1500%2C843&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom clipping indicators" class="wp-image-236599" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lightroom-tips-6.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lightroom-tips-6.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lightroom-tips-6.jpg?resize=600%2C337&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lightroom-tips-6.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lightroom-tips-6.jpg?resize=717%2C403&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="use-the-copy-paste-shortcut-to-speed-up-your-workflow"> 4. Use the copy-paste shortcut to speed up your workflow</h2><p> Say you&#39;re editing a large volume of photos from an event, a wedding, or a portrait photoshoot.

A window will pop up, asking you which settings you want to copy:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236602" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:62.6%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="939" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lightroom-tips-7.jpg?resize=1500%2C939&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom copy settings" class="wp-image-236602" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lightroom-tips-7.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lightroom-tips-7.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lightroom-tips-7.jpg?resize=600%2C376&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lightroom-tips-7.jpg?resize=768%2C481&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lightroom-tips-7.jpg?resize=717%2C449&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Then, once you&#39;ve chosen the relevant settings, select your to-be-edited photos, then choose <strong>Edit>;Paste</strong> (or press <strong>Ctrl/Cmd+V</strong> ).</p><p> The settings from your original photo will be pasted onto the selected images, and your editing work will be done!</p><p> This can be a great way to handle complex photoshoots. For instance, if you captured images in multiple types of light, you might edit the first <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/front-light-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="front-lit image (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">front-lit image</a> , copy the settings, and paste them across all the remaining frontlit images. You could do the same for the backlit images, the shaded images, and so on – and if you require even more control over your results, you can make slight adjustments to your settings as you go, then copy again and paste as required.</p><p> I do have one recommendation, though:</p><p> Even if you think you&#39;ve done a successful copy-paste job, quickly go through the edited images and make sure everything looks okay. You don&#39;t want to send images to a client, only to realize that you cropped all the files by accident!</p><h2 data-section id="use-lightrooms-local-adjustment-tools"> 5.

Mirrorless models are feature-rich, and features like manual focusing guides and electronic viewfinders come in handy in certain scenarios. But don&#39;t discount DSLRs; their optical viewfinders are very effective when working in near-total darkness. Ultimately, both have their merits, and it comes down to what you&#39;re most comfortable using. Just remember that it&#39;s crucial to go full-frame for the best high-ISO performance.</p><h2 data-section id="a-wide-angle-lens"> 2.

You press the shutter button, expecting to capture a great image – but when you review the shot, it looks blurry.为什么？ Because your camera moved when you touched it.</p><p> That&#39;s where a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/8-benefits-using-wireless-remote-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="remote shutter release (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">remote shutter release</a> comes into play. This nifty gadget allows you to take photos without touching your camera, eliminating any chance of camera shake so you can capture tack-sharp shots time and time again.</p><p> If you&#39;re keen on star trails or <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/step-by-step-guide-to-long-exposure-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="long exposures (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">long exposures</a> beyond 30 seconds, it&#39;s important to recognize that some advanced remotes display the exposure time; that way, you can carefully determine the length of the exposure as you work.</p><p> But what if you don&#39;t plan to use extra-long shutter speeds?

A natural night filter</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133683" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="501" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Natural-Night-e1504644929145.jpg?resize=750%2C501&#038;ssl=1" alt="Night landscape photography equipment" class="wp-image-133683" data-recalc-dims="1"/></span></figure></div><p> Photographers don&#39;t talk much about using a natural night filter, but let me tell you, this tool can be a game-changer. Especially when shooting near cities or populated areas where light pollution is a big issue, a natural night filter becomes a go-to item in my kit. It slots easily into a filter holder on the front of your lens, and once in place, it acts as a barrier, filtering out the wavelengths of light pollution that mess up your photos.</p><p> Sure, you can try to fix light pollution issues in post-production. But in my experience, the right filter can save you a lot of hassle – your images will come out crisper and more balanced right off the bat. NiSi and LEE are great brands for night filters, and they both offer robust and effective options. The filters aren&#39;t exactly budget-friendly, but if you&#39;re serious about capturing the night sky in all its glory, investing in one can be worth every penny.</p><h2 data-section id="plenty-of-batteries"> 5.

Long exposures and cold nighttime temperatures can deplete your batteries faster than you think, and that&#39;s why having extra batteries is non-negotiable when you&#39;re out in the field at night.</p><p> In a perfect world, we&#39;d all carry a handful of brand-name batteries from Canon, Nikon, or Sony. But let&#39;s face it, extra batteries are expensive – so if you&#39;re looking to save a bit, there are third-party batteries that cost less. Just read the reviews, and understand that they might not have the same longevity or reliability as the name-brand ones.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256238" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:63.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="949" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/night-landscape-photography-equipment-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C949&#038;ssl=1" alt="Night landscape photography equipment" class="wp-image-256238" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/night-landscape-photography-equipment-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/night-landscape-photography-equipment-2.jpg?resize=300%2C190&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/night-landscape-photography-equipment-2.jpg?resize=600%2C380&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/night-landscape-photography-equipment-2.jpg?resize=768%2C486&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/night-landscape-photography-equipment-2.jpg?resize=717%2C454&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> You can also adopt a few tricks to save battery life. Turn on your camera&#39;s power-saving mode, avoid using the electronic viewfinder, and only power up your camera when you&#39;re ready to shoot.</p><p> But my basic advice? Keep two or three fully charged batteries in an inner pocket of your jacket, especially if it&#39;s cold. That way, you&#39;re always prepared, and you won&#39;t have to cut your photography session short because of a dead battery.</p><h2 data-section id="a-powerful-headlamp"> 6.

You&#39;re out in the field with a bag full of equipment, but none of it will be useful if you can&#39;t see what you&#39;re doing.</p><p> A handheld flashlight might come to mind as a solution. However, using one can be limiting. If you&#39;re maneuvering over uneven ground, your hands are better off free, and that&#39;s where a headlamp becomes invaluable. Strap it on, and suddenly you have light exactly where you&#39;re looking, no juggling act required.</p><p> Plus, with a headlamp, you can see clearly as you mount your camera, select focus, adjust composition, or change settings. But don&#39;t forget to turn off the headlamp before you hit the shutter. Otherwise, you&#39;ll end up unintentionally painting your scene with light.</p><h2 data-section id="a-smartphone"> 7.

But while these shots are a huge part of street photography, the genre is actually far more expansive.</p><p> You see, street photography is about candidly photographing life and human nature. It is a way for us to show our surroundings and how we as photographers relate to it.</p><p> People don&#39;t need to be present in a street photograph, nor does a street photo need to be taken in a city. It can be taken anywhere, and it can portray nearly anything – as long as it isn&#39;t posed or manipulated. A street photo can be shot at a family barbecue or in the middle of 5th Avenue in New York City. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2_prince_and_broadway.jpg?ssl=1" alt="people walking street photography" title="2_prince_and_broadway.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Note that, while technical quality is always important, it is not celebrated in street photography the way it is in, say, landscape photography. A landscape image needs to be sharp. It needs to have perfect colors and plenty of tonal detail. But street photography is different; it can be grainy, poorly focused, or slightly off-kilter.</p><p> Can these issues ruin a street photo? Yes, sometimes, so it&#39;s important to aim for technical mastery. But if an image is technically imperfect, it may still be great (or, thanks to these deficiencies, it might actually become <em>better</em> ). </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cobblestone.jpg?ssl=1" alt="shadows on the cobblestones" title="cobblestone.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 id="ethics-in-street-photography"> Ethics in street photography</h2><p> I&#39;m not going to sugarcoat it: Street photography is intrusive. Photographing people candidly usually means that you do not have their permission beforehand. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/3_smiley_face_soho.jpg?ssl=1" alt="smiley face hat man walking" title="3_smiley_face_soho.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> To do street photography, you will need to come to terms with this. Every time you hit the shutter, there is a chance that your subject will be bothered. Some won&#39;t mind, but some will.</p><p> That is the <a aria-label="moral cost of street photography (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/street-photography-exploitative-vs-respect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">moral cost of street photography</a> . Most of us do it because we like people, and we like exploring, and we like capturing culture. The camera is just a way to bring back moments that we see and enjoy. The images we take have value – both current and historical. When you look at images from the 1920s, 1950s, 1970s, or even from 15 years ago, which are the most interesting? Usually, it&#39;s the ones that include people and culture. Those are the photographs that so many viewers find fascinating, because they offer lots of cultural value.</p><p> However, it&#39;s up to you to decide whether street photography is worth it. Yes, it offers benefits – but the cost is real, too.</p><h2 id="how-to-get-over-your-fear-of-photographing-people"> How to get over your fear of photographing people</h2><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/7-steps-to-get-over-your-fear-of-street-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="Fear (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Fear</a> is one of the toughest obstacles to overcome for street photographers. Beginners often think, “What if my subject sees me? How will they feel? Will they be mad? How will they react?”</p><p> But an important fact to keep in mind is that getting caught doesn&#39;t have to be that bad.</p><p> Think about the first time that a comedian bombs on stage. Once it happens, it&#39;s over, and they no longer need to worry. Similarly, someone <em>will</em> see you take their picture, and it&#39;s important that you speak to them. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/4_shades_of_red.jpg?ssl=1" alt="woman's arm" title="4_shades_of_red.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> (Keep in mind that, when you do street photography right, most people won&#39;t notice. But occasionally, they will.)</p><p> When someone asks you what you are doing, be confident and comfortable. I say that I am a photographer carrying out a project capturing the culture and people of New York, and I thought they looked fabulous (flattery is key!). If they continue to question me, I will explain more; I&#39;ll tell them that I did not mean to make them uncomfortable and that I&#39;m happy to delete the image if they prefer. Only twice have I ever had to delete a photograph. Those are pretty good odds. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/joe_soho.jpg?ssl=1" alt="man with coffee walking" title="joe_soho.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> By the way, if someone catches you, own up to it, but don&#39;t be combative. Even if it is in your legal right to photograph on the street, don&#39;t use that as your argument. You don&#39;t need to argue at all. And no matter what, keep a smile on your face.</p><p> Keep in mind that the stealthier you try to act, the weirder you can actually look. Sometimes, being obvious and taking photos in a direct way can be the least confrontational strategy. The more obvious you look, the less people will think that you could possibly be doing something wrong. If you were, why would you be so obvious?</p><p> Finally, consider starting somewhere busy, such as a fair or a market. It&#39;s a great way to get over the initial hump because you&#39;ll be less noticeable – and as you improve, you can move on to different places.</p><h2 id="is-street-photography-legal-street-shooting-and-the-law"> Is street photography legal?

Do not hold me (or Digital Photography School) accountable for what I have written below. These are my own beliefs based on my research. Do your own research and familiarize yourself with the laws in your area.</em></p><p> In certain locations, street photography without permission is illegal. Some places make it completely impossible to do street photography, while in other places photographers may be able to ignore the laws. In some countries, street photographers continue to take candid images, but only where the person&#39;s face is unrecognizable.</p><p> In the US and the UK, there is no right to privacy in public. This means that you can legally take photographs of anyone in a public place. Note that the definition of “public place” may vary from one country to the next, but it does generally include parks, sidewalks, roads, and outdoor common areas of office buildings. Most indoor locations, on the other hand, would be considered private places, such as shops, churches, schools, and office buildings. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/graffiti_selfie.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Graffiti selfie" title="graffiti_selfie.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> In the US and the UK, you can use photographs taken in public places for artistic purposes <em>without</em> the need for a model release. This means you can sell street shots as fine art prints or as illustrations for books or cards. However, you cannot use these images for commercial or advertising purposes without a model release from every person in the scene. You cannot use the images to promote a product, and you cannot use them in a way that may insinuate something false about the subject.</p><p> Legal rights aside, it can also be smart to research the locals&#39; friendliness toward street photographers. In some locations, it is much easier to photograph people, while in other locations, people may be much more confrontational. One of the reasons New York is such a great place for street photography is because the people are used to seeing cameras. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/6_canal_street.jpg?ssl=1" alt="woman walking through the crowd" title="6_canal_street.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> You should also assess each person before you snap their photo.

And when you find one, just wait.</p><p> If you only shoot while walking, you will come across many wonderful locations – but you&#39;ll only give yourself a brief moment to capture the right image. Instead, find a nice location…and then wait for the perfect moment. By hanging out in one area, you&#39;ll be able to focus your attention on the scene, plus you&#39;ll be ready with your camera.</p><p> Also, if you lie in wait, people will enter your personal space, not the other way around. That way, you can feel more comfortable shooting (and your subjects will feel more comfortable, too). </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/7_pushups_rucker_park.jpg?ssl=1" alt="boy doing push ups" title="7_pushups_rucker_park.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 id="2-after-shooting-keep-the-camera-up"> 2. After shooting, keep the camera up</h3><p> Grab your camera, then take a photo.</p><p> What did you do with your hand? Most photographers, the moment they&#39;ve captured an image, will drop their arm down and let their camera dangle. And <em>this</em> is what tips people off; it clearly indicates that <em>you have taken their photo</em> .</p><p> So make a conscious effort to adjust your behavior. After you capture an image, don&#39;t drop your arm. Instead, hold the camera in place until the subject leaves the scene. That way, your subject will think you were just photographing the background and that they were in the way.</p><h3 id="3-photograph-where-you-live"> 3. Photograph where you live</h3><p> What are the best locations for street photography? Most beginners believe that, to get great shots, they need an “interesting” area to shoot, like New York City or London.</p><p> But here&#39;s the truth: You don&#39;t need a highly populated area to take interesting street images. The best photographers can take good images anywhere.</p><p> If you&#39;re struggling to photograph where you live, try a little exercise: List the <em>least</em> interesting areas within 20 miles of your home. Then go there and force yourself to figure out how to take good photographs. You&#39;ll find it tough at first – but pretty soon, you&#39;ll be capturing some great pictures!</p><h2 id="the-best-street-photography-equipment"> The best street photography equipment </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/8_yosemite_soho.jpg?ssl=1" alt="person carrying an iMac box" title="8_yosemite_soho.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> You can do street photography with <em>any</em> type of <a aria-label="camera (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-camera-for-street-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">camera</a> .

A zoom lens will let you capture the more obvious opportunities at different distances but will be heavier, more noticeable, and more cumbersome. A prime lens will restrict you to a single focal length but will also be light, freeing, and fun to use.</p><p> In fact, prime lenses actually offer a big advantage: you will begin to see the world more intuitively with one focal length. While the limitation will stop you from capturing certain shots, you will become even better at capturing images within the constraints of that focal length. Ultimately, you&#39;ll become quicker and more spontaneous with your camera.</p><p> Also, traveling light and compact will give you a lot more flexibility, especially in places where a large camera stands out. In my experience, lighter cameras and lenses are more fun to shoot with, and they let you enjoy photography in situations you normally wouldn&#39;t take a bulky DSLR setup.</p><h2 id="the-best-street-photography-camera-settings"> The best street photography camera settings </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/9_sample_sale.jpg?ssl=1" alt="people waiting in line street photography" title="9_sample_sale.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> There is no one correct way to do street photography, and many of the best shooters use completely different methods. However, you&#39;ll want to consider a handful of factors (and if you&#39;ve been photographing in a specific way for a long time, I&#39;d advise testing out other methods, if only to push you out of your comfort zone).</p><p> Below, I share my favorite <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-street-photography-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="street photography camera settings (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">street photography camera settings</a> , starting with:</p><h3 id="aperture"> Aperture</h3><p> In street photography, you usually want a narrow <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> for increased <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> . A deep depth of field will let you capture a variety of situations on the fly, plus it will prevent you from missing focus on fast-moving candid subjects. And it can provide beneficial context and storytelling, too.</p><p> While I won&#39;t recommend one single aperture, consider stopping down to around f/8 or f/11. Assuming your subject is a few feet away and you&#39;re shooting with a wide-to-standard focal length, this will give you plenty of depth of field to keep your subject sharp, even if you don&#39;t have time to focus properly (see the zone focusing method, explained below). </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/10_bike_messenger.jpg?ssl=1" alt="man riding a bike through a street" title="10_bike_messenger.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 id="shutter-speed"> Shutter speed</h3><p> Most street photos feature moving people.

But if I need to, I&#39;ll drop to 1/160s and sometimes 1/125s.</p><p> Note that your minimum shutter speed should depend on your own stability (eg, if you&#39;re standing still, you&#39;ll be able to shoot much better than if you&#39;re moving). It should also depend on the speed of your subject; a bicyclist or jogger needs a faster shutter speed versus a walker.</p><p> Also, <em>always</em> peek at your photos afterward to check the sharpness. That way, you can learn as you go along.</p><h3 id="iso"> ISO</h3><p> You&#39;re trying to squeeze as much depth of field as possible out of your camera. You&#39;re trying to keep the shutter speed fast.</p><p> To do this, you&#39;ll need to boost your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> .</p><p> I will typically set my camera to ISO 400 in sunlight, 800 in light shade, 1600 in dark shade, 3200 at dusk, and 6400 at night. With entry-level digital cameras, I would probably drop by a stop (to 3200 at night, 1600 at dusk, and so on).</p><p> Fortunately, in street photography, noise often looks good, though test your camera to see how the images appear at high ISOs (and do some prints to see how the noise appears on paper, too). With newer cameras, you can easily go to ISO 1600, 3200, and higher. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/11_canal_street.jpg?ssl=1" alt="man working outside market" title="11_canal_street.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 id="camera-mode"> Camera mode</h3><p> What&#39;s the best camera mode for street photography? You can shoot in <a aria-label="Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority</a> , or even <a aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> – but I personally prefer Shutter Priority.</p><p> You see, you&#39;ll often be shooting into the sun one moment and away from it the next, and if you&#39;re shooting in Manual mode, you&#39;ll need to change your settings every time you turn your camera. It&#39;s much more efficient to set your camera to Shutter Priority, dial in your preferred shutter speed, and start shooting.</p><p> That said, in consistent lighting situations, when shooting indoors, or when <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/in-the-dark-10-tips-for-street-night-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="shooting at night (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shooting at night</a> , I will switch to Manual mode. And when I want a very shallow depth of field, I&#39;ll switch to Aperture Priority, choose a low ISO, and set my aperture to f/2.8 or so.</p><h2 id="composition-in-street-photography"> Composition in street photography </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/12_blonde_soho.jpg?ssl=1" alt="woman in bright sunlight" title="12_blonde_soho.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Capturing perfect street photography compositions is difficult – but it&#39;s also essential, because a good composition is <em>key</em> to a great street photo.</p><p> That&#39;s why I&#39;d urge you to compose your street photographs the same way you&#39;d compose a landscape image. Assess the scene and arrange all of the elements together. Every element counts, no matter what it is; the best street photographers have a way of bringing everything together in just the right way.</p><p> Sometimes the subject is all that&#39;s important, and you&#39;ll want to frame it or blur the background away while forgetting about everything else. A lot of photographers will shoot this way 100% of the time, especially when first starting out, but that&#39;s a mistake. The subject matters, but the environment matters, too.</p><p> Try to combine the main subject with other elements to create a more complex composition. Can you create relationships between subjects to add new meaning to a scene? Whether or not you decide to make the surroundings prominent, you always need to be aware of them. It&#39;s better to intentionally discard background elements than to not notice them at all. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/construction_workers.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Construction workers through a screen" title="construction_workers.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 id="lighting-in-street-photography"> Lighting in street photography</h2><p> In street photography, you should <em>always</em> keep an eye out for your main light sources. How is the light hitting your subject, and where is it located in relation to that subject? How is it hitting the background? What color is the light, and are there multiple light sources?</p><p> However, it is important to understand that there is no <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/bad-light-street-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="best light for street photography (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link"><em>best</em> light for street photography</a> . The harsh midday light will be just as beautiful and interesting as the warm dawn or dusk light. What&#39;s important is that you make the most out of the light in any location.</p><p> Some photographers will use a portable flash to illuminate their subjects and separate them from the background. This can create a great look, but keep in mind that flashing a stranger in the face can be very confrontational.</p><p> Also, when the flash is too strong, it can take away from the feeling of reality; this is a look that some photographers dislike and some photographers desire, so it&#39;s a decision you&#39;ll have to make. If you&#39;re going for a surreal look, then a flash could be a big asset.</p><h2 id="advanced-street-photography-tips"> Advanced street photography tips </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13_youth_soho.jpg?ssl=1" alt="person smoking in Soho" title="13_youth_soho.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> In this section, I&#39;ll share some high-level street photography advice.

Look for facial expressions and gestures</h3><p> Scenes with people just walking down the street or standing in place are <em>not enough</em> . To take your images to the next level, you must photograph people with <a aria-label="strong facial expressions or gestures in their body (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/importance-capturing-gesture-emotion-street-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">strong facial expressions or gestures</a> .</p><p> As humans, we recognize what others are feeling through their facial expressions. So when you&#39;re out shooting, one of the first things you should be doing is paying attention to people&#39;s expressions. You can also get subtle cues from a person&#39;s body, so keep an eye out for how a person gestures through their body, hands, legs, and feet.</p><p> Then, when the expression or gesture is at its peak, take a photo!</p><h3 id="2-seek-out-imperfection"> 2. Seek out imperfection</h3><p> The beauty of street photography is often in its imperfections. I discussed this at the start of the article, but it bears repeating: you do not need to make your photos perfect in every way. Strong grain (or digital noise), an image that is slightly askew, an element that is slightly in the way, and poor lighting can all make an image imperfect – but they can also make it more real.</p><p> While each of the latter items have the ability to ruin a photo, they&#39;ll sometimes do just enough to make your image feel like a natural moment. So while you should always aim for technical mastery, realize that imperfections can be beneficial and even necessary. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/14_selfie_soho.jpg?ssl=1" alt="kids taking a selfie" title="14_selfie_soho.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 id="3-try-zone-focusing"> 3. Try zone focusing</h3><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/ultimate-guide-to-zone-focusing-for-candid-street-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="Zone focusing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Zone focusing</a> is simple to learn, fairly difficult to master, and painful to explain in writing (it&#39;s much easier to just show someone how to do it). Basically, zone focusing is a strategy where you manually focus a set distance into the scene, then take photos without adjusting your focus point at all.</p><p> You start by prefocusing your camera to a certain distance. I typically choose between 8 and 10 feet away, which is where I like to capture my subjects. Then, when subjects enter the prefocused area, you can click the shutter <em>without</em> fiddling with your autofocus. The fraction of a second that zone focusing saves, and the added freedom this allows, will take you a <em>long</em> way.</p><p> I usually only zone focus at 35mm and wider.为什么？ The farther you zoom in, the more accurate you have to be with your focus to get your subject sharp; it becomes very difficult to zone focus over 50mm. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/jerry_delakas_astor_newsman.jpg?ssl=1" alt="man at a newsstand " title="jerry_delakas_astor_newsman.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> When starting out, zone focusing is very easy to screw up. If you do not gauge the distances correctly, you can miss focus entirely. It is much easier to zone focus in bright sunlight, because with a 35mm or wider focal length and an aperture of f/11 to f/16, you&#39;ll have a <em>huge</em> depth of field. Even if you miss the focus by a bit, your important subjects will be sharp.</p><p> Eventually, you can learn to zone focus in darker situations and at apertures up to f/2. It&#39;s much more difficult, so take your time getting there, but it&#39;s very possible. When zone focusing at shallower apertures, you can even learn to move the focus ring without looking, so if you are focused at 10 feet and a subject appears 5 feet away, you can adjust the focus instinctively to that distance without even looking (that&#39;s how sports shooters did it before autofocus existed!). It takes a lot of practice, but it&#39;s very possible to learn!</p><h3 id="4-develop-your-ideas"> 4.

What do you want your photographs to show? How do you want them to look?</p><p> These questions may seem difficult – or impossible – to answer, and that&#39;s okay. The more you shoot, the more you&#39;ll understand what you are drawn to. You&#39;ll see subjects that you are attracted to, and you&#39;ll begin to seek them out when you are photographing. Occasionally, you will have big ideas right away, but it will often take a lot of time for these ideas to grow and develop naturally.</p><p> In other words:</p><p> It&#39;s okay to shoot first and ask questions later.</p><h3 id="5-spend-a-lot-of-time-editing-your-street-photography"> 5.

Editing is where you should really think about your work in a larger setting. It&#39;s where you can explore themes and ideas as they start to pop up in your photography. It&#39;s when you can combine similar images to create a larger story. It&#39;s where you can develop a style in both look and content.</p><p> Therefore, the time that you spend editing will help you when you are out shooting.</p><p> Consider using Lightroom&#39;s star rating and collection system to organize your best work and to group photos with similar themes. Find patterns in your work and images that play well off each other, then create collections. Constantly add photos, remove photos, and change their order.</p><p> When editing your work, it is important to consider the value of realism. An image that is so over-edited that it looks fake will kill the spirit of street photography. Remember, your images don&#39;t have to be perfect. You do not need every detail in the shadows and highlights. While you should certainly do post-production, always take a step back and consider whether or not you&#39;ve overcooked your shot.</p><h3 id="6-learn-from-the-street-photography-masters"> 6.

Your local library can be a big help!</p><p> Pay special attention to the street photographers whose work you don&#39;t like. Street photos are often different and weird, and it can be impossible to truly get a sense of what a photographer is trying to portray by seeing just a few photographs.

To achieve this effect, you must use a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="narrow aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">narrow aperture</a> , which in turn will reduce your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> and make your images <em>very</em> prone to blur.</p><p>因此，许多风景摄影师在拍摄结束回家后，却发现他们的照片始终模糊不清。</p><p>不过，有一个简单的方法可以解决这个问题：使用<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-buying-a-tripod/" target="_blank" aria-label="tripod (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">三脚架</a>！如果您在弱光下拍摄，这一点尤其重要，但老实说，我建议您<em>随身</em>携带三脚架。</p><p>现在，有三脚架，有<em>三脚架</em>。对于风景摄影，您可能需要购买更耐用的选择；虽然小型、轻量的三脚架可能会暂时发挥作用，但如果您在风中拍摄，则可能会出现三脚架晃动的风险（另外，您的三脚架可能会被吹倒）。一个好的三脚架也可以使用很长时间并且经受住考验，因此请购买您能负担得起的最好的三脚架，并在拍摄时尽可能保持相机静止。</p><p>另一件值得购买的好设备是<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/remote-shutter-vs-delayed-shutter/" target="_blank" aria-label="remote release (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">远程释放</a>。您不需要使用带有内置间隔计的昂贵设备；只需一个简单的遥控快门就可以了。一旦您准备好拍摄，请从相机后退一步并按下快门按钮。按下相机快门按钮时不会产生任何振动，并且您的图像将会清晰漂亮。</p><p> （如果您不想购买远程版本，则可以使用自拍器。）</p><h2 data-section id="not-getting-the-horizon-straight"> 2. 没有看清地平线</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-256215" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px;

id="1-use-window-light-for-a-flattering-effect"> 1.利用窗光打造迷人效果</h2><p>出色的狗狗摄影始于出色的照明，对我来说，那就是<em>窗户光</em>。</p><p>窗户光很漂亮，（通常）柔和，非常适合照亮拍摄对象，同时让背景陷入阴影。</p><p>要了解窗户光的力量，请看这两张图片： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/with-without-window-light.jpg?ssl=1" alt="With without window light - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="有-无-窗光.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>窗户光不仅照亮了狗的关键部位——同时让其他部位陷入阴影以获得更加三维的效果——它还可以让你使用<a aria-label="low ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">低ISO</a>和更快的<a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">快门速度</a>，这会给你带来更清晰、更高的拍摄效果。 - 优质图像。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/photo-with-window-light.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Photo with window light - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="窗光照片.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>顺便说一句，如果您更喜欢使用闪光灯或影室闪光灯，也没关系！只要确保用<a aria-label="modifier (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/a-beginners-guide-to-light-modifiers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">修饰剂</a>遮盖它们即可获得柔和、讨人喜欢的效果。</p><h2 id="2-in-a-pinch-use-your-phone-light"> 2. 紧要关头，使用手机灯</h2><p>虽然窗户光（或精心修改的人造光）是狗狗摄影的理想选择，但在窗户附近拍摄并不总是可行。</p><p>毕竟，您可能在房子周围闲逛，注意到您的狗在做一些可爱的事情，并想用相机捕捉到它。在这种情况下，您根本无法将狗移到窗户附近以获得完美的照明！您也没有时间设置一些闪光灯或闪光灯。</p><p> So what do you do?下次当您遇到困难的照明场景时，请尝试拿出智能手机，打开手电筒，然后将其指向您的狗。测试不同的角度（45 度照明和其他形式的侧光往往效果很好！）。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/photography-camera-light.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Photography camera light - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="摄影相机灯.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 id="3-create-a-stunning-tinfoil-background"> 3.创建令人惊叹的锡纸背景</h2><p>您是美丽的圆形<a aria-label="bokeh (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">散景</a>的粉丝吗？根据我的经验，可爱的散景效果可以拍摄一张平庸的狗照片，并赋予其引人注目的专业外观 - 但令人惊叹的散景并不总是那么容易创建。</p><p>输入一个令人惊叹的 DIY 狗肖像工具：</p><p>锡纸！</p><p>只需取一些锡纸，将其揉成一团，然后展开即可。将锡纸放在狗后面，用灯照射它，然后 - 瞧！ – 你会得到令人瞠目结舌的散景效果： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/tin-foil-bokeh.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Tin foil bokeh " title="锡箔散景.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>这项技术确实需要一些练习，但要开始，请尝试使用大<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">光圈</a>（f/2.8 是一个很好的起点），并确保将您的狗移到箔片前面（箔片之间的距离越大）狗和箔片，背景模糊效果越好）。</p><p>我还建议您使用短焦距或变焦镜头，最好是 50 毫米以上，并确保箔片完全<em>填充</em>背景。最后，如果您很难获得足够明亮的散景，请尝试将背景与狗分开照明（在这里，您的智能手机可以提供很大帮助！）。</p><h2 id="4-shoot-dog-reflection-photos"> 4.拍摄狗狗倒影照片</h2><p>这个狗狗摄影技巧可能有点不传统，但它很简单，而且是捕捉创意狗狗照片的好方法。</p><p>下次当您靠近水（例如水坑或池塘）时，请让您的狗坐下。然后小心地调整自己的角度，以便<em>只有</em>狗的倒影和脚出现在照片中（您可能需要低下）。</p><p>然后，在后期处理中，您可以翻转图像以创建奇妙的幻觉： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dog-reflected-puddle.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Dog reflected puddle - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="狗反射水坑.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>很酷，对吧？当然，您始终可以尝试放大反射头像，包括照片中更多的狗，等等。</p><h2 id="5-use-a-mirror-to-create-negative-space"> 5.使用镜子创造负空间</h2><p>极简主义的狗狗照片很漂亮；狗通常占据画面的一小部分，而镜头的其余部分则被空白区域覆盖（例如，白墙或失焦的前景元素）。</p><p>现在，您始终可以通过在大型、空旷的环境中工作来拍摄<a aria-label="minimalist shots (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/photographic-minimalism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">极简主义的照片</a>，但是如果您在家里拍摄，该怎么办？如何在杂乱的环境中拍摄出简约的照片？</p><p>很简单：带一面镜子。</p><p>然后扩大光圈以创建狭窄<a aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">的景深</a>，缩小以将小狗包含在画面中，然后将镜子靠近相机镜头。确保镜子<em>没有</em>遮住狗，但<em>遮住</em>了框架的其余部分。</p><p>这样，如果你的光圈足够宽并且镜子距离你的相机镜头足够近，镜面就会被遮挡，给你一个美丽的<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/negative-space-in-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="negative space (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">负空间</a>： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/white-space-dog.jpg?ssl=1" alt="White space dog - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="空白狗.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 id="6-use-fairy-lights-to-spice-up-your-dog-photography"> 6.使用童话般的灯光为你的狗狗摄影增添趣味</h2><p>仙女灯价格便宜，使用起来很简单，而且如果小心使用，它们可以创造出令人惊叹的散景效果： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dog-on-fairy-lights.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Dog on fairy lights - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="仙女灯上的狗.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>因此，拿一些童话灯（圣诞灯也可以！），然后将它们放置在照片背景中。你也可以让你的狗坐在它们上面，然后从上面射击。</p><p>为了获得最佳效果，请确保使用大光圈。如果仙女灯不够模糊，请尝试将它们移至背景更远的位置和/或将狗带到前面。</p><h2 id="7-use-perspex-to-create-beautiful-foreground-reflections"> 7. 使用有机玻璃创造美丽的前景反射</h2><p>倒影是增强狗狗照片效果的好方法。通过将反光物体放置在相机镜头附近，然后倾斜该物体直到产生狗的反射，您可以获得特别酷的效果。</p><p>这就是我拍摄这张图像的方式，该图像的特点是构图左侧有有趣的反射： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dog-reflection-hack.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Dog reflection hack - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="狗反射黑客.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>我喜欢使用有机玻璃来实现这个技巧——无论我走到哪里，我都会随身携带一块有机玻璃——但你也可以使用智能手机获得类似的效果！</p><h2 id="8-use-a-prism-to-create-stunning-effects"> 8.使用棱镜创造令人惊叹的效果</h2><p>手持式棱镜将产生类似于有机玻璃的效果，但结果往往看起来更加迷幻并且具有有趣的颜色： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/camera-hack-prism.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Camera hack prism" title="相机黑客棱镜.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>因此，如果您想要特别<em>狂野的</em>效果，请拿起手持棱镜，然后尝试将其放置在狗和相机镜头之间。随意尝试不同的角度和不同的距离 - 根据棱镜的位置，您会得到各种有趣的结果。</p><h2 id="9-shoot-into-the-light-for-a-flare-effect"> 9.

Some light sources – such as the low sun – produce very warm, orangish light, while other light sources – such as artificial flash – produce very cold, bluish light. But when you dial in the correct white balance, you <em>neutralize</em> (ie, remove) this warm or cold result. Successful neutralization helps the underlying colors shine through and ensures the photo more accurately represents its subject.</p><p> Generally speaking, it&#39;s a good idea to neutralize color casts, so it can be helpful to work with your camera&#39;s white balance presets or even to <a aria-label="set the white balance using a gray card (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-a-gray-card-to-get-more-accurate-exposures-and-color/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">set the white balance using a gray card</a> .

You can actually use a warm or a cool white balance setting to add mood to your fall files. For instance, if you want to enhance reds and oranges, you can use a high-temperature white balance preset to warm up the image!</p><h2 data-section id="aim-to-portray-the-chaos"> 7. Aim to portray the chaos</h2><p> Fall scenes tend to be pretty chaotic. They often feature waving branches, fallen leaves, colorful shrubs…the list goes on.</p><p> And in photography, chaos is generally a bad thing. Many photographers spend long minutes working each scene so they can <em>reduce</em> the chaos. After all, chaos distracts the viewer and prevents them from looking toward the main subject, right?</p><p> Not always! If you can <em>embrace</em> the chaos, you can capture unique images that go beyond the standard fall shots. Try to carefully compose your shots so that all the elements fit together like a puzzle. And see if you can intersperse different colors throughout the frame – some reds here, some greens there.</p><p> In “chaos” shots, the goal is to think in terms of abstract geometry. Make sure that you carefully balance different colors and textures throughout the scene. And test out different apertures to see whether the images look good as deep <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> shots or <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-get-shallow-depth-of-field-in-your-digital-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="shallow depth of field (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shallow depth of field</a> files.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-240803" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-12.jpg?resize=1500%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="fall photography trees with yellow leaves" class="wp-image-240803" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-12.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-12.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-12.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-12.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-12.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-12.jpg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-12.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="bring-out-fall-colors-in-post-processing"> 8.

It doesn&#39;t require specialized knowledge, either; you can handle all your fall photo editing in an intuitive program such as Lightroom.</p><p> I&#39;d recommend first adjusting the exposure to make sure you capture the level of detail you&#39;re after. If you notice any detailless shadows or highlights, use the tonal sliders (ie, the highlights, shadows, blacks, and whites sliders) to recover the missing data.</p><p> Then make some contrast changes. This will often look nice and add plenty of punch, but don&#39;t go overboard. Too much contrast will start to create unrealistic effects, which is absolutely <em>not</em> what you want.</p><p> Finally, experiment with different color intensity sliders. The Saturation slider, for instance, can boost the overall color intensity. The Vibrance slider, on the other hand, enhances cooler colors. And if you&#39;re feeling especially adventurous, you might even try tweaking individual colors (using <a aria-label="Lightroom's HSL panel (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-the-hsl-panel-in-lightroom-for-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Lightroom&#39;s HSL panel</a> or <a aria-label="Photoshop's Hue/Saturation adjustment layer (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-the-hue-saturation-adjustment-in-photoshop-a-video-tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Photoshop&#39;s Hue/Saturation adjustment layer</a> ).</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-240805" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:68.87%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1033" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-8.jpg?resize=1500%2C1033&#038;ssl=1" alt="hand holding up a fall leaf" class="wp-image-240805" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-8.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-8.jpg?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-8.jpg?resize=600%2C413&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-8.jpg?resize=768%2C529&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-8.jpg?resize=717%2C494&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="go-out-when-the-weather-is-bad"> 9.

Rain is a great way to add a melancholy mood, while snow can create uplifting vibes or a sadder, lonelier look (depending on how you approach and edit your photos). And fog pretty much always looks great, though if you want <em>really</em> powerful images, try to combine fog with repetition (such as lines of trees in a forest).</p><p> You do have to be careful, though. It&#39;s easy to get lost in heavy fog or snow, so always carry a phone and tell someone where you&#39;re going in advance. And bad weather can damage your camera, so make sure you carry a rain cover at all times.
