Adobe has refined Lightroom Classic immensely over the years and newer versions are certainly better, but even something as simple as scrolling through large photo libraries or changing the size of image thumbnails can result in hiccups. Normal operations like applying edits, converting to DNG, and exporting are plenty fast, but other features – such as the facial-recognition tool – can bring even the most powerful computer to its knees.</p><p> Lightroom, by contrast, absolutely sails through anything you throw at it. Scrolling through tens of thousands of photos is fast and smooth, flipping from one photo to the next is practically instantaneous, and working with edits is as zippy as anything.</p><p> If sheer performance is all you want out of a digital asset management tool, Lightroom is the preferred choice. However, if you prefer a richer set of editing and organizational tools but don&#39;t mind some performance hiccups, Lightroom Classic will probably be more to your liking.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255023" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:55.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="829" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-facial-recognition.jpg?resize=1500%2C829&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom vs. Lightroom Classic: The facial recognition interface of Lightroom Classic." class="wp-image-255023" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-facial-recognition.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-facial-recognition.jpg?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-facial-recognition.jpg?resize=600%2C332&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-facial-recognition.jpg?resize=768%2C424&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-facial-recognition.jpg?resize=160%2C88&amp;ssl=1 160w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-facial-recognition.jpg?resize=717%2C396&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> If you want to slow Lightroom Classic to a crawl, just use the facial-recognition tool on a large collection of images.

Here, Lightroom is positively anemic compared to Lightroom Classic, and even several years after it was released, it is still missing what many would consider to be very basic organization features.</p><p> Lightroom organizes images using a simple Album/Folder structure: Photos are physically stored in Folders but one image can be in several Albums. Images can also contain star ratings and Flags such as Pick or Reject and be sorted on the fly to show only the photos that match these specific criteria.</p><p> But in terms of sheer photo organizational capability, Lightroom Classic wins hands-down – it&#39;s not even <em>remotely</em> close. Lightroom Classic has a bewildering assortment of methods that can be used to organize, sort, filter, and manage your pictures. You can use the Filter bar in the Library module to instantly narrow down all your shots according to specific criteria, and you can also search by Flag, Rating, and Color status. Smart Collections can be created that contain all images which match (or don&#39;t match) certain rules, and these are continually updated in real-time. When you import images, you can add metadata, change filenames, and specify exactly where you want your shots to be located.</p><p> Therefore, if organization and file management are your priorities, look no further than Lightroom Classic.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-with-caption"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255025" style="width:1496px"><span class="space" style="width:1496px; padding-top:69.05%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1496" height="1033" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-smart-collection.png?resize=1496%2C1033&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom vs. Lightroom Classic: The Smart Collection configuration dialog box in Lightroom Classic." class="wp-image-255025" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-smart-collection.png?w=1496&amp;ssl=1 1496w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-smart-collection.png?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-smart-collection.png?resize=600%2C414&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-smart-collection.png?resize=768%2C530&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-smart-collection.png?resize=717%2C495&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The sheer amount of parameters you can apply to a Lightroom Classic Smart Collection is mind-boggling.

It could only do basic operations and did not have much in the way of masking, grading, and other editing functions that photographers relied on for their workflows. Since then, Adobe has dramatically improved Lightroom&#39;s editing features, and it now covers nearly all of the operations that most photographers need.</p><p> Lightroom and Lightroom Classic offer basic tools like exposure and color adjustments, tone curves, color grading, and lens correction. Lightroom Classic goes a bit deeper on a few things – for instance, it lets you have pixel-precise control over chromatic aberration, whereas Lightroom does CA-removal automatically – but those kinds of operations are outliers.</p><p> Lightroom Classic&#39;s AI-powered masking features are incredibly impressive, and they&#39;re not available in Lightroom – but they almost certainly will be added to Lightroom in the near future. Lightroom Classic does also give you much greater control when copying edits from one photo to another or when syncing edits across many photos at once.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255035" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:60.13%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="902" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-editing-point-curve.png?resize=1500%2C902&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom vs. Lightroom Classic: The editing interface of Lightroom.

The winner here is difficult to say; it really comes down to what you need, not which program does more.</p><p> If you shoot professionally, you will likely appreciate the greater level of control and flexibility offered by Lightroom Classic, but if you value simplicity and ease of use, then Lightroom will probably suit you better.</p><h2 data-section id="lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-versatility"> Lightroom vs. Lightroom Classic: Versatility</h2><p> Once my kids are in bed, there are few things I enjoy more than sitting down in front of my 27-inch screen, putting on some music, and going through photos in Lightroom Classic. It&#39;s my happy place, and I can get lost in a state of photography flow for so long that time just slips away. Lightroom Classic offers everything I need right in one app, and it&#39;s versatile enough to handle any type of photoshoot and any type of photo. From importing to editing to exporting, it&#39;s all right where I need it, and it&#39;s organized in a way that makes sense to me.</p><p> Lightroom is equally versatile but in an entirely different way. It doesn&#39;t have the same level of microscopic control over every minute detail of the image management and editing process, but it <em>does</em> allow you to edit all your photos from any device or web browser. You never have to think about where your images might be located or whether you synced specific shots to the cloud. With Lightroom, everything is at your fingertips any time you want it.</p><p> Additionally, Lightroom&#39;s integration with the iPad and Apple Pencil is outstanding, and editing using this method is not just efficient but fun and enjoyable. Both Lightroom and Lightroom Classic are versatile in different ways. Neither one is inherently better, but one might be better suited to your needs.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255045" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:48.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="726" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-moth-flower.jpg?resize=1500%2C726&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom vs. Lightroom Classic: The editing interface of Lightroom Classic." class="wp-image-255045" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-moth-flower.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-moth-flower.jpg?resize=300%2C145&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-moth-flower.jpg?resize=600%2C290&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-moth-flower.jpg?resize=768%2C372&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-moth-flower.jpg?resize=717%2C347&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Lightroom Classic is incredibly versatile as a full digital asset management program, but Lightroom is versatile in its own way.</figcaption></figure></div><h2 data-section id="lightroom-vs-lightroom-classic-price-and-value"> Lightroom vs Lightroom Classic: Price and value</h2><p> One feature that makes choosing between Lightroom vs Lightroom Classic easier?价格。 Both programs are available <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom/compare-plans.html" target="_blank" aria-label="for the same subscription fee of $9.99/month (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">for the same subscription fee of $9.99/month</a> , which means you don&#39;t have to decide based on which is cheaper.

But before we delve into the nitty gritty of smartphone photography, I&#39;d like to emphasize a few particular reasons why a mobile phone can outcompete a professional camera.</p><p> First and foremost, the portability and convenience of having a camera at all times are hard to beat. Your smartphone is always with you and is <em>always</em> ready to capture those unexpected moments, whether you&#39;re on a train, a plane, stopped at a light, or in the middle of your lunch break.</p><p> Second, the various built-in features and modes offered by smartphones – such as Portrait mode, HDR settings, and Night mode – can enhance the average beginner&#39;s images above and beyond the shots they can take with, say, a DSLR. Yes, an experienced photographer with an expensive camera could create similar effects with a careful approach and equally careful editing, but it takes time and a lot of effort to get to that point.</p><p> Third, a smartphone allows you to capture, edit, and share photos all in one place; in other words, it&#39;s a one-stop shop for photography. Imagine being on a trip, capturing a breathtaking sunset, editing the image, and sharing it with friends and family on Facebook – all in the span of about 10 minutes. This type of ultra-integrated shooting certainly isn&#39;t possible on a DSLR and is one of the unique benefits of smartphone photography.</p><p> Finally, the cost-effectiveness of smartphones compared to professional camera gear is also a significant advantage. Non-smartphone photography can be an expensive hobby, especially when you factor in lenses, tripods, and other accessories. However, most folks already own a smartphone that takes solid photos – and even if you&#39;re looking to upgrade so you can achieve the best possible shots, it still won&#39;t cost you an arm and a leg.</p><h2 data-section id="how-to-pick-a-smartphone-for-photography"> How to pick a smartphone for photography</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255278" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:56.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="844" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-103.jpg?resize=1500%2C844&#038;ssl=1" alt="智能手机摄影" class="wp-image-255278" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-103.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-103.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-103.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-103.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-103.jpg?resize=717%2C403&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> You can capture great photos with pretty much any smartphone. But if you&#39;re looking to capture ultra-clean images and gain access to cool features, you might want to consider an Android or iPhone device with photo-centric capabilities.</p><p> Here are a few key factors to consider when choosing the best smartphone camera:</p><h3 data-section id="image-quality"> Image quality</h3><p> Not all smartphone cameras produce equally high-quality photos. Resolution is one factor to consider here; more megapixels are often better, especially if you want to be able to crop your shots without dramatically degrading the quality.</p><p> You should also look for a larger sensor, which will – all else being equal – allow you to get sharper, more natural images when photographing in darker areas. Image stabilization can also come in handy, especially if you often end up with blurry photos in low-light situations.</p><h3 data-section id="focal-length-flexibility"> Focal length flexibility</h3><p> Many smartphones offer more than one camera. In addition to the ubiquitous standard camera, you might find a phone with a wide-angle and a telephoto camera, or even an ultra-wide or an ultra-telephoto camera. Wider cameras are perfect for landscapes, while telephoto cameras are ideal if you want to photograph tight portraits and distant subjects.</p><p> As you consider different options, think about the camera type(s) that best suit your interests. More cameras usually mean more flexibility, but make sure to look at the specs of each one. The image quality can often vary from one camera to the next, meaning that a 48 MP standard camera does <em>not</em> guarantee 48 MP telephoto images.</p><h3 data-section id="additional-features-and-modes"> Additional features and modes</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255285" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-108.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="智能手机摄影" class="wp-image-255285" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-108.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-108.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-108.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-108.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-108.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-108.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Think about additional features that might help you with your photography. If you want to photograph stationary scenes at night – such as cityscapes from an apartment window – a night mode can make a huge difference. Portrait mode can add depth of field effects, while panorama mode is perfect for those wide scenic shots.</p><p> These additional modes and features can take your photography to the next level, but not every smartphone boasts every feature. Make sure that the device you pick gives you everything you need to capture the shots <em>you</em> want to create.</p><h3 data-section id="cost">成本</h3><p>Determining your budget is crucial, as smartphones can vary wildly in price. You&#39;ll want to think about a range that you&#39;re willing to spend, then look for the best value within that range. And don&#39;t just think about the cost of the phone itself. Consider the total cost, including potential accessories, image-editing app subscriptions, and so on.</p><p> If you don&#39;t have the budget to purchase a shiny new model, older models with strong camera features are definitely worth considering. It&#39;s all about finding the right balance between what you want and what you can afford!</p><h2 data-section id="smartphone-photography-accessories-are-they-necessary"> Smartphone photography accessories: Are they necessary?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255279" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-100.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="智能手机摄影" class="wp-image-255279" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-100.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-100.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-100.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-100.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-100.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you&#39;re just getting started with smartphone photography, it&#39;s fine to shoot with only your smartphone. However, once you become more familiar with your phone camera, and especially if you want to specialize in certain photographic genres, you may want to consider purchasing an accessory or two.</p><p> Now, I&#39;m not saying you should rush out and buy every gizmo and gadget on the market.离得很远。 Instead, start by understanding your interests. Are you into sprawling landscapes or close-up flower photos? Depending on your answer, your smartphone setup should look quite different.</p><p> As you grow more confident and your skills start to increase, you can begin to build your kit. As you do, here are a few items worth considering:</p><h3 data-section id="a-tripod">三脚架</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-255280" style="width:450px"><span class="space" style="width:450px; padding-top:133.33%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="450" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-106.jpg?resize=450%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="智能手机摄影" class="wp-image-255280" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-106.jpg?resize=450%2C600&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-106.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-106.jpg?resize=768%2C1025&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-106.jpg?resize=717%2C957&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-106.jpg?w=1124&amp;ssl=1 1124w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Stability is key in photography, especially for long-exposure shots, and that&#39;s where a tripod comes in handy. If you&#39;re shooting a scene and you want to show off movement – like a stream running through a valley – a tripod will keep your smartphone camera motionless as it records a photo for several seconds.</p><p> Additionally, a tripod allows for consistent framing when capturing several shots that you hope to blend together; this is key if you want to create stunning time-lapses.</p><p> Look for portable and adjustable options. Some tripods even come with Bluetooth remotes, allowing you to take photos from a distance without touching your phone. You can simply mount your smartphone on the tripod, step back, and use the remote to capture the perfect moment <em>without</em> worrying about camera shake.</p><h3 data-section id="clip-on-lenses"> Clip-on lenses</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255281" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-101.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="智能手机摄影" class="wp-image-255281" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-101.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-101.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-101.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-101.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-101.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Perhaps you&#39;re looking to capture ultra-wide landscapes, detailed macro images, or photos of skittish subjects? If that&#39;s the case, clip-on lenses can help you out by enhancing your smartphone&#39;s capabilities. They come in various types, including wide-angle, fisheye, macro, and telephoto, and they can certainly give you some extra focal length flexibility when shooting.</p><p> Before buying a clip-on lens, however, ensure compatibility with your smartphone model. Additionally, the quality varies wildly from lens to lens – this is something that I have plenty of experience with! – so it&#39;s wise to read reviews and maybe even test out a few options before investing.</p><h3 data-section id="portable-lighting"> Portable lighting</h3><p> While professional photographers often love to use studio lighting, even serious iPhone and Android photographers tend to shy away from most forms of artificial light. It cuts down on portability, and it generally doesn&#39;t look that great.</p><p> That said, portable lighting solutions are sometimes useful for smartphone portrait and smartphone product photography; in particular, they can significantly improve lighting for indoor or low-light shots.</p><p> If you need an artificial light boost, consider LED ring lights or small portable LED panels. Some even come with adjustable color temperature for creative control. These tools can help you manage shadows and highlights in a way that helps you craft the mood you want to create, and they&#39;re designed to be ultra-lightweight and compact.</p><h2 data-section id="tips-to-level-up-your-smartphone-photos"> 15 tips to level up your smartphone photos</h2><p> Now let&#39;s take a look at the tips, tricks, and techniques you can use to capture beautiful photos using your smartphone, starting with:</p><h3 data-section id="clean-your-lens"> 1. Clean your lens</h3><p> This tip is extremely basic, but you will be <em>amazed</em> by the dirt and grime that accumulate on your smartphone lens. (When I reach for my phone, I often find lots of smudges and dirt caused by my kids, my pockets, the environment, and more.)</p><p> So do yourself a favor and get in the habit of quickly wiping your phone lens before beginning a photoshoot. It&#39;ll make your photos look so much sharper!</p><p> Note that you&#39;ll want to pay especially close attention to your smartphone camera lens during bad weather; if you&#39;re photographing in the rain, for instance, a single drop of water can turn the whole shot blurry. Make sure you wipe that lens clean at least every few minutes!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-173318" style="width:450px"><span class="space" style="width:450px; padding-top:133.33%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="450" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-8.jpg?resize=450%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="智能手机摄影技巧" class="wp-image-173318" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-8.jpg?resize=450%2C600&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-8.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-8.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-8.jpg?resize=717%2C956&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-8.jpg?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="tap-the-screen-to-set-focus"> 2. Tap the screen to set focus</h3><p> Typically, when you point your smartphone at a subject, the camera will guess what you want to photograph. For instance, if it recognizes faces, it&#39;ll focus on the faces; if it recognizes a person, it&#39;ll focus on the person.</p><p> This method of autofocusing can work well, especially if you&#39;re photographing a clear scene with an obvious main subject. But when the scene is more complex – you&#39;re photographing a bird surrounded by trees, for example – your smartphone may get the focusing wrong, and the shot will turn out blurry.</p><p> So what do you do?</p><p> Instead of letting your smartphone&#39;s algorithms determine your point of focus, simply tap on your subject, and then – voila! – you&#39;ll get a sharp result.</p><p> Note: If you want extremely fine control over your smartphone&#39;s focusing – such as when you&#39;re doing close-up photography – there are a variety of camera apps that allow you to focus manually so that you can rack the plane of focus back and forth until you get the results you&#39;re after!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-173319" style="width:450px"><span class="space" style="width:450px; padding-top:133.33%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="450" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-4.jpg?resize=450%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="智能手机摄影技巧" class="wp-image-173319" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-4.jpg?resize=450%2C600&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-4.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-4.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-4.jpg?resize=717%2C956&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-4.jpg?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="dont-use-flash"> 3. Don&#39;t use flash</h3><p> Your smartphone camera has a flash, but it really, <em>really</em> sucks! Sorry – there simply isn&#39;t a way to sugarcoat it: The flash on your phone camera is not flattering for photos, whether you&#39;re shooting in the daytime, late at night, <a aria-label="landscapes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/smartphone-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">landscapes</a> , flowers, or portraits.</p><p> So whenever you&#39;re shooting, keep that flash <em>off</em> . Instead, use natural light for great results. For instance, shoot in the early morning or the late evening to get <a aria-label="beautiful golden lighting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-photograph-golden-hour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">beautiful golden lighting</a> , or work on cloudy days for soft, evenly lit images.</p><p> And if you desperately need extra light, invest in lighting accessories designed for smartphones, such as an LED ring light.</p><h3 data-section id="discreetly-take-photos-by-pressing-the-volume-buttons"> 4. Discreetly take photos by pressing the volume buttons</h3><p> Sometimes, the perfect shot requires a touch of subtlety – such as when you notice a beautiful scene while out walking, or if you&#39;re watching your kids do something especially cute. In such instances, using the volume button to take photos is a great way to capture the image without disturbing the subjects or making them feel self-conscious.</p><p> How does this work? Some smartphones automatically set the volume buttons as an alternative shutter control, while others don&#39;t default to this option but do let you set it up on your own (this process is simple and usually involves togging an item in the camera settings). Then, with your smartphone set, you can discreetly raise your camera and nudge a volume button upward or downward.</p><p> Remember, the key here is to use this technique with care and ethics. The goal isn&#39;t to make your subjects feel uncomfortable!</p><h3 data-section id="manually-set-the-image-brightness"> 5. Manually set the image brightness</h3><p> Did you know that you can set image brightness (ie, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="image exposure (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">image exposure</a> ) manually?</p><p> It&#39;s true, and you can use this function to control the level of detail that will appear in the final photo.</p><p> The details depend on your specific smartphone model, but try tapping on the screen, then look for some sort of exposure symbol (such as a sun). Swipe up (or drag the corresponding slider) to brighten the exposure, and swipe down (or drag the corresponding slider) to darken it.</p><p> Note that the general goal is to keep as much detail as possible in the final image. However, you can also deliberately brighten or darken an image for creative effect, like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-173321" style="width:450px"><span class="space" style="width:450px; padding-top:133.33%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="450" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-2.jpg?resize=450%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="智能手机摄影技巧" class="wp-image-173321" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-2.jpg?resize=450%2C600&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-2.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-2.jpg?resize=717%2C956&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-2.jpg?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="make-sure-your-smartphones-hdr-function-is-on"> 6. Make sure your smartphone&#39;s HDR function is on</h3><p> HDR is a handy feature found in most smartphones today, and you might be surprised to learn how much it can enhance your photos. It stands for <em>high dynamic range</em> , and its primary purpose is to bring out the details in the shadows and highlights. It works by taking multiple shots at different exposures and then merging them together to create a balanced image.</p><p> Most modern phones offer some sort of HDR option, which can often be toggled on and off in your phone&#39;s settings. (It&#39;s usually tucked away in the camera app settings.)</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255282" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-105.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="智能手机摄影" class="wp-image-255282" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-105.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-105.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-105.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-105.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-105.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-105.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> What&#39;s important is that you make sure HDR is active when you&#39;re photographing scenes with significant contrast between bright and dark areas. It&#39;s especially useful for landscapes where the sky is bright but the land is shrouded in shadow, or for subjects that are lit from behind. As long as it&#39;s enabled, HDR will work its magic to even out those contrasts and make the image look more like how your eyes see it.</p><p> On the other hand, there are times when you might want to turn HDR off, such as when you&#39;re aiming for a more dramatic or moody effect. It&#39;s good to know how to control the feature so you can make a choice that fits your creative vision.</p><h3 data-section id="compose-your-photos-creatively"> 7.

And if you were photographing a group of forks, you&#39;d want to include three, five, seven, or nine.合理？</p><p> As with the rule of thirds, the rule of odds isn&#39;t actually a rule.

This is great for individual or couple photos and can give a professional touch, similar to what you could achieve with a high-end camera.</p><p> Night mode is another powerful feature. If you&#39;ve ever tried to take a photo in low light, you know how difficult it can be, but Night mode takes several images and blends them together for a clear and bright shot.</p><p> And then there&#39;s Panorama. Want to capture a breathtaking landscape? Panorama mode lets you take a series of photos and stitch them together into one wide image.</p><p> You don&#39;t need to be a technical whiz to use these modes. Just find them in your camera app, select the one that fits your scene, and shoot. Over time, you&#39;ll get a feel for when to use each mode, but experimenting is the best way to learn!</p><p> So don&#39;t hesitate to try these modes and see what works best for you. The more you play with them, the more you&#39;ll understand what they can do. That&#39;s the first step in becoming a more skilled and confident smartphone photographer.</p><h3 data-section id="straighten-the-horizon"> 10. Straighten the horizon</h3><p> A common beginner smartphone photography mistake is a crooked horizon. After all, it&#39;s so easy to accidentally tilt your phone when shooting!</p><p> Unfortunately, crooked horizons are a major problem, and unless you know how to handle them (either in the field or in post-processing), you&#39;ll be stuck with a set of bad photos.</p><p> Fortunately, dealing with crooked horizons isn&#39;t difficult. Simply take a moment to turn on your camera grid; this will display a set of lines across the screen, which you can then use to level your horizons in the field.</p><p> You can also handle crooked horizons in post-processing. Most editing apps include some sort of straightening option, though you will lose pixels in the process, so it&#39;s always best to get it right in the field!</p><h3 data-section id="use-leading-lines"> 11. Use leading lines</h3><p> <a aria-label="Leading lines (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-leading-lines-for-better-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Leading lines</a> are lines that lead the viewer into the frame and draw attention to the main subject. And these lines, if used correctly, are insanely powerful.</p><p> When you&#39;re shooting with your smartphone, look around for roads, buildings, or even furniture that can help lead the eye to the subject. Technically, a leading line can be pretty much anything, from outstretched arms and tree branches to road signs and buildings, so even if you can&#39;t see any obvious lines, I encourage you to keep looking!</p><p> Once you find a leading line, adjust your position so that it points to the main subject. Your composition will instantly improve! Here, I used the row of chairs to direct the viewer toward the building in the background:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-173322" style="width:450px"><span class="space" style="width:450px; padding-top:133.33%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="450" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-5.jpg?resize=450%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="智能手机摄影技巧" class="wp-image-173322" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-5.jpg?resize=450%2C600&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-5.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-5.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-5.jpg?resize=717%2C956&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-5.jpg?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="photograph-in-natural-light"> 12. Photograph in natural light</h3><p> Earlier in the article, I mentioned the value of natural light, but it&#39;s so important that it deserves its own section. You see, there is something so <em>pure</em> and <em>clean</em> about photographing in natural light. It looks great, it produces beautiful photos, and it&#39;s always available.</p><p> I love morning and evening light because of its golden hues and soft, flattering effect. Overcast light is nice, too. And even high-contrast light produced by the harsh sun can look amazing (especially in black and white).</p><p> If you shoot in heavy shade or at night, you can still use natural light, but you&#39;ll need to use a tripod to prevent image blur. (Fortunately, there are plenty of high-quality yet relatively cheap smartphone tripods to choose from!)</p><p> This next image, of a foggy morning out on Lake Michigan, shows the beauty of soft natural light:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-173324" style="width:450px"><span class="space" style="width:450px; padding-top:133.33%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="450" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-1.jpg?resize=450%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="智能手机摄影技巧" class="wp-image-173324" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-1.jpg?resize=450%2C600&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-1.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-1.jpg?resize=717%2C956&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karthika-Gupta-10-tips-to-improve-mobile-photography-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="try-not-to-zoom"> 13. Try not to zoom</h3><p> Unless your smartphone offers a proper telephoto camera, I recommend you do as little zooming as possible.</p><p> You see, most zoom functions use <em>digital</em> zoom, which simply crops the image to magnify the subject. In other words, it doesn&#39;t actually get you closer to the subject; instead, it just removes pixels. Recently, smartphone manufacturers have developed algorithms that allow for slightly better results when zooming digitally, but it&#39;s still always better to get close to your subjects instead of relying on your device&#39;s digital zoom capabilities.</p><p> If you own a smartphone with a zoom capability, and you&#39;re not sure whether the images are simply cropped or whether the device boasts a genuine telephoto lens, go ahead and read the specifications sheet (you can find this on the manufacturer&#39;s website). In general, this should clear things up, and you can determine the best approach for photographing distant subjects.</p><h3 data-section id="consider-using-a-sophisticated-camera-app"> 14. Consider using a sophisticated camera app</h3><p> I know that you might be comfortable with the built-in camera app on your smartphone. But as you grow in your photography skills, you&#39;ll find that more sophisticated camera apps can provide you with greater control and creativity.</p><p> Many advanced camera apps offer manual controls. Imagine being able to adjust the shutter speed, ISO, and white balance, just like professional photographers do with their DSLRs. And as I mentioned in a previous tip, some of these apps let you focus manually to pinpoint <em>exactly</em> where you want the sharpest details in your image.</p><p> Some apps also allow for a more artistic shooting process. They&#39;ll apply filters to your camera feed in advance so you can see the world in high-contrast black and white, intense grunge, monochromatic blue, and much more. If you&#39;re in a creative rut, trying such an app can certainly help you out.</p><p> Note that camera apps like Adobe Lightroom Mobile and ProCam offer significant manual capabilities and are generally user-friendly, so don&#39;t be afraid to experiment with them and see what you think.</p><h3 data-section id="process-your-images-using-an-editing-app"> 15.

Most smartphones come with a range of easy-to-use editing apps that can help you enhance your pictures.</p><p> I&#39;d recommend starting with the basics: Crop your photo to improve the composition, then adjust brightness and contrast to make the image pop. You might also tweak the white balance or add a bit of sharpening. Don&#39;t be afraid to play around with these settings. Often, a little tweak here and there can make a world of difference.</p><p> Many of these apps also offer filters and presets. These are ready-made settings that apply a particular look to your image with just a single tap. They can be a fun way to explore different styles, but be sure to use them judiciously. Sometimes, less is more.</p><p> If you want to dive a little deeper, some apps allow more advanced editing like layering and blending. You might find these options a bit more challenging if you&#39;re new to editing, but don&#39;t be discouraged. There are plenty of tutorials online that can guide you through the process.</p><p> What&#39;s vital here is to maintain the <em>quality</em> of your image during editing. If the app doesn&#39;t offer non-destructive processing, always work on a copy of the photo rather than the original file, and be cautious not to over-edit. Subtlety often works best.</p><p> Editing isn&#39;t about changing what you captured; it&#39;s about enhancing it. Think of it as the final touch that brings your photo to life. And most importantly, have fun with it! Experimenting with different techniques can be an enjoyable and rewarding part of the photographic process.</p><h2 data-section id="how-to-take-amazing-smartphone-photos-final-words"> How to take amazing smartphone photos: final words</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255286" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-104.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="智能手机摄影" class="wp-image-255286" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-104.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-104.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-104.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-104.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-104.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/smartphone-photography-104.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> With a bit of practice, you can capture amazing smartphone photos of landscapes, people, and so much more – even if you&#39;re an absolute beginner.</p><p> Keep in mind that photographing with a smartphone should be <em>simple</em> .

While some horses may be exceedingly gentle, others can be unpredictable or even aggressive. A single kick from a horse can cause serious injuries, so caution is essential.</p><p> Never stand behind a horse or catch them by surprise. Sudden movements or even wearing bright colors can startle them. It&#39;s essential to be aware of the horse&#39;s presence and ensure they know where you are.</p><p> Before diving into the photography session, have a chat with the owner or handler about the horse&#39;s personality. Is the horse flighty or bitey? Have they ever seen a camera before? Understanding these aspects can help you approach with caution.</p><p> Flash photography is generally a no-no around horses unless you&#39;re sure they are used to it. A flash could endanger not just you but also the horse and the handler. I advise avoiding it as much as possible.</p><h2 data-section id="learn-the-horses-language"> 2.

This language is understood by horse owners and trainers, but it might be new to you. Spend some time researching horse body language before your first shoot. You&#39;ll want to understand how the horse is feeling to predict their behavior and avoid danger.</p><p> Horse owners often prefer certain positioning of ears, legs, and heads. For example, pinned-back ears signify an unhappy horse, while relaxed, forward ears can mean the horse is content. Understanding this language will not only keep you safe but also ensure you capture shots that the owners will love.</p><p> If you&#39;re familiar with this equine language, you&#39;ll have a better sense of what the owners want, and your photo shoot will be more successful.

It requires a delicate approach. When you first meet the horse, it&#39;s essential to create a calm environment.</p><p> Let the handler introduce you if the horse is calm enough. Allow the horse to approach you, sniff the camera, and become familiar with your presence. Talk softly and move slowly; a gentle pat might be welcomed if the handler deems it appropriate.</p><p> Are you unsure how the horse will react to the sounds of your camera? Organize a few test shots with the handler. Ensuring that everyone is in a safe position during these test shots is vital. If the horse reacts negatively, a sudden buck or kick can be dangerous.</p><p> If your camera has a silent shooting mode, this is a great time to use it. But remember, “silent” doesn&#39;t always mean entirely noiseless. Test it out to gauge the horse&#39;s reaction.</p><h2 data-section id="choose-the-right-lens-for-horse-photography"> 4.

It can be influenced by various factors, including the horse&#39;s temperament and the type of shots you&#39;re aiming for.</p><p> If you&#39;re doing a portrait session and the horse is comfortable with you getting close, a wide-to-standard zoom lens, like a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/every-photographer-needs-24-70mm-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="24-70mm (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">24-70mm</a> with a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="maximum aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">maximum aperture</a> of f/2.8, can be a great choice. With it, you can capture wide-angle shots or zoom in for tighter images.</p><p> A 50mm or 85mm prime lens is also a fantastic option. These lenses often offer quality at an affordable price, with a wide aperture like f/1.8 for <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" aria-label="beautiful background blur (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">beautiful background blur</a> .</p><p> When photographing from the sidelines or with a skittish horse, a longer telephoto lens is a must. A 70-200mm lens will allow you to capture detailed images from a distance.</p><p> Sometimes, having a good telephoto zoom handy, even with a more approachable horse, can enhance your shots. It allows you to get those close-up details without invading the horse&#39;s personal space.</p><h2 data-section id="dial-in-the-right-horse-photography-settings"> 5.

Modern cameras handle high ISO quite well, but test your camera to know your limits.</p><p> A wide aperture, such as f/2.8 or f/4, can be valuable, especially in low-light conditions. But remember, a wider aperture narrows the window of sharpness.

It&#39;s a combination of understanding the horse&#39;s behavior and using your camera&#39;s capabilities to their fullest potential. It&#39;s not about having the most expensive gear, but about knowing how to use what you have to create stunning images.</p><h2 data-section id="photograph-the-tender-moments"> 6.

Capturing that connection between horse and rider in your lens? Even more so. Every horse owner has a bond with their companion that is unique, personal, and full of emotion. As a photographer, your mission is to capture that bond, that shared love, in a way that transcends the physical frame.</p><p> Take a moment to observe. Notice the horse and its owner, their interactions, their unspoken communication. Look for the soft moments, the shared glances, the loving gestures. It&#39;s in these fleeting moments that the true essence of their relationship lies. Patience is key here, and waiting for these tender moments can often reward you with the most touching and powerful images.</p><p> An integral part of this process involves integrating the rider into your photoshoot. It&#39;s essential for you to keep them engaged, keep them relaxed. Encourage them to interact with their horse naturally, as they would when no one is watching. These candid shots often result in the most authentic images, brimming with raw emotions and moments of connection. Remember, horse lovers are often just as excited to be part of the shoot as they are to have their equine companions photographed.</p><h2 data-section id="dont-forget-about-the-details"> 7.

These can range from the gleaming shine in their coat to the distinct patterns of their markings, the flowing mane, the softness in their eyes, and so much more.</p><p> I always find it useful to have a chat with the owner before I start clicking away. Get to know the horse through their eyes, understand what makes their horse special to them. They might have a fondness for certain features – the curve of the horse&#39;s neck, the unique color of their eyes, the way their mane catches the light. Your job as a photographer is to capture these personal favorites in the best light possible.</p><p> Use your lens wisely for these detail shots. A telephoto lens works great if you want to maintain a safe distance, especially if the horse is a little skittish. However, with a calm and friendly horse, feel free to move closer and use a standard lens. Experiment with varying your aperture to create a range of effects, from an overall sharp image to a focused shot with a beautifully blurred background.</p><h2 data-section id="take-your-time"> 8.

Spend a day, if possible, with the horse and the owner. Get to know them, understand their dynamics, build a rapport. Patience and understanding go a long way in establishing trust, which in turn helps capture the best possible images.</p><p> Observe the horse&#39;s habits, their likes and dislikes. Maybe they love a particular spot in the paddock, or they jump around gleefully after a good run. Keeping these nuances in mind will help you anticipate their actions and be prepared for spontaneous shots.</p><p> Slowing down also allows you to notice the small but significant details of the environment around you – interesting backgrounds, shifting light patterns, shadows, and reflections. All these elements can add depth and context to your photographs, turning a good picture into a great one.</p><p> Don&#39;t rush the process. Horse photography, like all good things in life, takes time. It requires patience, practice, and a keen eye for detail. But rest assured, the results will be worth your effort.</p><h2 data-section id="use-similar-techniques-to-photograph-equine-events"> 9.

Finding a safe spot is crucial, and one where the horse can see you from a distance. Always stay put and never move towards the horse and rider, and remember, using flash is a big no-no. Checking with any officials before you start is also a smart move.</p><p> To capture both horse and rider in mid-jump – a favorite of horse riders – you&#39;ll likely need a shutter speed around 1/650s to 1/800s. By setting your camera to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/burst-mode/" target="_blank" aria-label="continuous release (burst) mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">continuous release (burst) mode</a> , you can press the shutter just as the horse lifts off, increasing your chances of getting the perfect shot.</p><p> Focusing can be tricky, so you&#39;ll need to be extra attentive. Prefocusing in advance where you know the horse will be is an option, but I find using your camera&#39;s AF tracking to follow the horse generally better. It lets you shoot a variety of images as the horse moves in different directions, giving you a range of dynamic shots to choose from.</p><h2 data-section id="work-fast-for-horse-race-photography"> 10.

Horses at top speeds are incredibly fast, so I&#39;d recommend the fastest shutter speed the light will allow. Use your camera&#39;s continuous shooting mode, and don&#39;t hesitate to take hundreds of shots. Among the failures and near-duplicates, you&#39;ll find those magical moments that make it all worth it.</p><p> Getting close to the finish line at smaller race meets can make for breathtaking photos, but you&#39;ll need permission. Assure the officials that you don&#39;t use flash and that you understand how easily horses can be spooked. Your diligence can grant you access to some unique vantage points.</p><p> Here&#39;s a pro tip: try panning shots during the races. It captures the sense of movement and speed, giving your photos an artistic flair. Lower your shutter speed to around 1/30s and move your camera along with your subject as you fire the shutter. If done right, you&#39;ll end up with a sharp horse and rider against a stunning blur of motion in the background.</p><p> This technique might take a few tries to master, but the resulting images can be truly spectacular. Combining both standard and panning shots during horse races can provide you with an exciting and varied portfolio of images, each illustrating a different aspect of the race!</p><h2 data-section id="horse-photography-tips-final-words"> Horse photography tips: final words</h2><p> From understanding a horse&#39;s personality and body language to choosing the right lens and settings, we&#39;ve explored essential tips and techniques so you can capture beautiful images of horses.</p><p> Remember to approach each photo session with care and patience; with some perseverance, you&#39;ll capture plenty of horse photos you can be proud of – whether it&#39;s a tender moment between rider and horse, or the thrilling speed of a race.</p><p> Now it&#39;s your turn to grab a camera and explore the world of equine photography.

It was authored by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/author/jamesmaher/">James Maher</a> .</p><p> I love to do street photography at night.

The pioneering modernist photographer Andre Kertesz captured beautiful nighttime street shots in Paris in the 1920s – and he inspired another skillful Parisian photographer, Brassai, to create breathtaking night street shots in the 1930s.</p><p> Nighttime street photographers don&#39;t have the luxury of strong sunlight, so they&#39;re forced to use a variety of different approaches to compensate. These include technical and equipment-based techniques such as long shutter speeds, high ISOs, flashes, and fast lenses, as well as visual techniques, such as adjusted aesthetics that embrace blur and grain.</p><p> Night street photography tends to be wonderfully atmospheric, and it&#39;s proven itself to be very popular in the 21st century, especially as low-light camera technology continues to improve.</p><h2 data-section id="the-benefits-and-drawbacks-of-photographing-the-streets-at-night"> The benefits and drawbacks of photographing the streets at night</h2><p> Nighttime street photography comes with several major benefits – in other words, there&#39;s a reason for its popularity!</p><p> For one, the streets tend to be emptier at night, allowing you to isolate a subject or two without difficulty – this can make for more powerful minimalistic shots.</p><p> Photographing at nighttime with streetlights also adds a different mood to images, giving a sense of mystery, nostalgia, drama, and even horror, depending on how you approach your shots.</p><p> And budding street photographers – and even more accomplished shooters – sometimes struggle with fear or discomfort when photographing strangers. Working at night, however, lends a sense of distance and anonymity that makes for less anxiety.</p><p> Of course, night street photography comes with several significant challenges. Cameras rely on light to capture sharp, well-exposed images, and nighttime – as you are undoubtedly aware! – doesn&#39;t offer much light. To address this, it&#39;s important to have a real technical mastery of the camera; otherwise, you&#39;ll end up with images that are blurry, grainy, or dark (or a combination of the three).</p><p> And while I do talk about this in greater depth at the end of the article, photographing at night in certain areas can be genuinely dangerous. Obviously, this depends on the location, and it also depends on the approach you take. Below, I offer tips for taking proper safety precautions at night, but it really is important to keep this in mind so you don&#39;t go in unprepared.</p><h2 data-section id="the-best-camera-settings-for-night-street-photos"> The best camera settings for night street photos</h2><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2_st_marks_skateboarder_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-63063" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2_st_marks_skateboarder_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="street night photography person in the snow" class="wp-image-63063" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2_st_marks_skateboarder_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2_st_marks_skateboarder_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2_st_marks_skateboarder_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> 1/125s | f/2.5 | ISO 6400</figcaption></figure></div><p> Capturing sharp street photos is mostly about the shutter speed, so that&#39;s where I&#39;d like to start. To freeze motion during the day, I prefer to use a shutter speed of 1/320s (with 1/160s as my lower threshold). But at night, this changes. In the brightest areas – lit by streetlights or car headlights – you can comfortably photograph at 1/250s, but most of the time, you&#39;ll need to use a shutter speed between 1/160s and 1/60s. Otherwise, you&#39;ll be forced to boost your ISO to ridiculous heights, and you&#39;ll risk ruining your images with noise.</p><p> Note that when your shutter speed is set to 1/60s, you&#39;ll need steady hands. (A lens or camera with image stabilization can help, too!) In fact, to photograph handheld at 1/60s, you need to stop your own motion completely. Fortunately, with some practice, this can be done.</p><p> As for your aperture setting: The wider the aperture, the faster you can make your shutter speed (or the lower you can drop your ISO). It&#39;s possible to shoot at f/4 in brighter areas at night, but if you can shoot at f/2.8, f/2, or even f/1.8, you&#39;ll have a much easier time. In other words, the wider your aperture for night street photography, the better.</p><p> Finally, you&#39;ll need to raise your ISO to 1600, 3200, or even 6400. With modern digital cameras, you can photograph at high ISOs and come away with decent images, and while it&#39;s always best to keep the ISO as low as possible, you just won&#39;t manage to get well-exposed shots at night otherwise. (I personally shoot at ISO 3200, and I sometimes go to ISO 6400 in especially dark areas or when I&#39;m photographing fast-moving subjects.)</p><p> What camera mode should you use? If you&#39;re doing fast-paced shooting in a variety of different lighting scenarios (ie, moving in and out of the street lights), Aperture Priority can work well – just set your camera to your widest aperture and highest tolerable ISO, then let it choose the shutter speed for you. (If the shutter speed drops below 1/60s, then you&#39;ll either need to accept some blurriness or boost that ISO further.)</p><p> And as for your method of focusing: Normally, zone focusing is a great method for street photography, but when using an ultra-wide aperture at night, you&#39;ll end up missing a lot of images. You can try using manual focus to prefocus in a certain area if you can anticipate a shot in advance, but working with continuous AF and one of your camera&#39;s tracking modes might be the better option, depending on your camera&#39;s capability. (If you&#39;re not sure what will work best, try to do some experimentation!)</p><h2 data-section id="essential-gear-for-nighttime-street-photography"> Essential gear for nighttime street photography</h2><p> The best nighttime street photography gear is broadly similar to daytime street photography gear in that you want your equipment to be lightweight, compact, and inconspicuous. That said, there are a few things to keep in mind when purchasing new equipment for those nighttime adventures:</p><h3 data-section id="pick-a-camera-with-good-high-iso-capabilities"> Pick a camera with good high-ISO capabilities</h3><p> Since you&#39;ll often be shooting at ISO 3200, ISO 6400, and even beyond, it&#39;s essential that you use a street photography camera that won&#39;t ruin your shots with an explosion of noise. Consider investing in a compact full-frame camera or a top-notch APS-C model, and try to keep the megapixel count on the lower side, as ultra-high MP cameras tend to actually perform worse when shooting at high ISOs compared to the lower MP siblings (assuming the technology is from the same generation).</p><p> Low-light focusing capabilities are also very handy – many cameras struggle to acquire focus in the dark, while others are high performers in this area. If your camera can&#39;t focus in near darkness, that&#39;s not an absolute dealbreaker – you can focus manually or shoot in the streetlights – but it&#39;ll certainly limit your flexibility.</p><h3 data-section id="pick-a-lens-with-a-wide-maximum-aperture"> Pick a lens with a wide maximum aperture</h3><p> As I mentioned above, you&#39;ll want to make sure you pick a compact lens for shooting the streets at night. But while most daytime street photography is shot at an aperture of around f/8, nighttime is a whole different ball game. You&#39;ll need to widen your lens&#39;s aperture to its maximum, which means that the wider the maximum aperture that&#39;s offered by the lens, the better.</p><p> Therefore, I&#39;d recommend grabbing a lens with a maximum aperture of at least f/2.8 (and f/1.8 or f/1.4 can be even better, assuming the models are still relatively compact).</p><p> It can also help to grab a slightly wider prime than you might be inclined to use otherwise, such as a 35mm, 28mm, or – if you&#39;re interested in a more unique look – 24mm. Wider lenses are less prone to camera shake, and they&#39;re also easier to use at night since the darkness and lack of activity results in fewer distractions throughout a broader scene.</p><p> Of course, you can still use a standard 50mm lens for nighttime street photography – a 50mm f/1.8, for instance, is great in nearly every street-photography scenario – but if you have the opportunity to go wide, I&#39;d recommend at least testing it out!</p><h2 data-section id="tips-for-night-street-photography"> 10 tips for night street photography</h2><p> Now that you understand the best settings and equipment for photographing the streets at night, let&#39;s take a look at a few tips – for both beginners and advanced street shooters – to enhance your results.</p><h3 data-section id="seek-out-light-sources"> 1. Seek out light sources</h3><p> Always pay attention to the main light sources in a scene. This is true no matter where or when you are photographing, but it becomes even more important at night. So instead of hunting for subjects, start by finding a beautiful light source or an area with good lighting, then wait around for something to happen.</p><p> Note that night street photography lighting can be anything: car headlights, streetlights, neon signs, window lighting, or even smartphone light. Simply look for noticeable illumination, then pay careful attention to how these light sources hit potential subjects. Adjust your angle until you get the lighting effect you want, then shoot away!</p><p> When I was <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/street-photographers-guide-new-york-city/" target="_blank" aria-label="photographing the streets of New York City (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">photographing the streets of New York City</a> , I found a beautiful restaurant with bright windows. I used the restaurant lighting to bring out detail in the passersby: </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/3-Noodletown-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-62980" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/3-Noodletown-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=600%2C399&#038;ssl=1" alt="people outside NYC restaurant at night" class="wp-image-62980" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/3-Noodletown-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/3-Noodletown-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/3-Noodletown-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/3-Noodletown-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> 1/60s | f/2.8 | ISO 3200</figcaption></figure></div><h2 data-section id="take-plenty-of-shots"> 2. Take plenty of shots</h2><p> Sometimes, street photographers like to use a more deliberate approach, capturing only a couple of images of each subject. This works fine during the day, especially if you can confidently nail the focus and exposure – but at night, it&#39;s a recipe for a lot of failed images.</p><p> So instead of just taking one or two images of each subject or scene, when you&#39;re out at night, push things a bit. Don&#39;t be afraid to capture 5-10 shots of the same subject, and if you&#39;re willing to sort through all the shots later, you might even consider using your camera&#39;s burst mode to fire off dozens of shots in a few seconds.</p><p> The idea here is to simply maximize your chances of success. The more you shoot, the more likely you are to hit on that moment when your subject is moving slowly enough to stay sharp, even at 1/60s – and the more likely are you to nail the focus even with a razor-thin depth of field.</p><h3 data-section id="photograph-nightlife"> 3. Photograph nightlife</h3><p> Certain parts of the city – such as the business district – can empty out at night; they&#39;ll make for a poor night street photography experience. Other areas, however, will get busier after sunset, and they&#39;ll offer plenty of opportunities.</p><p> So seek out the nightlife and shoot it! You might consider doing some internet searches for bars and clubs in your area, then make sure you head on over as the night begins. Alternatively, if you&#39;re after more formal-looking subjects, go for a walk near some upscale restaurants and see what you can find!</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-62984" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="photographing the nightlife" class="wp-image-62984" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> 1/125s | f/2 | ISO 6400</figcaption></figure></div><p> And don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re restricted to photographing people on the street outside clubs and restaurants. You can capture all sorts of stunning effects by shooting through windows (plus, if you&#39;re feeling a bit nervous about photographing people, the window can act as a barrier and reduce your anxiety).</p><h3 data-section id="alternate-between-getting-close-and-stepping-back"> 4. Alternate between getting close and stepping back</h3><p> I&#39;m a big proponent of Robert Capa&#39;s advice that “if your photos aren&#39;t good enough, you&#39;re not close enough.” However, I often violate this rule at night.</p><p> You see, while I do try to get close to many of my subjects – and I encourage you to do the same – I also try to create compositions where the subjects are small aspects of the overall scene. At night, backgrounds can be much more beautiful than during the day, so it often pays to have people become the secondary element in the scene, rather than the primary focus.</p><p> This approach comes with a technical advantage: When your subjects are off in the distance, you won&#39;t need to use a fast shutter speed to capture their motion. A nearby subject can be frozen at 1/125s or faster; a distant subject can often be photographed at 1/60s and turn out sharp, even if it&#39;s on the move.</p><h3 data-section id="experiment-with-a-tripod-for-creative-effects"> 5. Experiment with a tripod for creative effects</h3><p> When doing street night photography, it&#39;s usually best to go handheld. After all, you never know what interesting things are about to happen, and you want to be able to react fast.</p><p> That said, it can be useful to bring along a tripod, especially if you&#39;re interested in capturing some <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/long-exposure-street-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="long-exposure street photography (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">long-exposure street photography</a> .</p><p> The idea here is to find a busy area, mount your camera on a tripod, then use a slow shutter speed to capture people in motion. You&#39;ll need to experiment with different shutter speeds (1/8s is a good starting point), and you&#39;ll need to shoot a <em>lot</em> of photos, but you&#39;ll eventually end up with some gorgeous motion blur effects:</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/5-lower_east_side_nightlife_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-62987" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/5-lower_east_side_nightlife_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="motion blur night street photography" class="wp-image-62987" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/5-lower_east_side_nightlife_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/5-lower_east_side_nightlife_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/5-lower_east_side_nightlife_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> 1/8s | f/4 | ISO 800 | Tripod</figcaption></figure></div><p> It took me a long time to capture the image displayed above; I wanted the people spread throughout the entire scene, and I also wanted an interesting foreground subject (in the end, I was satisfied by the pose of the woman in the street and the man looking at her).</p><h3 data-section id="try-working-with-a-flash"> 6. Try working with a flash</h3><p> Some street photographers love using a flash, while others hate it. Whether you decide to try flash at night is up to you; on the one hand, it&#39;ll provide extra illumination so you can use a faster shutter speed, a narrower aperture, and a lower ISO. On the other hand, it&#39;ll give a very intense deer-in-the-headlights look, plus it can lead to confrontation (people don&#39;t like being flashed, especially in the dark!).</p><p> Personally, I prefer to work with the constraints of natural light, and I also get uncomfortable flashing strangers in dark settings. But if you feel confident enough to shoot with flash, then by all means, try it and see what you think. It can give a fantastic look when done well.</p><p> Note that you can have the flash do all the work lighting the scene (so that the foreground area turns out lit and the background is completely dark). But you can also set your camera to slightly underexpose the scene, then use the flash to add some fill light to your main subjects in the foreground.</p><h3 data-section id="be-careful-when-boosting-the-exposure"> 7.

And when this happens, you&#39;ll have no choice but to raise the exposure when editing. <em>Just make sure you do it carefully</em> .</p><p> Here&#39;s my recommendation: First, ignore the noise and get the exposure and look correct. If you have to raise the exposure a significant amount, the noise will be terrible, so you&#39;ll need to apply some <a aria-label="noise reduction (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-do-noise-reduction-in-lightroom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">noise reduction</a> .</p><p> There are many excellent noise reduction programs, but I like Lightroom&#39;s built-in noise reduction. If the noise is still bad after applying the noise reduction algorithm, try bringing the image into Photoshop to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tips-blur-filters-photoshop/" target="_blank" aria-label="add a very slight Gaussian blur (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">add a very slight Gaussian blur</a> .</p><p> At that point, I often use Lightroom&#39;s grain settings to add texture back into the photo. The result looks much more pleasing to the eye than extreme digital noise, and it can hide some of the technical deficiencies of underexposed images. The photo will not look perfectly sharp, but it can still be beautiful.</p><h3 data-section id="dont-be-afraid-of-blur-and-imperfection"> 8. Don&#39;t be afraid of blur and imperfection</h3><p> Most street photographers aim to get their photos as sharp as possible. Sharpness certainly isn&#39;t a bad thing – but know that a photo can still look fantastic even if it isn&#39;t incredibly crisp.</p><p> You see, when photographing at night, you don&#39;t need to freeze motion perfectly to get a stunning result. Personally, I hold my day images to a higher standard than my night images. My day images need to look sharp, while my night photos simply need to be interesting and look good, even if they&#39;re a little blurry in places.</p><p> Also, at shutter speeds from around 1/60s to 1/30s, it can be fun to shoot handheld. Your subjects will turn out somewhat sharp, yet there will be a little motion, too. It&#39;s a great way to add a sense of energy to your compositions.</p><h3 data-section id="let-your-night-street-photos-look-dark"> 9.

They should be dark, with deep shadows and areas that are hard to see. When you <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-read-and-use-histograms/" target="_blank" aria-label="look at the histogram (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">look at the histogram</a> of a night image, it should be skewed toward the far left, especially relative to your day images.</p><p> But when you point your camera toward a street scene at night, it&#39;ll often overexpose the photo. The resulting file will look bright and you&#39;ll be able to see plenty of detail, but the scene just won&#39;t feel real. (You&#39;ll also end up with blown-out streetlights and store windows.) In such cases, you&#39;ll want to lower the <a aria-label="exposure compensation (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-exposure-compensation-to-take-control-of-your-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure compensation</a> on your camera slightly or – if you&#39;re shooting in <a aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> – boost the shutter speed, narrow the aperture, or widen the ISO.</p><p> I do think that bright night images <em>can</em> look good. But dark, realistic night images are generally better, so carefully monitor the histogram and don&#39;t be afraid to drop that exposure compensation as needed.</p><h3 data-section id="be-careful"> 10. Be careful</h3><p> Depending on where you live, heading out at night with a camera is not always the safest idea. Travel light, keep your equipment to a minimum, and be careful about where you go. Make sure you pay attention to your surroundings, and if you start to feel uncomfortable, head in the other direction.</p><p> If you&#39;re not sure whether you can safely photograph on the streets at night, do some research. I&#39;d recommend messaging veteran street shooters in the area, though you can also look at general articles and statistics covering city crime rates.</p><p> Use your best judgment regarding who to photograph, and think about bringing a friend along. Don&#39;t stay in one place for too long, and avoid putting down your gear to change lenses. Finally, if you desire greater peace of mind, insure your gear before you head out!</p><h2 data-section id="tips-for-night-street-photography-final-words"> Tips for night street photography: final words</h2><p> Well, there you have it:</p><p> Everything you need to know for stunning night street shots.</p><p> Getting beautiful street photos at night isn&#39;t always easy.

This technique can lead to beautiful washes of color in the foreground, giving the image a dreamy quality.</p><p> The magic of shooting-through can be used with a variety of subjects, from insects to leaves, portraits, and even birds. But I find it most mesmerizing when used in flower photography. You can create a harmonious color palette by simply letting another flower or leaf blur in the foreground.</p><p> Here&#39;s how you do it: set up your macro shot as you normally would, then adjust your angle until there&#39;s a second subject close to the lens. This could be another flower head or a leaf. The key is to use a wider aperture (think f/2.8 to f/5.6) to sufficiently blur out the foreground subject. And remember, it&#39;s okay to experiment! You could position your lens closer or farther from the foreground subject to get the look you want.</p><p> As for focus, manual is the way to go here. This ensures that you have control over focusing on the main subject, rather than the foreground object.</p><h3 data-section id="condensation-on-spider-webs"> 6.

These droplets can act like tiny prisms, refracting light and creating a beautiful spectacle.</p><p> Timing is important for capturing these shots. I find the best time to be early mornings. If you&#39;re planning ahead, look for conditions where there&#39;s been plenty of rain, but the night is clear with limited wind. Fall is often the best time for this kind of photography.</p><p> Look for fields that are home to spiders, where larger webs might be found. Upon discovering a web coated in condensation, get close with your lens. Then, it&#39;s time to play around with your compositions. Consider wider shots that showcase the entire web, or more intimate shots with a softer focus, emphasizing individual threads of web with suspended dewdrops.</p><p> These simple yet unique subjects can offer you a lot of creative freedom, so don&#39;t be afraid to experiment. And remember, sometimes the simplest subjects can produce the most extraordinary images in macro photography.</p><h3 data-section id="backlit-dragonflies"> 7.

Their delicate, winged forms make for stunning macro photography subjects. Particularly when you take your shots against the backdrop of a rising or setting sun. It&#39;s all about capturing that ethereal glow that gives your subject an almost other-worldly appearance.</p><p> Timing can be crucial when shooting dragonflies. Early mornings, in my experience, tend to be the best time as they are less likely to be on the move. That&#39;s not to say you can&#39;t catch great shots in the evening. If you don&#39;t mind slightly wider shots, the evening light can work perfectly for this.</p><p> When it comes to positioning, consider having the sun between your camera and the dragonfly. This will illuminate your subject, adding depth and dimension to your photograph. Getting down low, at the same level as the dragonfly, will frame them clearly against a bright sky.</p><p> You can play around with how you angle yourself relative to the sun and the dragonfly. The sun could be directly behind the dragonfly or you might prefer to leave it out of the frame. There&#39;s no one-size-fits-all solution. It&#39;s all about experimenting with different angles to get the effect you desire.</p><p> I&#39;ve already addressed this elsewhere in the article, but remember: if you&#39;re using a DSLR to shoot into the sun, be careful not to damage your eyes. A good safety measure is to switch to Live View so you can monitor your composition and exposure without looking directly at the sun.</p><h3 data-section id="oil-and-water"> 8.

This is the perfect setup for those days when stepping outside just isn&#39;t in the cards. Whether it&#39;s poor weather or you simply want a change of scene, this technique is a creative way to explore macro photography from the comfort of your home.</p><p> Start by combining oil and water in a clear dish. Lift the dish off the ground using cups placed on either side. This simple setup forms the basis for some truly mesmerizing images. Now, to add a dash of color and texture, position a colorful sheet of paper beneath the suspended dish. Construction paper works well, but don&#39;t hesitate to experiment with different patterns and prints you might have lying around.</p><p> Now, it&#39;s time to set up your camera. With your camera suspended over the dish on a tripod, the goal is to achieve a surface that&#39;s perfectly parallel to the mixture below. This precise alignment helps in capturing all the swirling details of the oil and water mixture. To achieve this, it&#39;s a good idea to switch to Live View and manually focus on the mixture.</p><p> Natural light from a window may be enough, but if you find your camera struggling with exposure or if you&#39;re working in a dimly lit area, it&#39;s time to introduce an artificial light source. A flash or a continuous light, positioned off to the side of the dish, can work wonders here.</p><p> Now, for the fun part! Gently swirl the oil and water mixture and wait for it to settle. The patterns will start to dance and undulate, creating an array of dynamic compositions. Keep your eye out for a particularly compelling design, and once it appears, take your shot!</p><p> Remember, camera shake can turn a dreamy shot into a blurry mess. Using a remote release to trigger your shutter can be a lifesaver. Many cameras offer smartphone connectivity for this purpose, which can be a handy alternative if a remote release isn&#39;t readily available.</p><h3 data-section id="ice-abstracts"> 9.

It&#39;s an art form in its own right, producing beautiful images worthy of hanging on your wall. Even more exciting is the fact that winter, which is often barren of other macro subjects, is the perfect time to indulge in this technique.</p><p> What you&#39;re looking for in this scenario is ice with a pattern of bubbles. As the temperature drops and water starts to freeze, your best bet is to find shallow moving waters, like creeks or streams. I&#39;ve had great luck with these places, but don&#39;t disregard the edges of small pools either.</p><p> Now that you&#39;ve found your perfect ice patch, let&#39;s discuss the setup. Even as someone who loves handheld photography, I must admit, a tripod becomes an invaluable tool in ice abstract photography. Position your camera so the lens is parallel to the ice, close enough to fill the frame with the beautiful bubble patterns.</p><p> Choosing the right aperture is critical. Opt for something around f/8 to ensure a sharp capture of those delicate ice bubbles. This also offers a bit of a safety net if your lens isn&#39;t perfectly parallel to the ice.</p><p> Now comes the time for exploration and creativity. Play around with different compositions. The rule of thirds, the golden ratio, and the rule of odds can offer starting points, but don&#39;t let them limit you. Try out various compositions and see what appeals to you most!</p><h2 data-section id="super-macro-photography"> Super macro photography</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255201" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/macro-photography-1-1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="微距摄影" class="wp-image-255201" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/macro-photography-1-1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/macro-photography-1-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/macro-photography-1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/macro-photography-1-1.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/macro-photography-1-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> While this guide is all about macro photography, it wouldn&#39;t be complete without mentioning its intense sibling – <a aria-label="super macro photography (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/super-macro-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">super macro photography</a> .

Whether you&#39;re strolling down the streets of Paris or trekking the mountains of Nepal, the threat of losing your cherished (and costly) gear to theft is real. And let&#39;s face it: Losing your gear doesn&#39;t just hurt your wallet. A moment of bad luck could throw your entire trip thrown off track – unless you take proper precautions.</p><p> As an experienced globetrotter and shutterbug, I&#39;ve picked up a few tricks along the way to safeguard my gear, and I&#39;m here to share them with you. These tips aren&#39;t some magic shield, but they&#39;re practical, easy to follow, and can significantly lessen the odds of you facing a camera catastrophe. Even better, they&#39;ll provide you with a backup plan in case you do hit a bump in the road.</p><p> Ready to confidently capture the world without constantly worrying about your gear? Let&#39;s dive right in!</p><h2 data-section id="trust-your-instincts"> 1.

I can&#39;t emphasize this enough. It doesn&#39;t matter whether you tend to worry or not; your intuition is your primary defense mechanism, and it&#39;s essential to listen to it.</p><p> Sometimes, your worries might seem overly paranoid, but there could be instances where you&#39;re subconsciously (or consciously) picking up on potential dangers. Do you really want to take that risk when you&#39;re far away from home?</p><p> So if you start feeling uncomfortable or sensing something isn&#39;t right, don&#39;t ignore it.

While I haven&#39;t done this myself, I think it&#39;s an excellent idea in the right circumstances. The key is for the bag to appear worn-in and inconspicuous, not falling apart.</p><p> Additionally, avoid drawing attention to your bag as a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/choosing-right-camera-bag-may-need-one/" target="_blank" aria-label="camera bag (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">camera bag</a> . Opt for an everyday pack that doesn&#39;t scream “Camera!” Thieves often target individuals with flashy new camera bags, making them vulnerable. By using a more general-looking bag (especially one that&#39;s seen better days!) you&#39;re less likely to be a potential target.</p><h2 data-section id="tone-down-your-gear-and-appearance"> 3. Tone down your gear and appearance</h2><p> If you have a new bag that clearly looks like it&#39;s meant for a camera and swapping it out isn&#39;t feasible, try toning it down. Give the bag a slightly worn and dirty look. I understand that it may not be fun to treat your brand-new camera backpack this way, but it can significantly decrease its appeal to potential thieves.</p><p> A pristine new bag sends a message that you may have money and are likely an infrequent traveler, making you a more appealing target. On the other hand, a well-traveled and modest-looking bag lowers the chances of becoming a victim.</p><p> Similarly, consider your appearance and dress accordingly. You don&#39;t need to go to the extremes of buying local clothes or blending in entirely, but at least observe how others dress in the area and make some adjustments. Avoid wearing flashy or luxurious outfits that might attract unnecessary attention. The goal is to be a less enticing target, and making a few simple changes can go a long way!</p><h2 data-section id="always-keep-one-eye-on-your-surroundings"> 4.

While it&#39;s easy to get absorbed in capturing the perfect shot, it&#39;s essential not to get overly distracted, especially in crowded areas. While the chance of someone snatching your camera is slim, it&#39;s better to be cautious and prepared. Thieves might also target your day bag or purse, so stay aware.</p><p> I find it helpful to use the reflection on my camera&#39;s LCD display to check what&#39;s happening behind me. By holding the camera up to my eye and then pulling back slightly, I can pan around while maintaining visual awareness of my surroundings. This simple technique adds an extra layer of safety to my photography experience, and I certainly encourage you to try it for yourself.</p><p> And let&#39;s not forget the obvious: <em>never</em> leave your gear unattended in public spaces, even for a short moment. Avoid placing your backpack outside the bathroom or turning away from your tripod-mounted camera, even if you&#39;re desperate. Those are the actions that can lead to unfortunate outcomes!</p><h2 data-section id="rely-on-the-buddy-system"> 5.

Even if you&#39;re used to solo adventures, a companion can enhance your experience with great company and camaraderie as well as added safety.</p><p> Perfecting a system where one person shoots while the other keeps an eye out takes practice, but it&#39;s highly beneficial in crowded environments and busy city streets. Traveling with non-photography friends can be great too; it reduces arguments about who gets to shoot next!</p><p> Plus, even if both of you plan to photograph non-stop, traveling with a companion offers significant safety advantages, especially for nighttime outings. It&#39;s a smart choice, and if you know of anyone who might want to accompany you on an upcoming trip, consider inviting them along.</p><h2 data-section id="rotate-your-memory-cards"> 6. Rotate your memory cards</h2><p> Modern memory cards boast impressive storage capacities, but you shouldn&#39;t fall for the “bigger is better” trap. Putting all your precious photos on a single card is risky. Instead, swap your memory cards often and distribute them strategically, especially if you&#39;re concerned about theft.</p><p> Also, if you don&#39;t have a backup solution like a laptop or external drive (more on that in the next section!), consider storing some cards in unlikely places. After filling a card with fantastic shots, take the card out and secure it in a well-hidden money belt. Then, when you get back to your room, hide it in a drawer or in your clothing. (Of course, make sure you don&#39;t forget it when you leave!) Don&#39;t worry about your cards getting out of order; your home computer software can sort the images by capture time later.</p><h2 data-section id="make-a-backup-every-night"> 7.

That way, even if something happens to one set of photos, the other will likely remain safe.</p><p> Any standard HDD can work for this, though I&#39;d recommend at least 1 TB of storage as a starting point (you can go larger or smaller based on your trip&#39;s length and shooting habits). Nowadays, spacious drives are affordable and reasonably fast, so they&#39;re perfect for backing up your shots.</p><p> For extra security, consider keeping a second hard drive with another copy of your shots or explore <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/backing-up-your-digital-photos-is-cloud-storage-right-for-you/" target="_blank" aria-label="cloud backup options (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">cloud backup options</a> .

Wear your bag safely</h2><p> Your bag&#39;s position can make a significant difference in ensuring your gear&#39;s safety. In crowded places like markets, consider wearing your camera bag against your stomach rather than on your back. It might look a bit unusual, but it adds an extra layer of security.</p><p> If you&#39;re using a backpack, wear it over both shoulders. Ensure that all compartments are zipped up, and if possible, invest in a bag with zipper locks to deter easy access while you&#39;re on the move.</p><h2 data-section id="take-multiple-cameras-but-only-carry-one"> 9.

Keep the backup gear safely stored in your room and head out with your primary equipment. If the worst happens and your gear is stolen or lost, you can always go back to your accommodations and switch to the backup.</p><p> Plus, having spare equipment not only provides peace of mind but can also save your trip from being ruined by gear mishaps like drops or water damage.</p><h2 data-section id="use-a-safety-net-or-a-hard-case"> 10. Use a safety net or a hard case</h2><p> When you&#39;re out exploring during your travels, it&#39;s natural to worry about the safety of your valuable photography gear left behind in your room. To provide you with peace of mind, there are some essential travel safety devices you can consider.</p><p> One option is a wire mesh safety net offered by companies like PacSafe. These nets are designed to enclose your bag and fasten it to a secure object. You can place your non-essential gear in a smaller bag, add the wire net, and secure it to something solid, though you will need a fixed object for this purpose. While it&#39;s important to note that determined professionals might still be able to break through these nets with the right tools, they&#39;ll certainly serve as a deterrent for opportunistic thieves.</p><p> Another reliable choice is to use a hard case for your gear, such as those made by Pelican Cases. These cases are constructed from tough plastic and come with loops to accommodate standard padlocks or cable locks, allowing you to fasten the case to a solid object.</p><p> These hard cases are water- and dust-proof, and will ensure your gear stays clean and dry during your travels. They&#39;re also particularly handy when you need to check your gear at the airport.</p><p> However, it&#39;s worth noting that hard cases are bulkier than regular backpacks, so carrying them around all day definitely isn&#39;t a good idea (in other words, you&#39;ll want to bring a more portable camera bag, too). Some cases do offer wheels and pull handles to improve ease of use.</p><h2 data-section id="use-a-safe"> 11.

Take advantage of this amenity and store any non-essential gear – though do consider taking a photograph of the items you&#39;re handing over in the presence of a staff member. This is similar to counting and getting a receipt for cash you deposit for safekeeping. If the establishment doesn&#39;t provide a receipt, having the photo will serve as your insurance, confirming what you handed over.</p><p> Additionally, some hotels provide mini-safes in the rooms, which can be quite useful. These mini-safes aren&#39;t big enough to fit an entire gear bag, but they can accommodate items like lenses, memory cards, hard drives, and small laptops, making them a great option for securing your gear during your daily adventures. They can also come in handy at night if you feel your accommodation is located in a less secure area.</p><h2 data-section id="keep-a-record-of-your-gear"> 12. Keep a record of your gear</h2><p> Before embarking on your trip, take the time to create a detailed list of all your photography gear, including the serial and model numbers. Make a couple of copies of this information and store them in a safe place. In the event that your gear is stolen and later recovered, having a list of serial numbers will be crucial for identifying and claiming it as your own. It&#39;s also a good idea to take a picture of your gear before you leave as an additional reference.</p><p> On a related note, if you plan to check your camera bag or case at the airport, consider placing an electronic tag in one of the pockets. Not only can this tag be helpful in case the airline misplaces your bag, but it can also alleviate anxiety when you leave expensive gear behind in your room (you can regularly check the tag&#39;s location when you&#39;re out and about!).</p><h2 data-section id="keep-your-gear-insured"> 13.

It ensures you can focus on capturing beautiful moments without worrying about all the unpleasant what-ifs.</p><h2 data-section id="how-to-keep-your-camera-safe-while-traveling-final-words"> How to keep your camera safe while traveling: final words</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255162" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="998" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/keep-camera-safe-traveling-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C998&#038;ssl=1" alt="Keep your gear safe while traveling" class="wp-image-255162" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/keep-camera-safe-traveling-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/keep-camera-safe-traveling-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/keep-camera-safe-traveling-4.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/keep-camera-safe-traveling-4.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/keep-camera-safe-traveling-4.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/keep-camera-safe-traveling-4.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Keeping your precious gear safe during your travels is of utmost importance, but with a few practical precautions, you can significantly reduce the risk of any unfortunate mishaps.</p><p> Whether you&#39;re jet-setting to far-off lands or exploring local gems, always stay vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Trust your instincts, and if something doesn&#39;t feel right, don&#39;t hesitate before leaving the area. And consider taking out a gear insurance policy. It&#39;ll cost far less than the price of replacement equipment, and it&#39;ll offer greater peace of mind, too.</p><p> Remember, utilizing safety measures like wire mesh safety nets and hard cases can add an extra layer of protection to your equipment, while you can always use the hotel safe or the mini-safe provided in your room to store non-essential gear securely.</p><p> So enjoy your travels, and capture some amazing photos!</p><p> Now over to you:</p><p> <em>How do you plan to keep your gear safe while traveling?

When choosing an app for post-processing, there are five key factors we recommend you consider:</p><h3 data-section id="ease-of-use-and-interface"> Ease of use and interface</h3><p> Photography should be fun, right? That goes for editing, too. It&#39;s crucial that the app you choose has a user-friendly and intuitive interface. If you&#39;re a beginner, this is especially important. There are many simple and enjoyable apps out there, but others can be complicated and convoluted.</p><p> Therefore, if you&#39;re not tech-savvy or don&#39;t have experience with photo editors, we really recommend you pick a simple app that offers a basic design. Some come with helpful tutorial sections or walkthroughs; these are great for beginners as they&#39;ll help you navigate the app and use the tools effectively.</p><p> If you&#39;re an experienced photo editor, a confusing interface might not be such a hindrance, so you may want to focus less on the app interface and more on its advanced features. But remember: Every app is unique. It&#39;s often worth your time to test out different ones.</p><p> Fortunately, most of the apps in this list are free. And even the ones that aren&#39;t free do tend to offer trials or demo versions. So go ahead and get your hands on a few. Take them for a spin. See how comfortable they feel before you make a commitment.</p><h3 data-section id="editing-features"> Editing features</h3><p> Every photo editor is different; each comes with its unique set of features, and it&#39;s important to find one that can do what <em>you</em> want it to.</p><p> Are you a hobbyist or a beginner? Then you might be looking for an app that provides basic editing features, such as cropping, rotating, adjusting brightness, contrast, and saturation. Don&#39;t forget filters, either, which can be great fun to experiment with (and can dramatically increase your editing speed).</p><p> On the flip side, maybe you&#39;re more of an enthusiast or a pro. In that case, you might want more advanced editing features. You&#39;ll want to look for things like layering, text addition, object removal, and masking.</p><p> Also, if you&#39;re looking for an easy-to-use app that&#39;ll speed up your workflow, consider an editing app with AI tools. These apps are designed to automate the editing process and can be a lifesaver if you&#39;re dealing with a lot of photos.</p><p> One more thing: If your main goal is to accomplish one form of precision editing, consider a specialist editing app. Several of the apps on our list focus on specific types of edits, such as perspective correction or object removal – and while they can only make one adjustment, they do an excellent job.</p><h3 data-section id="key-accessories"> Key accessories</h3><p> The core purpose of an editing app is, well, editing. But you shouldn&#39;t forget about the extras. These are the features that go beyond editing but can be useful for photographers and photo editors.</p><p> Some editing apps, for instance, come with built-in cameras. You can use these to shoot and edit all in one place.</p><p> And then there&#39;s image organization. It&#39;s not the most exciting part of photography, but it&#39;s important. Some apps let you organize your image library with tools such as folders, ratings, and keywords.</p><p> Cloud-storage integration can also be a game-changer, especially if you like to edit on multiple devices. This feature ensures that you can do your main editing on your desktop, then switch to your phone or tablet for editing on the go, then to your laptop for editing on the job, and so on.</p><p> And last but not least, let&#39;s discuss exporting and sharing. Some apps let you export in certain handy file formats and share directly to social media platforms, which can be a <em>massive</em> time-saver.</p><p> So when you&#39;re choosing your editing app, remember to consider these additional features. They might not be essential, but they just make your life a lot easier.</p><h3 data-section id="compatibility-and-performance"> Compatibility and performance</h3><p> Most of the best apps for photo editing are available for both iOS and Android devices, but a few are tailored for one type of device. It&#39;s critical to pick an app that&#39;s a match for your smartphone or tablet.</p><p> Before you get too excited about a specific app, take a good look at the versions available. And even if the app does have Android and iPhone versions available, keep in mind the features can differ across platforms. So if you&#39;re checking out reviews, be sure they&#39;re for the version you&#39;re planning to download.</p><p> Lastly, let&#39;s talk about performance. Some apps can be quite demanding, and whether your smartphone or tablet can run it effectively depends on a variety of factors. Checking out the system requirements beforehand will save you from any unexpected crashes and frustration.</p><h3 data-section id="price">价格</h3><p>Photo-editing apps range from absolutely free to relatively expensive, and their pricing models vary, too. Some can be purchased with a one-time payment. Others require a subscription.</p><p> Generally, more expensive apps come with a wider range of features. But don&#39;t think pricier is always better. Some of the apps listed in this article offer top-notch features and cost nothing at all.</p><p> Before making a big purchase, ask yourself if you&#39;re really going to use those advanced features. Maybe a free or less expensive app will do just fine. And don&#39;t forget to check for free trials. It&#39;s always a good idea to test out a paid app before committing to it.</p><h2 id="best-photo-editing-apps-final-words"> The best photo-editing apps: final words</h2><p> In the end, the ideal photo-editing app should be a perfect fit for <em>you</em> . It should feel comfortable to use and have everything you need to achieve your vision. Above all, it should take your photos to the next level!</p><p> So when picking the best app to edit photos, don&#39;t rush. Explore different apps. Take advantage of those free trials. Experiment with various tools. And if you can&#39;t decide, remember that you don&#39;t need to pick just one; you can use two apps, three apps, or more to improve your editing workflow.</p><p> Now over to you:</p><p> <em>Do you like any other photo-editing</em> <em>apps?

But how can you create gorgeous abstract shots of your very own?</p><p> Diving into this photographic genre might seem like a daunting task, and I can understand why: There&#39;s a slew of new concepts and techniques to consider. Remember, abstract photos aren&#39;t just about clicking the shutter; they require a whole new way of seeing and interpreting the world around you.</p><p> That said, don&#39;t worry too much. Sure, beginner abstract snappers have a lot to learn, but that&#39;s what this article is for. Below, I share all the essentials, including practical tips, tricks, techniques, and ideas for amazing abstract shots. I also share plenty of inspirational examples along the way.</p><p> By the time you&#39;re done reading, you&#39;ll know more than how to <em>see</em> like an abstract photographer; you&#39;ll be ready to harness your unique vision to craft images that leave a lasting impression.让我们开始吧！</p><h2 data-section id="what-is-abstract-photography"> What is abstract photography?</h2><p> Abstract photography focuses on the beauty of shapes, colors, patterns, and textures. Unlike most other forms of photography, it doesn&#39;t aim to represent reality in a literal sense; instead, creating abstract photos is all about <em>playing</em> with visual elements to create images that might not be immediately recognizable.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255103" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1002" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-5.jpg?resize=1500%2C1002&#038;ssl=1" alt="抽象摄影" class="wp-image-255103" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-5.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-5.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-5.jpg?resize=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-5.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-5.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-5.jpg?resize=717%2C479&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Think about a close-up shot of rust on an old car. The subject might not be clear right away. But the intricate patterns, the vivid colors, and the unique textures can create a captivating image. It&#39;s the viewer&#39;s job to delve into the picture, to explore and interpret.</p><p> A great way to understand the concept is to study the work of renowned abstract photographers. People like Aaron Siskind, who found abstract forms in everyday life, or Franco Fontana, known for his vivid landscapes turned into color blocks.</p><h2 data-section id="what-makes-abstract-photography-special"> What makes abstract photography special?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255104" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="抽象摄影" class="wp-image-255104" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-4.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-4.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-4.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Abstract photography compels you, the photographer, to see the world differently. It nudges you to spot the extraordinary in the ordinary. A stack of colorful papers might seem mundane. But frame it right, and you&#39;ve got a masterpiece of geometric shapes and striking hues. A few bubbles in front of a colorful poster might seem boring, but – as with the photo above! – by using a macro lens to hone in on the bubbles&#39; shapes, the scene is suddenly far more striking.</p><p> Abstract photography offers the same eye-opening, paradigm-shifting experience to anyone who <em>views</em> abstract images. Because at root, shooting abstracts is about finding compelling visual qualities in anything and everything.</p><p> Additionally, because abstract photos are so decoupled from reality, they have the power to represent and evoke emotions without relying on conventional meanings. An image of swirling colors can communicate feelings of chaos, while a pattern of calming blues might inspire tranquility.</p><p> Finally, abstract photography presents an exciting opportunity: the chance to break free from traditional rules. Forget about straight horizons or centered subjects. Abstract photography urges you to experiment, to push the boundaries. It&#39;s about discovering new ways to create visually appealing images, which in turn nurtures your creativity and artistic growth!</p><h2 data-section id="essential-abstract-photography-techniques"> 8 essential abstract photography techniques</h2><p> Now that you&#39;re familiar with what this genre of photography is all about, I&#39;d like to share a handful of the most popular – and effective – techniques for creating beautiful abstract images.</p><p> You don&#39;t need to master each and every one, but I encourage you to at least <em>try</em> all of your options and see what you think!</p><h3 id="1-move-your-camera-while-you-shoot"> 1.

This technique is known as <a aria-label="intentional camera movement (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-intentional-camera-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">intentional camera movement</a> , or ICM, and it can produce breathtaking results.</p><p> The idea is to set your camera to its <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="Manual (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual</a> or <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/" target="_blank" aria-label="Shutter Priority mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Shutter Priority mode</a> . Then dial in a <em>lengthy</em> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> (often in the area of 1/10s, though you can experiment with longer speeds, too).</p><p> Start moving your camera from side to side or up and down, then hit the shutter button, and keep moving your camera until the image is complete. You&#39;ll get different results depending on the direction of your movement, the length of the shutter speed, and the look of your subject – but pretty much <em>every</em> image created using this technique looks super cool.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255066" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-16.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="抽象摄影" class="wp-image-255066" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-16.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-16.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-16.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-16.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-16.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-16.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> A few pieces of advice:</p><p> First, do your intentional camera movement photography when the light is low. That way, you can keep your shutter speed long enough to capture a beautiful blurry effect.</p><p> Second, lower your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> to its base level (generally ISO 100). That way, you get the longest shutter speed possible.</p><p> Third, if you <em>can&#39;t</em> get a fast-enough shutter speed out in the open, try heading into the shade. You might also add a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/neutral-density-filters-landscape-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="neutral density filter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">neutral density filter</a> over your lens. Here, the quality of the filter isn&#39;t hugely important, as you&#39;ll be aiming for lots of blur anyway – so feel free to grab a cheap ND filter off of Amazon or eBay.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255067" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-18.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="抽象摄影" class="wp-image-255067" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-18.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-18.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-18.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-18.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-18.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-18.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Fourth, look for colorful subjects that will stand out, even when blurred. Flowers are great for ICM photography, as are leaves in the fall, water at sunset, iridescent rocks, and more.</p><p> Finally, experiment wildly. Be sure to take various shots while moving your camera in different directions. Then start moving your camera in circles or random wiggles. Over time, you&#39;ll get better at predicting the outcome, though intentional camera movement photography is <em>always</em> a bit of an adventure.</p><h3 id="2-photograph-moving-subjects"> 2.

But make sure to use your lens at its widest aperture, and ensure that the “shoot-through” item is sufficiently close to the lens.

It&#39;s a great way to achieve that gorgeous soft-focus abstract effect so many photographers love.</p><p> Note: When I say “wide aperture,” I&#39;m talking about dialing in settings like f/1.8 or f/2.8. Such wide apertures will create a shallow depth of field, and everything outside your main focus point will be blurred, like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255084" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-13.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="抽象摄影" class="wp-image-255084" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-13.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-13.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-13.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-13.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-13.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-13.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> And here&#39;s the best part: With a wide aperture, you can isolate specific elements in your frame.

It&#39;s a little unusual, but it can yield incredible results.</p><p> Freelensing involves detaching the lens from your camera, holding it in front of the lens mount, and slightly tilting it as you take photos. The magic of this technique lies in its ability to create a tilt-shift effect – in other words, when you tilt the lens, it adjusts the plane of focus.</p><p> This allows you to selectively keep a particular area sharp while the rest of the image remains blurred. And when you&#39;re going for a unique look, this can be a wonderful tool – because by selectively focusing, you can present your subjects in a fresh, unexpected way.</p><p> And the power of freelensing goes even further. By pulling the lens away from the camera mount, you can actually <em>magnify</em> your subject to show all sorts of minute details (just as if you were using a dedicated macro lens!). And tilting the lens back and forth will result in artistic light bleed effects, too, which can be lots of fun to play with.</p><p> Now, freelensing is an outstanding way to portray everyday subjects in a new light and even add a touch of surprise to your photography. It&#39;s a technique I&#39;ve used myself, and it&#39;s one that I wholeheartedly recommend.</p><p> However, when freelensing, you should always proceed with caution. Your lens will be detached from your camera body, and as a result, your camera sensor can be exposed to dust and other potential hazards. So always make sure you&#39;re working in a clean environment – it&#39;s not a technique you should try in a blowing sandstorm, for instance – and whatever you do, <em>don&#39;t drop your lens</em> !</p><h2 data-section id="tips-for-beautiful-abstract-photos"> 6 tips for beautiful abstract photos</h2><p> Looking for additional abstract photo tips?

Try getting low, looking up, and exploring close-ups. In abstract photography, daring experimentation is more rewarding than conventional shooting.</p><p> Additionally, when you frame each shot, consider compositional elements like leading lines, symmetry, and patterns. These elements can lend balance to the scene, and/or they can help draw the viewer&#39;s eye across the image, creating a sense of movement.</p><p> At the same time, abstract photography isn&#39;t chained to reality, and it shouldn&#39;t be chained to rigid photographic rules, either. You&#39;re free to push boundaries, so go ahead and try something different. You&#39;re likely familiar with the rule of thirds; it&#39;s a popular guideline in photography. But while it can work well for abstract shooting, you can also get great results by consciously going against the grain. Try centering your subject or framing it way off to the side. Such bold compositions can make viewers sit up and take notice!</p><h3 data-section id="constantly-think-about-color"> 2.

It can attract attention, set a mood, or evoke strong emotions. And because abstract photography involves emphasizing the essential visual qualities of a subject over its “real-world” form, the importance of color becomes magnified.</p><p> For abstract shooters, this can be a <em>huge</em> opportunity. You can create striking images just by selectively incorporating colors into your compositions.</p><p> Ever notice how vibrant or contrasting colors can draw the eye? A bold red against a muted background can create a dramatic impact. On the other hand, contrasting colors can add depth, guiding the viewer&#39;s gaze through your photograph. Experiment with color combinations. You never know what might resonate with you.</p><p> Plus, working with a consistent color palette can tie a series of abstract images together, allowing you to create a more cohesive portfolio that you can share on a website or social media. Not every image in the series has to use the exact same colors, but if all the colors complement each other in some way, your series will have a harmonious feel. Try using different shades of the same color, or work with a similar mood, like calming pastels or bold hues.</p><p> And if you&#39;re into artificially lit photography, don&#39;t forget about color gels or filters. They can transform a simple scene into something surreal and artistic. A blue filter can give an ethereal quality, while a red filter can add a sense of drama.</p><h3 data-section id="try-to-convey-emotion-through-your-photos"> 3.

For the best abstract shots, I encourage you to make a real effort to share your feelings through your images.</p><p> Start by asking yourself how <em>you&#39;re</em> feeling as you unpack your camera. Then consider the emotion you want your viewers to feel. Is it peace, excitement, mystery, or nostalgia? Once you&#39;ve decided, consider how form, color, and texture can express this feeling.</p><p> Soft curves and muted colors might create a calming mood. On the other hand, jagged lines and bold, contrasting colors could create tension. A dark, shadowy image could hint at mystery or fear, while a bright, vibrant image might evoke joy or surprise. Keep experimenting to find what works for you.</p><p> In the end, it&#39;s your emotions and intentions that shape how viewers interpret your images. As an abstract photographer, you&#39;re not just snapping pictures. You&#39;re creating a visual language that expresses your unique perspective. Don&#39;t be afraid to infuse your work with your feelings. That emotional connection is often what makes abstract photography so intriguing and engaging.</p><h3 data-section id="simplify-simplify-simplify"> 4.

When you&#39;re setting up your shot, keep in mind that any unnecessary elements in your frame might pull the viewer&#39;s attention away. It&#39;s like a room full of clutter – too much stuff, and you can&#39;t appreciate the beauty of the space.</p><p> So what&#39;s the fix?这很简单。 Examine your frame. Look for anything that doesn&#39;t add to the story or mood you&#39;re trying to convey. If an element isn&#39;t contributing, it&#39;s likely detracting. Change your angle, adjust your frame, move closer – do whatever it takes to remove those distractions.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255082" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-19.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Essential Abstract Photography: A Guide (+ Tips)" class="wp-image-255082" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-19.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-19.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-19.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-19.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-19.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/abstract-photography-19.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Minimalism is your friend here. By keeping your images bare-bones, each line, shape, and color will play a crucial role. As you embrace this approach, you&#39;ll find your images gain a certain power. The compositions will resonate with viewers and leave a lasting impression.</p><p> On a related note, always think about negative space as you shoot. This is the empty or “quiet” space around your main subject. It might sound simple, but it shouldn&#39;t be underestimated. In fact, careful use of negative space can really emphasize the importance of your subject. Think of negative space as a sort of stage – it&#39;s there to put your main character in the spotlight. The more negative space you have, the more your subject will stand out, and the more the audience will pay attention to what you want them to see.</p><h3 data-section id="look-at-the-work-of-other-abstract-photographers"> 5.

Established abstract photographers have a lot to teach you; looking at their images can provide you with fresh inspiration, expose you to different styles, and ignite your creativity.</p><p> Don&#39;t just glance at the photos, though. Immerse yourself in them. What feelings do they evoke and why? Are there patterns or recurring themes? Take your time to digest the details. You&#39;re not just enjoying the view; you&#39;re unraveling the photographer&#39;s creative process.</p><p> Don&#39;t be afraid to venture outside your comfort zone. Explore work from photographers with different styles. Even if it doesn&#39;t align with your taste, you can still learn something valuable. You might just pick up a technique or idea you hadn&#39;t considered before.</p><p> Remember, this isn&#39;t about copying someone else&#39;s work. It&#39;s about expanding your photographic vocabulary. It&#39;s about drawing inspiration and incorporating it into your unique style. In fact, as you expose yourself to the creative approaches of others, you&#39;ll find your <em>own</em> vision and voice growing.</p><h3 id="6-have-fun-with-post-processing"> 6.

Instead of thinking about overprocessing, look at abstract editing as a time to cast off your processing restraints and have fun.</p><p> For instance, try softening your images to make them more ethereal (by adding Gaussian blur or negative Clarity):</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-103267" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px;

Instead, it&#39;s about turning the lens onto the world in a way that lets you show the viewer your unique perspective. It&#39;s an invitation to play, to experiment, to examine the visual qualities of the world.</p><p> Those are a few of the many reasons it&#39;s a ton of fun!</p><p> So grab your camera, step out, and let the world be your canvas. The essence of abstract photography lies not in the rules, but in the <em>breaking</em> of rules. Remember the tips and techniques I shared, and with persistence, your photos will turn out amazing.</p><p> Now over to you:</p><p> <em>Which subjects do you plan to photograph first?
