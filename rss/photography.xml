美元，但它们可以让您对图像进行极大的控制，并且在棘手的情况下它们的价值是无价的。</p><p>因此，要掌握灰卡摄影，请继续阅读！ </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-is-a-gray-card-in-photography">摄影中的灰卡是什么？</h2><p>灰卡顾名思义：一张灰色的卡。更具体地说，灰卡一般是中灰，即18%灰。它们往往体积小、便于携带、重量轻，并且在必要时很容易从相机包中取出。</p><p>某些类型的摄影师从不使用灰卡进行拍摄，例如街头摄影师、野生动物摄影师和（大多数）风景摄影师。但其他摄影师，包括<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-ways-to-take-stunning-portraits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">肖像摄影师</a>和<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/product-photography-tips-to-improve-your-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">产品摄影师</a>，很少会在没有随身携带的情况下离开家。为什么？我将在下一节中解释这一点： </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="why-are-gray-cards-important">为什么灰卡很重要？</h2><p>还记得我说过灰卡是中灰，也称为<em>18% 灰</em>吗？</p><p>这个数字很重要，因为 18% 灰度是<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understand-camera-light-meter-desired-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">相机测光表</a>在确定场景的正确曝光时尝试计算的值。如果您将灰卡放在拍摄对象前面并进行测光，无论场景中存在任何色调对比，您都将获得平衡的曝光。</p><p>现在，您可能想知道：我相机的测光表怎么样？为什么我不能依靠<em>它</em>来获得良好的曝光？</p><p>相机测光表非常非常好，但它们也会犯错误，尤其是在面对显着的色调对比度以及自然非常亮（例如暴风雪）或非常暗（例如黑色岩石）的场景时。</p><p>由于食物上的明亮亮点和桌子的深色木头，下面的场景对于相机仪表来说是一个棘手的场景：</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-94667" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img

data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>灰卡还有第二个重要用途：</p><p>它们为<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/introduction-to-white-balance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">白平衡</a>计算提供了完全中性的表面。与场景中的大多数颜色（蓝色、黄色、绿色等）不同，灰卡没有自然温度或色调。因此，通过在灰卡上训练您的相机，您可以为您拍摄的所有内容设置完美的白平衡。当您需要忠实地重新创建图像中的颜色（无论是用于商业目的还是科学/记录镜头）时，这一点尤其重要。</p><p>尽管相机的基本白平衡设置可能相当不错，但有时确实会遇到困难。例如，钨灯泡的<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/colour-temperature-scale-visualised/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">色温</a>变化很大，具体取决于其质量和功率输出。这可能会导致相机上的钨丝灯设置无法准确呈现颜色，因此需要中性灰卡。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="do-you-need-a-gray-card">您需要灰卡吗？</h2><p>灰卡很有用，但它们并不适用于所有类型的摄影。其一，如果拍摄对象在移动，那么灰卡计算基本上毫无价值；过了一会儿，场景就会改变，你需要再读一遍，再读一遍，再读一遍，这有点烦人。想象一下一位街头摄影师，他在拍摄移动中的物体时从阴影到阳光来回走动。灰卡毫无用处，因为曝光和白平衡需要随时重新校准。</p><p>此外，只有当您的拍摄对象和灰卡被相同的光线照亮时，灰卡才起作用。然而，在某些类型的摄影中——例如鸟类摄影和体育摄影——拍摄对象可能距离很远。这就是为什么鸟类摄影师和体育摄影师几乎从不使用灰卡；考虑到与拍摄对象的距离，这确实没有意义！</p><p>另一方面，灰卡非常适合受控拍摄场景。如果您要拍摄食物、产品或肖像，那么灰卡会非常有用。您可以靠近拍摄对象，读取灰卡读数，并在整个拍摄过程中依靠它。另外，在这些情况下通常需要灰卡，因为您必须准确地表示产品和食品的颜色。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-use-a-gray-card-for-perfect-exposures">如何使用灰卡获得完美曝光</h2><p>灰卡是最接近灵丹妙药的东西。它几乎在任何情况下都能提供近乎完美的曝光。那么它是怎样工作的？</p><p>首先，将相机设置为<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/fine-tune-your-exposures-with-spot-metering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">点测光模式</a>，这会告诉相机对画面中央的一个小点进行测光。虽然这不是绝对必要的，但它会很有帮助，特别是在您无法用灰卡填充整个框架的情况下。</p><p>接下来，将灰卡放入场景中，位于画面的正中央。将相机切换到<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">手动模式</a>并设置曝光（根据相机的测光表读数）。</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure

id="metering-with-a-gray-card-quick-tips">使用灰卡计量：快速提示</h3><p>以下是一些使灰卡计量过程更容易、更准确的提示：</p><p>首先，测光后，确保拍摄对象相对于光源保持相似的位置。例如，如果您在户外拍摄头像并且阳光从正面照亮拍摄对象，请确保拍摄对象保持前光。如果您将拍摄对象转向一侧、完全转身或进入阴影，这将影响您的曝光，并且您将需要再次读取灰卡。</p><p>抄表时，尽可能用灰卡填满框架。这将确保您的仪表仅暴露卡片，<em>而不</em>暴露边缘周围的任何东西。

拍摄旅游照片</h2><p>如果你用谷歌搜索任何著名的地标或地点，你会看到数千张图片——其中许多图片一遍又一遍地具有相同的<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/travel-photography-composition-tips/" target="_blank" aria-label="travel compositions (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">旅行构图</a>和相同的<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/natural-light-in-travel-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="lighting (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">灯光</a>。</p><p>许多旅行摄影师都陷入了这些陷阱。他们与其他人拍摄相同的照片，这导致他们的作品集变得无聊和陈词滥调。</p><p> （事实上​​，大多数摄影编辑会告诉您，他们不想要“典型的游客”照片，仅仅是因为大多数人已经看过这些照片数百次！）</p><div

data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>那么如何避免拍摄典型的旅游照片呢？如何捕捉独特的旅行影像？</p><p>归结为三件事：</p><ol><li><strong>做你的研究</strong>。这里的想法是在出发前查找<a aria-label="travel photography locations (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-ways-find-great-locations-travel-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">旅行摄影地点</a>，然后真正深入研究游客（以及可能的其他旅行摄影师）拍摄的照片。确定天气、灯光和构图，然后将其全部记录下来，这样当<em>您</em>拍摄时，就不会拍摄完全相同的图像。</li><li><strong>要有创意</strong>。您可以通过两种方式做到这一点：您可以找到不太受欢迎的地点和主题，<em>或者</em>您可以想出一种独特的方式来展示热门主题。这取决于您自己的创造力（尽管您对位置的研究和思考越多，就越容易！）。</li><li><strong>承诺自己</strong>。拍摄独特的旅行照片是很困难的。为了获得完美、原创、令人惊叹的图像，您可能需要等待几个<em>小时</em>才能获得完美的条件。您甚至可能需要在光线或天气好的情况下再返回。</li></ol><p>也就是说，还有另一种方法可以捕捉标准旅行目的地的独特图像：运气好！有时，您会及时到达某个地点，看到一些<em>令人惊奇的</em>事情发生 - 无论是人、动物，甚至天气 - 并且您会捕捉到真正独特的图像。不幸的是，这样的日子很少见，所以我强烈建议你依靠我上面给出的建议，而<em>不是</em>纯粹依靠运气。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-avoiding-people"> 2. 避开人群</h2><p>事情是这样的：</p><p>如果您想讲述一个旅游目的地的故事，如果您真的想捕捉该目的地的<em>精髓</em>，那么您必须包含当地人的图像。</p><p>但许多新摄影师出于害羞而刻意避开这些<a aria-label="travel portraits (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-ways-improve-travel-photography-portraits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">旅行肖像</a>。这是可以理解的，但它会导致产品组合黯淡无光，无法封装一个位置。</p><p>老实说？你没什么可害怕的。</p><p>大多数人都很友好，根据我的经验，如果您付出努力并花时间去了解某人，他们会非常乐意满足您的摄影兴趣。所以不要害羞！走到人们面前，自我介绍，并询问是否可以拍一两张照片。</p><div

class="ek-link">旅行相机设置</a>等等。</p><p>另外，如果您确实使用上述快照方法拍到了一张很棒的照片，那么它肯定与游客拍摄的上千张其他照片相似（请参阅错误＃1！）。</p><p>所以深呼吸。减速。并<em>致力于</em>拍摄一张精彩的照片，即使这需要一个小时（或三个小时）。您可能不会花那么多时间在泳池边，但回家时一定会拍出更好的旅行照片！</p><div

多角度拍摄</h2><p>每个地点都有一些标准的“观点”、“风景”或“了望点”。如果你前往一个热门地区，你会随处看到它们的标志，游客常常会涌向这些地点，试图目睹最好的景色。</p><p>您可能会想在这些地方拍照，其中许多地方都可以欣赏到日出、日落、山脉、海滩等的壮丽景色。虽然视角<em>看起来</em>很棒，但它们通常不利于摄影。其一，它们很少提供良好的前景主题或<a

在不同的天气下，也许使用不同的焦距，或使用不同的技术。</p><p>也就是说，如果您真的想拍摄独特的旅行照片，您可以完全避开视点。寻找独特的观点通常需要更多的努力、辛劳，甚至金钱，但最终，这往往是值得的。</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span

noopener" class="ek-link">人像</a>，那么你必须掌握灯光。幸运的是，这非常容易，这要归功于<em>照明模式</em>——也就是说，您可以持续使用简单的肖像照明设置来获得漂亮的图像。</p><p>事实上，人像照明模式对于初学者和高级拍摄者来说都非常有用。作为一名经验丰富的肖像摄影师，我在自己的作品中<em>一直</em>使用这些图案。</p><p>下面，我分享每个肖像艺术家都应该知道的六种有用的摄影照明技巧。我还提供了照明图，以便您确切地知道如何在自己的工作室中复制该图案。</p><p>您准备好将人像拍摄提升到新的水平了吗？让我们开始吧。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="split-lighting"> 1.分体照明</h2><p>分体照明看起来就像听起来一样；它将脸分成相等的两半，如下所示： </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/split-lighting-pattern1.jpg?ssl=1" alt="女人与分体照明" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>由于这种半阴影效果非常引人注目，尤其是在光线较暗的情况下，因此通常用于拍摄音乐家和艺术家的喜怒无常的照片。</p><p>要实现分光照明，只需将光源放置在拍摄对象的左侧或右侧 90 度（您甚至可以将其稍微移到他们的头后面）。在真正的分光照明中，“阴影”脸上唯一应该被照亮的部分是眼睛（如上图所示）。这是简单的分光照明图，但请注意，您始终可以使用补光灯、边缘光和背景光来美化分光图像： </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/split-lighting-by-Darlene-Hildebrandt.png?ssl=1" alt="分体照明图" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>另外，请确保拍摄对象的至少一只眼睛包含<a aria-label="catchlight (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/an-introduction-to-catchlights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">聚光灯</a>（从光源反射的亮点）。否则，眼睛会显得毫无生气，整个镜头很可能就毁了。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="loop-lighting"> 2. 循环照明</h2><p>环形照明将拍摄对象鼻子上的小阴影投射到脸颊上。看下面的照片；看到鼻影稍微落在鼻孔右侧了吗？ </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Loop-lighting-pattern.jpg?ssl=1" alt="带有环形照明肖像的女人" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>环形照明可能是人像摄影中最常见的照明模式。为什么？它很容易创建，而且它让大多数人都满意！这就是为什么一些摄影师认为它绝对是拍摄肖像的最佳照明（特别是如果您是初学者）。</p><p>请注意，在循环照明中，鼻子的阴影和脸颊上的阴影<em>不会接触</em>。这是一种不同的照明模式，我将在下一节中讨论。相反，保持阴影较小并稍微向下（但不要将光源放置得<em>太高</em>；否则，您将产生奇怪的阴影并失去必要的聚光灯）。这是另一个示例，柔和的阴影落在观看者的右侧： </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Loop-lighting-pattern-example.jpg?ssl=1" alt="与循环照明结合在一起" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>要创建环形照明，请将光源放置在略高于视线水平且距相机约 30-45 度的位置。确切的角度取决于人的脸部，因此请随意打开造型灯（如果您的灯有的话）或将闪光灯放在不同的位置拍摄几张照片。随着时间的推移，您将能够更好地阅读人们的面部表情，并且从一开始就能够识别出完美的环形灯位置。</p><p>下图模拟了我上面分享的情侣图像的光照条件： </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/loop-lighting-by-Darlene-Hildebrandt.png?ssl=1" alt="循环照明图" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>请注意，黑色背景代表拍摄对象后面的树林。太阳照在树林上，我在相机左侧放置了一个白色<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-ways-of-using-reflector-to-take-better-portraits/" target="_blank" aria-label="reflector (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">反光镜</a>，将光线反射回拍摄对象的脸上。在标准工作室设置中，您可以放置​​闪光灯而不是反射器，但在这种情况下（使用来自太阳的自然光）反射器效果很好！</p><p>请记住：您的光线应<em>略高于</em>拍摄对象的视线水平。初学者把灯放低并向上倾斜，这会让这个问题变得很糟糕。这照亮了拍摄对象的鼻子底部，结果并不那么讨人喜欢。 <br /></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="rembrandt-lighting"> 3.伦勃朗灯光</h2><p><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rembrandt-lighting-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="Rembrandt lighting (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">伦勃朗照明</a>得名于 17 世纪艺术家伦勃朗，他在他的肖像画中使用了它。它可以通过对象脸颊上的清晰三角形光来识别，如下所示： </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Rembrandt-lighting-pattern.jpg?ssl=1" alt="伦勃朗灯光" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>请注意，鼻子和脸颊的阴影<em>确实</em>相交，从而形成了那个小三角形；这与循环照明不同，循环照明中阴影不应接触。另请注意，伦勃朗照明比循环照明更具戏剧性，因此将其用于情绪化的肖像拍摄，而不是标准的家庭照片拍摄。</p><p>要创建伦勃朗照明，请将灯光放在拍摄对象的一侧，并要求拍摄对象稍微转离灯光。灯光应该在他们的头顶上方，这样鼻子的阴影就会落向脸颊。这是伦勃朗照明图，用窗口代替闪光灯（当然，您可以使用任何类型的光源）： </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Rembrandt-lighting-by-Darlene-Hildebrandt.png?ssl=1" alt="伦勃朗布光图" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>并非每个人的脸都适合创造伦勃朗光线。如果他们的颧骨较高或突出，这可能会起作用，但如果他们的鼻子较小或鼻梁扁平，则可能很难实现。</p><p>请记住，您并不总是需要<em>精确地</em>创建此模式；只要你的拍摄对象感到受宠若惊并且你得到了你想要的情绪，那么灯光就起作用了。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="butterfly-lighting"> 4.蝴蝶照明</h2><p><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-perfect-butterfly-lighting/" target="_blank" aria-label="Butterfly lighting (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">蝴蝶照明</a>因鼻子下方产生的蝴蝶形状的阴影而得名，如下所示： </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Butterfly-lighting-pattern.jpg?ssl=1" alt="蝴蝶灯光肖像" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>结果是一张非常<em>迷人的</em>照片，脸颊和下巴下有阴影，所以你经常会在时尚杂志和电影明星的照片中看到它。它也适合年长的拍摄对象，因为它不强调皱纹，也适合瘦脸的拍摄对象（而圆脸、宽脸的拍摄对象在循环照明或分光照明下看起来更好）。</p><p>蝴蝶照明的创建非常简单。只需将光源直接放置在相机后面并略高于拍摄对象的眼睛或头部水平即可： </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/butterfly-lighting-by-Darlene-Hildebrandt-1.png?ssl=1" alt="蝴蝶照明图" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>如果鼻子下方的阴影太强，您可以在下巴正下方放置一个反光板（如果需要，您的拍摄对象可以握住它）。</p><p>仅使用窗户灯或反射器很难创建这种图案。您通常需要强光源（例如太阳或闪光灯）才能在鼻子下方产生更清晰的阴影。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="broad-lighting"> 5. 广泛的照明</h2><p>从技术上讲， <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-broad-and-short-lighting-in-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="broad lighting (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">宽泛照明</a>并不是肖像照明<em>模式；它是一种人像照明模式</em>。这是一种肖像照明<em>风格</em>，您可以将其与循环照明、伦勃朗照明或分割照明一起使用。然而，它是一种有用的照明设置，通常与上面讨论的模式组合在一起，我绝对建议您掌握它。</p><p>当拍摄对象的脸部稍微远离相机时，您会获得广泛的照明，并且<em>朝向</em>相机的脸部一侧被光线照亮，如下所示： </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Broad-lighting.jpg?ssl=1" alt="广泛的照明" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>这种类型的照明使人的脸看起来更宽或更宽（因此<em>有宽泛照明的</em>绰号），并且在拍摄脸部非常瘦的拍摄对象时效果很好。但大多数人希望看起来更苗条，而不是更宽，因此这种类型的照明不适合较重或圆脸的人。</p><p>要创建广泛的照明，请将面部转离光源，如下图所示。请注意靠近相机的脸部一侧如何接收光线，而脸部的较远一侧仍处于阴影中。 </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/broad-lighting-by-Darlene-Hildebrandt.png?ssl=1" alt="广泛的照明图" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="short-lighting"> 6. 短照明</h2><p>短照明与宽照明相反；面向相机的一侧脸被阴影笼罩，而背对相机的一侧脸则变亮。 </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Short-lighting.jpg?ssl=1" alt="灯光短的女人" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>对于较暗、情绪化甚至<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/making-low-key-portrait/" target="_blank" aria-label="low-key portraits (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">低调的肖像</a>来说，这是一种有用的照明模式。请注意，短照明会使更多的脸部处于阴影中，更具雕塑感，增加 3D 品质，并且对大多数人来说非常显瘦和讨人喜欢。</p><p>要创建短光，请让拍摄对象稍微转向光源，以便阴影落在靠近相机的脸部一侧： </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/short-lighting-by-Darlene-Hildebrandt.png?ssl=1"

Experiment with intentional camera movement or use a shallow depth of field to create dreamy, impressionistic effects.</li><li> <strong>Play with Light:</strong> Seek out scenes where light dances and plays. Capture the interplay of light and shadow to add depth and dimension to your images.</li><li> <strong>Vibrant Colors:</strong> Channel the spirit of the impressionist painters by infusing your photos with vibrant, bold colors. Look for scenes that evoke emotion through the use of a rich color palette.</li><li> <strong>Natural Scenes:</strong> Explore nature as your canvas. Whether it&#39;s a blooming garden, a tranquil forest, or a flowing river, find inspiration in the natural world.</li><li> <strong>Reflective Surfaces:</strong> Experiment with reflective surfaces like water or glass to create mesmerizing reflections that add an ethereal quality to your photos.</li><li> <strong>Everyday Moments:</strong> Capture the ordinary in an extraordinary way. Look for mundane scenes and transform them into captivating impressions through your lens.</li><li> <strong>Movement and Action:</strong> Freeze a moment in time or allow movement to paint a dynamic picture. Whether it&#39;s the swaying of trees, the rush of a crowd, or the flutter of wings, let movement be your brushstroke.</li><li> <strong>Abstract Elements:</strong> Embrace abstraction by focusing on patterns, textures, and shapes. Challenge viewers to see the world in a different light.</li></ol><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-257590" style="width:840px"><span class="space" style="width:840px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/olympus-digital-camera.jpg?resize=840%2C630&#038;ssl=1" alt="dPS 双周摄影挑战赛：印象派" class="wp-image-257590" style="width:840px;height:630px" width="840" height="630" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/olympus-digital-camera.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/olympus-digital-camera.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/olympus-digital-camera.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/olympus-digital-camera.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/olympus-digital-camera.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/olympus-digital-camera.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> &#39;Run for the train in the rain&#39; f/3.5 at 1/4 of a second shutter on the run in the rain.</figcaption></figure></div><p> <strong>Submission Guidelines:</strong></p><ul><li> <strong>Number of Entries:</strong> Submit up to three of your best impressionist photographs.</li><li> <strong>Caption:</strong> Provide a brief caption for each photo, sharing the inspiration or story behind your creative choices.</li><li> <strong>Technical Details:</strong> Optionally, include information on your camera settings or any post-processing techniques used to achieve the impressionistic effects.</li></ul><p> <strong>Make sure you include the hashtags #dPSWeeklyChallenge and #dPSImpressionist in your post, here in the comments or over on social media.

Let yourself forget about all the work that went into specific images, then come at the files with a neutral eye.</p><p> Another option is to take a quick look at all your photos, then go away for a while before looking again. When you come back to the computer, you may see elements you didn&#39;t notice previously, and you&#39;ll hopefully have an unbiased mindset for photo viewing. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="essential-photography-quotes-final-words"> Essential photography quotes: final words</h2><p> Now that you&#39;ve finished this article, you know 10 key photography quotes – and you&#39;re hopefully feeling inspired.</p><p> So memorize the quotes I&#39;ve shared.

This is especially true when shooting with telephoto lenses, at high magnifications, or in low light.</p><p> That&#39;s why, if you&#39;re looking to take sharper photos, you should brush up on your handholding technique. Grip your camera in one hand and cup a second hand under the lens. Keep the camera close to your body, keep your elbows tight, and – when possible – support yourself with a wall, a tree, or another solid object.</p><p> Also, make sure to press the shutter button <em>gently</em> ; don&#39;t punch at it.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-224562" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-6-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="person getting down on the ground for sharp images" class="wp-image-224562" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-6-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-6-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-6-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-6-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-6-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-6-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Proper handholding technique will provide a major increase in sharpness, <em>but</em> it&#39;s not foolproof.

Use a tripod</h2><p> If sharp photos are your goal, then using a tripod is the absolute <em>best</em> thing you can do for yourself.</p><p> You&#39;ll need to buy a sturdy tripod, though; a cheap, plasticky model will offer limited gains (and may even increase the blur, depending on other factors).</p><p> If you&#39;re shooting long exposures at night, then a tripod is essential. I&#39;d also recommend taking a tripod for most landscape photography, as well as situations where you&#39;re using a long lens.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-224564" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="998" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-5.jpg?resize=1500%2C998&#038;ssl=1" alt="photographer with a tripod how to get sharp photos" class="wp-image-224564" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-5.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-5.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-5.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-5.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-5.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-5.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Before grabbing your tripod, though, ask yourself: Is it really practical to bring this with me? If your tripod is relatively heavy and you&#39;re going on a long hike or traveling by plane, you may be better off without it.

This is where a remote release becomes invaluable; it lets you trigger your camera&#39;s shutter without physically touching the camera, ensuring that no inadvertent movement disrupts your shot.</p><p> Remote releases sync with your camera and can be either wired or wireless. They are typically affordable and easy to use, making them a great addition to your photography kit. If you&#39;re looking to save money, or if you don&#39;t have a remote release on hand when you set off for a photoshoot, your camera&#39;s self-timer function is an effective alternative. With the self-timer, you can press the shutter button and then step away, allowing any vibrations to settle before the camera takes the photo.</p><p> This technique is particularly useful for long-exposure photography, macro photography, or any situation where even the slightest camera movement could compromise the sharpness of your image.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-mirror-lock-up"> 4.

It refers to the vibrations caused by the camera&#39;s mirror flipping up when the shutter button is pressed. While this isn&#39;t an issue with mirrorless cameras, DSLR users need to be mindful, especially when shooting with slower shutter speeds; the mirror slap can cause noticeable blur in your photos.</p><p> Fortunately, there&#39;s an easy solution: use the mirror lock-up feature. This function allows you to flip the mirror up well before taking the shot, thereby eliminating any mirror slap at the moment of exposure. Using mirror lock-up is particularly crucial when capturing long-exposure images, where even the slightest movement can affect image sharpness. On the other hand, if you&#39;re using a fast shutter speed, taking precautions against mirror slap isn&#39;t necessary.</p><p> An alternative here is to use your camera&#39;s Live View mode. When Live View is activated, the mirror is flipped up in advance in order to let you see the shot through the LCD screen. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-your-cameras-electronic-shutter"> 5.

It occurs due to the internal movement of your camera&#39;s mechanical shutter, which can introduce vibrations and result in a slight blur in your images. Even if you&#39;ve done everything else perfectly, shutter shock can still compromise the sharpness you&#39;re striving for.</p><p> Fortunately, there&#39;s a simple solution: use your camera&#39;s electronic shutter. Most modern mirrorless cameras come equipped with this feature. For DSLR users, though a fully electronic shutter won&#39;t be available, you&#39;ll often find an Electronic Front-Curtain Shutter (EFCS) option in your camera settings. EFCS starts the exposure electronically, which prevents the vibrations caused by the mechanical shutter movement.</p><p> By the way, a benefit of using EFCS over the electronic shutter is the avoidance of rolling shutter distortion. This is particularly useful when photographing fast-moving subjects. Rolling shutter distortion can create a jello-like effect in your images, where straight lines appear curved or skewed due to the rapid movement. By starting the exposure electronically but finishing it mechanically – which is the exact process used by the EFCS setting – you prevent this issue, resulting in more natural-looking photos. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="select-a-fast-shutter-speed">6. Select a fast shutter speed</h2><p> Here&#39;s another major culprit of blurry photos:</p><p> A too-slow <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> .</p><p> You see, the shutter speed refers to the length of time the camera sensor is exposed to the light. And if the shutter speed is too long, elements of your image will have time to move (and your setup will have time to shake, as well).</p><p> If you&#39;re using a tripod and your subject is stationary (eg, a desert landscape), you generally don&#39;t need to worry about using a fast shutter speed. But if you&#39;re handholding your camera <em>or</em> you&#39;re hoping to freeze fast action, then a fast shutter speed is essential.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-224567" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bicyclists going by How to take sharp photos" class="wp-image-224567" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-to-take-sharp-images-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> How do you pick the right shutter speed for tack-sharp images? If your subject is <em>stationary</em> , use the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/back-to-basics-what-is-the-reciprocal-rule-in-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="reciprocal &quot;rule&quot; (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">reciprocal “rule”</a> for handholding:</p><p> <em>Your shutter speed should be faster than the lens&#39;s focal length.</em></p><p> So if your lens is 50mm, then shoot at 1/50s or above. If your lens is 100mm, then shoot at 1/100s and above. If your lens is 200mm, then shoot at 1/200s and above.

And another reason for a blurry shot is either <em>missed focus</em> or a <em>too-thin depth of field</em> .</p><p> Now, by narrowing your aperture, you&#39;ll increase the window of focus in your images. An aperture of f/16 may keep the entire scene sharp (depending on various factors, including your lens&#39;s focal length). Whereas an aperture of f/2.8 will generally give a tiny window of sharpness.</p><p> So if your images are blurry because the depth of field is too thin, just dial in an aperture of f/8, f/11, or even f/16, and you should see a significant increase in sharpness.</p><p> Technically, if your images are blurry because you missed focus, you should work on your focusing technique (as I discuss below). But by narrowing the aperture (and consequently deepening the depth of field), you can give yourself a bit of extra leeway when shooting.</p><p> Note that narrowing the aperture will also darken the image, so you&#39;ll need to keep an eye on your exposure as you make adjustments.

A high ISO <em>will</em> increase the image exposure so you get a detailed photo.</p><p> However, high ISOs come with a downside, called <em>noise</em> . Noise is essentially little speckles of light and color across your shots, and when it gets out of hand, it can seriously impact sharpness.</p><p> So what ISO should you use for sharp images? It depends on your camera, and high-ISO noise performance is improving all the time. These days, you can often get away with an ISO of up to 800 or 1600, especially if you use a recent full-frame camera.</p><p> And if you&#39;re in a situation where you <em>need</em> a fast shutter speed (eg, you&#39;re shooting an indoor sport), it&#39;s better to boost the ISO than to underexpose all your photos.</p><p> But whenever possible, set your ISO to its base value. <em>That&#39;s</em> how you&#39;ll get the sharpest photos.</p><p> (Note that you can also reduce noise in post-processing. But this generally comes with a slight dip in image quality, so be careful!) </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="turn-on-your-image-stabilization"> 9.

Image stabilization certainly isn&#39;t perfect, but it&#39;ll let you handhold at very slow shutter speeds, especially if you&#39;re using top-of-the-line image-stabilized equipment. In some low-light situations, you can even get away without using a tripod.</p><p> Keep in mind that image stabilization helps with camera movement but not subject movement – so if you&#39;re shooting low-light action, it won&#39;t offer improved sharpness (though a few lenses do offer sharpness gains when panning in low light; for more details, consult your lens manual).</p><p> And one more thing:</p><p> If you mount your camera to a tripod and drop the shutter speed below 1/80s or so, then turn <em>off</em> image stabilization. You won&#39;t need the stabilization – your tripod will keep your pictures sharp – and active image stabilization on a rock-solid base can actually increase blur. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="improve-your-focusing-technique-and-use-the-right-settings"> 10.

When photographing stationary subjects, make sure your camera is set to AF-S (One-Shot AF on Canon).

The best choice will depend on the scenario, but a single-point setting generally works for still subjects, while a group of AF points or some form of AF tracking is better for moving subjects.</p><p> When focusing on fast-moving subjects, make sure to look through the viewfinder, not the LCD. And pan your camera along with the subjects (and continue to pan, even after you&#39;ve hit the shutter button).</p><p> When focusing on stationary subjects, it&#39;s often best to use the focus-and-recompose technique, where you grab focus on your area of interest, continue to half-press the shutter button (this will <em>lock</em> focus), then recompose until you get the result you want.

However, manual focus offers a level of control and precision that autofocus sometimes can&#39;t match, especially in challenging conditions. It&#39;s particularly useful when you&#39;re working in near darkness or shooting subjects at close range. In these scenarios, your camera&#39;s autofocus might struggle and repeatedly miss the mark. That&#39;s when switching to manual focus can make a huge difference.</p><p> You&#39;ll typically find a switch on your lens barrel to shift from autofocus to manual focus. Once you&#39;ve made the switch, it&#39;s all about fine-tuning the focus manually. This is done by gently turning the focus ring on your lens barrel. It might feel slow, especially if you&#39;re used to the speed of autofocus, but the accuracy you gain is well worth the extra time.</p><p> When focusing manually, you can use the viewfinder to eyeball your subject. But for more distant subjects or to ensure even greater accuracy, consider using the magnification feature on your camera&#39;s LCD screen. This will give you a much better view of your focus point, allowing you to make very precise adjustments. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="make-sure-your-lenses-are-sharp"> 12.

(Go too narrow, and you&#39;ll start to see softening due to diffraction, so I&#39;d recommend stopping before f/13 or so.)</p><p> Of course, the specifics depend on your lenses, so be sure to carefully test each one; take a series of shots at different apertures, then pixel-peep on your computer to identify the sharpest files.</p><p> By the way, if you own a zoom lens, you may also want to test sharpness across its focal length range. Many zooms get softer as you move toward the extremes, and by identifying the optimal focal lengths, you can get even sharper images. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="fill-the-frame-with-your-subject"> 16.

Even high-resolution cameras show a reduction in image quality with significant cropping. And if your lenses aren&#39;t top-tier, this quality reduction can become a problem even with moderate cropping.</p><p> By composing your shot to include your subject fully, you minimize the need for cropping later. This approach not only preserves image quality but also encourages you to think more critically about your composition. It&#39;s a practice that pushes you to consider your positioning, the lens you choose, and how you frame your subject.</p><p> Of course, you don&#39;t have to fill the frame obsessively – sometimes, cropping is the only option – but the more you can get it right in camera, the better your results will be. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="apply-sharpening-in-post-processing"> 17.

This isn&#39;t a flaw; most cameras are designed to soften images slightly to avoid moire, a digital imaging artifact. And since RAW files are unprocessed, they lack the in-camera sharpening applied to JPEGs.</p><p> (JPEGs, in contrast, look sharper straight out of the camera due to automatic processing.)</p><p> To bring your RAW photos up to par with JPEG sharpness, it&#39;s essential to add some sharpening during post-processing. This step, often overlooked, can transform your images from good to great. A bit of global sharpening can help enhance the overall clarity of your photo.</p><p> But don&#39;t stop there; applying targeted sharpening to areas rich in detail can make those elements pop, adding depth and texture to your image.</p><p> Additionally, when you downsize an image for web or print, you often introduce a slight softness. To counter this, apply a touch of sharpening upon export. This will ensure your images retain their crispness and detail.</p><p> Just remember: with sharpening, less is often more. Over-sharpening can lead to unnatural-looking images and amplify noise. The key is to strike a balance, enhancing the sharpness while maintaining the natural quality of your photographs. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-take-sharp-images-final-words"> How to take sharp images: final words</h2><p> Now that you&#39;ve finished this article, you know that capturing sharp photos isn&#39;t <em>hard</em> – it simply involves improving your knowledge and technique.

Now, let&#39;s focus on a specialized way to make that foreground sing: leading lines.</p><p> What exactly are leading lines? Think of them as guides, paths that steer your viewer&#39;s eye from one part of the frame to another. They build a sense of movement, enticing the eye to travel from the foreground elements all the way to the majestic background.</p><p> Don&#39;t think you need to find a perfect straight line etched in the scenery. Rivers winding through valleys, pathways through fields, or even rows of trees can serve this purpose. Nature often provides these lines freely, if you know where to look.</p><p> Why does this technique work so well in wide-angle landscape photography? Because wide-angle lenses exaggerate distances and scale, these lines often appear more dynamic, more elongated. They beckon your viewers into the scene, providing a near-3D effect.</p><p> So take a moment during your next shoot to scout for these leading lines. Sometimes they&#39;re obvious, like a long, deserted highway. At other times, they might be subtler, like cracks in a dry lake bed or bending reeds in a marsh. Once you begin integrating them, your compositions will become more engaging and visually complex. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photograph-a-subject-in-its-environment"> 3.

They give you the freedom to play with multiple elements within your frame. Instead of settling for one or two features to capture, aim for a multi-layered composition.</p><p>这意味着什么？ It&#39;s simple. Use your wide-angle lens to include something interesting in the foreground, a captivating subject in the mid-ground, and a scenic view in the background. Each layer serves a role in creating a sense of depth, offering your viewers a journey through the scene.</p><p> Don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re not sure how to balance these layers. It comes down to practice and a bit of intuition. Look for elements that harmonize, yet stand distinct from one another. A bed of colorful flowers in the foreground, a serene lake in the mid-ground, and a snow-capped mountain in the background – each component contributes to a well-rounded story.</p><p> One word of caution: be mindful of how the layers interact. The last thing you want is for one element to overpower the rest. A foreground that&#39;s too busy or a background that&#39;s too overwhelming can throw off the balance.</p><p> Spending a few moments arranging these layers can be a game changer. Once you master this technique, your wide-angle landscapes will take on a richer, more complete form. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="watch-out-for-distractions"> 6.

Look at the edges of your frame. Are there any stray elements, like tree branches or random objects, poking in? Scan the mid-ground and background too, making sure every element complements, not competes with, your main subject.</p><p> This level of scrutiny may feel tedious and unnecessary. But trust me, investing that time beforehand will save you a lot more time later in editing. You&#39;ll notice your photos emerging cleaner, and more importantly, more impactful.</p><p> Your patience will pay off, not just in the short term but in your long-term growth as a photographer.

Landscape photographers <em>love</em> working with polarizers, but when you&#39;re using an ultra-wide lens, you can run into issues.</p><p> For one, depending on the angle of your camera, you may end up with a polarization effect that&#39;s applied unevenly across the scene. This is due to the nature of polarizing filters – they work differently depending on the filter&#39;s angle relative to the sun – and while it&#39;s not an issue on telephoto lenses, it can come into play if you&#39;re shooting at, say, 15mm. When this happens, it&#39;s generally better to avoid a polarizer completely.</p><p> Second, some ultra-wide lenses feature a bulbous front element that simply cannot <em>take</em> a polarizer. So if you&#39;re using an ultra-wide lens, you may need to adjust your compositions or even choose different subjects to prevent unwanted reflections from plaguing your images. If your lens won&#39;t take a polarizer, you may want to consider avoiding waxy leaves, water, and wet rocks, all of which will create reflections and reduce image saturation. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="include-a-human-to-show-scale"> 13.

Everything is framed within your lens, but sometimes the true scale gets lost. A towering mountain can look like a mere hill; a sprawling forest might appear more like a grove of trees.</p><p> A simple solution? Include a human element. A person standing near the base of a mountain, or along a rocky shoreline, instantly provides a sense of scale. It gives your viewers a tangible point of reference, helping them grasp the enormity of the scene.</p><p> You don&#39;t need to make the human figure the centerpiece of the shot, by the way. It&#39;s just a tool to aid comprehension, a way to make the vastness more understandable. Just make sure you position this figure thoughtfully, ensuring it complements the landscape rather than distracting from it.</p><p> Whether it&#39;s you in the frame or a friend you&#39;ve dragged along, having a human reference can turn an impressive wide-angle landscape into an awe-inspiring one!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="manage-uneven-light"> 14.

Often, the background sky will be much brighter than your foreground objects, and this can cause significant exposure problems. Do you expose for the sky and lose detail in the foreground? Or do you expose for the foreground and blow out the sky?</p><p> My recommendation is to use a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/using-graduated-neutral-density-filters-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="graduated neutral density filter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">graduated neutral density filter</a> , which will darken the top portion of your composition while leaving the foreground untouched. You might also consider using a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/getting-real-hdr/" target="_blank" aria-label="bracketing and blending technique (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">bracketing and blending technique</a> , where you capture several images at different exposures, then merge them together in post-processing.</p><p> In truth, both of the above approaches have their merits! Filters do tend to be expensive, but they&#39;ll also save you time behind the computer, while bracketing can be highly effective but takes greater patience when editing. If you&#39;re not sure which technique you like best, rent some filters, try both options, and see what you think! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-forget-about-post-processing"> 15.

But the journey isn&#39;t over. Post-processing is how you transform a good photograph into a great one.</p><p> Think of your camera as an interpreter. It does its best to relay what it sees, but sometimes the essence gets lost in translation. That&#39;s why you need to roll up your sleeves and dive into editing.</p><p> A straightforward place to start is with basic adjustments. Tinker with contrast, brightness, and saturation to get closer to what your eyes saw. You can add vignettes to direct focus, and use dodging and burning to bring out the texture and depth in various areas.</p><p> Remember, post-processing isn&#39;t about altering reality; it&#39;s about making it more perceptible. The goal is to help convey the scene as vividly as you remember. The aim isn&#39;t for over-the-top effects, but subtle improvements that amplify the mood and message of your photograph. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="wide-angle-landscape-photography-final-words"> Wide-angle landscape photography: final words</h2><p> Wide-angle lenses are often the most-used glass in a landscape photographer&#39;s kit.

贡献。</em></p><p>与注重捕捉清晰细致图像的传统摄影不同，印象派摄影挑战我们通过不同的镜头来看待世界，这种镜头不太关心清晰度，更关心情感和视觉影响。印象派照片不仅仅涉及镜头前的事物，还涉及您选择通过颜色、形状甚至模糊来讲述的<em>故事</em>。</p><p>我喜欢捕捉印象派的照片，在这篇文章中，我将分享一些技巧，让您可以用相机进行绘画，这样您就可以创作出能引起内心深处共鸣的艺术品。我的方法鼓励你拥抱运动，专注地玩耍，并庆祝抽象。</p><p>因此，无论您是一位想要打破常规的经验丰富的摄影师，还是渴望探索的初学者，请准备好捕捉一些令人惊叹的图像！ </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-is-impressionist-photography">什么是印象派摄影？ </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img

Polak.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>印象派摄影是一种摄影师试图传达场景的感觉或暗示，而不是字面描述的风格。换句话说，它是通过形状和颜色而不是尖锐、真实的表现来呈现主题的本质，从而捕捉场景的整体氛围。</p><p>在印象派和抽象摄影中，重点是通过纹理、形式和颜色的相互作用来激发情感。这种风格鼓励使用充满活力的色调、独特的形状和线条来制作视觉刺激的作品。</p><p>想象一下，短暂地观察一个场景，然后在你的眼睛完全理解细节之前就转身离开。留下的是对颜色和形式的模糊记忆，是对原始场景的提炼本质——这就是印象派摄影的意义所在。

1.寻找形状、图案和纹理</h3><p>当您进行日常活动时，请注意您周围的形状。即使是标准的房屋或公寓也充满了有趣的形状、图案和纹理，可以用来制作印象派照片。</p><p>仔细观察周围的不同物体，考虑是否有重复出现的形状或主题。然后利用它们来发挥你的优势。</p><p>例如，在照片中可以非常有效地使用线条，因为眼睛会倾向于在整个镜头中跟随它们。看看波浪到达岸边时的起伏图案： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1-Look-for-shapes-Waves-by-Eva-Polak.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Impressionist photography" title="1-寻找形状 Waves by Eva Polak.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>如果您喜欢在城市中漫步，请寻找建筑物形成的图案。</p><p>基本上，您能找到的形式相互作用越多越好！ </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-intentional-camera-movement"> 2. 有意识地移动相机</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4-Pan-you-Camera-Wattle-Bay-Eva-Polak.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Impressionist photography" title="4-潘你相机 Wattle Bay Eva Polak.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>有意识地移动相机是创造印象派风景摄影的绝佳技术，尤其是当您面对突出的线条时，例如水平延伸的海滩或森林中的高大树木。</p><p>该方法需要练习才能掌握，但过程是创作享受的一部分，并且实际上保证每次拍摄都会产生独特的效果。这是我的建议：</p><ol><li>将相机设置为快门优先模式。</li><li>选择 1/20 秒到 1/2 秒之间的慢快门速度。</li><li>将相机对准场景中央，然后半按快门按钮设置曝光。</li><li>平移相机，使其与场景中的任何主导线平行移动。</li><li>平移时，完全按下快门按钮。即使快门关闭后仍继续运动以获得流畅的效果。</li><li>尝试不同的快门速度以获得不同的结果！ </li></ol><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="look-for-reflections"> 3.寻找倒影</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2-Reflection-Seagull-by-Eva-Polak.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Impressionist photography" title="2-反射海鸥，作者：Eva Polak.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>倒影是创作印象派摄影的最佳方式之一——如果你仔细观察，你会发现它们<em>无处不在</em>。</p><p>当你四处走动时，寻找光滑的表面。考虑一下如何使用每个表面来捕捉否则无法拍摄的视点。</p><p>特别注意被雨水浸湿的街道上色彩缤纷的倒影；他们将创造出具有印象派品质的闪闪发光的场景。</p><p>此外，湖泊和河流可以创造出一些美妙的反射表面。</p><p>请始终记住，当表面具有纹理或形状时，可能会出现不寻常且有趣的反射。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-zooming"> 4.尝试缩放</h3><p>变焦连拍或变焦模糊是另一种简单、有趣且易于实现的技术。它涉及在拍照时改变镜头的焦距（放大或缩小），导致照片从中心向外模糊，就好像场景正在向您猛冲过来一样。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5-Zoom-Water-lily-by-Eva-polak.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Impressionist photography" title="5 倍变焦睡莲，作者：Eva polak.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>要使用此技术，您需要一台带有变焦镜头（包含变焦环）的相机。将相机设置为快门优先，并将快门速度拨至 1/10 秒左右。</p><p>像平常一样构图，然后在按下快门时变焦镜头。这项技术成功的关键是获得正确的变焦连拍<em>量</em>。尝试变焦速度和方向，并尝试不同的快门速度。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5-Zoom-Autumn-Leaves-by-Eva-Polak.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Impressionist photography" title="5 倍变焦秋叶，作者：Eva Polak.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-selective-focus"> 5. 使用选择性焦点</h3><p>选择性对焦涉及隔离画面的一小部分，使其处于清晰焦点，同时让图像的其余部分以柔和、绘画的方式渲染。当使用大光圈（例如 f/1.8 或 f/2.8）镜头时，此技术最有效。</p><p>为了获得最佳效果，请使用长焦镜头放大感兴趣的点，或使用微距镜头靠近拍摄对象。</p><p>将相机设置为光圈优先模式并选择可用的最大光圈。可能需要手动对焦以确保画面的所需区域清晰对焦。</p><p> （专业提示：要获得特别引人注目的效果，请在框架中包含鲜艳的颜色！） </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="deliberately-defocus-your-lens"> 6.故意散焦你的镜头</h3><p>将镜头拉离焦距是让场景呈现印象派外观的快速方法，如下所示： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3-Defocus-Lonly-by-Eva-Polak.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Impressionist photography" title="3-Defocus Lonly by Eva Polak.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>使用<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-priority-and-shutter-priority-exposure-lesson-1/">光圈优先模式</a>并将镜头设置为最大光圈（较小的数字，例如 f/2.4 或 f/4）。这很重要，因为您需要<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/seeing-in-depth-of-field-a-simple-understanding-of-aperture/">非常浅的景深</a>。</p><p>然后将镜头切换到手动对焦并开始通过相机观察事物。转动对焦环，直到一切都变得模糊。</p><p>并尝试改变焦点；这将产生不同程度的模糊，适合不同的拍摄对象。 </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-the-focus-through-technique"> 7.使用聚焦技术</h3><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure

What questions about photography will help you understand what they do? How can you use their knowledge to improve your own photography?</p><p> I&#39;ve spent a lot of time interviewing photographers, and I&#39;ve developed a list of <em>essential</em> questions for photographers that I highly recommend you commit to memory. These are the types of questions that will give you the best, most useful advice, and they&#39;ll also help you understand how the photographer approaches their own photography.</p><p> That way, the next time you run into a photographer you admire or you simply engage with a photographer on a website or forum, you know how to come away with the most helpful information.</p><p> Let&#39;s get started with my first question: </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-is-the-one-thing-you-wish-you-knew-when-you-started-taking-photos"> 1. What is the one thing you wish you knew when you started taking photos?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-221836" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="998" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-9.jpg?resize=1500%2C998&#038;ssl=1" alt="拿着相机的摄影师要问每个摄影师的问题" class="wp-image-221836" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-9.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-9.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-9.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-9.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-9.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-9.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Every photographer struggles when they start out – and improves as they gain experience. Which means that every photographer has one, or two, or even <em>dozens</em> of things they wished they had known at the beginning.</p><p> Advice you receive might include:</p><ul><li> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-elements-of-composition-in-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="Composition (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Composition</a></li><li> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/studio-lighting-equipment-guide/" target="_blank" aria-label="Lighting (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Lighting</a></li><li>齿轮</li><li><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-tips-location-scouting-before-photo-session/" target="_blank" aria-label="Scouting (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Scouting</a></li><li>动机</li><li>And much, much more!</li></ul><p> So it&#39;s a great question to ask a photographer right off the bat.

Camera settings, composition, light, post-processing; it all takes effort to master, which means that every photographer has experienced some <em>journey</em> .</p><p> So ask them about it. Ask them how they went from <em>beginner</em> status to <em>professional</em> (or skilled amateur, semi-professional, etc.). What did they do that helped them most? Was it reading books about photography? Photography courses? Viewing photography? Practicing? Some type of magic bean?</p><p> (Bonus: Plenty of photographers <em>love</em> this question, because it&#39;s clearly flattering! So you&#39;re likely to get a good, long, helpful answer.) </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-essential-resources-do-you-recommend"> 3. What essential resources do you recommend?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-257545" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/questions-to-ask-photographers-101.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="要问摄影师的基本问题" class="wp-image-257545" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/questions-to-ask-photographers-101.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/questions-to-ask-photographers-101.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/questions-to-ask-photographers-101.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/questions-to-ask-photographers-101.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/questions-to-ask-photographers-101.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/questions-to-ask-photographers-101.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Every photographer has their go-to resources. These are the books, courses, or tools that they swear by. If you&#39;re talking to a professional, don&#39;t forget to ask them about the resources they find indispensable. This can be your shortcut to leveling up your skills.</p><p> Courses, books, documentaries, and workshops come in all shapes and sizes. Some might recommend a YouTube channel that offers quick photography hacks. Others may point you toward a comprehensive online course that dives deep into the technicalities. The point is, each photographer has their own set of recommendations that can offer you unique perspectives.</p><p> And if they&#39;re in the photography education space, don&#39;t be surprised if they recommend something of their own. Many of these photographers create their own courses or write books to share their expertise. This could be your chance to get an insider&#39;s view. Learning from their curated material could provide you with tips that are hard to find elsewhere.</p><p> Bottom line: The right resources can help you refine your craft. Investing in the right books or online courses can provide you with practical skills that you can apply right away. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-do-you-get-honest-feedback-on-your-work"> 4. How do you get honest feedback on your work?</h2><p> Feedback is a cornerstone of growth, not just in photography but in any creative endeavor. If you&#39;ve ever wondered where to get an unbiased critique of your work, you&#39;re not alone. Professionals have been through this and can guide you to platforms or communities where you can get constructive criticism.</p><p> Not all feedback is created equal. While friends and family might offer praise, they often lack the expertise to give you a detailed critique. Professionals can point you to online forums, photography clubs, or even specific social media groups where your work can be critically assessed.</p><p> How do you get people to be honest? There&#39;s an art to soliciting constructive feedback, and a professional can teach you how. Maybe it&#39;s about asking the right questions or maybe it&#39;s about creating an environment where people feel comfortable being candid. Learn these techniques to get the most out of your feedback sessions. </p><div class="wp-block-jetpack-send-a-message"></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-gear-do-you-use"> 5. What gear do you use?</h2><p> I don&#39;t recommend you start off with this question, because it comes off as a bit superficial; after all, it&#39;s the photographer, not the gear, that makes great photos.</p><p> That said, gear does make a difference, and understanding a photographer&#39;s setup can help you in two key ways:</p><ol><li> It&#39;ll offer recommendations for your own kit (after all, if a photographer you admire shoots with a certain lens and achieves tack-sharp images, the lens is undoubtedly capable glass!).</li><li> It&#39;ll give you an understanding of the necessary equipment for different photography genres. For instance, a panoramic <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/11-surefire-tips-for-improving-your-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="landscape photographer (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">landscape photographer</a> will need a certain type of tripod – but if you&#39;ve never shot panoramas, you may not know this. Same with a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/macro-photography-for-beginners-part-1/" target="_blank" aria-label="macro photographer (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">macro photographer</a> who uses a focusing rail, a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/step-by-step-guide-to-long-exposure-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="long exposure photographer (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">long exposure photographer</a> with a 10-stop neutral density filter, etc.</li></ol><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-221838" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-7-1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="相机装备" class="wp-image-221838" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-7-1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-7-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-7-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-7-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-7-1.jpg?resize=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1365w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-7-1.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-7-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> By the way, when you question a professional photographer about gear, don&#39;t limit yourself to cameras and lenses. Accessories are often amazingly helpful and less well known, so I highly recommend you discuss tripods, tripod heads, filters, flashes, camera bags, and even rain covers. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="which-lens-is-your-favorite-why"> 6. Which lens is your favorite?为什么？</h2><p> This question about photography continues on the gear theme, except it attempts to understand why a photographer uses the lenses that they do – and what makes certain lenses better than others. Again, it&#39;s worth emphasizing here that a great photographer can make images with any lens, but focal length, maximum <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> , autofocusing speed, and more can all affect your photos (potentially a lot more than you think!).</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-221839" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-3.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="桌子上的图丽镜头" class="wp-image-221839" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-3.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-3.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-3.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/questions-to-ask-photographers-3.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> By the way, when it comes to choosing from among high-level lenses, it&#39;s not so much about determining which lens is the sharpest.

As a photographer, what <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> you buy?</p><p> You&#39;ll get plenty of different answers here, and that&#39;s great – encourage the photographer to be as broad or specific as they want. Photographers might talk about lenses that sit in their camera bag getting dusty, tripods that shake on windless days, lights that broke after five uses, or something else entirely.</p><p> Note each item, but don&#39;t let it stop you from buying the equipment yourself; what works for one person might not work for another! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-are-some-common-photography-pitfalls"> 9. What are some common photography pitfalls?</h2><p> We all make mistakes. In photography, some missteps can lead to poor results, but knowing what to avoid can make all the difference. So, why not ask a professional what to watch out for? The answer might just save you from falling into common traps.</p><p> Let&#39;s talk about composition, for example. It&#39;s easy to get caught up in the moment and snap a shot without properly framing your subject. Another common error is investing too much in gear, without dedicating equal time to learning the craft. This unbalanced approach can stall your progress significantly.</p><p> There are also more nuanced pitfalls. Some photographers get so caught up in achieving technical perfection that they forget to develop a unique style. Other mistakes are conceptual, like taking photos without a clear intent or message. These pitfalls can divert you from your artistic path.</p><p> Being aware of these mistakes isn&#39;t just about avoidance. It&#39;s also about knowing what to focus on for improvement. By asking this question, you&#39;re not just collecting cautionary tales; you&#39;re building your own guidebook for success. You&#39;re armed with the knowledge of what not to do, which is just as valuable as knowing what to do.</p><p> Gathering advice on common pitfalls offers you a fast track to improvement. It&#39;s like having cheat codes for a video game. You get to bypass the errors that could have slowed you down, ensuring a smoother journey in your photography career. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-are-your-favorite-settings"> 10.

These are the endeavors that fuel a photographer&#39;s passion. They are not for likes or follows but for the joy and satisfaction that comes from creating something meaningful. Another strategy might be to set aside “creative time” apart from your regular shooting schedule. This is time reserved purely for experimenting and developing your artistic voice.</p><p>您可能还会发现专业人士使用有形的工具来保持专注。 Mood boards, journals, or even a dedicated workspace can serve as daily reminders of what you&#39;re striving for.

Getting a balance is key, and who better to ask than a professional photographer?</p><p> Different platforms suit different styles. Instagram may be great for portrait photography, while Pinterest could be more suited for showcasing landscapes. Asking a seasoned photographer about their preferred platform can give you a new perspective on where to showcase your work.</p><p> How much time should you spend on social media? The answer varies. But finding out how a professional manages their time online can offer you invaluable insights. Maybe they have a set schedule or perhaps they outsource their social media management. Whatever their strategy, it can serve as a useful reference point for you.</p><p> Of course, the big question: art or likes? Social media can skew your focus towards getting validation rather than improving your craft. It&#39;s important to hear from someone who&#39;s navigated these waters successfully. They can offer advice on how to maintain your artistic integrity while still engaging with an online audience. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="whose-work-has-influenced-you-most"> 15.

In my experience, it&#39;s best to set up near rivers or lakes, because they offer an abundant food source for the birds, and you&#39;ll often be able to move along the water&#39;s edge for different angles.</p><p> You might also try doing a quick search online for the best birding locations near you. Alternatively, you can find a birding forum or a birding blog that lists bird count data; that way, you can head to the locations that interest you based on your target bird species.</p><p> Once you&#39;ve found a location, observe the flying birds for a few moments. Look for a position – on a bank or a hill – that will put you as close to the bird&#39;s level as possible. (In other words, you don&#39;t want to be shooting up at the birds from below or down at the birds from above. You want the most direct, dead-ahead angle possible.)</p><p> And check out the position of the sun, because you should <em>not</em> be shooting into it. Light coming from behind you or from the left or the right of your position is preferred.</p><p> Also, birds will generally take off and land into the wind, so knowing the wind direction will help you predict the flight path of the birds you are photographing.</p><p> Finding the best bird in flight locations will take a <em>lot</em> of trial and error. Many of the locations you check out will be duds – but it&#39;ll be worth it, because very occasionally, you&#39;ll find an area you can return to again and again and again. Scout enough locations, and you&#39;ll end up with a good list of these hotspots! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shoot-during-the-best-light">2.

Really, as long as you shoot in the two hours after sunrise and the two hours before sunset, the light will look great (though remember that you need to carefully choose your position; you want the birds to be illuminated from the front, not the back!).</p><p> Also, because you&#39;re photographing birds in the air, you&#39;ll still get nice lighting on your subject even if you shoot a little before or after the golden hours (just make sure the light doesn&#39;t get too harsh!).</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="make-yourself-invisible">3.

You can also stay low to the ground as you approach a bird hotspot or use natural cover (eg, trees). As you get more serious, you might consider wearing camouflage clothing, using a blind, or even shooting from your car window (birds tend to be less bothered by cars, so you can often drive close to birds that would normally fly away).</p><p> Once you&#39;ve found a nice spot, keep relatively still. Don&#39;t make any sudden movements. Instead, keep everything slow and steady as you set up your camera, then take a seat if you can (I recommend maintaining that low profile).</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-the-right-gear"> 4.

So get the best lens you can afford, then learn to use it well!</p><p> I&#39;d also recommend you grab a sturdy tripod and a good gimbal head. It&#39;ll help you balance your setup while tracking birds (though a less expensive option is a pan head, which can also work well). Finally, while ball heads can be used for birds in flight photography, they&#39;re not a very stable solution for large lenses, so I don&#39;t generally recommend them.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="study-your-subject"> 5.

For instance, many birds, especially the larger species like herons or eagles, will relieve themselves just before they fly. Knowing this can give you a split-second warning that translates into a beautiful takeoff shot.</p><p> Really, a lot of this studying will occur while you&#39;re out photographing. Just by watching the birds, by identifying their behavioral habits, by seeing <em>what</em> they do and <em>when</em> they do it, you&#39;ll accumulate plenty of useful knowledge.</p><p> For instance, did you know that shorebirds tend to run down the beach in a consistent direction? So if you want close-up shots of skittish shorebirds in flight, determine their direction, position yourself down the beach, get on the ground, and wait for them to come to you!</p><p> (That&#39;s the kind of thing you learn after spending hours and hours watching birds on a beach!) </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="get-your-birds-in-flight-camera-settings-right"> 6.

And it can get a little complex.</p><p> However, I do have some recommendations that should simplify the process immensely.</p><p> First, use <a aria-label="Aperture Priority mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Aperture Priority mode</a> ; that way, you have control over your aperture and ISO at all times (and by boosting your ISO or widening the aperture, you can increase the <a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> ).</p><p> Second, set your aperture to around f/8 or so. This is where your lens will be most crisp, plus it will give you enough depth of field to get wingtip-to-wingtip sharpness.</p><p> Third, set your ISO to its lowest value, which is generally around ISO 100. The goal here is to avoid boosting the ISO, which will create <em>noise</em> . That said, when photographing in low light, you&#39;ll need to raise the ISO to increase the shutter speed.</p><p> Now, in birds in flight photography, the shutter speed is probably the most essential setting, because if you get it too slow, the bird&#39;s wings will blur, and this rarely looks good. In general, I&#39;d recommend using a shutter speed of at least 1/1000s, and 1/2000s and beyond is better. (Your minimum shutter speed will change, though, depending on the speed of the bird; large birds in flight, like herons and geese, are slow, whereas small birds in flight, such as wrens, dart through the sky.)</p><p> Anyway, dial in the aperture and ISO, then look at your shutter speed, which your camera will select based purely on exposure considerations. Ask yourself: Is this shutter speed fast enough? If so, then you&#39;re golden – but if not, you&#39;ll need to either raise your ISO or widen your aperture so that your camera has enough light to boost the shutter speed.</p><p> I&#39;d recommend boosting the ISO before you adjust the aperture. But if your ISO is creeping into noisy territory, it might make sense to widen the aperture rather than risk a too-noisy image.</p><p> Once you&#39;ve dialed in all your settings, I&#39;d recommend doing a quick test. Capture a few photos of nearby birds (they don&#39;t need to be well composed – the goal is to make sure your shutter speed is fast enough and your aperture is narrow enough). Zoom in on your camera LCD, make sure everything looks good, then have fun photographing birds in flight! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="learn-good-focusing-technique"> 7.

That way, whenever you half press the shutter button, the focus will engage – then it will <em>refocus</em> as your subject moves. (Nikon and many other manufacturers call this mode “AF-C,” though Canon calls it “AI Servo.”)</p><p> You should set your camera to its fastest <a aria-label="burst mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/burst-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">burst mode</a> , also known as its continuous shooting mode. This will let you capture a series of images in quick succession as a bird flies by.</p><p> Next, you&#39;ll want to engage your camera&#39;s tracking AF-area mode. It&#39;ll tell your camera to track the bird through the frame, even as it flies left and right, up and down, etc. The specifics will depend on your camera, but some form of “tracking” should do the trick. Also, if your camera offers it, try activating your animal Eye AF, which will specifically identify and track birds&#39; eyes through the frame.</p><p> Then, once your camera is set, start focusing on the bird when it&#39;s either a) perching and about to take off, or b) flying far off in the distance. Half-press the shutter button, and keep tracking the bird as it takes off and/or comes closer. Once the bird flies into the prime area, press the shutter button down completely, fire off a burst of shots, and – fingers crossed! – you&#39;ll get a good result.</p><p> A few additional tips:</p><p> When the bird flies by, keep panning even after you&#39;ve stopped shooting. This follow-through motion will keep your last image in focus better than an abrupt stop.</p><p> Also, when panning as the bird flies by, you want to match your panning speed to that of the bird. Even if you&#39;re forced to drop your shutter speed, perfect panning will keep the bird sharp while the background blurs.</p><p> Aim to keep the bird&#39;s eye in focus and sharp; this is key. If you are handholding your setup, try to keep your left hand under the barrel of your lens and your elbows close to your body, as this will help you maneuver the camera as steadily as possible. If you are standing, keep your legs spread out to create a good sturdy base.</p><p> Finally, if you&#39;re planning to hold your location and position for a time, I recommend a tripod. This will help keep your camera steady, especially if you&#39;re using a very heavy lens. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="aim-for-a-powerful-composition"> 8.
