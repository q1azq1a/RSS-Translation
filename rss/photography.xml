还是其他编辑软件，功能都非常丰富，不可能将所有功能映射到几个按钮上。这就是为什么值得您花时间编写一些按钮，然后花时间学习尽可能多的键盘快捷键 - 特别是那些与您通常的编辑工作流程一致的键盘快捷键。</p><p>不可否认，一开始使用手写笔并用另一只手点击键盘快捷键可能看起来有点奇怪。但要勇往直前，坚持下去；你很快就会发现它并不像乍看起来那么令人畏惧。</p><h2 data-section

class="wp-element-caption">在该图像中，地面上的条带充当引导线，引导眼睛看向背景。</figcaption></figure></div><p>当用作构图技术时，引导线通常会移向照片的主要主题。例如，一条河流可能会引导人们的眼睛看到背景中一座被雾气覆盖的山，或者一根圆木可能会引导人们的眼睛看到令人惊叹的日落。</p><p>请注意，引导线可以是<em>任何东西</em>：河流或原木，如上面的示例中提到的，但也可以是道路上的标记、海滩上的尖石、沙子上的线条、房屋的墙壁 - 如果它看起来像一条线并且能够引导观看者的眼睛，那么它可以用作引导线！</p><h2 data-section id="types-of-leading-lines-to-consider">要考虑的引导线类型</h2><p>您可能会将引导线视为摄影工具箱中的一个整体工具。然而，它们的用途远比您想象的要多，并且可以以各种形式出现。</p><p>例如，我们可以根据这些线的方向来识别它们：垂直、水平或对角线。垂直引导线从框架底部向顶部延伸。这种方法增加了深度，因为线条邀请观众踏上场景之旅。水平线从画面的一侧移动到另一侧，增加了强度，而对角线则引入了动态运动。</p><p>引导线也不限于直线。尽管直线更常见，但不要低估曲线的视觉吸引力。想象一下海滩上卷曲的波浪或向观察者伸展的下垂的树枝。底线：两种线条都有其独特的魅力，曲线提供了直线很少能达到的流动感和优雅感。</p><h2 data-section id="why-are-leading-lines-important">为什么引导线很重要？</h2><p>引导线引导观众浏览构图。</p><p>因此，通过在画面中仔细放置引导线，您可以将注意力吸引到照片中重要的区域，例如美丽的山脉或海上的日落。换句话说，您可以使用引导线让观看者看到您希望他们看到的地方，并避开您希望他们避开的区域。</p><p>您还可以使用引导线在整个构图中创建<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/visual-flow-composition/" target="_blank" aria-label="flow (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">流动</a>（通常称为<em>动态）</em> 。引导线自然地带领观看者围绕照片进行旅程，这让他们保持参与（总是一件好事！）。</p><p>另外，引导线是在图像中创建三维（即<a aria-label="depth (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/depth-dimension-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">深度</a>）的好方法。通过强调线条的起点，然后让它消失在背景中，您可以创造出在风景摄影中看起来<em>令人难以置信的</em>3D 幻觉。</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span

使用可用的最广角镜头</h3><p>您<em>不需要</em>广角镜头来创作令人惊叹的引导线构图。</p><p>但这确实非常有帮助。</p><p>为什么？好吧，广角镜头可以让你捕捉广阔的场景——这样你就可以将引导线定位在画面底部，然后让它们流入镜头，慢慢地越来越远，直到它们消失（或到达你的主要拍摄对象）。</p><p>将此与长焦构图进行比较，其中引导线通常从靠近主体的位置开始，然后快速终止。缺乏活力、缺乏趣味性、缺乏三维度。</p><p>正是出于这个原因，许多风景摄影师都使用超广角焦距进行拍摄。他们经常找到一条引导线，使用广角镜头来强调它，并创造出令人惊叹的深度构图。</p><p>合理？</p><div

/></span></figure></div><p>使用起来也非常简单。这就是你要做的：</p><p>首先，确保你的引导线足够引人注目。它本身应该成为一个主题——就像一块有趣的岩石或一片五颜六色的花朵。</p><p>其次，确保使用宽焦距。我建议至少使用 35 毫米（在全画幅相机上），但 24 毫米、18 毫米甚至 14 毫米更好。</p><p>第三，将相机安装在三脚架上，并降低到拍摄对象的上方。您希望引导线在画面中突出，即使这意味着距离拍摄对象只有几英寸。您需要调<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="narrow aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">小光圈</a>，例如 f/8、f/11，甚至 f/16，以保持前景和背景清晰。</p><p>你的最终镜头将看起来令人难以置信——有一个有趣的前景主题，一条引导眼睛的线条，再加上（希望如此！）一个有趣的背景主题来完成构图。</p><h3 data-section id="embrace-the-s-curve"> 4.拥抱S曲线</h3><p>S 曲线是风景摄影师中流行的工具，它当然不是一般的引导线；这是一条蜿蜒的小路，以迷人的 S 形远离镜头。它受到人们喜爱是有原因的：它为图像增添了深刻的深度感和活力。</p><p>如果你足够仔细的话，你可以在大自然中找到这些优美的曲线，尤其是在河流中。如果您一直在寻找但尚未确定可在您的作品中使用的 S 曲线，那么您就需要发挥创意了。也许沙滩上有脚印，或者秋天有一些树叶。不管是什么，诀窍是用广角镜头靠近以强调曲线。</p><p>此外，曲线在构图中的位置也至关重要。常见的做法是将 S 曲线放置在画面的中心，引导观看者的眼睛看向远处引人注目的元素，例如山脉或瀑布。但请随意尝试并找到最适合您的方法。</p><h3 data-section id="study-the-work-of-other-photographers"> 5.研究其他摄影师的作品</h3><p>这是真正深入研究引导线力量的好方法吗？查看您最喜欢的射手的作品。</p><p>几乎每个摄影师在其职业生涯的某个阶段都会利用主导线，而真正伟大的摄影师善于利用它们将平凡变成非凡。首先，挑选一些您最喜欢的照片，并研究摄影师如何使用引导线来创作引人注目的构图。</p><p>引导线放置在哪里？它们是垂直的，向天空延伸，还是水平的，横跨整个框架？也许它们是对角排列的，增加了一种运动感？或者它们是弯曲的，为图像增加了一层额外的复杂性？这里的目的是向工艺大师学习，并培养自己对强大引导线的洞察力。</p><p>当您在自己的摄影中遇到类似情况时，请使用这些见解来指导您的方法。随着时间的推移，您将开始在各处看到引导线，并且有效地使用它们将成为第二天性。</p><h2

noopener" class="ek-link">Manual exposure</a> can be a tough nut to crack. Deciphering the exposure meter, calculating adjustments, grasping how light bounces off varying surfaces and hues – it&#39;s a lot for a newcomer. So the natural fallback is the handy Auto mode.</p><p> An electronic viewfinder, though, simplifies manual exposure control because it&#39;s visual. With a mirrorless camera, what you behold in the viewfinder is a fair preview of your shot. The moment you tweak your exposure controls, the viewfinder reflects those changes. It&#39;s like getting a sneak peek into your shot before you press the shutter button. Thus, mastering manual exposure becomes a breeze.</p><p> But there&#39;s a catch. On certain cameras, you might need to tweak settings so the electronic viewfinder reflects exposure alterations. This is crucial if the viewfinder&#39;s brightness level stays put despite changes in exposure.</p><p> Additionally, before you head out and start shooting with an EVF-laden mirrorless camera, make sure your viewfinder&#39;s brightness is neutral. If the screen is too dim or too bright, it can lead to overexposed or underexposed shots. However, don&#39;t fret over slight discrepancies. Modern cameras come packed with high-dynamic-range sensors that can compensate for minor differences.</p><h3 data-section id="advantage-evfs-offer-advanced-focus-information"> Advantage #2: EVFs offer advanced focus information</h3><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254723" style="width:2500px"><span class="space" style="width:2500px; padding-top:66.72%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2500" height="1668" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bamboo.jpg?resize=2500%2C1668&#038;ssl=1" alt="bamboo © Kevin Landwer-Johan" class="wp-image-254723" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bamboo.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bamboo.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bamboo.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bamboo.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bamboo.jpg?resize=1536%2C1025&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bamboo.jpg?resize=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bamboo.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bamboo.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> When I peer into my DSLR camera&#39;s viewfinder, I see a tiny illuminated spot indicating the image is focused. But with my mirrorless camera&#39;s electronic viewfinder, I&#39;m privy to much more focus detail.</p><p> Each camera brand has its own unique way of highlighting the focused area. My Lumix camera, for example, displays a light blue overlay on the sharply focused regions.</p><p> This comes in super handy when you&#39;re using a multipoint autofocus option. You see, cameras don&#39;t always focus on the desired area. But a quick look at the focus details in your electronic viewfinder gives you a clear picture of what&#39;s in focus.</p><h3 data-section id="advantage-an-electronic-viewfinder-displays-in-camera-edits"> Advantage #3: An electronic viewfinder displays in-camera edits</h3><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254724" style="width:1024px"><span class="space" style="width:1024px; padding-top:66.7%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flower.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="spiky flower © Kevin Landwer-Johan" class="wp-image-254724" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flower.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flower.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flower.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flower.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flower.jpg?resize=1536%2C1025&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flower.jpg?resize=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flower.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flower.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Most cameras come loaded with various profile modes, like monochrome, portrait, or vivid, to jazz up your photos as you shoot them.

Sometimes, it&#39;s crucial to review an image, especially if you&#39;re unsure about your exposure settings.</p><p> Photographers often use the camera&#39;s monitor for this, but that could be problematic in bright sunlight. Glare reflecting off the monitor can diminish the clarity of your photos. But with your electronic viewfinder, you can review your photos without the distraction of reflected light, giving you a more accurate impression of your work.</p><h2 data-section id="a-note-about-electronic-viewfinder-quality"> A note about electronic viewfinder quality</h2><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254725" style="width:2500px"><span class="space" style="width:2500px; padding-top:66.68%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2500" height="1667" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rice-view.jpg?resize=2500%2C1667&#038;ssl=1" alt="rice fields in the sun © Kevin Landwer-Johan" class="wp-image-254725" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rice-view.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rice-view.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rice-view.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rice-view.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rice-view.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rice-view.jpg?resize=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rice-view.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rice-view.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Electronic viewfinders are a bit like people – no two are exactly alike. You&#39;ll see variations in resolution from camera model to camera model, and even across different manufacturers.</p><p> This might sound technical, but here&#39;s the simple takeaway: the higher the viewfinder&#39;s resolution, the crisper your image will look. Just like with smartphones and TVs, this is a technology that&#39;s advancing rapidly. With every new mirrorless camera that hits the shelves, we&#39;re seeing viewfinders that pack in more detail than ever before.</p><p> Don&#39;t forget to consider the difference between LCD and OLED viewfinders, too. As a rule of thumb, OLEDs are generally brighter and render colors more realistically.</p><h2 data-section id="electronic-viewfinders-in-photography-final-words"> Electronic viewfinders in photography: final words</h2><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254722" style="width:2500px"><span class="space" style="width:2500px; padding-top:66.72%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2500" height="1668" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elephants.jpg?resize=2500%2C1668&#038;ssl=1" alt="elephants in a river © Kevin Landwer-Johan" class="wp-image-254722" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elephants.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elephants.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elephants.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elephants.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elephants.jpg?resize=1536%2C1025&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elephants.jpg?resize=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elephants.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elephants.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Switching from a DSLR&#39;s optical viewfinder to an electronic one can feel a little like learning to ride a bike all over again. It requires a bit of a mental shift, sure, but trust me, it&#39;s worth it. The benefits far outweigh the initial discomfort.</p><p> One of the biggest perks, especially if you&#39;re just getting the hang of manual mode, is being able to see the effect of your adjustments in real time. Tweak the aperture, dial in a different shutter speed, mix up the ISO settings – and you&#39;ll see the result right in your viewfinder. For those of us who are visual learners (and let&#39;s face it, most photographers are), this is a game-changer. It&#39;s much more intuitive than trying to decipher a camera&#39;s exposure meter.</p><p> Believe me when I say that an electronic viewfinder can make photography even more enjoyable! They simplify some of the technical aspects of shooting, which means you can focus more on capturing the scene in front of you.</p><p> Finally, don&#39;t worry too much about comparing electronic and optical viewfinders. They both have their strong points, and I frequently use both in my own work, so you certainly shouldn&#39;t stress over the difference.</p><p> Now over to you:</p><p> <em>Do you plan to use an electronic viewfinder?为什么或者为什么不？在下面的评论中分享您的想法！</em></p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/electronic-viewfinders/">The Essential Guide to Electronic Viewfinders</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com">Digital Photography School</a> .

Pick the right equipment </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Fig-8.jpg?ssl=1" alt="soccer photography action scene" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> <a aria-label="Sports photography (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/introduction-to-sports-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Sports photography</a> , perhaps more than any other photographic genre, depends on gear. For the best results, you need a fast-shooting camera and a capable lens.</p><p> The best soccer photography cameras offer top-notch autofocus systems (ideally with face and eye tracking) and powerful <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/burst-mode/" target="_blank" aria-label="continuous shooting modes (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">continuous shooting modes</a> . The tracking algorithms will help you maintain focus on players as they sprint across the field, while the continuous shooting will let you fire off bursts of shots so you can capture the perfect moment.</p><p> Unfortunately, high-level sports cameras – like the <a href="https://geni.us/CanonEOSR3" target="_blank" aria-label="Canon EOS R3 (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Canon EOS R3</a> , <a href="https://geni.us/SonyA1dPS" target="_blank" aria-label="Sony a1 (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Sony a1</a> , <a href="https://geni.us/Sonya9IIdPS" target="_blank" aria-label="Sony a9 II (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Sony a9 II</a> , and <a href="https://geni.us/NikonZ9dPSLens" target="_blank" aria-label="Nikon Z9 (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Nikon Z9</a> – are very expensive, but I&#39;d encourage you to at least invest in a full-frame camera like the <a href="https://geni.us/Sonya7IV" target="_blank" aria-label="Sony a7 IV (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Sony a7 IV</a> or the <a href="https://geni.us/CanonEOSr6" target="_blank" aria-label="Canon EOS R6 (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Canon EOS R6</a> . You might also consider an action-centric APS-C model like the <a href="https://geni.us/CanonEOSR7dPS" target="_blank" aria-label="Canon EOS R7 (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Canon EOS R7</a> or the <a href="https://geni.us/NikonD500APSCCamera" target="_blank" aria-label="Nikon D500 (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Nikon D500</a> .</p><p> As for lenses:</p><p> You&#39;ll need at least one dedicated action lens; for best results, an 18-55mm or 55-200mm kit lens just won&#39;t be sufficient. In the former case, the players and the action will be too far away, and in the latter case, you&#39;ll struggle to capture sharp shots in low light.</p><p> Instead, grab a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/every-photographer-needs-70-200mm-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="70-200mm lens (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">70-200mm lens</a> to start out. If you can afford it, get an f/2.8 model, which will give you extra flexibility when working indoors or at night. Note that 200mm is long enough to shoot close and mid-distance players, but it&#39;s always helpful to add some extra power to your gear bag, so if you can afford a 300mm or 400mm lens – or a 200-400mm zoom – you&#39;ll be <em>very</em> well equipped. (Anything longer than 400mm can get a little too tight unless you want to photograph players at the other end of the field.) </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Fig-3.jpg?ssl=1" alt="soccer photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> If you have a decent lens but find that it isn&#39;t quite long enough, you don&#39;t need to rush out and buy a longer model. Try cropping, which can get you much closer to the action and can still give you highly detailed results (as long as you&#39;re using a higher-megapixel camera). And if you&#39;re not sure whether it&#39;s worth buying a new lens, you can always rent some glass for a day or two.</p><h2 data-section id="carry-a-monopod"> 2.

Yes, you can handhold a hefty 70-200mm f/2.8 lens, or even a 400mm monster, but why put all that strain on your arms? That&#39;s where a monopod comes in. It&#39;s your best friend on the soccer pitch, providing support for your gear and sparing your arms from fatigue.</p><p> So why do I rate monopods so highly? Well, they keep your arms from getting tired too quickly. They&#39;re slim, lightweight, and easy to lug around – perfect for those sudden location changes or angle adjustments. Plus, they help reduce camera shake. This is vital when dealing with telephoto lenses, notorious for shaking-induced blur.</p><p> And let&#39;s not forget, many soccer games take place under dim indoor lights or after sunset. Under such challenging lighting conditions, even a tiny camera shake can result in blurry photos. But a monopod? It steadies your camera like a rock, ensuring tack-sharp shots.</p><p> I guarantee you won&#39;t break the bank on a decent monopod, and they&#39;re a cinch to pack and carry. One final tip: take a small camp stool along. Trust me, your back will thank you, and you&#39;ll find that low-angle shots can give your soccer photos a fresh, engaging perspective.</p><h2 data-section id="carefully-choose-your-soccer-photography-settings"> 3. Carefully choose your soccer photography settings</h2><p> I like to shoot in <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> ; it gives me plenty of flexibility, and it lets me adjust my settings as needed to cope with changing light. If you&#39;re not comfortable working in Manual mode, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/" target="_blank" aria-label="Shutter Priority mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Shutter Priority mode</a> is your best option (and it&#39;s especially great at handling fields that feature both sun and shade).</p><p> You&#39;ll need to pick the right <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> to freeze the action. I&#39;d recommend 1/800s as the absolute minimum for advanced players (though you can drop the shutter speed down to 1/500s or so if you&#39;re photographing younger players). Really, when it comes to photographing fast-paced movement, the higher the shutter speed, the better – so if you have the room to boost the shutter to 1/1000s, 1/2000s, or even 1/4000s, just do it. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Fig-5b.jpg?ssl=1" alt="soccer photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> That said, ultra-slow shutter speeds can create some fantastic – and highly artistic – images when done correctly. Working at 1/30s is a good starting point, and if you find that you capture too much blur, simply speed up the shutter by a couple of notches. Conversely, if you end up with too little blur, you may need to slow the shutter speed down. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Fig-4b.jpg?ssl=1" alt="soccer photography tips slow shutter speed blur" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> If you&#39;re using Shutter Priority mode, then your camera will choose the aperture for you – but you&#39;ll control it indirectly via your shutter speed choice. And if you&#39;re using Manual mode, you&#39;ll need to choose your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> directly. So what aperture is best?</p><p> For single-player shots, f/2.8 is generally ideal, as it will do a very nice job of isolating the subject. However, when photographing moments that feature more than one player (eg, tackles), if you have enough light, then use f/4 (it&#39;ll give you a slight <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> increase). Of course, some lenses cannot reach f/2.8 or even f/4, and in such scenarios, just use the widest aperture you have available.</p><p> You&#39;ll also need to choose an <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> , and I encourage you to use this to simply fill in the gaps between your aperture-shutter speed combination and the brightness you want to achieve. It&#39;s best to keep the ISO as low as possible – the higher the ISO, the more noise you&#39;ll get in your images – so on bright days, I often work at ISO 400. Low-light scenarios – for instance, when shooting at dusk, at night, indoors, or on a heavily overcast day – require an ISO boost, however, so ISO 800, 1600, and beyond may be required.</p><p> Spend some time testing out different ISO settings on your camera, as different models handle high ISOs differently. These days, you can often work at ISO 1600 with minimal noise, but it really depends heavily on your camera, so make sure you know how it&#39;ll perform <em>before</em> you head out to shoot.</p><p> Additionally, <a aria-label="picking the correct autofocus mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/choosing-a-focus-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">picking the correct autofocus mode</a> is absolutely essential to capturing sharp shots. Don&#39;t use your camera&#39;s AF-S (or One-Shot) mode; make sure you switch your camera to AF-C (or AI-Servo), which will continually reacquire focus as your subject moves.</p><p> And if your camera offers a good tracking mode, use it! You want to be able to follow players as effectively as possible, and if you have to constantly reselect focus points as your subjects move, you&#39;ll miss out on too many shots.</p><p> Finally, your camera&#39;s burst mode can be an absolute <em>game-changer</em> . You might know it as continuous shooting mode, but whichever name you prefer, this tool allows you to fire off a whole series of photos in just a couple of seconds.</p><p> With burst mode, you&#39;re no longer worried about missing that split-second shot. You&#39;re equipped to freeze heart-stopping moments that pass in the blink of an eye. One caveat, though: The more you use burst mode, the more photos you&#39;ll end up with. That means more time spent sorting through them all, but in my view, it&#39;s a small price to pay for the spectacular shots you can capture.</p><h2 data-section id="get-in-the-right-position"> 4. Get in the right position</h2><p> As with any sport, if you can sit in the right place, you&#39;ll have a much better chance of nailing key shots. I generally recommend working from a few specific places, as I detail in the diagram below: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Fig-1.jpg?ssl=1" alt="soccer photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> And here&#39;s a breakdown of each option (note that the position numbers correspond to the numbers on the map):</p><ul><li> <strong>Position 1:</strong> Working near the corner (slightly behind the goal line) will give you some great shots of players as they run with the ball toward you. You can also get some great shots of goals, too. This position is very versatile as you can get a good mix of everything.</li><li> <strong>Position 2:</strong> Working halfway between both goals is a great way to shoot goals (as you can generally capture both the goalie and the goal shooter in a single frame). You&#39;ll also be able to capture players running down the field, though if they&#39;re running down the sides, the shots may not be as head-on.</li><li> <strong>Position 3:</strong> For some variation, try shooting from the sideline near the corner. You&#39;ll be able to capture some great panning shots of players with the ball as they run the length of the field. You generally won&#39;t be able to get many great goal shots from Position 3, but you may be able to capture some great tackle photos if the action happens around midfield.</li></ul><p> I don&#39;t recommend you pick a spot and stay in the same place for the game; instead, sit in one location for a while, then move around half-time or so. That way, you can capture a variety of images.</p><p> Whatever you do, don&#39;t be tempted to run around the field following the ball. You will be forever running and not photographing! It is much better to sit in one location and wait for the action to come to you. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Fig-10.jpg?ssl=1" alt="soccer photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 data-section id="keep-an-eye-out-for-key-moments"> 5. Keep an eye out for key moments</h2><p> The best soccer shots tend to feature some kind of <em>action</em> . So always be scanning for these moments, and when you see them, get your finger on that shutter button! In particular, look for:</p><p> <strong>Celebrations</strong> . These could be from the team that just scored a goal, or – after the final whistle – from the team that won the match.</p><p> Here, teammates celebrate after scoring a goal in the rain: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Fig-6.jpg?ssl=1" alt="soccer photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> You can also show emotion on the faces of the losing players: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Fig-12.jpg?ssl=1" alt="soccer photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> <strong>In-game action</strong> , including tackles, headers, dives, slides, goals, and goal saves. These moments occur frequently throughout the game, so keep your eyes open. It&#39;s essential that you stay focused. And bear in mind that older players generally play with more intensity than younger players, so if you photograph more advanced leagues, you&#39;ll have more opportunities to capture dramatic tackles. (Just remember: Older players move a lot faster, so you&#39;ll need to crank up that shutter speed and be ready for anything!)</p><p> Here, one player is pushing the other: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Fig-2.jpg?ssl=1" alt="soccer photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Here, a player is taking a shot at the goal: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Fig-7.jpg?ssl=1" alt="soccer photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> And here, a player is heading the ball. (For this type of shot, you must capture the ball close to the player&#39;s head. If the ball is too far away, it can get lost! Also, the player&#39;s expression is generally best when the ball has just hit their head!) </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Fig-9.jpg?ssl=1" alt="soccer photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> <strong>The crowd</strong> . If you&#39;re covering a game with lots of fans, don&#39;t forget to get some shots of them, too. They can add lots of atmosphere! Try to capture emotion; often, the fans are just as excited as the team when a goal is scored, though when the team is about to lose, they may get very quiet.</p><h2 data-section id="know-the-game"> 6.

You never know when a tidbit of information might help you capture an amazing photo.</p><p> Not a soccer fan?没问题。 It&#39;s time to hit the books, tune in to commentaries, and perhaps join a local league for an immersive experience. A deep understanding of the game allows you to predict events before they happen, giving you a distinct advantage behind the lens.</p><p> Moreover, knowing the teams and players you&#39;ll be shooting can give you that extra edge. Research their style, their strengths, their weaknesses. Pay special attention to key players, understand their unique tactics. A star player&#39;s signature slide-tackle or header goal, if captured at the right moment, can be a truly sensational shot.</p><h2 data-section id="dont-be-afraid-to-start-small"> 7.

Sure, the players steal the spotlight, and they should. But the setting they&#39;re playing in can make or break your shots.

Instead, a clean, uncluttered backdrop will highlight the players and lend your photo a professional touch.</p><p> Keep a keen eye on the surroundings while you&#39;re on the field. Identify any potential disturbances in the background and try to avoid shooting against them. You&#39;re not just watching the game; you&#39;re seeing beyond it.</p><p> Creating a pleasant blur in the background can also make a huge difference. That blur effect, known as <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" aria-label="bokeh (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">bokeh</a> , helps separate the players from the background and makes any distractions less noticeable. To achieve the best bokeh, make sure you use a wide aperture. Also, photographing players when they&#39;re closer to you – and farther from the backdrop – can enhance the blur effect.</p><p> One more piece of advice: Consider getting down low. This way, you&#39;ll have the stadium walls and the crowd, not the turf, serving as your backdrop.</p><h2 data-section id="capture-a-few-wider-shots"> 9.

It&#39;s understandable; telephoto lenses help you get right in the thick of the game, capturing those high-energy moments in stunning detail. But there&#39;s a place for wider shots, too.</p><p> For one, a wider lens can offer a different perspective and adds diversity to your shots. It can also frame the game in a broader context, capturing the stadium&#39;s ambiance, the cheering crowd, or even the dramatic sky overhead during an open-air game.</p><p> So carry along a wide lens and experiment with it. Try shooting the stadium as it fills up with excited fans. Get a wide shot of the entire field during a key moment of the match. Or capture the collective emotions of the crowd – their celebrations, disappointments, and everything in between.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254746" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:50.13%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="752" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/soccer-photography-7.jpg?resize=1500%2C752&#038;ssl=1" alt="Soccer photography tips" class="wp-image-254746" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/soccer-photography-7.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/soccer-photography-7.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/soccer-photography-7.jpg?resize=600%2C301&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/soccer-photography-7.jpg?resize=768%2C385&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/soccer-photography-7.jpg?resize=717%2C359&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> While these images might not pack the same intense punch as a close-up action shot, they serve a different purpose. They add layers to the story of the game, giving it depth and richness. And they add variety to your portfolio. So next time you head out to photograph a soccer match, remember to go wide every once in a while. It might just result in the shot that completes the story.</p><h2 data-section id="edit-and-share-your-best-shots"> 10.

Correct the white balance, adjust exposure levels, and ensure the colors pop just right. A little boost in clarity will add that extra crispness to your images.</p><p> You can also consider adding a vignette effect to guide the viewer&#39;s focus toward the players. But remember, subtlety is key. Your viewers should feel the effect, not see it.</p><p> Finally, select the images you&#39;d be proud to put your name on. These are the shots that tell the story of the game. Share them with the world, be it on social media, your personal blog, or a news site.

(Just remember, each image should share at least a third of its scene with its neighbors!)</p><p> Back home, you&#39;ll need to stitch these images together using a software program. Even basic tools like Lightroom Classic have potent panorama stitching capabilities, so this step will be a breeze.</p><p> A pro tip: A wide-angle lens can work wonders for panoramas. It lets you capture stunning skies and include more of the foreground along with the background, adding depth and scale to your images. The results?

Bad move.</p><p> Imagine being in a foreign land, capturing once-in-a-lifetime vistas, only to return with a memory card full of subpar shots, all thanks to an avoidable camera setting blunder.</p><p> That&#39;s where your camera manual comes in. Take the time to understand how your camera works, and acquaint yourself with its nifty features. This will let you optimize key settings and avoid pitfalls like snapping shots at needlessly high ISOs.</p><p> And guess what? When you&#39;re on your travels, a solid understanding of your camera doesn&#39;t just level up your photo game – it adds to the fun too! With your newfound knowledge, you&#39;ll be all the more eager to explore and capture.</p><h2 data-section id="play-the-long-game"> 6.

But when you&#39;re enveloped in the beauty of unfamiliar landscapes, it&#39;s crucial not to lose your focus. Sure, you might be tempted to capture every fascinating detail that catches your eye. But it&#39;s important to take a step back and focus on the larger picture.</p><p> Seeing everything through your lens might be tempting, but remember, you&#39;re here for the truly special shots, not just the ordinary. Getting too engrossed in indiscriminate shooting could cost you the really magnificent scenes you&#39;ve dreamed about capturing. To get that one perfect shot of a sunset-soaked beach or a snow-capped mountain, patience – and determination – is your ally.</p><p> For instance, the image displayed above didn&#39;t require a stroke of luck. It was the fruit of persistence. I walked for what felt like miles, bypassing people and zooming 4WDs, before I found this tranquil scene. I was able to grab a few hand-held shots before the light faded, but if I had stopped to capture every interesting vista along the way, I might have missed out on this gem.</p><p> So when you set out with a specific shot in mind, stay the course. That said, if a more captivating opportunity presents itself, be ready to switch gears. Flexibility is your secret weapon in landscape photography, and recognizing an unexpected golden opportunity is a skill worth honing.</p><h2 data-section id="use-that-tripod-whenever-you-can"> 7. Use that tripod whenever you can</h2><p> In the section on gear above, I encouraged you to invest in a good-quality tripod. However, a tripod is worth nothing if you don&#39;t take advantage of it, so let me remind you: Use the tripod whenever you can!</p><p> When the day gives way to dusk, and handheld shots are no longer feasible, your tripod can be a lifesaver. Once your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> dips below 1/100s, a tripod will have your back, providing the rock-solid support needed for pin-sharp images. Bonus point – it&#39;ll allow you to play with long-exposure effects, transforming flowing rivers or drifting clouds into breathtaking, ethereal visions.</p><p> The tripod, however, isn&#39;t just a nighttime tool. Even in broad daylight, using a tripod encourages a more thoughtful approach to composing your images. It allows you to set up and perfect your composition well before the light conditions peak. That way, when the ideal moment comes, you can focus on capturing the scene rather than fiddling with the frame.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254631" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Lauca-9838.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="旅游风光摄影" class="wp-image-254631" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Lauca-9838.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Lauca-9838.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Lauca-9838.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Lauca-9838.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Lauca-9838.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Lauca-9838.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="keep-your-horizon-level"> 8. Keep your horizon level</h2><p> This one&#39;s a common pitfall for beginners in landscape photography – skewing the horizon. Amid the excitement of capturing an inspiring view, you might forget this simple yet crucial element.</p><p> So here&#39;s a quick reminder: Keep an eye on the horizon. Strive to align it straight for a more balanced and level photo. Remember, all horizontal elements should run parallel to the bottom of the frame and all vertical elements should be perfectly perpendicular, unless you&#39;re aiming for a deliberately angled perspective.</p><p> Yes, you can fix a tilted horizon during post-processing. But remember, straightening the image means cropping off some pixels around the edges. The more you need to straighten, the more pixels you lose. So why not nail it right in the field?</p><p> Here&#39;s a pro tip for those struggling with straight horizons: consider a bubble level. Attach it to your camera&#39;s hot shoe, and you&#39;ll get straight shots, whether you&#39;re going low- or high-angle, even while handholding!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254629" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_5946.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="travel landscape photography" class="wp-image-254629" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_5946.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_5946.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_5946.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_5946.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_5946.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_5946.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="think-constantly-about-the-lighting"> 9. Think constantly about the lighting</h2><p> One major player in the game of travel landscape photography? The light. It&#39;s a bit of a chameleon, changing in quality throughout the day, morphing from soft and warm to neutral and harsh. Even your position in relation to your subject influences the lighting angle.</p><p> There&#39;s no universal <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/landscape-photography-about-light/" target="_blank" aria-label="&quot;perfect light&quot; in landscape photography (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">“perfect light” in landscape photography</a> . It&#39;s a personal dance between your style and the subjects you&#39;re capturing. But remember this: always, always be alert to the light!</p><p> Start by envisioning your subjects. Consider when they&#39;ll look their best – during midday when light is abundant, or perhaps at the start and end of the day when light is more dramatic and golden. If you&#39;ll be traveling without a car, make sure your planned times sync with your mode of transport. And don&#39;t forget to plan how to reach your location right on time.</p><p> Next, mull over lighting direction. Frontlighting will give you more detail, side-lighting brings in drama with heavy shadows, while backlighting, although tricky to handle, can elevate the atmosphere of your shot. If you&#39;re unsure, experiment! Click away under different lighting, it&#39;s better to have too many shots than too few!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254632" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3F6A5272.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="旅游风光摄影" class="wp-image-254632" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3F6A5272.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3F6A5272.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3F6A5272.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3F6A5272.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3F6A5272.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3F6A5272.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="work-hard-on-your-compositions"> 10.

How you arrange the elements within your frame, how your shots are structured—it can add a rhythm and balance to each image. Take a seascape photograph as an example. Where should the horizon line sit? At the bottom, top, or smack in the middle? This is the essence of composition, and it certainly needs your attention!</p><p> Working on your landscape compositions during your travels can do wonders for your confidence and skill. Read about various composition techniques before your trip, and try implementing them when you&#39;re on the field.</p><p> When you&#39;re shooting, search for <a aria-label="leading lines (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-leading-lines-for-better-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">leading lines</a> that guide the eye through the landscape and engage the viewer, like a winding path through the wilderness. And experiment with the <a aria-label="rule of thirds (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">rule of thirds</a> . Try positioning your main subject off-center, or place the horizon one-third or two-thirds into the frame.</p><p> You might find composition to be technical or even mundane at first, but give it a chance.

You want to let your gear do the heavy lifting, so here&#39;s what you need to know:</p><p> To capture intricate details and fill the frame with your fluttering subject, opt for a telephoto or long <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lenses-for-macro-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="macro lens (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">macro lens</a> . These lenses have the reach and magnification power to get you up close and personal with the butterflies.</p><p> If you have access to it, a telephoto lens in the range of 200-500mm can do a good job. However, pay attention to the lens&#39;s minimum focusing distance when making your selection. Some telephoto lenses excel at zooming in from a distance but struggle to focus on objects up close. Given the small size of butterflies, this is an essential factor to consider.</p><p> For exceptional results, a dedicated telephoto macro lens, such as a 150mm or 180mm lens, is hard to beat.这些镜头以其出色的清晰度而闻名。 However, even with a 180mm lens, you&#39;ll still need to exercise patience and get fairly close to the butterflies to fill the frame effectively.</p><h2 data-section id="use-a-tripod-but-keep-the-head-loose"> 2.

This means that you often won&#39;t have the luxury of time to set up your equipment and lock your tripod in place. However, using a tripod can still offer stability, minimizing the risk of camera shake and resulting in sharper images.</p><p> My suggestion? Bring a tripod along, but keep the head loose. This way, you can swiftly move your camera to follow the butterflies while still enjoying the benefits of added stability. It will also save your arms from fatigue while you wait for your subject to strike the perfect pose.</p><p> If a tripod feels too cumbersome or restrictive for your shooting style, consider a solid alternative: a monopod. Unlike tripods, monopods have just one leg, making them easy to maneuver and adjust as you track butterflies in motion. They are also lighter and more convenient to pack, which is a definite plus when you&#39;re out in the field.</p><p> Finally, some butterfly photographers prefer the freedom and flexibility of shooting handheld. If you opt for this approach, make sure your lens or camera has image stabilization to help counteract camera shake and work on your handholding technique. Remember to keep those elbows tucked in and consider bending your knees or even kneeling on the ground for added support!</p><h2 data-section id="wait-for-colder-weather"> 3.

One secret to success lies in taking advantage of colder weather conditions.当外面寒冷的时候，蝴蝶往往会表现得很轻松。他们变得不太愿意四处晃动（即使他们发现一位热情的摄影师挥舞着大镜头！）。</p><p>因此，为了最大限度地提高获得完美照片的机会，最好将蝴蝶摄影郊游安排在天气变冷的日子。 Alternatively, you can aim for early morning sessions, as discussed later on in this article. Just after sunrise, you&#39;ll find the butterflies in a more relaxed state, and it&#39;ll give you ample opportunity to capture their delicate beauty.</p><p> Of course, don&#39;t forget to bundle up appropriately!

Whether you choose to get up close or use a long lens, I often recommend positioning your camera so its sensor is parallel to the butterfly&#39;s wings.</p><p>为什么这很重要？ Well, when you&#39;re shooting butterflies, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> becomes extremely limited, even with a narrow <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture setting (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture setting</a> . To keep the entire butterfly sharp – from wingtip to wingtip – it&#39;s essential to ensure that your camera&#39;s sensor is perfectly aligned with the wings of your subject. In other words, aim to photograph the butterfly in profile, especially for those ultra-close shots.</p><p> By positioning yourself correctly and aligning the sensor with the butterfly&#39;s wings, you increase the chances of capturing the entire butterfly in focus, wings and all. This technique will enhance the overall sharpness and detail of your photographs, and the results will speak for themselves.</p><p>但是，如果您无法拍摄蝴蝶完美侧面的照片，请不要太担心！ Do what you can to increase the depth of field, and even if you can&#39;t get the wings completely sharp, at least make sure that the butterfly&#39;s body remains in focus.</p><h2 data-section id="wait-until-the-butterfly-is-frontlit-by-the-sun"> 5.

While you can experiment with different lighting directions, my experience has shown that the best results come when the butterfly is <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/front-light-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="frontlit by the sun (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">frontlit by the sun</a> . Here&#39;s why:</p><p> When the sun is positioned behind you, casting its warm rays over your shoulder, it creates beautiful illumination on the butterfly.这种照明设置呈现出蝴蝶翅膀的复杂细节和鲜艳的色彩，使您的照片闪闪发光（没有双关语！）。</p><p> While you may be tempted to shoot in backlight or sidelight, they can present challenges.逆光通常会导致眩光效果，使得难以清晰地捕捉蝴蝶的特征。 Sidelighting, on the other hand, can create shadows that obscure the butterfly&#39;s delicate patterns.</p><p> To maximize your chances of getting that perfect frontlit shot, choose a good position in advance. Observe the butterfly and anticipate its movements. Wait patiently until it moves to a position where the sun is shining directly on it. Remember, butterflies won&#39;t pose on command, so a little patience goes a long way.</p><p> By the way, you might be wondering about the ideal time for butterfly photography.大多数摄影师更喜欢<a aria-label="golden hours (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-photograph-golden-hour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">黄金时段</a>，即清晨或傍晚。 During this time, the sunlight has a warm, golden quality that adds a magical touch to your images. However, even on cloudy days, you can still capture stunning butterfly photos. Just keep in mind that the light might be more limited, making it a bit challenging to achieve sharp shots.</p><h2 data-section id="use-a-fast-shutter-speed"> 6.

Then make sure the continuous shooting mode is active and be ready to take advantage of any butterfly activity.</p><p> Before the butterflies arrive, focus on a flower or a specific area where they frequently land. This way, when you spot a butterfly approaching, you can simply hold down the shutter button and let the camera photograph away. While it&#39;s impossible to guarantee perfect results, the approach certainly increases your chances of capturing that split-second moment when the butterfly is perfectly positioned or in mid-flight.</p><p> When reviewing your shots at home, keep in mind that continuous shooting will generate a large number of images, including quite a few that are out of focus or less than ideal. But don&#39;t be discouraged! Remember that even professional photographers sift through numerous frames to find the gems. Take your time to carefully examine the series of shots.

Butterflies, like most critters, respond to sudden changes in the light – so if you cast a shadow over them, they&#39;re likely to flutter away. This is especially important to remember when shooting on sunny mornings and afternoons, as the low angle of the sun can easily create long shadows.</p><p> To minimize the risk of casting a shadow on your subject, try positioning yourself at a lower angle. By getting down closer to the ground, you can reduce the chances of your own shadow obstructing the butterfly&#39;s delicate presence. Not only does this technique decrease the likelihood of disturbing the butterfly, but it also grants you a more intimate perspective, and the resulting photos will immerse the viewer in the tiny world of these beautiful creatures.</p><h2 data-section id="shoot-in-the-morning-for-the-best-butterfly-photos"> 10. Shoot in the morning for the best butterfly photos</h2><p> If you want to capture breathtaking butterfly photos, the morning is your secret weapon.为什么？ Well, as I explained above, when the air is cool and crisp, butterflies tend to be more relaxed and less active.

Unfortunately, however, a cluttered or distracting background can diminish the impact of even the best photos. So to make your butterfly images truly stand out, you need to pay attention to what&#39;s happening behind your subject.</p><p> Imagine: You&#39;ve found a perfect butterfly perched gracefully on a flower, ready for its close-up. You frame your shot, adjust the settings, and click the shutter button. But wait! In the background, there&#39;s a mess of branches, people walking by, or other objects that steal attention away from the butterfly.</p><p> To avoid this, take a moment to evaluate the background <em>before</em> pressing the shutter. Look for a clean and uncluttered space that will emphasize the butterfly, not distract from it. To achieve the best results, position yourself in a way that allows for ample space between the butterfly&#39;s perch and the area behind it.</p><p> Another trick is to use a wider aperture setting (smaller f-number) to create a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-get-shallow-depth-of-field-in-your-digital-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="shallow depth of field (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shallow depth of field</a> . That way, the background blurs into a soft wash of colors and shapes, focusing the viewer&#39;s attention on the sharp and vibrant butterfly in the foreground.</p><p> Remember, the background plays a crucial role in the overall impact of your butterfly photos. A clean, smooth, and complementary background will make your subject pop and captivate viewers – so always check behind your subject before shooting!</p><h2 data-section id="try-the-shooting-through-approach"> 12.

Here&#39;s how you can get started:</p><p> First, find a suitable perch where you anticipate a butterfly will land. Look around for interesting vegetation, preferably flowers, that you can use as a foreground element.</p><p> Position yourself in such a way that the foreground element is situated between your lens and the butterfly perch. The closer the foreground element is to your lens, the better the effect. Dial in a wide aperture to create a soft blur in the foreground while manually focusing on the butterfly perch.</p><p> When the butterfly lands on the perch, seize the moment and snap a few shots. It may take some patience and persistence, but you&#39;ll end up with shots featuring a sharp butterfly surrounded by a soft blur.根据我的经验，这种技术可以营造出梦幻而空灵的氛围，以独特的方式与蝴蝶的美丽相得益彰。</p><p> Remember to experiment with different compositions and angles to ensure you get the most captivating results. With dedication and a creative mindset, this simple approach will help you produce breathtaking photographs that stand out from the crowd.</p><h2 data-section id="butterfly-photography-tips-final-words"> Butterfly photography tips: final words</h2><p> And that&#39;s a wrap on our journey into the captivating world of butterfly photography!

Typically, you&#39;ll attach the flash to the camera&#39;s hot shoe or use a bracket to connect it to one side of the camera. In either case, it&#39;s considered on-camera flash.</p><p> When you use on-camera flash, the light is usually directed straight from the camera to the subject. However, if you have a flash unit with a swivel head, you can adjust the direction of the light. This allows you to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/bounce-flash-secrets-bouncing-way-better-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="bounce the flash (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">bounce the flash</a> off the ceiling (indoors) or other reflective surfaces.</p><p> Mounting your flash on-camera makes it easier to control and manage the settings. Modern flash units sync seamlessly with cameras, allowing the two to communicate and calculate the ideal amount of light needed for a perfect exposure. This functionality eliminates many of the complexities associated with flash photography.</p><p> Keep in mind that on-camera flash does have some limitations when it comes to diffusion accessories.

You&#39;re not restricted to the fixed position of an on-camera flash.</p><p> Some camera systems have built-in wireless flash trigger systems, while others require an external trigger or sync cable to synchronize the flash with the camera&#39;s shutter. The key is to make sure that the camera and flash work together seamlessly; otherwise, using your flash would be pointless.</p><p> The level of control you have over the flash&#39;s functionality depends on both the flash itself and your camera. Generally, more advanced flash units offer a wider range of options for customization. Opting for a flash from the same brand as your camera often provides even greater control and flexibility.</p><h2 data-section id="the-benefits-and-drawbacks-of-on-camera-flash"> The benefits and drawbacks of on-camera flash</h2><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254453" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/On-camera-flash-portrait.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="woman at a beach using on camera flash © Kevin Landwer-Johan" class="wp-image-254453" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/On-camera-flash-portrait.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/On-camera-flash-portrait.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/On-camera-flash-portrait.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/On-camera-flash-portrait.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/On-camera-flash-portrait.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/On-camera-flash-portrait.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> When it comes to photography, on-camera flash offers some enticing benefits, but it also comes with its fair share of drawbacks. Let&#39;s delve into the advantages and disadvantages of using on-camera flash to capture <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-ways-to-take-stunning-portraits/" target="_blank" aria-label="portraits (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">portraits</a> , <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tips-event-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="event photos (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">event photos</a> , and more.</p><p> One of the biggest advantages of on-camera flash is its convenience, especially in tight situations. Imagine being in a crowded space, surrounded by people, with little room to maneuver. In such scenarios, having the flash mounted on your camera provides a level of flexibility. You can effortlessly move around, capturing the moment without worrying about people obstructing your path.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254456" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/on-camera-flash-event.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="woman at a temple at night © Kevin Landwer-Johan" class="wp-image-254456" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/on-camera-flash-event.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/on-camera-flash-event.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/on-camera-flash-event.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/on-camera-flash-event.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/on-camera-flash-event.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/on-camera-flash-event.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Additionally, having the flash securely attached to your camera makes a big difference when stability is crucial. Picture yourself on a small boat, crossing a swinging bridge, or navigating uncertain terrain. In these instances, it&#39;s important that you have a free hand to maintain balance and steady yourself; you don&#39;t want to be carrying around a loose flash or a light stand! By keeping the flash mounted on your camera, you can stabilize yourself and maintain control while still capturing stunning images.</p><p> However, it&#39;s important to note that on-camera flash does have its downsides. The primary issue lies in the quality of light it produces. Direct light, and even bounced light, often fail to yield desirable results. When the flash is mounted on my camera, shadows often appear unnatural due to the angle of the illuminating light on my subject. Plus, the harsh, unflattering shadows detract from the overall aesthetic of the photograph.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254458" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.93%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1004" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/on-camera-flash.jpg?resize=1500%2C1004&#038;ssl=1" alt="Young woman at an event with on-camera flash © Kevin Landwer-Johan" class="wp-image-254458" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/on-camera-flash.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/on-camera-flash.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/on-camera-flash.jpg?resize=600%2C402&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/on-camera-flash.jpg?resize=768%2C514&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/on-camera-flash.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/on-camera-flash.jpg?resize=436%2C293&amp;ssl=1 436w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/on-camera-flash.jpg?resize=717%2C480&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Finally, the options for diffusing the flash are somewhat limited when it comes to on-camera setups. The size of diffusers must be small enough not to interfere with or obstruct the camera, which compromises their effectiveness. Larger diffusers typically generate softer, more even lighting, resulting in more pleasing results – yet achieving this level of diffusion becomes a challenge when working with the smaller diffusers required for on-camera flash.</p><h3 data-section id="on-camera-flash-pros"> On-camera flash pros</h3><ul><li> Easy to use</li><li> Can shoot hands-free</li><li> Not as cumbersome</li></ul><h3 data-section id="on-camera-flash-cons"> On-camera flash cons</h3><ul><li> Direct light is less flattering</li><li> Limited diffusion options</li></ul><h2 data-section id="the-benefits-and-drawbacks-of-off-camera-flash"> The benefits and drawbacks of off-camera flash</h2><p> Using off-camera flash may not be as straightforward as sticking your flash on top of your camera, but trust me, it&#39;s worth the effort to learn how. When it comes to capturing a variety of subjects in different situations, positioning your flash away from your camera can produce remarkably pleasing results.</p><p> I often opt for off-camera flash to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/on-camera-speedlight-fill-flash-portraits/" target="_blank" aria-label="fill in the shadows (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">fill in the shadows</a> created by ambient light. Here&#39;s how I do it: First, I position myself and my subject exactly as I want them. Then, I strategically place my flash on the opposite side of the main light source. This technique works like magic, effectively softening harsh shadows and creating a more balanced tonal range in my composition. </p><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-style-default"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/off-camera-flash-event.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="Buddhist ceremony with men and boys using off camera flash

I can angle my flash from below, casting eerie shadows on my subject&#39;s face, giving it that mysterious, horror movie vibe. Alternatively, I can position a flash behind my subject to create a captivating hair light. And let&#39;s not forget about side lighting or using the flash to fill in shadows from a key light. Off-camera flash gives you the freedom to experiment and elevate your portrait game.</p><p> Now, let&#39;s talk about flash modifiers. Some of the most effective ones happen to be quite large, and trying to use them with your flash mounted on the camera is impractical; they&#39;re just too big! But with your flash off camera, you have access to dozens of modifiers that&#39;ll help you control and shape the quality of light. Think umbrellas, softboxes, and an array of other light diffusers!</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254457" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flash-soft-box.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="flash with a softbox © Kevin Landwer-Johan" class="wp-image-254457" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flash-soft-box.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flash-soft-box.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flash-soft-box.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flash-soft-box.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flash-soft-box.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flash-soft-box.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Now, sometimes I like to go handheld with my flash, but it&#39;s not always the most convenient option. That&#39;s when I rely on extendable light stands or tabletop stands to keep my flash in place. And when I&#39;m working with an assistant, I have them hold the off-camera flash for me. (Teamwork makes the dream work, right?)</p><p> I must admit, using off-camera flash requires a bit more attention and calculation compared to the simplicity of a camera-mounted flash. When your flash is not mounted to the hot shoe, communication between the flash and the camera may not be as precise. This can result in overexposed or underexposed photos when relying on automatic flash systems. In such situations, I take control of my flash output and manually adjust it to achieve the desired exposure.</p><h3 data-section id="off-camera-flash-pros"> Off-camera flash pros</h3><ul><li> More lighting style options</li><li> Flexible positioning</li><li> Compatible with large modifiers</li></ul><h3 data-section id="off-camera-flash-cons"> Off-camera flash cons</h3><ul><li> More difficult to learn and use</li><li> Requires a stand, assistant, or a free hand</li></ul><h2 data-section id="on-camera-vs-off-camera-flash-verdict"> On-camera vs off-camera flash: verdict</h2><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254455" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bubbles.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="woman making large bubbles © Kevin Landwer-Johan" class="wp-image-254455" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bubbles.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bubbles.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bubbles.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bubbles.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bubbles.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bubbles.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> As you&#39;ve hopefully gathered from the article, neither on-camera flash nor off-camera flash reigns supreme at all times. They both have their uses, and it&#39;s really all about figuring out what works for each situation and aligns with your preferred style.</p><p> On-camera flash is a breeze to manage and use, but let&#39;s be real: the lighting it produces isn&#39;t always the best. Plus, you don&#39;t have much wiggle room when it comes to tinkering with modifiers to get that perfect shot.</p><p> As for off-camera flash: While it&#39;s trickier to learn and master, the results can be amazing. Not only does it have the power to bathe your subjects in wonderfully flattering, diffused light, but you can also move it around to conjure up all sorts of breathtaking effects and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-portrait-lighting-patterns-every-photographer-should-know/" target="_blank" aria-label="beautiful lighting patterns (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">beautiful lighting patterns</a> .</p><p> If you&#39;re new to the flash game, I urge you to be adventurous and try both options. Spend time evaluating how each type of flash transforms the scene (make sure you pay close attention to the direction and intensity of the shadows!). Try bounce techniques and experiment with different modifiers. Test the approaches out in various scenarios and with different subjects.</p><p> By doing these tests, you&#39;ll become well-equipped to make an informed decision the next time you&#39;re faced with a tricky situation!</p><p> Now over to you:</p><p> <em>Do you prefer on-camera or off-camera flash?

Depending on the weather and your geographical location, blue hour lasts from just a handful of minutes to around 45 minutes.</p><p> Therefore, if you want to take advantage of the beautiful light, you must act fast! I highly recommend you download an app like <a href="https://www.photopills.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">PhotoPills</a> , which will give you specific blue hour times for your location and time of year. (PhotoPills also indicates when the golden hours start and end, which is also highly useful for most forms of photography!)</p><p> At the very least, you should research sunrise and sunset times the night before your photoshoot, then arrive on location early and set up in advance. If possible, find a nice composition or two. And once the magic begins, shoot away!</p><p> Note that, if you&#39;re looking to capture blue hour shots before sunrise, it&#39;s generally a good idea to scout the location the day prior. Trying to find compositions in the darkness can be tough, so if you can get this done in advance, you&#39;ll dramatically improve your chances of capturing great shots. Conversely, if you&#39;re aiming to capture blue hour shots after sunset, make sure you know exactly how to get back to your car, and don&#39;t forget to bring a flashlight; you don&#39;t want to get stranded with 8+ hours of darkness on the way!</p><h2 data-section id="the-best-blue-hour-photography-settings"> The best blue hour photography settings</h2><p> During blue hour, the sky becomes relatively dark, so you&#39;ll need a long shutter speed or a high <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> to get a good <a aria-label="exposure (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure</a> , both of which come with significant tradeoffs.

Either of these can work, though Aperture Priority is generally the better choice for beginners, while Manual mode is more suited to a professional workflow.</p><p> If you go the Aperture Priority route, you should set an aperture that will keep the entire shot sharp (f/8 is a good starting point), and set your ISO to around 100 (to prevent unwanted high-ISO noise). Then let your camera determine the proper shutter speed for a nice exposure.</p><p> If you decide you want a <em>longer</em> shutter speed than your camera selects – to create beautiful streaks out of moving clouds or moving water – you can narrow the aperture, which will consequently cause your camera to lengthen the shutter speed. If you decide you want a <em>shorter</em> shutter speed (to freeze motion), you can widen the aperture or raise the ISO, though bear in mind that a wider aperture will reduce the depth of field, while a higher ISO will introduce noise into the image.</p><p> If you go the Manual mode route, simply dial in your camera&#39;s base ISO and a nice aperture (just as if you&#39;re using Aperture Priority). Then set the shutter speed so that your camera&#39;s exposure meter is roughly balanced. If you need to increase or decrease the shutter speed, then make sure you <em>also</em> increase or decrease another exposure variable (ie, the aperture or ISO) to keep the exposure meter balanced.</p><p> One thing to keep in mind: Because blue hour tends to look relatively dark, your camera may try to overexpose the scene, which will ultimately create an unnatural-looking result (and may cause blown-out highlights). If you&#39;re using Aperture Priority mode, you&#39;ll need to add some negative <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-exposure-compensation-to-take-control-of-your-exposure/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure compensation (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure compensation</a> to counteract this tendency, and if you&#39;re using Manual mode, you&#39;ll need to deliberately underexpose by a stop or two.</p><p> The best advice I can give is to always check the LCD preview and histogram after each image, and if you find that the photos are looking too bright (or too dark), take steps to correct the issue.

Here are my recommendations:</p><h3 data-section id="a-full-frame-camera"> A full-frame camera</h3><p> While you can absolutely capture beautiful blue hour shots using any camera – including a smartphone – a full-frame DSLR or mirrorless camera offers one huge advantage: It&#39;ll let you ramp up the ISO as needed without overwhelming your images with noise.</p><p> As I mentioned above, it&#39;s best to keep your ISO as low as possible, but if you&#39;re photographing moving subjects, working handheld, or doing astrophotography, keeping the ISO at 100 isn&#39;t always an option. Plus, the higher you can raise your ISO, the more flexibility you&#39;ll have and the faster you can shoot (waiting around for your camera to finish a five-minute exposure isn&#39;t always a ton of fun!).</p><p> That&#39;s when a full-frame camera will come in handy. The newest mirrorless models – such as the <a aria-label="Sony a7 IV (opens in a new tab)" href="https://geni.us/Sonya7IV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Sony a7 IV</a> , the <a aria-label="Canon EOS R5 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://geni.us/CanonEOSr5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Canon EOS R5</a> , and the <a href="https://geni.us/NikonZ6IIdPS" target="_blank" aria-label="Nikon Z6 II (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Nikon Z6 II</a> – tend to perform best at high ISOs, but older and/or cheaper models can work great, too.</p><h3 data-section id="a-fast-lens"> A fast lens</h3><p> Most blue hour landscape and cityscape photography is done at narrow apertures, so a lens with an f/1.8 maximum aperture isn&#39;t necessary – but if you want to do blue hour street photography, portraiture, or astrophotography, a lens with a wide maximum aperture will make a huge difference. You&#39;ll be able to use handholdable shutter speeds without boosting your ISO to 12800, and you&#39;ll be able to freeze moving subjects, too.</p><p> If you&#39;re just starting out, I&#39;d recommend grabbing a prime lens with a maximum aperture of at least f/2.8, and an f/1.8 maximum aperture is even better. You can pick up one of these models for cheap (such as a 50mm f/1.8), so you won&#39;t need to worry about breaking the bank.</p><h3 data-section id="a-tripod"> A tripod</h3><p> In my experience, the average blue hour shutter speed sits somewhere between one and six seconds. If you dial in such a lengthy shutter speed and then try to shoot handheld, you&#39;ll end up with frustratingly blurry shots.</p><p> Of course, you can always boost your camera&#39;s ISO to compensate for a shorter shutter speed, but the noise is often unbearable. And while you can widen your lens&#39;s aperture to f/2.8 and beyond, you&#39;ll lose the deep depth of field effect that is so prized by landscape, architecture, and cityscape shooters.</p><p> So for the best results, you really must use a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-tripods-for-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="good tripod (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">good tripod</a> .</p><p> A tripod will hold your camera in place while you shoot a 1-second, 6-second, or even 30-second exposure. Make sure you invest in a sturdy model; while there are plenty of cheap options out there, most of them will struggle to handle your setup, especially in wind.</p><p> If you&#39;re the type of photographer who walks long distances or travels frequently, I&#39;d recommend a carbon fiber tripod, which combines sturdiness with portability. Otherwise, an aluminum model is fine (they tend to be on the cheaper side, but they&#39;re also a lot heavier). Whatever you do, however, <em>do not buy plastic</em> . It&#39;s just too flimsy.</p><h3 data-section id="a-remote-release"> A remote release</h3><p> Even once your camera is mounted on a tripod, pressing the shutter button can cause camera shake, which will create blurry photos.</p><p> That&#39;s where a remote shutter release can help. It&#39;s a little handheld device that&#39;ll let you trigger your shutter from a distance. And this, in turn, will prevent any extra camera vibrations.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-206720" style="width:344px"><span class="space" style="width:344px; padding-top:174.42%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="344" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blue-hour-photography-1.jpg?resize=344%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="long-exposure shot of the Flatiron building during blue hour" class="wp-image-206720" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blue-hour-photography-1.jpg?resize=344%2C600&amp;ssl=1 344w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blue-hour-photography-1.jpg?resize=172%2C300&amp;ssl=1 172w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blue-hour-photography-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1340&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blue-hour-photography-1.jpg?resize=717%2C1251&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blue-hour-photography-1.jpg?w=860&amp;ssl=1 860w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Happily, remote shutter releases are pretty cheap. You can get basic models – which generally consist of a single button and nothing else – for around $20. If you want to do serious long-exposure photography or time-lapse photography, you might consider grabbing a slightly more sophisticated remote (some options feature LCD screens with timers, interval-shooting functions, and more).</p><p> That said, if you want to get started with blue hour photography right away or you really don&#39;t like the idea of a remote release, you do have a few other options. You might be able to connect your camera to your phone and trigger it with an app. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/remote-shutter-vs-delayed-shutter/" target="_blank" aria-label="two-second self-timer function (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">two-second self-timer function</a> (the delay will give shutter-button vibrations time to die off). Neither of these options is wildly convenient – phone connections are often unreliable while self-timers throw off split-second timing – but they&#39;ll work in a pinch.</p><h3 data-section id="a-neutral-density-filter"> A neutral density filter</h3><p> The blue hour is an incredible time for capturing breathtaking long-exposure shots. However, despite the lower light conditions during this period, you may still face challenges when trying to shoot at ultra-slow shutter speeds, such as 10 seconds or longer, without causing overexposure.</p><p> To overcome this hurdle, a crucial piece of gear comes into play: the neutral density filter. This handy accessory easily attaches to your lens and effectively blocks out excess light, allowing you to extend your shutter speed without any issues. With a high-quality neutral density filter, you can achieve impressive long-exposure blue hour shots with shutter speeds ranging from 10 seconds to even an hour.</p><p> It&#39;s important to invest in a reliable filter – there are some low-cost options available that result in unpleasantly soft photos. Make sure to choose a reasonably high-quality neutral density filter to ensure your images turn out sharp!</p><h3 data-section id="a-flashlight"> A flashlight</h3><p> When you venture into the enchanting world of blue hour photography, there&#39;s one more item you simply can&#39;t leave behind: a flashlight. This trusty tool serves multiple purposes and ensures that you&#39;re fully equipped for a blue hour adventure!</p><p> First and foremost, a flashlight is indispensable for finding your way in the dark. Whether you&#39;re setting up your gear before sunrise or wrapping up your shoot after sunset, a reliable light source helps you navigate safely through the shadows.</p><p> A flashlight also unlocks the potential for creative exploration. By using light painting techniques, you can add a touch of magic to your blue hour shots. With a flick of your flashlight, you can selectively illuminate your subject or create captivating light trails, adding an artistic flair to your images.</p><p> Finally, when shooting in low-light conditions, it can be challenging for your camera to find focus. This is where a flashlight comes to the rescue. By directing its beam towards your subject, you provide a clear point of reference, making it easier for your camera&#39;s autofocus to lock onto the desired focal point.</p><h2 id="what-types-of-photos-should-you-take-during-the-blue-hour"> What types of photos should you take during the blue hour?</h2><p> Blue hour is all-around wonderful, so don&#39;t let your genre of choice restrict you from heading out for some ethereal blue light. You can shoot moody street scenes or long-exposure architectural images. You can even capture gorgeous blue hour portraits by combining flash and natural light (more on this below!).</p><p> That said, blue hour is most suited to landscape and cityscape photography. It combines colors, clouds, long exposures, and flattering light – pretty much everything from the serious landscape and cityscape photographer&#39;s playbook. Scenes that are generally motionless but include a few moving elements – such as a beach with waves lapping at the shore – make for especially gorgeous blue hour shots. These types of images <em>do</em> take some patience and a bit of extra gear, but with the right approach, you can capture photos that really shine.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-206718" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:47.6%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="714" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blue-hour-photography-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C714&#038;ssl=1" alt="blue hour photography cityscape long exposure" class="wp-image-206718" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blue-hour-photography-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blue-hour-photography-4.jpg?resize=300%2C143&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blue-hour-photography-4.jpg?resize=600%2C286&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blue-hour-photography-4.jpg?resize=768%2C366&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blue-hour-photography-4.jpg?resize=717%2C341&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The only types of images you should avoid during the blue hour are those that highlight action subjects, such as wildlife photography, bird photography, and sports photography. The low light makes it tough to capture sharp files, so it&#39;s best to tackle these photos during the day.</p><p> Of course, it&#39;s sometimes necessary to shoot action during this time period, but you&#39;ll need to take an approach that&#39;s different to the one I recommended above; instead of using a tripod and a slow shutter speed, you&#39;ll need to boost your ISO and widen your lens aperture until your shutter speed is at least 1/100s (and ideally much faster). You&#39;ll also want to use a lens with a wide maximum aperture (f/2.8 at minimum). That way, you can freeze your subjects in motion!</p><h2 id="5-tips-for-beautiful-blue-hour-photography"> 9 tips for beautiful blue hour photography</h2><p> Yes, blue hour is a great time to take photos.

These lenses are perfect for capturing expansive scenes that make your viewers go “wow.” With a wide-angle lens, you can take in breathtaking vistas, city skylines, and much more.</p><p> Why go wide? Well, these lenses offer a generous field of view, allowing you to include more in your frame. The wide-angle effect adds an extra punch to your shots, especially when you include interesting foreground elements (see the next tip!).</p><p> Not only that, but wide-angle lenses are great for reducing blur caused by camera shake. So, even if your tripod isn&#39;t the sturdiest or you&#39;re dealing with less-than-ideal weather conditions, your images will come out sharper with a wide-angle lens.</p><p> You don&#39;t need an ultra-wide focal length either; even a 24mm or 35mm lens can work wonders for capturing the magic of the blue hour.</p><h3 data-section id="incorporate-foreground-and-background-elements-to-add-depth"> 2.

One effective technique is to incorporate interesting elements in both the foreground and the background of your shot.</p><p> Imagine you&#39;re photographing a stunning cityscape during the blue hour. Look for a striking skyline that catches your eye as your background element. It could be a cluster of towering buildings or a unique architectural structure. Then, find a compelling foreground element to complete the composition. It could be a stone pathway, a reflective puddle, or a line of trees.</p><p> By combining these elements, you give your photo a sense of three-dimensionality. It&#39;s like inviting the viewer to step into the frame and explore the scene. The foreground and background work together to create a visually engaging image that grabs attention.</p><p> Pro tip: Be sure to use a relatively narrow aperture to keep both the foreground and background elements sharp. And if your foreground subject is very close to the lens, you might want to try a focus-stacking technique to ensure everything remains in focus!</p><h3 id="4-shoot-in-raw-and-post-process-your-photos"> 3.

You can easily adjust the exposure and colors of a RAW file, and these adjustments are often the difference between a stunning shot and a mediocre one.</p><p> For instance, you can bring up the shadows in a RAW photo to reveal all sorts of lovely details. You can also bring out the blues and pinks in the sky, enhance the warmth of artificial lighting, and even darken the edges of the frame, which will push the viewer&#39;s eye toward your main subject.</p><p> And while you can make <em>some</em> adjustments to JPEGs, the effects are much more limited. Plus, if you adjust a JPEG too much, you may start to see unpleasant artifacts, such as banding.</p><p> RAW files do come with a drawback: They need editing. (A RAW file literally cannot be displayed in its original form; you must edit and convert it to a viewable format, first.)</p><p> But as I explained above, editing is a key part of every blue hour image. Without editing, you&#39;ll fail to bring out all the key details and colors in your shot.</p><p> So shoot in RAW and embrace the editing process.

You can switch to manual focus and take control.</p><p> Manual focus might sound intimidating, but it&#39;s actually quite simple. Just turn the focus ring on your lens until your subject appears sharp in the viewfinder or on your camera&#39;s screen. It also comes in handy when you&#39;re dealing with scenes featuring lots of depth; that way, you can set the focus exactly where you want it, ensuring maximum depth of field.</p><p> Bottom line: Thanks to manual focusing, you won&#39;t waste time waiting for the autofocus to catch up, and you&#39;ll have more control over the sharpness of your images. I encourage you to give it a try when you have some time to practice, and you&#39;ll see how easy it can be to get the perfect focus for your blue hour shots.</p><h3 id="5-include-electric-lights"> 5. Include electric lights in your images</h3><p> Don&#39;t get me wrong: You can take <em>amazing</em> blue hour photos of unaltered, naturally lit landscapes.</p><p> But in my experience, electric lights offer two benefits:</p><ol><li> They decrease exposure times. As the blue hour wears on, the sky will rapidly darken – and you may find your shutter speeds increasing to 10 seconds, 20 seconds, and beyond. However, an electric light or two will add extra illumination to the scene, thereby shortening your exposures and creating time for a few extra shots.</li><li> They add drama and interest to your photos. If you use a narrow aperture (ie, f/8), electric lights will appear as beautiful starbursts, which can create a focal point or simply complement your main subject.</li></ol><p> For instance, check out the image below, which relies on star-shaped lights to captivate the viewer:</p><p> Electric lights do come with some challenges, however. If you stand too close to a light source, you may get lens flare across your entire frame. And if you&#39;re not careful, electric lights can create major spots of overexposure in an otherwise well-exposed scene.</p><p> So don&#39;t get too close to the lights – the smaller the lights, the less problematic the flare and overexposure areas – and if you&#39;re struggling with exposure issues, check out my next tip:</p><h3 data-section id="use-hdr-techniques-to-recover-highlights"> 6.

Unfortunately, they can also result in all sorts of exposure problems, because electric lights are significantly brighter than their surroundings.</p><p> One approach is to expose for the electric lights and let the rest of the scene go dark. The idea is that you can then recover the shadows in post-processing – but this will introduce lots of noise, so it&#39;s really not ideal.</p><p> Another approach is to ignore the highlights. Expose for the rest of the scene, let the lights blow out, and embrace the resulting shot. This can work, but there&#39;s a better option that <em>combines</em> both of the approaches I&#39;ve shared.</p><p> You see, the best way to handle bright electric lights and dark skies is to capture two shots.
