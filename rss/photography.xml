/></span></a></figure></div><p>这听起来太明显了，不值得在这里提及，但出发前查看天气预报很重要。大多数旅行都是提前预订的，但长期预报只能提前几天准确。检查天气预报可以帮助您做好准备。</p><p>如果天气预报说有雨并且天空多云怎么办？然后你需要弄清楚你将如何应对。在暗淡的光线下拍摄与在强烈的阳光下拍摄有很大不同，您需要以不同的方式进行风景摄影。</p><p>例如，当面对阴天或下雨时，您可能会选择黑白作品，您可能会使用更简约的构图方法，或者您可能会专注于<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/landscape-photography-rain/" target="_blank" aria-label="creating evocative images showing the background blurred out by the rain (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">创建令人回味的图像，显​​示被雨模糊的背景</a>。</p><p>另外，如果预计会下雨，请确保您有防水相机包来保护您的装备，以及镜头清洁纸巾或布来清除前镜头元件上的水。保护相机的盖子也是一个好主意—— <a href="https://geni.us/AlturaraincoverdPS" target="_blank" aria-label="this cover (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">这个盖子</a>在亚马逊上售价20美元左右，是一个不错的选择——只要你小心并运用常识，你就可以用它在露天雨中拍摄而无需担心。损坏您的电子设备。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="take-minimal-gear"> 4. 携带最少的装备</h2><p>当您研究不同的拍照机会时，请仔细考虑您需要携带的装备。诀窍是找到平衡点；一方面，您想带足够的镜头和配件来拍摄精彩的图像，但另一方面，您又不想携带太多，以至于到达目的地后精疲力竭，无法携带。相片。</p><p>例如，在最近的一次旅行中，我带了<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009R6WO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00009R6WO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dpsgeneral-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenersponsored nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="ek-link">17-40mm 广角变焦镜头</a>和<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007GQLU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00007GQLU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dpsgeneral-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenersponsored nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="ek-link">85mm 定焦镜头</a>（加上快门线、滤镜等）。就是这样！由于我的研究，我知道我不需要任何其他东西。</p><p>我确实建议带上三脚架，但这可能很棘手。您不想拖着一个巨大笨重的三脚架绕地球半个地球，因此在重量和稳定性之间找到折衷方案非常重要。有很多好的三脚架可以提供不错的稳定性，而又不会给您带来太大的负担，因此，如果您没有三脚架，我强烈建议您查看<a

class="ek-link">我们关于最佳旅行三脚架的文章</a>。</p><p>最后，在计划时，不要忘记个人物品，例如防护服、雨衣、食物、水等。它们都会增加您的负担！</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="be-flexible"> 5. 保持灵活性</h2><p>良好的计划可以为您提供良好的开端，但不要过于执着于遵循时间表，以免在学习新东西时无法更改计划。当您在外景地时，您可能会遇到一个您非常想拍摄的新场景，或者您可能会从当地人那里听说您绝对应该去看看的区域。</p><p>事实上，我建议您利用当地知识来发挥自己的优势。如果可以的话，请向住宿的接待人员询问最佳拍照地点。您还可以与店主、路人等交谈。您可以随时浏览商店，在那里您可能会遇到包含有趣想法的明信片或当地相册。</p><p>底线：不要太拘泥于你的计划，以至于当新的机会出现时你无法看到它们！

You might be surprised at the stunning images you can create when you do! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="carefully-position-your-subject-for-maximum-impact"> 2. Carefully position your subject for maximum impact</h3><p> I&#39;ve talked a lot about macro settings and lighting, but I&#39;d also like to emphasize a third corner of the macro photography triangle:</p><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-elements-of-composition-in-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="Composition (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">作品</a>。</p><p> Composition in macro photography is a <em>huge</em> deal; by positioning your elements in different areas of the frame, you can achieve very different end results.

By positioning your subject a third of the way into the frame, you can achieve a nice harmony while maintaining plenty of visual movement (also known as <em>dynamism</em> ).</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-210745" style="width:862px"><span class="space" style="width:862px; padding-top:69.61%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="862" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/macro-photography-995.jpg?resize=862%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="tulip soft focus Macro photography" class="wp-image-210745" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/macro-photography-995.jpg?w=862&amp;ssl=1 862w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/macro-photography-995.jpg?resize=300%2C209&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/macro-photography-995.jpg?resize=600%2C418&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/macro-photography-995.jpg?resize=768%2C535&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/macro-photography-995.jpg?resize=717%2C499&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> You might also experiment with centered compositions, where you place your main subject right in the center of the frame. Centered images tend to look pretty intense, and they work especially well if you have a symmetrical subject.</p><p> Once you&#39;ve learned the basic composition guidelines, such as the rule of thirds and symmetrical symmetry, I&#39;d recommend playing around with different image layouts. Find a nice macro subject, then position it in various parts of the frame. You might think about doing macro <a aria-label="minimalism (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/minimalism-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">minimalism</a> , you might try including diagonals, you might consider incorporating triangles or the rule of odds; basically, there are all sorts of different options, so have fun with them! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="increase-the-distance-between-your-subject-and-the-background"> 3. Increase the distance between your subject and the background</h3><p> At the start of this article, I promised to explain how to achieve beautiful, blurred <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-tips-killer-macro-backgrounds/" target="_blank" aria-label="macro backgrounds (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">macro backgrounds</a> . Part of it has to do with using a wide aperture for a shallow depth of field. But there&#39;s another key part, too:</p><p> Make sure your <em>subject</em> is as far from the <em>background</em> as possible.</p><p> It&#39;s a simple trick, but it makes a huge difference.</p><p> Now, you can increase the subject-to-background distance in two main ways:</p><ol><li> You can find a subject that&#39;s far from the background. So if you want to photograph a tulip, find one that&#39;s far from the trees or fence or grass behind it.</li><li> You can change your position so that the area behind your subject recedes. For instance, by getting down low to the ground, the area behind your subject will often change from the grass (near to your subject) and become distant trees or distant flowers (far from your subject). And you&#39;ll get a much better blur.</li></ol><p> For the image below, I wanted to create a nice background blur while shooting some grape hyacinths. I didn&#39;t have too many flowers to choose from, so I got low to the ground – I was practically lying face down in the flower bed! – and I shifted my camera back and forth until there was a nice distance between my main subject and the flower behind it.

Frame your subject against the sky for gorgeous backgrounds</h3><p> In macro photography, the background often matters as much as the subject. A good background will complement the main focus of the shot by adding color, bokeh, or negative space, whereas a bad background will clash with the image&#39;s subject and distract the viewer.</p><p> There are a number of great techniques for leveling up your backgrounds, but one of my all-time <em>favorite</em> methods is to get down low so that my subject is framed against the sky. This can work at pretty much any time of day – on cloudy days, you&#39;ll get a lovely white background, for instance – but I really recommend using the approach at sunrise and sunset.</p><p> You see, by carefully adjusting your camera angle, you can photograph your macro subject against the orange or pink sky created by the setting sun. I captured this image of a dandelion seedhead using that precise method:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-205262" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macro-photography-3-1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="macro photography dandelion seedhead" class="wp-image-205262" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macro-photography-3-1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macro-photography-3-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macro-photography-3-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macro-photography-3-1.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macro-photography-3-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> A note of caution: Don&#39;t look through your camera directly at the sun, especially at high magnifications. If you&#39;re using a DSLR, I&#39;d really recommend switching to Live View (where you shoot with your camera&#39;s rear LCD).</p><p> But as long as you&#39;re shooting safely, you&#39;ll have a <em>lot</em> of fun! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-selective-focus-techniques"> 5. Try selective-focus techniques</h3><p> One technique that can truly transform your macro photos is selective focusing. It&#39;s when you employ a wide aperture, like f/2.8, to create a shallow depth of field – then you deliberately position the focus on a particular part of your subject.</p><p> Let&#39;s say you&#39;re photographing a flower. With selective focusing, you can adjust the focus to only highlight the edge of a petal. The rest of the flower and the background blur into a soft wash of color, drawing attention to the sharp detail of the petal edge.</p><p> This technique can result in breathtaking, artistic images, <em>but</em> it does require a healthy dose of patience and persistence. Your initial shots may not turn out as you imagined, but don&#39;t let that deter you. Continue experimenting, take multiple shots of each subject, and don&#39;t be afraid to play with different focal points! You&#39;ll eventually end up with some outstanding shots.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-focus-stacking"> 6. Try focus stacking</h3><p> I must admit, I have a soft spot for shallow-focus macro photography. There&#39;s something enchanting about having a small part of your subject in sharp focus while the rest fades into a dreamy blur. However, I understand this isn&#39;t everyone&#39;s cup of tea, and it may not always serve your photographic purpose, especially if you&#39;re showcasing a product or composing a still-life shot.</p><p> In such scenarios, you&#39;ll likely want your entire subject to be in sharp focus. One way to achieve this is by using a narrow aperture. Dialing down to f/8, f/11, or f/13 can often give you more depth of field to work with, resulting in sharper images.</p><p> But what if an f/13 aperture doesn&#39;t give you enough depth of field for a sharp subject? This can often happen when you&#39;re dealing with a subject featuring lots of depth – like a coneflower with petals reaching out in all directions – or you&#39;re aiming to shoot at extremely high magnifications.</p><p> One option is to narrow the aperture further, but not all lenses even offer apertures past f/16, plus an ultra-narrow aperture will lead to a phenomenon known as <em>diffraction</em> , which will soften your images.</p><p> So I recommend an alternative: focus stacking.</p><p> Focus-stacking involves capturing a series of images, each with a slightly different focus point. While a single photo might only have a portion of your subject in sharp focus, the set of images, when combined, encompasses the whole subject. Using post-processing software, you can stack these images together to create a final file that displays your entire subject in sharp focus.</p><p> (There are plenty of software options available for this, including more generalist programs like Adobe Photoshop as well as dedicated stacking software like Helicon Focus.)</p><p> A few words of caution: focus stacking can be time-consuming, particularly for beginners. Also, keeping your camera still throughout the process is vital – a tripod is a big help here. A focusing rail can also be beneficial, allowing you to subtly adjust focus between shots by moving your entire setup.</p><p> One last thing to remember: If you&#39;re photographing outdoors, avoid this technique on windy days. A gust of wind can move your subject and ruin the shot. However, with practice and patience, focus stacking can produce macro images with a depth and clarity that&#39;s hard to achieve otherwise! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-freelensing-for-creative-macro-photos"> 7. Try freelensing for creative macro photos</h3><p> I want to share one of my favorite methods for <em>artistic</em> macro photos: <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/freelensing-guide-creative-macro-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="freelensing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">freelensing</a> .</p><p> The term might sound a bit technical, but the process is simple: in freelensing, you disconnect your lens from your camera. You then hold the detached lens up against the lens mount and tilt it back and forth as you take your shots.</p><p> This maneuvering creates an effect similar to a tilt-shift lens – where the plane of focus hits the subject unevenly – resulting in beautiful and mesmerizing background bokeh. This is the type of macro shot you can get relatively easily with a freelensing technique:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255225" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/macro-photography-106-1.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Macro photography" class="wp-image-255225" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/macro-photography-106-1.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/macro-photography-106-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/macro-photography-106-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/macro-photography-106-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/macro-photography-106-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> One of the many advantages of freelensing is the ability to achieve close-up shots with a non-macro lens. This is because, by pulling the lens slightly away from the camera, the image is magnified.</p><p> Additionally, if you allow some light to seep through the opening between the lens and lens mount, you can create cool light-leak effects. (Just remember not to cover the gap with your hand if you&#39;re aiming for this look!)</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-205266" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macro-photography-7.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="macro photography pinecones" class="wp-image-205266" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macro-photography-7.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macro-photography-7.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macro-photography-7.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macro-photography-7.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macro-photography-7.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Of course, every technique comes with its own challenges, and freelensing is no different. The biggest concern is that you&#39;ll drop your lens or camera; you also risk allowing dust and dirt to reach the sensor.</p><p> Therefore, when I freelens, I prefer using my older backup camera and a relatively cheap 50mm prime lens. I also avoid freelensing in harsh weather conditions or in dusty or sandy areas (and I recommend you do the same!). </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-the-broken-backlighting-technique-for-beautiful-bokeh"> 8. Use the broken-backlighting technique for beautiful bokeh</h3><p> Broken backlighting can help you create stunning macro images with spectacular bokeh.</p><p> Let me explain how it works:</p><p> First, position yourself between the sun and your potential subjects. Then adjust your angle until there is something that <em>breaks up</em> the backlight – tree leaves work great for this purpose, but you could also use tree branches, bushes, or grasses in fields.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-210751" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/macro-photography-150.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="backlit leaves Macro photography" class="wp-image-210751" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/macro-photography-150.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/macro-photography-150.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/macro-photography-150.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/macro-photography-150.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/macro-photography-150.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/macro-photography-150.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Next, widen your lens aperture and get close to your subject.

This is a different beast altogether, involving techniques that go beyond standard macro photography so you can capture subjects at even greater levels of magnification.</p><p> Super macro photography typically requires a controlled environment, a tripod, and artificial lighting. Serious super macro photographers often use specialized lenses that offer ultra-high magnifications. But there&#39;s another approach that doesn&#39;t require a specific lens: a reverse-mounting technique. This involves joining two lenses together, with one facing the correct direction and the other facing backward.</p><p> Common subjects for super macro photography are often small objects with intricate details. Insects (usually dead), leaves, flowers, and snowflakes all make for excellent subjects.</p><p> But don&#39;t let that limit your imagination. The world of super macro photography opens up the door to a universe of unseen details, so feel free to explore and experiment. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-complete-guide-to-macro-photography-final-words"> The complete guide to macro photography: final words</h2><p> Here&#39;s the truth: Macro photography <em>isn&#39;t</em> about having the most expensive equipment or mastering highly technical skills. It&#39;s about seeing the world from a new perspective and being willing to get close – even closer than you might have thought possible.</p><p> Whether you&#39;re just starting out or looking to sharpen your skills, the techniques I&#39;ve shared here can help you elevate your macro photography game. Focus-stacking, getting ultra-close, exploring different subjects – all of these can bring your work to a whole new level.</p><p> At the end of the day, however, the key isn&#39;t to follow a strict set of rules. It&#39;s to experiment, persevere, and have fun. That&#39;s when you&#39;ll discover what macro photography is truly about, and you&#39;ll start creating the kind of images that blow you away.

While bird photography comes with real challenges, it&#39;s not as difficult as it might seem – and it&#39;s not as <em>expensive</em> as it might seem, either!</p><p> I&#39;ve been doing bird photography for over 15 years, and I can confidently say that to be a great bird photographer, you don&#39;t have to have a top-notch camera, or an ultra-long (and ultra-expensive) bird photography lens, or even access to world-class birding locations. In truth, photographing birds is mostly about patience, with a healthy dose of luck and technique – as I explain in greater detail below.</p><p> That said, certain gear can make bird photography a lot easier, so I make sure to discuss it in depth. I also cover a variety of other essential subjects for stunning bird pictures, including:</p><ul><li> The perfect bird photography lighting</li><li> Simple tips to improve your compositions</li><li> Plenty of bird photography examples</li><li>很多很多！</li></ul><p> So if you&#39;re ready to become an expert, let&#39;s dive right in, starting with my first tip: </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="pick-good-bird-photography-gear-but-dont-obsess-over-it"> 1. Pick good bird photography gear (but don&#39;t obsess over it)</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254931" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="998" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-12.jpg?resize=1500%2C998&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bird photography tips" class="wp-image-254931" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-12.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-12.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-12.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-12.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-12.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-12.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> In my view, here&#39;s what you need to get started with bird photography: an APS-C camera with interchangeable lens capabilities, plus a telephoto lens that reaches 300mm or more (not including the APS-C crop factor).</p><p> When I started as a bird photographer, I was in school, and I couldn&#39;t afford those fancy 500mm and 600mm lenses used by the pros. Instead, I purchased a used DSLR for around $150 and a 70-300mm zoom lens, and I learned to make it work. I was able to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/four-ways-to-get-frame-filling-shots-in-bird-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="capture frame-filling images of larger birds (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">capture frame-filling images of larger birds</a> (swans, herons, geese, etc.) and even smaller songbirds and shorebirds. With the right approach – as well as lots of patience! - 你也可以做到的。</p><p> That said, once you&#39;ve become more serious and really want to increase your flexibility and hit rate as a bird photographer, you&#39;ll want to upgrade to a more action-focused setup that also offers a bit more reach.</p><p> At that point, I do recommend considering a high-speed APS-C camera. It should have top-notch autofocusing capabilities and a minimum continuous shooting speed of 8 FPS. Cameras like Canon&#39;s EOS R7 are designed for action-focused shooting, and they&#39;re outstanding for dedicated bird photography. Not only are these cameras fast, but they&#39;re very robust. They&#39;re able to withstand challenging shooting conditions such as rain, mud, or sand (and as I&#39;ve learned over the years, in bird photography, you&#39;re <em>going</em> to get dirty!).</p><p> In terms of lenses, you&#39;ll ideally want something that extends beyond 300mm. A zoom lens that reaches 400mm or a 400mm prime lens is a good starting point – I often use a 400mm prime lens for my own bird photography – but if you&#39;re targeting smaller or more skittish birds, you&#39;ll want to check out a 500mm or 600mm lens. Yes, they can be expensive, but some zooms reach these super-telephoto lengths without breaking the bank, and some of the latest super-telephoto zooms are impressively high-quality.</p><p> Note: Should you spring for a 500mm lens or longer, it&#39;s also a good idea to invest in a sturdy tripod. It&#39;ll help reduce camera shake – a common issue at high magnifications – and make your bird photography easier on your arms.</p><p> Of course, as I emphasized in the introduction, while gear can enhance your shooting capabilities, it&#39;s not everything. If you have good technique and you persevere, it&#39;s absolutely possible to produce amazing bird photos – even without the longest lenses or the fastest cameras.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="research-your-subjects"> 2. Research your subjects</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254932" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bird photography tips" class="wp-image-254932" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-4.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-4.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-4.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> I can&#39;t stress this enough: understanding the birds you wish to photograph can greatly boost the quality of your shots. The more you know about a particular species, the better prepared you&#39;ll be to capture its unique behaviors and predict its actions on a moment-by-moment basis.</p><p> In a more simplistic sense, understanding basic facts about a target subject can help you determine where the bird might be, and (often more importantly!) <em>when</em> it might be there.</p><p> When I was a teenager, my family would take summer trips to the Cape May, New Jersey area. As most North American birders know, Cape May is a hotspot where you can find an explosion of species. But as I learned through experience, even a place like Cape May can be a relatively average location if you arrive at the wrong time. I wanted to photograph shorebirds, but while they often fill the beaches in spring and fall, you won&#39;t find many in late June (much to my disappointment!).</p><p> As a 15-year-old, I didn&#39;t have much control over the timing of my family vacation, but if I had been an adult, and I had done my research, I would&#39;ve known to avoid a mid-summer trip ！</p><p> How can you deepen your understanding of your avian subjects? For starters, try reading bird-specific books and online articles. As you delve into these resources, pay close attention to your subjects&#39; daily routines, nesting habits, and favorite food sources.</p><p> Next, consider watching documentaries or online videos that feature your desired bird species. These can give you insights into their unique behaviors, as well as offer a glimpse into the natural habitats they prefer.</p><p> Beyond that, there&#39;s a lot to be said about direct observation. If you regularly visit a particular area, consider spending time observing the birds without the pressure of photographing them. You&#39;ll gain a more intimate understanding of their behaviors, which can result in more compelling, personal photos down the line.</p><p> It might seem like a lot of work, and yes, it is. But capturing great bird photos does take effort, and the better you know your subject, the more likely you are to get those unique moments that set your work apart. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shoot-when-the-light-is-right"> 3.

Not only is this the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/bird-photography-lighting/" target="_blank" aria-label="best lighting for bird photography (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">best lighting for bird photography</a> , but it also coincides with peak bird activity.完美的时机，对吧？</p><p> Strong midday sunlight might seem appealing due to its convenience and intensity, but it can actually create harsh shadows that detract from your images. Instead, aim for those golden hours, which offer several advantages. It softens shadows on your bird subjects, enhances the glow in their plumage, and creates an appealing catchlight in their eyes.</p><p> The low position of the sun during these hours means light will come from the back, side, or front. Keep this in mind as different angles give different effects. Standard frontlight bird photography has the light coming over your shoulder, evenly illuminating your subject. Sidelighting and backlighting are less popular – they&#39;re more artistic and less natural – but they can add dramatic effects to your photos.</p><p> Cloudy days are another option. The diffused midday sunlight eliminates harsh shadows, though it lacks the warmth of golden-hour light. Also, you might struggle to maintain a fast shutter speed, especially for capturing birds in flight. That&#39;s not to say you can&#39;t get good results on a cloudy day. It just requires a bit more planning and creativity.</p><p> For my own bird photography, if the weather forecast predicts a sunny day, I&#39;ll try to get on location as the sun rises. Then I&#39;ll shoot for a few hours until the light gets too harsh, and head back home or to my accommodations to wait out the high-angle sun. A few hours before sunset, I&#39;ll head back out, then photograph until the light is essentially gone and I can no longer capture sharp photos.</p><p> But I treat cloudy days differently. I still like to get out early and then again in the afternoon – that&#39;s when the birds tend to be most active – but I&#39;ll often arrive a little later in the morning, stay a little longer, break for a short lunch, and then get back out to photograph some more before I call it a day. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="pick-a-fast-shutter-speed"> 4. Pick a fast shutter speed</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254934" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:56.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="844" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-18.jpg?resize=1500%2C844&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bird photography tips" class="wp-image-254934" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-18.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-18.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-18.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-18.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bird-photography-18.jpg?resize=717%2C403&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Birds are hardly ever stationary. They flit, fly, and flutter – and if your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> is too long, you&#39;ll end up with blurry images. This is tough to overstate; in my experience, even birds that appear to move slowly are generally quite fast, and birds that appear to be moving fast are like <em>lightning</em> .</p><p> Now, you might be asking, “What counts as a fast shutter speed?” That depends on your subject and the speed at which it moves, but I typically set my shutter speed to at least 1/1000s for a bird in motion. And when I&#39;m capturing smaller, faster birds, I like to work at 1/2000s (and even beyond). Like I said, birds are fast, and I don&#39;t want to risk coming home with a card full of blurry files.</p><p> Using a fast shutter speed, however, isn&#39;t as simple as setting your camera&#39;s shutter speed dial to 1/2000s.</p><p> You see, shutter speed, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> , and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> all work together. A fast shutter speed lets less light in, so if you&#39;re shooting at 1/2000s, you&#39;ll need to compensate for the lack of light some other way. One option is to increase your ISO, but be careful: High ISO values can introduce digital noise, and this can make your images look grainy.</p><p> Another way to let more light in is by using a wider aperture. Now, a wider aperture means a shallower depth of field, which can throw parts of the bird out of focus. On the other hand, a wide aperture can also blur your background, focusing attention on the bird. It&#39;s all about finding the balance that works best for your particular scene and your particular subject.</p><p> You might be thinking, “Sounds complex. How do I manage all of this?” Here&#39;s a tip: Switch your camera to Aperture Priority mode. You set the aperture, and the camera will adjust the shutter speed to get the right exposure. It&#39;s the perfect shooting mode for when the light is changing fast and you don&#39;t have time to fiddle with your settings. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="choose-the-right-location-for-bird-photography"> 5.

You can have all the skills in the world, but if there aren&#39;t any birds around, you&#39;re out of luck.</p><p> So where do you find the birds? Well, the world is filled with potential bird photography locations. But you&#39;ll need to do a bit of detective work first. Look up bird habitats, migration patterns, and bird hotspots in your area. Find out where the birds are and when they are likely to be there. (This relates to the second tip in this article: research your subject!)</p><p> But keep in mind that not every bird-filled location is a good place for photography. You could find a spot teeming with birds, but if the background is cluttered, or the birds are too far away, it&#39;s not going to work. I – and many other bird photographers – have learned this the hard way.</p><p> Local parks, wetlands, or nature reserves are usually good bets. The birds there are often more accustomed to humans, so you can get closer without scaring them away. But be prepared for days when the birds are just not cooperating.它发生了！</p><p>那你怎么办呢？ Persistence is key.继续往回走。 Learn the rhythms of the place, and the patterns of the birds.

If you&#39;re a beginner, you may find it challenging to create a compelling image structure. You see, bird photography is distinct. It doesn&#39;t rely on complex composition as much as other genres, like landscape or architectural photography.</p><p> However, getting the composition right is paramount.为什么？ Because it helps to draw the viewer&#39;s eye to the subject. It helps to create a stronger visual impact. It&#39;s your way to guide those viewing your work to see what you want them to see, to feel what you want them to feel.</p><p>但你怎么能做到这一点呢？ How can you elevate the quality of your bird photos significantly by merely improving your composition skills?</p><p> The solution is a lot simpler than you might think. There are a few key techniques you can employ to change your bird photography game. Firstly, practice using the rule of thirds. This fundamental principle of photography is a guide for photographers to compose their shots. Here&#39;s what you do: Imagine your frame divided into nine equal rectangles, three horizontally and three vertically. Now, position your bird along one of these lines or at an intersection. This will add balance to your photo and make it more engaging to the viewer.</p><p> Next, consider the rule of space. Think about the direction the bird is facing or moving. Allow space in the frame in that direction. This technique gives your bird room to &#39;move&#39; and brings life to your picture. It&#39;s a trick often used in wildlife photography, where the subject is often on the move.</p><p> On top of these, you might also want to try different framing techniques. Using natural elements, like grasses or flowers, to frame your bird can add an extra layer of interest to your shot. It gives context to the bird&#39;s habitat and can help highlight the bird itself.</p><p> Yet remember that all this isn&#39;t without challenges. As you focus on getting the perfect composition, you might miss a chance to click a spontaneous action or a unique behavior exhibited by the bird. But don&#39;t be disheartened. With practice, you&#39;ll become quicker in determining the best composition. You&#39;ll be able to capture not only the spontaneous moments but also the well-composed shots. The overall aesthetic quality of your images will significantly improve, and that&#39;s worth the effort. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="get-down-for-an-eye-level-perspective"> 6.

One of the main culprits is likely to be focusing. When your subjects are small, nimble, and often quite a distance away, focusing becomes a genuine challenge.</p><p> It&#39;s a common stumbling block. But, I assure you, improving your focusing skills isn&#39;t as daunting as it might seem. It is an effective way to track and capture those fast-moving feathered friends, resulting in more detailed and compelling photographs. You&#39;ll be amazed by the transformation a well-focused image can bring to your bird photography portfolio.</p><p> So, how do you improve your focusing skills? The first step is understanding your camera. Get to grips with the autofocus modes and settings. Every camera has its own quirks, and your job is to learn them. By doing so, you&#39;ll be able to select the best settings for each shot intuitively.</p><p> Next, practice. And when I say practice, I don&#39;t just mean going out and photographing birds. Instead, take some time to track other moving objects with your lens. This could be anything from cars driving by, to your dog running around in the yard. This practice will help improve your focus-tracking skills, preparing you for the fast-moving world of birds.</p><p> And lastly, don&#39;t underestimate the power of back-button focus. It can seem a bit foreign at first, but once you get the hang of it, it&#39;s a game-changer. By separating the focusing action from the shutter button, it allows you to have more control over what and when you focus.</p><p> Of course, improving your focusing skills is not without its challenges. It might seem like you&#39;re not making progress or it&#39;s not worth the time. I assure you, it is. The moment you look at your bird photos and see the crisp details of each feather, the time and effort spent mastering focus will be worth it. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="keep-the-eye-sharp-and-well-lit"> 8.

That&#39;s the catchlight, and you get it by positioning the sun (or another light source) at your back.</p><p> (Quick tip: For the best catchlights, simply point your shadow at the bird and make sure you have an eye-level perspective; the sun will do the rest of the work!)</p><p> You should also ensure that the bird&#39;s eye is always, always, <em>always</em> in focus. If the eye is blurry but the body is sharp, then you&#39;ve failed; if the body is blurry but the eye is sharp, you may still have a good shot. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="learn-how-to-stalk-birds-like-a-pro"> 9.

Make a sudden movement, or step too close, and off they go. So how do you get that close-up shot without scaring your subject away? You learn to stalk like a pro.</p><p> Moving slowly is crucial. It might seem like common sense, but in the excitement of spotting a bird, it&#39;s easy to rush in. Resist the temptation.</p><p> Try to use the environment to your advantage. Trees, bushes, and even human-made structures can provide cover, allowing you to get closer without being noticed. But here&#39;s the most important thing to remember. Respect the bird&#39;s space.</p><p> It&#39;s a fine line to walk. You want to get close enough for a good shot, but not so close that you cause the bird distress. Watch for signs that you&#39;re intruding. If the bird looks agitated or is making warning calls, back off.</p><p> Your best bet might be to use a blind. You&#39;ll need to set it up in a place where you know the bird will be, then just <em>wait</em> . It might take a few days for the bird to get used to your blind. But when it does, you&#39;ll be rewarded with some truly stunning shots. And you won&#39;t have disturbed the bird in the process. In my book, that&#39;s a win-win!</p><p> By the way, while you can purchase blinds online, that&#39;s not always necessary. I once set up a blind in my backyard using a cheap little tent, and it worked great!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="fill-the-frame"> 10.

If you&#39;re photographing a single individual, it&#39;s often a good idea to fill the frame.以下是一些好处：</p><ul><li> It&#39;s easy for the viewer to focus on the bird</li><li> It&#39;s easy to achieve a pleasing blur or bokeh effect in the background</li><li> It&#39;s easy to properly expose for the bird</li><li> It&#39;s easy to compose in the field</li></ul><p> Now, as I mentioned in my first tip, filling the frame isn&#39;t always necessary – and sometimes, if you have a shorter lens, it&#39;s not possible. But unless you&#39;re envisioning a stunning environmental shot, I do recommend you at least <em>try</em> to fill the frame. Work on the low, slow approach I discussed above, or consider using a blind.</p><p> If your lens is sharp and you&#39;re working with a high-megapixel camera, you can get away with a bit of cropping, but don&#39;t rely on this <em>too</em> much; even the best images will start to break down if you try to turn a distant bird into a close-up masterpiece.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="tell-a-story"> 11.

Storytelling is a way to express the time of the day, mood, place, or activity of the bird in a single photograph, and it&#39;s mostly about including a bit of environment in the scene (along with a frame-filling bird, of course! ）。</p><p> For instance, you can include some grasses next to the bird, you can photograph the bird catching a fish, you can capture two birds interacting, and so on. If you decide to shoot a wider image (ie, a shot with a <em>non</em> -frame-filling bird), then storytelling becomes especially critical; your story has to hold the viewer&#39;s attention because a small-in-the-frame bird won&#39;t be enough.</p><p> Here are a few additional tips you can use to enhance the story:</p><ul><li> Indicate the weather conditions by including snow, rain, or mist</li><li> Capture silhouettes during sunrise and sunset</li><li> Show season by including flowers in bloom, autumn colors, or snow</li><li> Include reflections for a surreal result </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="capture-the-action"> 12.

However, with a little practice and perseverance, you can become a <em>highly</em> capable action bird photographer.</p><p> Here are a few tips for shooting birds in action:</p><ul><li> Photograph early in the morning or late in the afternoon when birds are very active</li><li> Wait for the bird to move, then use <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/burst-mode/" target="_blank" aria-label="burst mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">burst mode</a> to take several photographs at once</li><li> Track the bird until the focus is locked before pressing the shutter (make sure you&#39;re using <a aria-label="continuous focus (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/choosing-a-focus-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">continuous focus</a> !)</li><li> Learn to anticipate the action either by observing or reading about birds</li></ul><p> Pro tip: When birds are hungry, it&#39;s easy to photograph them in action; they&#39;ll often ignore you in their single-minded quest for food, though take care not to disturb them and maintain a considerable distance.</p><p> By the way, <em>action</em> photos of birds don&#39;t need to depict aggressive and/or impossibly fast movement. You can simply photograph birds behaving in interesting ways!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="capture-birds-in-flight">13.

It&#39;s not easy to take flight photographs that will wow your viewers!</p><p> Your success largely depends on the bird, as well as the technique that you employ. Smaller birds are generally very erratic in their flight and quite small in the frame, which makes them difficult to track. Larger birds are slightly less swift and are not as difficult to track – so if you want to be successful with flight photography, start with larger, slower-moving birds.</p><p> And make sure you get out and practice <em>constantly</em> because sharp bird in flight photos require perfect technique. Here are some simple tips to capture magnificent flight photographs:</p><ul><li> Learn about the bird&#39;s flight patterns</li><li> Know the bird&#39;s landing and take-off patterns</li><li> If there is more than one bird, when one flies, the rest will likely follow suit</li><li> Track the bird for a few moments and let the camera achieve focus before pressing the shutter</li><li> Use Aperture Priority so you do not have to worry much about changing light conditions </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-background-makes-the-picture"> 14.

Bird photos look gorgeous when the background is clean and complements the bird. When the background is messy or distracting, however, the shot generally fails, even if the bird itself looks great.</p><p> In my experience, this is often tough for beginners to understand. They think that a great bird makes a great photo, when in reality, the entire frame matters, and that includes the background.</p><p> Bottom line: It&#39;s very important to keep an eye on the background while taking pictures of a bird. Here are a few simple tips you can follow:</p><ul><li> Avoid taking bird photographs when the background is too distracting</li><li> Avoid taking bird photographs when the background is plain and boring</li><li> If you don&#39;t like the background, wait for the bird to change position or adjust your angle until you get an interesting background</li><li> Choose maximum aperture values to throw the background slightly, or completely, out of focus</li></ul><p> It can also be helpful to start each bird photography session by thinking about the background. That way, you don&#39;t get into position until you know that you can capture a good, clean backdrop that&#39;ll highlight the bird.</p><p> One more tip: Post-processing can help with this – you can clean up small distractions behind the bird – but it&#39;s not good to rely on it too heavily. Lots of processing will start to become noticeable. Plus, if you always think to yourself, “No big deal, I can always use Photoshop,” it&#39;ll prevent you from learning how to get great backgrounds in camera (which is a skill that definitely comes in handy!). </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="practice-with-common-birds"> 15.

I personally learned most of my bird photography techniques with seagulls, mallards, geese, and herons.你也可以做到的。</p><p> Of course, don&#39;t be afraid to step outside your comfort zone and photograph the occasional songbird or shorebird. But if you don&#39;t capture beautiful images, don&#39;t get too worked up; instead, focus on mastering your techniques and learning the right <a aria-label="bird photography settings (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/bird-photography-camera-setting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">bird photography settings</a> .

It&#39;s what I was interested in creating when I first started shooting birds, and it&#39;s something I still love to do today.</p><p> But I&#39;ve also found that capturing wider shots, where the bird is smaller in the frame and surrounded by its environment, can be a rewarding challenge. Not only do these environmental bird photos add variety to your portfolio, but they can help convey a different side of your subject.</p><p> Take for example a heron poised on the edge of a marsh, ready to strike. Capturing a close-up of its intense gaze is certainly stunning. But what about including the reflections of the marsh in your frame? That puts the heron in context, telling a more complete story of its life and interactions.</p><p> To create captivating environmental bird photos, you&#39;ll need to shift your compositional approach slightly. Consider the bird as just one part of a larger tableau. Look for interesting elements in the bird&#39;s habitat that can complement your subject and add depth to your photo.</p><p> You&#39;ll also want to adjust your camera settings to ensure that both the bird and its environment are in focus. When I&#39;m photographing bird close-ups with a super-telephoto lens, I&#39;ll often set my aperture to around f/6.3. But when I&#39;m doing more environmental bird photography, I&#39;ll use a much shorter lens (often a 70-200mm lens, or even a 24-70mm zoom), and I&#39;ll set the aperture to around f/8 or so to ensure that the entire scene is rendered with plenty of detail.</p><p> I&#39;ll admit that a bird within its environment might not always offer the instant wow factor that a close-up shot does. But these wider images tend to offer a whole lot more detail, which rewards repeated viewing! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="look-at-other-amazing-bird-photography"> 17.

Fortunately, there are plenty of outstanding bird photographers in the world, and studying their shots is a fantastic way to dramatically improve your own work.</p><p> Starting out in bird photography, you may find it difficult to visualize the ideal composition, or maybe you struggle with finding the right lighting. This is where reviewing others&#39; work can be so beneficial. It offers invaluable lessons in composition and lighting, and it can even help refine your style.</p><p> So spend time following established bird photographers on social media platforms. Instagram, for instance, is filled with talented bird photographers who regularly share their work. Take time to study their photos. Ask yourself, what makes their photos stand out? How do they frame their subjects? What sort of lighting are they using?</p><p> Next, consider joining online bird photography communities. Sites like Flickr or photography-focused Facebook groups are brimming with images and discussions. Not only can you gain inspiration from the images posted, but you can also participate in constructive discussions and critiques.</p><p> Finally, don&#39;t overlook the power of a deep dive into award-winning bird photographs. They are, after all, award-winning for a reason! Study the photos, learn from them, and try to implement some of the techniques into your own work.</p><p> Remember, while it&#39;s great to be inspired by others, don&#39;t forget to develop your own style. As you progress and learn, you&#39;ll start to see patterns in what you like and don&#39;t like. This is the beginning of developing your unique style. So go ahead, experiment, deviate, and create. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-photograph-birds-final-words"> How to photograph birds: final words</h2><p> Now that you&#39;ve finished this article, you&#39;re well on your way to capturing beautiful bird photography.

An image that&#39;s a bright red color will have a high Red (R) percentage but very little Green (G) and Blue (B) percentages. An image that&#39;s a mid-gray color, on the other hand, will have 50% values for Red, Green, <em>and</em> Blue.</li><li> Higher percentages correspond to lighter tones, while lower percentages correspond to darker tones. An image with only 100% values for Red, Green, and Blue will be detailless white, while an image with only 0% values for Red, Green, and Blue will be a deep black.</li></ol><p> Displaying the RGB numbers for your photos is very useful, as we&#39;ll soon see. It&#39;s also quite easy! In Lightroom&#39;s Develop module, hover your cursor over the area you want to measure. Then look under the histogram for the corresponding RGB measurements.</p><p> (Note: RGB numbers are usually measured on a scale of 0-255, but in Lightroom, you generally see them on a percent scale.)</p><p> For my image above, I hovered my cursor over the child&#39;s forehead. I&#39;ve added a small arrow to the image so you can see exactly what I measured. My numbers tell me that the pixels next to the arrow had the following RGB values:</p><ul><li> Red: 73.1%</li><li> Green: 67.1%</li><li> Blue: 60.5%</li></ul><p> In other words, the child&#39;s skin is more red than green or blue; it&#39;s also on the brighter side but not so bright that it&#39;s overexposed. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="using-rgb-values-to-analyze-skin-tones"> Using RGB values to analyze skin tones</h2><p> When analyzing RGB numbers for skin tone, look for the following indicators:</p><ul><li> Red should be higher than Green. Green should be higher than Blue. This pattern is universal to all skin tones, regardless of age or ethnicity.</li><li> Each color should have at least a 2% difference – usually more – between it and the next number. Do you know how to identify a pure gray? That is a pixel that measures exactly the same in its Red, Green, and Blue numbers. So skin with RGB numbers that are very close to each other is going to look gray. Not very natural or appealing, right?</li><li> If any colors measure 94% or above, you probably have overexposure to deal with.</li><li> If any colors measure 6% or below, you probably have underexposure to deal with.</li></ul><p> The RGB numbers in my example photo of the child are consistent with expectations. That means the skin is at least relatively well exposed and has a good white balance.</p><p> What happens, however, if your photo doesn&#39;t look so good straight out of camera?</p><p> For this next photo, I used the Lightroom histogram to measure the RGB values just next to the arrow on the woman&#39;s forehead:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-260112" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:71.07%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="533" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.jpeg?resize=750%2C533&#038;ssl=1" alt="Skin tones Lightroom curves 02" class="wp-image-260112" title="skin-tones-Lightroom-curves-02.jpg" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.jpeg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.jpeg?resize=300%2C213&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.jpeg?resize=600%2C426&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.jpeg?resize=717%2C510&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The numbers were Red: 93.8%, Green: 92.5%, and Blue: 93.6%.</p><p> Anytime you see a photo with skin tones that have RGB values like those, your eyes are going to tell you that something is off <em>before</em> the numbers do. But the benefit of using the numbers is that they give you a sense of how you&#39;ll need to edit the image so the skin tones can be improved.</p><p> The numbers in this photo are concerning because, as I explained above:</p><ul><li> Anything higher than 94% or so is bright enough that a print from that image might not render good detail in those areas.</li><li> Blue is higher than Green. Red should always be the highest and Blue the lowest; otherwise, the skin will appear cold.</li><li> The RGB numbers are too close together, which means they&#39;re approaching gray. As a result, the skin in the photo is lifeless. </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-correct-skin-tones-in-lightroom"> How to correct skin tones in Lightroom</h2><p> To fix this image, you should start by tweaking the exposure. Proper exposure is a huge component of proper skin color. In fact, it&#39;s often impossible to assess skin tone issues effectively without correcting the exposure first.</p><p> A little-known bit of Lightroom awesomeness is that it&#39;s easy to correct exposure while keeping an eye on the RGB numbers. In the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/steps-for-getting-started-in-the-lightroom-develop-module/" target="_blank" aria-label="Develop module (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Develop module</a> , double-click in the numeric entry field for Exposure so that the number is highlighted. Next, hover your cursor over the area of skin you have been measuring (but don&#39;t click!). Use the up or down arrows on your keyboard to change the exposure until a more appropriate measurement for the Red value appears under the histogram.</p><p> You can adjust Highlights (or Shadows, Whites, or Blacks) in the same way. Activate the numeric input field for editing, then hover the cursor over the point you want to measure. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to increase or decrease the adjustment.</p><p> As you can see, I&#39;ve used this method to improve the skin tone exposure:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-260113" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:51.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="388" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-5.jpeg?resize=750%2C388&#038;ssl=1" alt="Skin tones Lightroom curves 03" class="wp-image-260113" title="skin-tones-Lightroom-curves-03.jpg" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-5.jpeg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-5.jpeg?resize=300%2C155&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-5.jpeg?resize=600%2C310&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-5.jpeg?resize=717%2C371&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> However, the color is still off. You can try to fix the issue with Lightroom&#39;s white balance sliders, but in my experience, when the RGB numbers are as close together as you see here, it&#39;s often better to use color curves. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="color-curves-vs-white-balance-sliders-for-correcting-skin-tones"> Color curves vs white balance sliders for correcting skin tones</h2><p> Lightroom&#39;s color curves feature has two major advantages over the white balance (WB) sliders.</p><p> As you know, Lightroom measures three colors (red, green, and blue) for each pixel. The white balance sliders don&#39;t allow you to target the most important component of skin color: red. You can, however, edit the red tones using Lightroom&#39;s color curves.</p><p> The other big benefit of using color curves is that you can adjust colors in limited parts of the image&#39;s tonal range. If you reduce yellow in an image using the basic Temperature slider, you&#39;ll reduce yellow globally (ie, everywhere in the image).

In other words, reducing blue is the same as increasing yellow.</p><p> Now, looking at the curves panel, do you see the histogram behind the straight line? When you click and drag the straight line to create a curve, this tells Lightroom to adjust the pixels corresponding to that part of the histogram.</p><p> Say, for instance, that you wanted to add blue to the midtones of an image. You would select the Blue channel and click the line in the middle of the histogram, where the midtones live. Dragging the line upward would add blue to the bright parts of your photo&#39;s tonal range.</p><p> Because dragging the curve upward increases the color the channel is named after – blue, in this case.

There are as many proper RGB measurements as there are people in the world. As you study RGB numbers, let trends in the numbers and generalities guide your edits, but don&#39;t try for an exact numeric match.</p><p> Second, measure skin tones in the middle range of brightness. Look for midtones to use as a reference point rather than bright highlights or deep shadows. Also, avoid measuring on cheeks, the end of the nose, or other areas that are usually redder than others.</p><p> Third, in general, when I&#39;m editing photos, I look for tones in these ranges:</p><ul><li> Red is highest; Green is in the middle; Blue is lowest. This should <em>always</em> be true.</li><li> The Red channel is usually between 70% and 90%. Very light skin can be as high as 94%. Very dark skin can go as low as 40-50%.</li><li> The Blue channel is usually between 30% and 80%.</li><li> It&#39;s not possible to generalize how many percentage points difference should be between Red and Green or Green and Blue. However, skin that has warmer tones will have less Blue in proportion to Red and Green.</li></ul><p> And finally, remember that small movements of your tone curve impact your image dramatically. Don&#39;t go overboard! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="edit-those-skin-tones-for-natural-looking-portraits"> Edit those skin tones for natural-looking portraits!</h2><p> Studying the patterns in the RGB numbers of your photos is a great way to develop your editing eye. Everyone takes photos that aren&#39;t quite right, and everyone struggles to determine what needs to be fixed, at least at first.</p><p> Analyzing the relationship between the numbers and the appearance of the photo will help you get to the point where you can eyeball a photo and determine what needs to be done <em>without</em> referring to the RGB numbers.</p><p> Now over to you:</p><p> <em>What do you think about this method for correcting skin tone in Lightroom?在下面的评论中分享您的想法！</em></p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/skin-tones-using-lightrooms-color-curves/">How to Correct Skin Tones in Lightroom (With Color Curves)</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com">Digital Photography School</a> .

(A friend convinced me that having a small-form, full-frame camera would be an entirely different way of shooting. I value his opinion, so I picked one up.)</p><p> After working with a 24-70mm f/2.8 lens, however, I found that I wasn&#39;t completely happy with what it offered; it was too heavy, and I wanted something light. I knew that I wanted a lens with a wide aperture, so I started to do research into my different options.</p><p> While looking through photos on Flickr, I noticed a few images where <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">the bokeh</a> appeared to be swirling in a circular pattern. It was awesome and unlike anything I had ever seen, like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-73064" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="399" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0086.jpg?resize=600%2C399&#038;ssl=1" alt="Helios 44-2 lens swirly bokeh" class="wp-image-73064" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0086.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0086.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0086.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0086.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> I did some quick digging. I soon found out this was called “swirly bokeh,” and that certain vintage lenses, such as the Helios 44-2 58mm f/2, produce the effect through a manufacturing defect. Well, this “defect” looked extremely cool, so I decided I wanted to purchase a Helios 44-2 for my collection and create some swirly bokeh of my own!</p><p> Below, I share everything that followed, including the trial-and-error process I used to (eventually) capture the bokeh I was after. If you&#39;ve purchased the Helios 44-2 but you&#39;re not sure how to use it to get its artistic bokeh, or if you&#39;re simply looking for a way to elevate your portfolio with creative effects, then read on! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="meet-the-helios-mm-f-lens"> Meet the Helios 44-2 58mm f/2 lens </h2><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-73065 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-73065" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-4670.jpg?resize=600%2C450&#038;ssl=1" alt="Helios 44-2 lens swirly bokeh" class="wp-image-73065" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-4670.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-4670.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> My Sony mirrorless camera with the Helios 44-2 58mm f/2.0 lens.</figcaption></figure></div><p> As I said above, I learned that certain vintage lenses were capable of creating the swirly bokeh effect. I discovered that there is a cult following for a lens called a Helios 58mm f/2, and that it&#39;s a Russian-made lens that essentially tried to emulate a famous Zeiss lens. The manufacturers&#39; goal wasn&#39;t to create swirly bokeh, but that&#39;s what happened – and as artistic photographers, it&#39;s something we can exploit!</p><p> Several companies made these lenses over several decades, and millions of units were produced, so the Helios 58mm f/2 isn&#39;t exactly rare. That&#39;s good for us creative photographers; since they&#39;re so common, they&#39;re ultra-inexpensive. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="where-to-find-the-helios-lens"> Where to find the Helios 44-2 lens</h2><p> Now, there isn&#39;t just one version of the Helios 58mm f/2 lens. However, through my research, I learned that the Helios 44-2 model lens reportedly creates the “swirly bokeh” I was looking for. I did a quick search on eBay and quickly found a ton of these for sale out of Russia and Ukraine.</p><p> After looking at several of them, I found one in excellent condition and ordered it for less than $50 including shipping.多么划算啊！ (I&#39;ve seen plenty of people get even better deals on eBay than I did!) </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-mount-the-lens-on-a-modern-camera"> How to mount the lens on a modern camera</h2><p> Helios 44-2 lenses were created for the M42 mount. Therefore, unless you already shoot a camera that uses this mount, you&#39;ll need an M-mount adapter.

It focuses <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dont-afraid-manual-focus/" target="_blank" aria-label="manually (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">manually</a> , and the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> must be adjusted manually, as well.</p><p> I&#39;ve never had a lens that was manual focus only, much less manual aperture. Instead of using a front or rear dial on the camera to choose your aperture, you grab a ring on the front of the lens to change it by twisting it to the left or right. (If you&#39;re used to that type of lens, then you&#39;ll be in better shape than I was – photographing that way was totally new to me!)</p><p> The aperture ring took some getting used to, and at first, it slowed my photo-taking process down. The aperture ring on the front of the lens reads “16” on the left, then “11,” “8,” “5.6,” “4,” “2.8,” and “2” as you turn to the right. Simply twist the dial to change the aperture. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-73068 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-73068" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0431.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0431" class="wp-image-73068" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0431.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0431.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0431.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> A light pole in a Missouri truck stop parking lot surrounded by corn, taken with the Helios 44-2. There&#39;s no swirly bokeh here – but I&#39;m getting there!</figcaption></figure></div><p> The standard challenge with manual focus is trying to eyeball the focus correctly. You might think your subject is in focus, but you might be just an inch or two out of focus.</p><p> Fortunately, my Sony a7 has a focus-assist option (also called focus peaking) that lights up in-focus sharp details in red so you know what part of the image is in focus. This makes it far simpler to get right.</p><p> Taking a portrait? Twist the focus ring until a person&#39;s eyes are rimmed in red and guarantee the eyes are sharp in focus. It&#39;s so easy, it&#39;s almost like cheating! Many other mirrorless cameras offer this feature, too, so if you don&#39;t own a Sony a7 model, check your camera manual to see whether your camera can do the same. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-create-the-swirly-bokeh-effect"> How to create the swirly bokeh effect </h2><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-73069 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-73069" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="399" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0100.jpg?resize=600%2C399&#038;ssl=1" alt="Helios 44-2 lens swirly bokeh" class="wp-image-73069" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0100.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0100.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0100.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0100.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This unfocused image shows the popular swirly bokeh effect!</figcaption></figure></div><p> I bought my lens right before a two-week trip to St. Louis, Missouri to visit family. It arrived the day before we left. After a quick test shoot, I decided I was going to use the Helios 58mm 44-2 exclusively for the entire trip.</p><p> When I arrived in St. Louis, I took the lens into my in-laws&#39; yard to find out how best to create the swirls. When you shoot wide open at f/2, and you get close to the subject, the background is a beautiful, buttery, soft bokeh:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-73070" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="399" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0103.jpg?resize=600%2C399&#038;ssl=1" alt="Helios 44-2 lens swirly bokeh" class="wp-image-73070" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0103.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0103.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0103.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0103.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> However, as you can see in the image above, the swirl effect doesn&#39;t always appear.

It became clear that I needed a good distance from my subject, as well as a background that included enough small highlights to fall into swirly bokeh in the distance.</p><p> Finally, I aimed my Helios 44-2 lens at a birdhouse about eight feet away, which conveniently had a cute little toad in the lower peephole.结果如下：</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-73074" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0451.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Helios 44-2 lens swirly bokeh" class="wp-image-73074" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0451.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0451.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hacking_Photography_Helios_44-2_Lens-0451.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>成功！ This shot also helped me realize that you need a pretty good distance in the background so the little light spots and details can register into that swirl shape. As long as you use a wide-open aperture, you choose a subject that&#39;s reasonably far from the background and your lens, and you make sure that the background has plenty of little highlights, you can get the same results!</p><p> Of course, you&#39;ll also need a Helios 44-2 lens and the relevant adapter, but like I said, you can grab these for cheap online. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="go-create-swirly-bokeh-with-your-helios-lens"> Go create swirly bokeh with your Helios 44-2 lens!</h2><p> I have to say: I&#39;m really in love with my Helios 44-2 lens.</p><p> It offers an f/2 maximum aperture, weighs next to nothing, and is incredibly inexpensive – remember, I grabbed mine for less than $50 (including shipping). Even at very small apertures, the lens produces beautiful images.

If you struggle to get good results, you can always head out into your backyard or a nearby park – like I did – and experiment with different subjects and distances.

It&#39;s funny: you can <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/12-steps-becoming-good-photographer/" target="_blank" aria-label="be the best photographer (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">be the best photographer</a> , but knowing what to charge can be an un-slayable dragon. And when you&#39;re not quite sure <em>why</em> you charge what you charge, it&#39;s hard to remain firm on your prices, especially when your clients want to haggle you down to nothing.</p><p> Below, I share my best tips for pricing photos. Bear in mind that many of these approaches aren&#39;t original – I learned everything I needed to know about setting my prices from <a aria-label="Alicia Caine's photo pricing book (opens in a new tab)" href="https://geni.us/PhotoPricingdPS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Alicia Caine&#39;s photo pricing book</a> . (I&#39;m not getting paid to tell you that. I swear by that book! It changed the entire face of my business.)</p><p> So without further ado, it&#39;s time to learn how you can effectively price your photo services, starting with: </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="include-pricing-on-your-website"> 1. Include pricing on your website</h2><p> This one is simple but extremely important: Go add some prices to your website.</p><p> It doesn&#39;t have to be all of your prices, but you should at least publish prices for your basic services, whether that&#39;s a couple&#39;s photoshoot, a pet portrait session, or a full-blown wedding.</p><p> This is the first step in managing client expectations and not getting the sticker-shocked client trying to weasel their way out of paying your prices. Just publish a couple of guide prices as a reference. (Of course, make sure that the prices you don&#39;t publish make logical sense in relation to the prices you do publish – otherwise, you run the risk of surprising and frustrating clients.) </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-feel-obligated-to-do-discounts"> 2. Don&#39;t feel obligated to do discounts</h2><p> As Alicia Caine taught me, <em>I don&#39;t have to do family and friend discounts</em> , and neither do you.</p><p> I don&#39;t expect them from others and I don&#39;t give them. Well…I don&#39;t allow it to be expected. These types of discounts aren&#39;t always a bad thing, and I might knock something off the price or give an unexpected gift to a friend – but in general, I&#39;m not open to this kind of thing, and that&#39;s something that I&#39;m firm and clear about.</p><p>为什么这个这么重要？ In my experience, it just doesn&#39;t go well when I underprice my services. The client/friend/family member values me less, and I feel a bit of resentment about spending an entire week <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-edit-and-deliver-wedding-photographs-in-one-day/" target="_blank" aria-label="editing a wedding (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">editing a wedding</a> I was expected to do for free. Alicia empowered me to say <em>no</em> . </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-consistent-pricing-calculations"> 3. Use consistent pricing calculations</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-260065" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pricing-your-photography-5.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="Pricing your photography" class="wp-image-260065" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pricing-your-photography-5.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pricing-your-photography-5.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pricing-your-photography-5.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pricing-your-photography-5.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pricing-your-photography-5.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pricing-your-photography-5.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> You shouldn&#39;t just price your photography services based on how you&#39;re feeling on the day you write it all out. Instead, develop a consistent set of calculations that you use to ensure that pricing is always logical and fair.</p><p> For instance, you can determine an hourly rate, then estimate the time you spend on each service and multiply accordingly.</p><p> As long as your calculations are consistent, everything will be nice and uniform and your pricing structure will make sense.</p><p> I used to price my prints according to the square inches of the product. That took a lot of work, and since reading <a href="https://geni.us/PhotoPricingdPS" target="_blank" aria-label="Alicia Caine's book (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Alicia Caine&#39;s book</a> , I have used her pricing calculations. (They&#39;re far, <em>far</em> easier!)</p><p> (Having consistent pricing calculations doesn&#39;t just make you more marketable to clients; it also gives you a good explanation if you <em>do</em> encounter a potential client who tries to haggle.) </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="always-charge-for-your-services-and-charge-up-front"> 4. Always charge for your services (and charge up-front)</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-260064" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pricing-your-photography-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Pricing your photography" class="wp-image-260064" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pricing-your-photography-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pricing-your-photography-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pricing-your-photography-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pricing-your-photography-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pricing-your-photography-2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pricing-your-photography-2.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> It can be tempting to charge purely based on the prints, photobooks, or image files that your clients buy after the shoot. I&#39;ve learned the hard way, however, that you should <em>always</em> charge a session fee – and you should require your clients to pay up-front when they make a session reservation.</p><p>为什么？ First, by charging up-front, you ensure that the clients are serious and aren&#39;t going to take up half a day on your calendar, then leave you hanging.</p><p> And don&#39;t just take a deposit. Take the whole thing. I&#39;ve had plenty of deposit-leavers leave me hanging, but no session-payers have let me down yet. Taking the money upon reservation (I either send them a self-addressed envelope or shoot them a PayPal invoice) falls under the category of “spent money is forgotten money.” So a week later when it&#39;s time to buy photo products, they don&#39;t feel like their bank account just took a hit and they&#39;re free to spend on photos.</p><p> And they <em>will</em> spend because they&#39;ve already made a financial investment. Not to mention an emotional and time investment during the session.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-offer-refunds"> 5. Don&#39;t offer refunds</h2><p> Whatever you do, always make it clear that anything the client pays up-front – whether that&#39;s a deposit fee or, as I recommend, a complete prepaid session fee – is non-refundable.</p><p> They can sign a contract (a little too formal for me) or acknowledge receipt of your confirmation email by saying that they understand the fee is non-refundable.</p><p> Otherwise, even if you charge up-front for your sessions, you&#39;ll eventually end up with some folks who try to get their money back after they bail on the session. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="include-expiration-dates-on-client-galleries"> 6.

(Some client galleries also offer the option to order prints directly!)</p><p> But just having a client gallery isn&#39;t enough. You should apply a clear expiration date to that gallery. If you don&#39;t, clients will intend to buy <em>but</em> never get around to it. However, an expiration date, like any deadline, encourages them along so they&#39;ll make purchases in a reasonable time period.</p><p> (I&#39;ve had clients go for months without ordering! Put the gallery up for 30 days and be sure to <em>watermark</em> those suckers all over the place. It&#39;s okay to ruin the preview with a watermark, and it makes it clear that swiping the preview is stealing.) </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="pricing-your-photography-final-words"> Pricing your photography: final words</h2><p> Well, there you have it: my best tips for developing a photography pricing structure and ensuring that clients don&#39;t take advantage of your services.</p><p> It&#39;s all based on a combination of Alicia Caine&#39;s incredible pricing advice and my own real-world experience.

I had been working on some <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/11-surefire-tips-for-improving-your-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="landscape shots (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">landscape shots</a> , but with the light fading from the sky, the thought of beer and food was beginning to overwhelm my desire to stay out. The colors were shifting to the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/new-photographers-guide-to-blue-hour/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">deep tones of blue hour</a> , and the light was long gone from the hills.</p><p> About to give up and head home, I spotted a lone juniper atop a rocky outcrop, perfectly silhouetted against the deep blue of the mountain sky. I sighed, tempted to ignore the scene. However, it was too good an opportunity to pass up, so I put my camera back on the tripod, walked over, and composed a shot. With a click, I snapped the shutter: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CO-KenCaryl-evening-30Dec2011-6.jpg?ssl=1" alt="CO KenCaryl evening 30Dec2011 6" title="CO-KenCaryl-evening-30Dec2011-6.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> The image was decent – it featured nice blues with a clean black foreground – but it needed some warmth, an element to contrast with the abundant cool tones. “If only I could get a beam of sunlight to reach back above the horizon…” I thought to myself.</p><p> And then: “Wait a second…”</p><p> I didn&#39;t need the sun; I had a flash and a remote trigger in my bag! I pulled it out, all thoughts of beer and food forgotten, and placed the flash on a boulder a few feet to my left. I set it low, to 1/4 of full power, then took a shot.</p><p> “Better,” I thought, looking at the image glowing on the back of my camera. But it still wasn&#39;t right. The light coming from the flash was too cool – it lacked the warmth I wanted. Digging back in my bag, I emerged with a pack of gels, slapped a half cut of CTO (color temperature orange) over the flash, and clicked off another photo.</p><p> “Now we&#39;re talking,” I muttered. Thanks to the flash, a warm beam of light had crossed the rocky foreground to light up the tree. Never mind that the actual sunlight disappeared 45 minutes before; I could re-create it with a little artificial light trickery. A few adjustments to the flash&#39;s positioning and brightness, and I had my keeper shot. Finally, I could go home. Here&#39;s the image I captured: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CO-KenCaryl-evening-30Dec2011-7.jpg?ssl=1" alt="CO KenCaryl evening 30Dec2011 7" title="CO-KenCaryl-evening-30Dec2011-7.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> For most photographers, flash is relegated to the studio.

I like to say that photographic rules are meant to be broken, but this one seems universal: get the flash off your camera.</p><p> The direction of light, and how much to use it, is a matter of your personal vision, but here are my thoughts: Artificial light should either look so natural you don&#39;t notice it comes from a bulb or so obvious that it&#39;s clear the scene was lit for artistic reasons. Anything in between usually doesn&#39;t work.</p><p> As with all successful photography, you need to think through your image and the story you are trying to tell. Do you want a natural-looking scene, or are you aiming for an artistic portrayal of your subject? Once you have an answer to that question, you can move forward. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-post-large-image wp-image-94428 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-94428" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:50.21%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="360" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CO-KenCaryl-evening-30Dec2011-12.jpg?resize=717%2C360&#038;ssl=1" alt="Scrubby pines grow from the rocks of the Dakota Hogback in the foothills of Colorado outside Denver, late evening." class="wp-image-94428" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CO-KenCaryl-evening-30Dec2011-12.jpg?resize=717%2C360&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CO-KenCaryl-evening-30Dec2011-12.jpg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CO-KenCaryl-evening-30Dec2011-12.jpg?resize=600%2C302&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CO-KenCaryl-evening-30Dec2011-12.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Scrubby pines grow from the rocks of the Dakota Hogback in the foothills of Colorado outside Denver, late evening.

A natural look is usually subtle and may rely heavily on the light that is already available to you.</p><p> In my example of the juniper tree, I kept the flash setting low and warmed the light with a gel to get a sun-like look. Finding the right balance between flash and ambient light is critical.</p><p> The further you get from the flash, the dimmer and harder the light becomes. A flash aimed toward the ground will be very bright close to the strobe, fading quickly to invisibility. When setting your scene, use the test button to look at the throw of light across your subject. Aim it carefully, and take advantage of the flash&#39;s zoom to direct the beam just where it is needed. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-post-large-image wp-image-94429 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-94429" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="478" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CO-KenCaryl-WSJA-20Dec2011-5-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#038;ssl=1" alt="A Western Scrub Jay perches in a tree in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains outside Denver, CO, USA." class="wp-image-94429" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CO-KenCaryl-WSJA-20Dec2011-5-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CO-KenCaryl-WSJA-20Dec2011-5-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CO-KenCaryl-WSJA-20Dec2011-5-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CO-KenCaryl-WSJA-20Dec2011-5-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CO-KenCaryl-WSJA-20Dec2011-5-1.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> A Western Scrub Jay perches in a tree in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains outside Denver, CO, USA.

My best advice is to take a guess, capture a shot or two, and then check the results on your LCD. You&#39;ll generally find you need to adjust the flash brightness, placement, or the ambient light exposure, and that&#39;s okay!</p><p> When using flash, remember this:</p><p> Adjust the brightness of the ambient light with the shutter speed, and adjust the exposure of the artificial (flash) light with the f-stop (aperture).</p><p> For example, if you want to bring out more brightness in the sky, lengthen your shutter speed; if you want to increase the apparent brightness of your flash, open up the aperture. This is effective for small adjustments in-camera and keeps you from having to constantly readjust flash settings. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-use-the-flash-for-more-artistic-nature-photos"> How to use the flash for more artistic nature photos</h2><p> What if you don&#39;t want to use the flash to create a natural-looking landscape, but you instead want to produce an artistic effect?</p><p> An artistic look is more straightforward, but light direction, intensity, and color are important. I like to photograph the northern lights around my home in Fairbanks, Alaska. Often the moon, stars, or aurora itself are sufficient to illuminate the foreground, but at times, the foreground starts to fade to black, like this: </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AK-FAI-aurora-112073-17.jpg?ssl=1" alt="AK FAI aurora 112073 17" title="AK-FAI-aurora-112073-17.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The foreground trees are completely detailless, but they&#39;re a lot darker than I&#39;d like.</figcaption></figure></div><p> In such cases, a splash of light is just what I need. When photographing the aurora – or the night sky in general – I rarely carry an actual flash, but I&#39;m always wearing a headlamp. During a typical 5-10 second exposure, if I need a little extra texture or warmth, I can pan the beam quickly over the foreground, <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/beginners-guide-to-light-painting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">“painting” it with light</a> , as I did in this image: </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AK-FAI-aurora-112073-18.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Aurora with artificial lighting" title="AK-FAI-aurora-112073-18.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> A bit of artificial light can transform a dark foreground!</figcaption></figure></div><p> Light from a typical LED is very cold, but cover it with CTO gel, and nice warm tones result.</p><p> Note: Light painting is a popular technique, but it does require some practice to ensure your subject is evenly lit and not too bright. Mixing light painting and ambient light can be a very effective way to even out the brightness in an image and compensate for highlights.</p><p> A while back, while in Argentina, I photographed a historic farmhouse in the late evening. Bright porch lights on the house needed to be evened out, so I painted some key parts of the scene. Here&#39;s what resulted: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Arg-Salta-SantAnita-house-night-104133-18.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Arg Salta SantAnita house night 104133 18" title="Arg-Salta-SantAnita-house-night-104133-18.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> A warning: Light painting can mess with the color of a digital image. If you use your camera&#39;s automatic settings, as I do, light-painted images will often require some color correction in post-processing. <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/raw-versus-jpg-why-you-might-want-to-shoot-in-raw-format/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Shoot in RAW</a> to be sure you retain this flexibility. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-use-flash-to-photograph-wildlife"> How to use flash to photograph wildlife</h2><p> Flash can also play an important role in wildlife photography. Birds in particular are often down low in dark forests (where natural sunlight is rarely found). Shaded light is flat and boring, but with careful use of flash, you can replace that bland light with some nice directional illumination: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CO-Dec2009-AMRO-3.jpg?ssl=1" alt="CO Dec2009 AMRO 3" title="CO-Dec2009-AMRO-3.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> When using flash with a long telephoto lens, you can often get away with on-camera, or bracket-mounted flash, as I did for my American Robin portrait above. Using camera-mounted flash is easy with <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/beginners-guide-to-using-ttl-off-camera-flash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">TTL (through the lens)</a> compatible strobes. In fact, this technique is so easy that I&#39;m not even going to go into it because more interesting possibilities exist.</p><p> Where I live in Alaska, the winters are long, and during the few hours of daylight, the sun is often hidden behind trees or clouds. The birds I love to photograph are usually stuck in flat, gray light – unless I bring out my flash!</p><p> There are a few trees in my yard that the birds prefer. By setting up a flash (or two), gelled with CTO to emulate the absent sun, I&#39;ve managed to create some well-lit portraits of these guys: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/RBNU-21Dec2011-2.jpg?ssl=1" alt="RBNU 21Dec2011 2" title="RBNU-21Dec2011-2.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> The method is similar to lighting a landscape. You&#39;ve got to choose your flash placement to avoid shadows, and since there is rarely a chance to replicate a poorly exposed shot, it&#39;s best to get your settings right and then leave them in place throughout the shoot.</p><p> For this next image, I was going for an almost studio-like look, so I took advantage of the white snow as a background, making the final image appear almost as a cut-out: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ORJU-22Dec2011-2.jpg?ssl=1" alt="ORJU 22Dec2011 2" title="ORJU-22Dec2011-2.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> I like to put my flashes atop a tall stand to get them over my head like a low-angle sun. Done right, the setup and exposure take only a few moments, and the results can be great! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="capture-some-amazing-nature-and-landscape-photos-with-flash"> Capture some amazing nature and landscape photos – with flash!</h2><p> Artificial light in the outdoors offers a great opportunity to create unique images. Think through your shots, consider where extra light can be added, and what role it will play in the final image. Not every situation requires it – in fact, most don&#39;t.

You don&#39;t have to be close to people&#39;s faces; you can capture candid expressions and serendipitous moments from a fair distance away. This lens is especially useful during the wedding ceremony when you would rather be far away and out of sight or hidden behind a wall or door. It allows you to capture the exchange of rings, the vows, and the kiss discreetly.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-96798" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="478" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0024.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#038;ssl=1" alt="lenses for wedding photographers example photo" class="wp-image-96798" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0024.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0024.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0024.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0024.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0024.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Thanks to a 70-200mm lens, I was able to discreetly capture this moment from a distance – and the long focal length created a pleasing foreground blur, too!</figcaption></figure></div><p> If you require an even longer zoom while staying at the same distance, you can choose to photograph using Crop mode (if you shoot full-frame and your camera offers this option). This will generally give you a 1.5x crop factor (it only uses a portion of the image and enlarges it approximately 1.5x). If you do this, make sure that you have enough pixels for the crop in case you feel the need to straighten or change your composition in post-processing.</p><p> For example, if you are shooting with a 12 MP camera in its full-frame mode, when you convert to your Crop mode, it becomes a 5 MP camera. This is below the minimum amount of pixels you need (generally around 6 MP) to enlarge prints to a decent size.</p><p> And if you have to crop in post-processing, 5 MP will not offer enough pixels to do so without compromising print output sizes.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-96788" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="478" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0014.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#038;ssl=1" alt="lenses for wedding photographers wedding program" class="wp-image-96788" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0014.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0014.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0014.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0014.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0014.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> At weddings, a 70-200mm lens is great for capturing details from a distance.</figcaption></figure></div><p> However, if you are photographing with a 36 MP camera in Crop mode, it drops to 15.3 MP.

So if you forget to compose accordingly in-camera, you will get a nasty surprise after you have taken the image. (Cut-off heads and limbs and badly cropped compositions are two examples.)</p><p> When using APS-C lenses on a full-frame body, the rest of the unused sensor area is blacked out. But when using full-frame lenses in Crop mode, this is not the default. You will still see the entire full-frame sensor if you don&#39;t change your settings.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-96791" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="478" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0017.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#038;ssl=1" alt="lenses for wedding photographers married couple" class="wp-image-96791" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0017.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0017.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0017.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0017.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0017.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Want to take flattering wedding portraits?

When photographing at 200mm, I typically stop down to around f/4 or f/5.6 at a shutter speed of 1/200-1/400th, and the sharpness of the image is stunning against a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-blurred-backgrounds-in-portraits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creamy bokeh background</a> . My 70-200mm f/2.8 lens also has a built-in lens collar you can use to steady your setup when hand-holding (and you also have the option to attach it to a tripod).</p><p> Without a tripod, you can <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-hold-a-digital-camera/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">steady yourself as much as possible</a> by leaning against something strong like a wall or a stable surface such as a table.

But while I would love to add this lens to my arsenal, it&#39;s not an absolute necessity. With the 24-70mm lens, you can photograph location scenes wide enough. And should you need to capture a wider scene, you could photograph a few images and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-making-your-first-panorama-photo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stitch them together in Photoshop as a panorama</a> . This is easy enough to do by making sure the exposure setting for the series of shots is the same, standing on a fixed point, then capturing a set of images while adjusting your composition slightly.</p><p> You can do the same for a photograph of all the guests, too. In fact, the two times mentioned above are the only times I need an ultra-wide lens for a wedding, so I cannot yet justify adding it to my list of must-haves.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-96786" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="478" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0012.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#038;ssl=1" alt="lenses for wedding photographers people dancing" class="wp-image-96786" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0012.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0012.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0012.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0012.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0012.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> A 24-70mm lens really excels when it comes to these dynamic candid wedding shots! </figcaption></figure></div><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-96795" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="478" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0021.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#038;ssl=1" alt="lenses for wedding photographers people dancing" class="wp-image-96795" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0021.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0021.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0021.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0021.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0021.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Another wedding image captured with my 24-70mm lens. </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="mm-prime"> 3. 85mm prime</h2><p> This is my all-time favorite lens for wedding photography, and it&#39;s the one I use for portraits of the bride and groom, bridesmaids and groomsmen, individual guests and small groups (the list goes on!).</p><p> As a fixed lens, an <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/review-sony-fe-85mm-f-1-4-gm-lens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">85mm prime</a> requires more work on your part; you have to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/perspective-photography-dont-just-stand-move-feet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zoom in and out with your feet</a> .

Plus, you must do this in a very short amount of time, often in small spaces like cramped hotel rooms.</p><p> A 35mm lens is also perfect for photographing wider scenes, because you can get images without the exaggerated distortions caused by a wider focal length.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-96813" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="478" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0032.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#038;ssl=1" alt="lenses for wedding photographers 35mm example" class="wp-image-96813" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0032.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0032.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0032.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0032.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0032.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> I love to use my 35mm f/1.4 lens to capture wider scenes like this one.

Plus, it doubles as a macro lens.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-96826" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:74.76%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="536" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0040.jpg?resize=717%2C536&#038;ssl=1" alt="lenses for wedding photographers details" class="wp-image-96826" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0040.jpg?resize=717%2C536&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0040.jpg?resize=300%2C224&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0040.jpg?resize=600%2C449&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/5-must-have-lenses-wedding-photographer_0040.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> I use my macro lens to capture all the little details.
