id="wide-apertures-generally-produce-softer-photos">大光圈（通常）会产生更柔和的照片</h3><p class="p1">使用几乎所有全开镜头，您最终会得到更柔和的图像。当设置为最大光圈时，镜头中每个玻璃元件的每个部分都会投入工作，镜头中的任何缺陷、污垢、划痕和光线的物理特性都会影响照片的清晰度。</p><p class="p1">这就是高质量快速镜头价格如此昂贵的部分原因。玻璃必须非常出色才能保持全开清晰度。 </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading p1" class="wp-block-heading p1" data-section id="very-narrow-apertures-produce-softer-photos">非常窄的光圈可产生更柔和的照片</h3><p

光圈在风景摄影中非常流行，也许这可以解释原因：它是清晰度和景深之间的良好折衷。在 f/16 时，您可以获得较深的景深，虽然文件会因衍射而软化，但与 f/32 相比，在 f/16 时效果不会那么明显。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading p1" class="wp-block-heading p1" data-section

So decide if you have already got enough necessary shots before you try it and whether the show will last long enough for some experimentation.</p><p> If you&#39;re game, here&#39;s how you do it:</p><ul><li> You will need your hands free for this, and you&#39;ll want to look through the viewfinder or perhaps use Live View, so using the remote release probably isn&#39;t going to work. Instead, set your shutter speed for about 8-10 seconds, leaving all the other camera settings where they were.</li><li> Set your lens to manual focus, then focus on the spot where the fireworks will burst. Turn the ring so things are out of focus.</li><li> Just as a firework explodes, fire the shutter and smoothly turn the focus right back to the focus point. You must get the fireworks in focus before the exposure is complete, but if you finish early, that&#39;s okay. </li></ul><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-173368 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/make-better-fireworks-photos-bloom-technique-02.jpg?ssl=1" alt="better fireworks photos" class="wp-image-173368" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Two images using the defocus-to-focus technique. (Images by Rick Ohnsman)</figcaption></figure></div><p> And try different things with subsequent shots. Go from focused to unfocused, zoom in or out during the exposure, or maybe take the camera off the tripod and move it during the exposure to make light trails. Play and see what you like.</p><p> Just remember that the duration of the show is limited, so try some experiments but also be sure you have some solid keepers.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-the-black-hat-trick">22. Use the black hat trick</h2><p> Here&#39;s a handy trick that can produce very artistic results:</p><ul><li> Have a hat, preferably one that&#39;s dark and opaque.</li><li> Put the hat over the front of the lens.</li><li> Have the camera in Bulb mode, and just before the firework launches, click open the shutter.</li><li> Quickly but gently – so as not to bump the camera – remove the hat while the firework explodes.</li><li> Leave the shutter open and carefully replace the hat. Repeat, removing and replacing the hat for multiple fireworks bursts. (You may need to have a smaller aperture or lower ISO to do this as you will be building up exposure brightness with each additional firework added).</li><li> Unlock the remote and close the shutter when you&#39;ve done all you want.</li></ul><p> What you&#39;re doing is making a multiple-exposure image in-camera.

Balance, however, isn&#39;t like standard compositional tricks; instead, it&#39;s more <em>fundamental</em> to photography. In fact, some photographers argue that most (or even all) compositional advice comes from the pursuit of visual balance – so if you start using this concept as you compose your images, it&#39;ll allow you to structure your photos <em>very</em> successfully.</p><p> But what is balance as it relates to photography?它是如何工作的？ And how can you use it in the field? In this article, I explore all of these questions, and I share nine approaches to creating balance in your images.</p><p>让我们开始吧！ </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-is-balance-in-photography"> What is balance in photography?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-147595" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:70.01%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="502" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-HEADER.jpg?resize=717%2C502&#038;ssl=1" alt="lighthouse - 9 Ways to Create Balance in Your Photography" class="wp-image-147595" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-HEADER.jpg?resize=717%2C502&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-HEADER.jpg?resize=300%2C210&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-HEADER.jpg?resize=600%2C420&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-HEADER.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Balance is a way of composing an image so that all elements complement each other equally. When an image is properly balanced, it features visual tension or harmony; this, in turn, results in an aesthetically pleasing shot.</p><p> But balance isn&#39;t a simple compositional trick. Many different elements can be involved in incorporating balance into your image composition, including:</p><ol><li>颜色</li><li>Light versus shadow</li><li>质地</li><li>Visual weight</li><li> Subject placement</li><li> Relation of elements to one other</li><li>对称</li><li>景深</li><li>Negative space </li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-do-you-achieve-balance"> How do you achieve balance?</h2><p> When you compose your shot, you need to think about the different elements and how they interact and relate to each other. What is the story you want to tell or frame? What is the emotion you are trying to convey?</p><p> Balance can be harmonious, where all elements are equally present and form an aesthetically pleasing whole (symmetry is a good example). A landscape scene perfectly mirrored in a still pond or lake is very harmonious.</p><p> Alternatively, an image can have visual tension due to balance. It may seem counterintuitive, but think about negative space or a small spot of bright red in an otherwise dull image. In such cases, the image is balanced, yet it doesn&#39;t feel harmonious (at least not in a simple sense).</p><p> Often, several different factors come into play when considering balance. In other words, it&#39;s not necessarily just one problem to solve for each image. Every scene has color, objects, tones, contrast, and so on, which are all involved in producing that final sense of balance.</p><p> Balancing a composition has to do with the mechanics of how you take the photo (light/shadow/contrast/tone), but it also has to do with more visual elements (symmetry/negative space/subject placement). So there are many different things to consider at once within each image.</p><p> Let&#39;s look at each in more detail!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="color"> 1.

This image has balance because the red has a lot of visual weight, but physically, the red is only a small part of the overall image.</p><p> If the red took up a lot more space, it would overwhelm; instead, it gives the viewer a place to start the journey as they look at all the different textures and colors contained in the garden.</p><p> You can also use color to evoke a mood, a feeling, or a period of time. This old bicycle was turned into a welcome sign at a historic homestead:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-148250" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:65.55%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="470" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-13.jpg?resize=717%2C470&#038;ssl=1" alt="b/w of a bike - 9 Ways to Create Balance in Your Photography" class="wp-image-148250" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-13.jpg?resize=717%2C470&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-13.jpg?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-13.jpg?resize=600%2C394&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-13.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-13.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-13.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Thanks to a slight sepia tone, the image displays all the textures in the shot and evens out all the different competing colors. The focus becomes the bicycle and not the bright green of the grass or the red of the chicken in the background. Changing the colors balances out all the other elements and allows you to emphasize the subject you <em>want</em> to be the focus.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="light-versus-shadow"> 2. Light versus shadow</h2><p> Light and shadow are opposing elements, and both are necessary for photography. If you have light, in general, you will have shadows. When you have both present it gives your subjects <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/depth-dimension-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="added dimension (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">added dimension</a> ; they become three-dimensional elements, even though they are being viewed in a flat two-dimensional medium (either printed or on a screen).</p><p> Contrast and tonal differences make an image more dynamic and interesting. Contrast comes from the difference between the amount of light and shadow in an image. More contrast also widens out the tonal range of the image. If the tones are too similar, the shot will look very flat, like this seaside landscape: </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-148249 size-post-large-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-148249" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="478" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-12.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#038;ssl=1" alt="overcast seascape image - 9 Ways to Create Balance in Your Photography" class="wp-image-148249" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-12.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-12.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-12.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-12.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-12.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This image taken on a heavily overcast day has very little contrast.

I photographed the horseshoes below so that the harsh midday sun created the shadows, which resulted in those interesting patterns and showed how the horseshoes hang on the nails. It would be a much less interesting image without the shadows!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-148251" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:72.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="522" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-14.jpg?resize=717%2C522&#038;ssl=1" alt="horse shoes in b/w - 9 Ways to Create Balance in Your Photography" class="wp-image-148251" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-14.jpg?resize=717%2C522&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-14.jpg?resize=300%2C218&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-14.jpg?resize=600%2C437&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-14.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="texture"> 3.

Yet the visual weight is held by the fuzzy green leaf in the bottom right-hand corner:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-148248" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:101.39%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="727" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-11.jpg?resize=717%2C727&#038;ssl=1" alt="monarch butterfly - 9 Ways to Create Balance in Your Photography" class="wp-image-148248" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-11.jpg?resize=717%2C727&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-11.jpg?resize=296%2C300&amp;ssl=1 296w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-11.jpg?resize=592%2C600&amp;ssl=1 592w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-11.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-11.jpg?w=740&amp;ssl=1 740w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If I were to crop the bottom section off, it would completely change the feel of the image, and the butterfly would become more prominent.</p><p> This next image is a personal favorite. It shows a fresh new bright limestone headstone in a cemetery of very old and weathered stones:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-148241" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:63.74%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="457" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-5.jpg?resize=717%2C457&#038;ssl=1" alt="cemetery - 9 Ways to Create Balance in Your Photography" class="wp-image-148241" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-5.jpg?resize=717%2C457&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-5.jpg?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-5.jpg?resize=600%2C382&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-5.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The light was at the perfect angle to highlight the bright stone, and as you can see, it carries a lot of visual weight – yet it&#39;s only a very small element physically within the image. The central placement works well in balancing the other elements around it and allows more of the story to be told. If I had composed the shot so the frame was tighter on the headstone, the resulting image would have a very different feel.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="subject-placement"> 5. Subject placement</h2><p> Where you place the subject in the frame is important in many ways. It can be used to show scale, to show the relationship between elements, to highlight tension, or to create a specific feel or stylistic tone to an image.</p><p> A classic example is the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/" target="_blank" aria-label="rule of thirds (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">rule of thirds</a> , which suggests that a centered subject lacks drama and impact. Instead, according to the rule of thirds, you should place the subject a third of the way into the frame to make it more dynamic.</p><p> Also, when the subject is looking in a particular direction, where you place them affects the feeling of the image. If they are looking out of the frame, placing them close to the edge creates a very different feeling compared to if you compose the image so that they are looking more into or across the frame.</p><p> In the cave image below, the people add balance by providing scale. Without them, we would be unable to appreciate the true size of the cave as we have no context to apply:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-148244" style="width:546px"><span class="space" style="width:546px; padding-top:137.36%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="546" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-7b.jpg?resize=546%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="large cave opening - 9 Ways to Create Balance in Your Photography" class="wp-image-148244" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-7b.jpg?w=546&amp;ssl=1 546w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-7b.jpg?resize=218%2C300&amp;ssl=1 218w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-7b.jpg?resize=437%2C600&amp;ssl=1 437w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The bright colors of their clothes also offer some visual weight in contrast to the textured details of the rock walls. The positioning at the bottom of the frame grounds the image and helps tell the story.</p><p> In this next image, the placement of the bellbird on the branch is an appealing balance of angles and lines:</p><p class="has-text-align-center"> <span class="responsive-image aligncenter wp-image-148242 size-full" style="width:644px"><span class="space" style="width:644px; padding-top:116.46%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="644" height="750" class="aligncenter wp-image-148242 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-6.jpg?resize=644%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="yellow bird in a tree - 9 Ways to Create Balance in Your Photography" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-6.jpg?w=644&amp;ssl=1 644w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-6.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-6.jpg?resize=515%2C600&amp;ssl=1 515w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><br /></p><p> The line of the main branch is echoed by the blurred ones in the background, which gives some depth and scale to the image. The bird is a nice size within the image, large enough to see the details but not cramped within the frame. His crimson eye holds a lot of visual weight, as well. If the bird was angled the other way, it would be less pleasing as it would not be balanced the same way (the “X” of the bird&#39;s body and the branch is symmetrical!). </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-relationships-between-elements"> 6. The relationships between elements</h2><p> This takes the placement concept a step further. It&#39;s about considering the specific relationship between elements and how can you use them in composing your images.</p><p> Take a look at this landscape shot below, which is a pretty simple land/sea/sky shot:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-148246" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:62.06%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="445" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-9.jpg?resize=717%2C445&#038;ssl=1" alt="danger sign cliff warning - 9 Ways to Create Balance in Your Photography" class="wp-image-148246" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-9.jpg?resize=717%2C445&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-9.jpg?resize=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-9.jpg?resize=600%2C373&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-9.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you focus on the right-hand side of the frame, it&#39;s not very interesting at all. But the inclusion of the sign next to the edge of the cliff changes everything. The bright red letters catch our attention (as they should!), and even though the sign is small, it has a large impact.</p><p> Had the sign not been so close to the edge, the photo would be less compelling. In composing this, I used the rule of thirds to provide scale and context with the cliff edge off to the right; I wanted to show that the cliff continued (it was a whole headland of several hundred meters with just this one sign).</p><p> Below is a landscape shot of some fossilized totara tree trunks at Curio Bay, The Catlins, NZ. I used a wide-angle lens, knowing that I needed to include a foreground element to anchor the shot and provide context.</p><p> The person also helps tell more of the story while providing a color pop of bright blue visual interest and weight against the sand and rock. His presence in the front of the frame balances out the large landscape behind him and gives scale so the viewer can appreciate how big the landscape is.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-148243" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="478" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-7.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#038;ssl=1" alt="man in a landscape image - 9 Ways to Create Balance in Your Photography" class="wp-image-148243" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-7.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-7.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-7.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-7.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-7.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="symmetry"> 7.

However, putting your subject dead-center in the frame can be risky. While a mirror image in a lake or puddle can be pretty, it can also be quite static and uninteresting. It&#39;s an odd situation where the image is perfectly balanced and yet doesn&#39;t work compositionally!</p><p> Below, you can see the trees reflected in the lake:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-148253" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="478" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-16.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#038;ssl=1" alt="fall scene and reflection - 9 Ways to Create Balance in Your Photography" class="wp-image-148253" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-16.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-16.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-16.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-16.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Considering-balance-in-composing-images-16.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The reflection is there and it creates some symmetry, but the angle at which it has been shot puts the focus on the landscape. In other words, the reflection is not necessarily the point of the image; it&#39;s more of a bonus. Also, the way the trees are arranged creates balance across the image, the two golden willows are rounded and slightly shadowed.</p><p> Note that the willows are counterbalanced by the taller golden poplar, with similarly toned grass behind and the green of the reeds in the water. There is enough contrast in the image with the light and shadow elements to add depth and interest, while the gold/blue color combination is an aesthetically pleasing one. The reflection softens the colors and tones enough that they allow the actual landscape to take prominence. I specifically composed the frame with all those things in mind.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="depth-of-field"> 8.

But imagine how the image would look if it were shot at f/16.

And despite the thrills of the sport, the arena is a tough place for a photographer. You have to deal with low or inconsistent light, high ISO settings and low shutter speeds, scuffed-up glass, and more. Learning the technique to get decent shots in the first place is half the battle – but that&#39;s a story for another time. Today, it&#39;s time to head into the editing room.</p><p> Below, I share my best tips for editing hockey photos using Lightroom. If you&#39;re a hockey parent or a budding <a aria-label="sports photographer (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/sports-photography-an-introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">sports photographer</a> , read on to discover how to make your photos of players on the ice stand out!</p><p> (Note: Even though this guide specifically addresses <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/total-beginners-guide-to-lightroom-step-by-step/" target="_blank" aria-label="features in Adobe Lightroom (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">features in Adobe Lightroom</a> , the same concepts can be used in any photo editing program with similar controls!)</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shoot-in-raw"> 1. Shoot in RAW</h2><p> First off, if you&#39;re serious about getting the best hockey pictures possible, then it&#39;s a good idea to <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/raw-vs-jpeg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shoot in RAW</a> . Sure, the files are a lot larger, but this is because more data is preserved for each shot. When you&#39;re editing, you&#39;ll be thankful for all the extra leeway you can get with a RAW file over a JPEG.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-145705" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2-shoot-hockey-in-raw.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="A hockey player sitting on the bench during a game" class="wp-image-145705" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2-shoot-hockey-in-raw.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2-shoot-hockey-in-raw.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2-shoot-hockey-in-raw.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2-shoot-hockey-in-raw.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2-shoot-hockey-in-raw.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> That&#39;s not to say that you&#39;re <em>doomed</em> if you shoot in JPEG. It just means you&#39;ll need to be extra careful to get the settings right in the camera, since you won&#39;t have nearly as much flexibility when editing later.</p><p>这是你的选择。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="cull-aggressively"> 2. Cull aggressively</h2><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/taking-out-the-garbage-7-tips-for-choosing-your-best-photos-fast/" target="_blank" aria-label="Culling (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Culling</a> is the process of reviewing your files from a photoshoot, then removing (and maybe also deleting) the photos that don&#39;t make the cut.</p><p> Not every image is a keeper. This is especially true in sports photography, where you&#39;ll frequently end up with images that are out of focus, poorly composed, or simply not very interesting. If your goal is to edit every single hockey photo you take, you&#39;ll never make it past your first photoshoot!</p><p> Choose the <em>best</em> of the <em>best</em> to focus your time and energy on. Edit those, and put the rest aside. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="crop-and-straighten-your-shots"> 3. Crop and straighten your shots</h2><p> It&#39;s rare to nail the best possible composition in-camera. Sure, it happens from time to time, but given the speed of the action and the unpredictability, it&#39;s more likely that your pictures will benefit from a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tips-cropping-better-composition/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">bit of cropping</a> and straightening in Lightroom.</p><p> Consider what&#39;s important in the frame. You want to have a nice balanced composition that fills the image. Think in terms of simplicity: if you crop out a stick or skate that appears in the corner of the image, it will help your final picture feel more clean and professional. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-145706 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-145706" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/3-ice-hockey-cropping-original.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="The unedited image of a hockey player on a breakaway - Tips for Editing Hockey Photos in Lightroom" class="wp-image-145706" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/3-ice-hockey-cropping-original.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/3-ice-hockey-cropping-original.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/3-ice-hockey-cropping-original.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/3-ice-hockey-cropping-original.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/3-ice-hockey-cropping-original.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Here&#39;s one of my hockey photos as it looked straight out of the camera.

If you find that your images are always just a little too zoomed out, keep that in mind the next time you photograph a game, and make a significant effort to either use a longer focal length or get closer to the action.</p><p> Straightening out your images is a big help as well. As you track the play through the viewfinder, it&#39;s easy to start tilting the camera. Now, I&#39;ll admit: there are times when a crazy tilt gives a sense of action and energy to a picture.</p><p> More often than not, however, a crooked shot just looks like the players are about to tumble out of one side of the image. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-145708 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-145708" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/5-hockey-edits-straightening.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="An unbalanced image of a hockey goaltender - Tips for Editing Hockey Photos in Lightroom" class="wp-image-145708" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/5-hockey-edits-straightening.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/5-hockey-edits-straightening.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/5-hockey-edits-straightening.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/5-hockey-edits-straightening.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/5-hockey-edits-straightening.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The players by the bench look like they&#39;re ready to slide down to the bottom left side of the shot. </figcaption></figure></div><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-145709 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-145709" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6-ice-hockey-edit.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="A hockey goaltender taking a break while the crowd cheers - Tips for Editing Hockey Photos in Lightroom" class="wp-image-145709" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6-ice-hockey-edit.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6-ice-hockey-edit.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6-ice-hockey-edit.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6-ice-hockey-edit.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/6-ice-hockey-edit.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This straightened version feels a little more stable.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Take the time to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-straighten-crooked-images-fast-using-lightroom/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">straighten your pictures</a> .

Apply white balance corrections</h2><p> Cameras process color differently than our eyes do. Under tricky lighting conditions, cameras can render unpleasant color casts, resulting in photos that are unnaturally warm (yellow) or unnaturally cool (blue).</p><p> Since it&#39;s hard to appreciate an image that looks too blue or too yellow, correcting the white balance is an important part of your final edit. If you shoot in RAW, you can <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/adjusting-white-balance-in-lightroom/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">adjust the white balance</a> without difficulty.

Apply contrast adjustments</h2><p> Your approach to editing is going to be very different depending on whether or not you have to shoot through the glass. In the NHL, photographers either shot through a small hole in the corners or from higher angles where they can see above the glass. But you may not have that luxury.</p><p> Shooting through thick glass usually robs a picture of a lot of its contrast. But contrast plays an important role in giving an image depth and making it “pop.” So you&#39;ll need to add that back in the final edit.</p><p> Lightroom offers a couple of sliders that can manage this:</p><ul><li> <strong>Contrast:</strong> This slider will make dark midtones darker and light mid-ones lighter. When used in moderation, it can make a picture appear richer, but be careful not to overdo it and create surreal tones.</li><li> <strong>Blacks:</strong> This slider influences the darkest tones of the image. This can be useful for fixing hockey pants, sticks, and skates so that they are black rather than a faded dark gray.</li><li> <strong>Shadows:</strong> This slider affects the mid-to-dark tones of the image. Typically, this slider plays a big role in determining the brightness of the crowd and the players&#39; faces.</li><li> <strong>Dehaze:</strong> The Dehaze slider tries to interpret how light has been lost and scattered in the image. It works well with foggy images and is actually a good fit when shooting through hockey glass, as well. </li></ul><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-145717 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-145717" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/10-ice-hockey-blacks-shadows-original.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="A low contrast image of two hockey players, taken through the glass - Tips for Editing Hockey Photos in Lightroom" class="wp-image-145717" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/10-ice-hockey-blacks-shadows-original.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/10-ice-hockey-blacks-shadows-original.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/10-ice-hockey-blacks-shadows-original.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/10-ice-hockey-blacks-shadows-original.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/10-ice-hockey-blacks-shadows-original.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This shot was taken through the glass.

If you&#39;re trying to edit the image to reflect reality, the Clarity slider should be used in moderation (like with the first edit above). But if you&#39;re looking to let loose and create a bold, loud image, consider using the Clarity slider more heavily (like in the second edit above). </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="reduce-noise-and-apply-sharpening"> 10. Reduce noise and apply sharpening</h2><p> We&#39;re getting close to the finished product, but we&#39;re not quite there yet; the combination of fast-paced action and high ISO settings means that you&#39;ll need to think about <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-do-noise-reduction-in-lightroom/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">noise reduction</a> and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learn-how-to-use-the-sharpening-tools-in-lightroom/" target="_blank" aria-label="sharpening (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">sharpening</a> . Lightroom offers a few powerful tools to do this, all of which are located in the Detail panel.</p><p> First, while modern cameras have vastly improved how much grain is produced at high ISOs, you&#39;ll still likely want to add some noise reduction. In Lightroom, you can now just hit the <strong>Denoise</strong> button, which will use AI to analyze your file and remove noise while preserving details. Alternatively, you can use the Manual Noise Reduction sliders for finer control.</p><p> One tip: Don&#39;t panic about the amount of grain while viewing the image at 400% zoom. Some grain is okay – in fact, it will be barely noticeable at all when viewing the picture under normal circumstances.</p><p> Also, remember that noise reduction should be beneficial to the image. Too much noise reduction will cause an unnatural smoothing effect, so if you notice that details start to lose definition, then you&#39;ve overdone it.</p><p> Sharpening can also be added according to taste. Just remember that oversharpening can make the image look metallic and fake, so try to find the right balance. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-145737 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-145737" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/28-hockey-sharpening.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Examples of sharpening and noise reduction in a hockey image" class="wp-image-145737" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/28-hockey-sharpening.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/28-hockey-sharpening.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/28-hockey-sharpening.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/28-hockey-sharpening.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/28-hockey-sharpening.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This is a tight crop of the finished image.

Picture yourself on an African savannah, photographing a grazing herd of elephants, followed by a beautiful eagle on the nearby tree…</p><p> Just encountering these subjects is exhilarating – but capturing a top-notch <em>photo</em> requires patience and technical skill, not to mention a quality lens. Because here&#39;s the unfortunate truth: Photographing distant wildlife can&#39;t be done with a wide-angle zoom or a standard prime. If you want to capture lots of detail, you need significant reach (generally 300mm at minimum). And if you want to capture a variety of subjects, both small and large, skittish and tame, you need a lens that can zoom in and out as the moment demands.</p><p> Fortunately, <a aria-label="Nikon's 200-500mm f/5.6E ED VR lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://geni.us/dPSNikon200-500f5-6len" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Nikon&#39;s 200-500mm f/5.6E ED VR lens</a> seems to be the perfect wildlife photography glass. It&#39;s versatile, it has plenty of reach, and it&#39;s available for a very reasonable $1400 USD. It weighs about 2300 g (81.02 oz), and the best part is that it boasts a fixed maximum aperture of f/5.6. In addition to a fixed aperture, there are three extra-low dispersion glass elements (ED) and powerful vibration reduction (VR), plus the lens comes with a tripod collar. The 200-500mm f/5.6 is stable when mounted on a tripod; it also works great with both full-frame (FX) and crop-sensor (DX) Nikon cameras.</p><p> But is the Nikon 200-500mm f/5.6E ED VR as great as it sounds? This field review of the Nikon 200-500 f/5.6 lens considers it from the perspective of a nature and wildlife photographer. I&#39;ve spent plenty of time testing the lens, and below, I explain how this lens performs in the wild; I also share my thoughts on the lens controls and ergonomics.

FULL allows the lens to focus across the entire focusing range. I use FULL all the time and have never missed the focus. The Infinity-6m option limits the focusing range of the lens so it will only focus from 6m to infinity. Any object that is closer than 6m won&#39;t be in focus, so I do recommend generally using the FULL option.</li><li> <strong>VR ON | VR OFF</strong> . This activates the Vibration Reduction. Set this to ON. I set it to ON even when mounted on a tripod.</li><li> <strong>NORMAL |运动</strong>。 This sets the type of Vibration Reduction. I recommend setting the VR type to NORMAL. For wildlife and birds, NORMAL mode works great.</li><li> <strong>LOCK 200 |开锁</strong>。 The LOCK 200 button locks the lens to 200mm. You cannot zoom the lens when it is locked, so the lock switch is perfect for when you are traveling and your lens is packed. It avoids unintended zooming during travel.</li></ol><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="ergonomics">人体工学</h3><p>The lens is a bit heavy, but as you continue to use it, you will be able to easily handhold it.

The zooming feels smooth and is precise. The manual focus ring feels slightly loose, but I do find the <em>quality</em> of the manual focus to be excellent.</p><p> The Nikon 200-500 f/5.6 fits in a midsized camera bag <em>if</em> it&#39;s first dismounted.

Many of the latest cameras by Nikon are good enough to shoot in low light, however, so it&#39;s the lens performance (and your technique) that you&#39;ll want to consider.</p><p> Overall, I&#39;d say this lens&#39;s performance is somewhere between good to average in low light. But if you follow the below techniques, you can achieve awesome images in low light:</p><ul><li> Use a bean bag or tripod.</li><li> Use an f/5.6 aperture.</li><li> Use shutter speeds from 1/30s to 1/60s.</li><li> If the lens is struggling to autofocus quickly, focus manually.</li><li> Shoot in RAW so that you can recover detail and process images effectively.</li><li> Shoot at a reasonably high ISO. This depends on your camera, but ISOs in the 2000-4000 range can provide a great balance between image quality and exposure.</li></ul><p> Here is an image I shot in near-darkness during a late winter evening. I used a bean bag, the aperture was set to f/5.6, and the shutter speed was 1/30s. The ISO was around 2500. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-171074 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-171074" style="width:1600px"><span class="space" style="width:1600px; padding-top:66.69%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1067" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shreyas-yadav-Image17.jpg?resize=1600%2C1067&#038;ssl=1" alt="Nikon 200-500mm f/5.6 review" class="wp-image-171074" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shreyas-yadav-Image17.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shreyas-yadav-Image17.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shreyas-yadav-Image17.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shreyas-yadav-Image17.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shreyas-yadav-Image17.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shreyas-yadav-Image17.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> A leopard on a late winter evening.

But if you combine it with the techniques I shared above, you can achieve stunning images. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-range-of-focal-lengths"> A range of focal lengths</h2><p> The Nikon 200-500mm is a hugely popular lens, and its focal length is one of the prime reasons. This range is perfect for wildlife photography and works well on both full-frame and crop-sensor cameras. 500mm is great for birds, while the 200-400mm range is great for wildlife.</p><p> If you are using a full-frame camera, you will get a focal length of 200mm to 500mm, and if you are a DX shooter, the effective focal length you will be getting is around 300mm to 750mm. In my experience, 750mm is superb for bird photography, and 300mm is great for animals and other wildlife. I use my Nikon 200-500mm f/5.6 on a crop-sensor (DX format) body. When I am on a safari, I can easily photograph eagles, woodpeckers, small forest birds, tigers, elephants, and snakes. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-171075 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-171075" style="width:1600px"><span class="space" style="width:1600px; padding-top:66.69%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1067" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shreyas-yadav-Image18.jpg?resize=1600%2C1067&#038;ssl=1" alt="Nikon 200-500mm f/5.6 review" class="wp-image-171075" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shreyas-yadav-Image18.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shreyas-yadav-Image18.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shreyas-yadav-Image18.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shreyas-yadav-Image18.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shreyas-yadav-Image18.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shreyas-yadav-Image18.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> A rat snake appeared in the bushes, which were very close to me.

Sharpness at this aperture is great!</figcaption></figure></div><p> If the objects are at a shorter distance and not moving very fast, an f/5.6 aperture produces nice colors and sharpness. If the objects are moving fast, however, I&#39;d recommend using f/8 to achieve sharp images. While you adjust your aperture for image sharpness, also ensure you have enough <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/">shutter speed</a> to freeze the action.</p><p> Here are the techniques I use to get sharp images with this lens every time. I have applied these techniques in the wild and repeatedly captured crisp photos:</p><ul><li> Set the lens aperture to f/5.6 or f/8 depending on the subject.</li><li> Set the shutter speed to at least 2x times the focal length (for example, if you are at 500mm, use a shutter speed of at least 1/1000s).</li><li> If you can&#39;t use a fast shutter speed due to low light, use Vibration Reduction along with stable support such as a tripod or bean bag (I&#39;ve found that, with VR activated, my shutter speeds can be as low as 1/30s and I can <em>still</em> capture sharp photos).</li><li> Use AF-C with dynamic focus areas or AF-S with the focus area set to the center point.</li><li> If needed, increase the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-choose-the-right-iso-for-your-digital-photography/">ISO</a> . For most of the latest Nikon cameras, ISO 2000 to ISO 4000 is the sweet spot! </li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="manual-focus-override-can-come-in-handy"> Manual focus override can come in handy!</h3><p> The manual focus override feature is useful when the lens struggles to autofocus. Usually this happens if there is clutter in front of the main object (eg, grass or leaves in front of a bird). In this case, use the manual focus ring to focus. As I mentioned above, the manual focus ring does feel a bit loose, but the precision is good.</p><p> Manual focus override is also useful in low-light conditions.

If so, you saw the interesting effect created by the rapid flashing. Smooth movement gets broken into a series of frozen-stepped motion, not unlike the frames of an old-time movie.</p><p> Now, what if you could do that with your still camera – that is, create a series of images, all within one frame? If you have a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/a-beginners-guide-to-working-with-flash-off-camera/" target="_blank" aria-label="portable flash (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">portable flash</a> or studio strobe capable of generating the stroboscopic effect, there&#39;s a good chance you can do this. You can create images that are a great way of analyzing and showing motion, and this article will show you how! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-is-an-in-camera-stroboscopic-effect"> What is an in-camera stroboscopic effect?</h2><p> Different flash manufacturers may use different names for this capability. Canon, Godox, and Yongnuo call it Multi-Mode, while Nikon calls it the Repeating Flash Function. However you refer to it, multi-flash is the capability to fire multiple flashes during one camera exposure.</p><p> The best way to see if your flash is capable of this effect is to read your flash manual. If the flash you own <em>does</em> have this capability, a photo illustration will often accompany it showing the kind of images possible, like this one here: </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-175452 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-175452" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Week-29-Pepper-Strobe.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Stroboscopic photography with multi-flash mode" class="wp-image-175452" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Week-29-Pepper-Strobe.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Week-29-Pepper-Strobe.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Week-29-Pepper-Strobe.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Week-29-Pepper-Strobe.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Week-29-Pepper-Strobe.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> A bright object on a dark background will help a lot when using the multi-flash technique!</figcaption></figure></div><p> If your flash unit supports it, there will be three constants you can control regardless of the make or model of your flash unit.他们是：</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="power-output"> 1. Power output</h3><p> This controls the intensity of the light output. Typically, output runs from 1/1 (full power) down in fractions of that, such as 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64, or 1/128. The smaller the fraction, the less intense the flash output.</p><p> There are two other things to remember about the flash output:</p><ol><li> The higher the output, the more battery power used, and the longer it will take to recycle the flash before it&#39;s ready for another burst.</li><li> The duration of the flash is shorter as the output power gets lower.  As a result, lower power/shorter durations have more “stopping power” when it comes to freezing motion.</li></ol><p> Just to give you an idea of different flash speeds at different power outputs, the chart below shows approximate flash durations for various power settings on a Canon 580EX Speedlite:</p><figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th> Flash output setting</th><th> Flash duration</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> 1/1</td><td> 1/250 of a second</td></tr><tr><td> 1/2</td><td> 1/919 of a second</td></tr><tr><td> 1/4</td><td> 1/2,066 of a second</td></tr><tr><td> 1/8</td><td> 1/3,759 of a second</td></tr><tr><td> 1/16</td><td> 1/6,024 of a second</td></tr><tr><td> 1/32</td><td> 1/9,470 of a second</td></tr><tr><td> 1/64</td><td> 1/14,000 of a second</td></tr><tr><td> 1/128</td><td> 1/20,000 of a second </td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-number-of-flashes"> 2. The number of flashes</h3><p> This one is easy and is exactly what it sounds like: it&#39;s the number of times the flash will fire during the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure</a> .</p><p> Set it for however many times you want the flash to fire in your image. That&#39;s how many “steps” of the moving object you will see. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-175461 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/stroboscopic-flash-hammer-swing.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Stroboscopic photography with multi-flash mode" class="wp-image-175461" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> How many times did the flash fire during this sequence? Count the number of steps. </figcaption></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-flash-frequency"> 3. The flash frequency</h3><p> This one can sometimes throw the new user as it uses a term not always familiar to everyone: hertz. In very simple terms, hertz refers to the number of cycles in one second. So, 1 Hz=1 flash per second, 10 Hz=10 flashes per second, etc. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-175460 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/multi-flash-mode_(5).jpg?ssl=1" alt="Stroboscopic photography with multi-flash mode" class="wp-image-175460" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The three settings you can control are power output, number of flashes, and frequency. This is a Canon 550EX flash. </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-determine-your-flash-settings-the-formula"> How to determine your flash settings: the formula</h2><p> Here&#39;s how you put it all together.</p><p> Figure out how much power you need and set the power output first. Your distance from the flash to the subject will help you determine it, and so will how fast and how many flashes you expect to fire and how much “freezing action” you need.</p><p> Then think about the speed of the action you intend to capture and its duration. Finally, determine how many steps you want to see freezing the action.</p><p> The formula looks like this:</p><p> <strong>Number of flashes/Hz = Shutter speed</strong></p><p>让我们举个例子。 You want to take a strobed shot of a hammer swinging down and striking a nail. You can put the flash close to the action, so 1/32 power might be enough. If you use a slow swing, you can complete the action in one second. You&#39;d like 6 steps of action in the shot.</p><p> Plug those numbers into the formula:</p><p> <strong>6 flashes/6 Hz (6 flashes per second) = 1 second shutter speed</strong></p><p> Now say you want to capture something faster like a club hitting a golf ball off a tee. You can still get the flash close enough to use 1/32 power. You want 15 steps in your sequence and guess the action will take just 1/30th of a second to complete.</p><p> Here&#39;s how the formula looks for that:</p><p> <strong>15 flashes/199 Hz = ~1/15s shutter speed</strong></p><p> The formula is right, but perhaps the speedlight you&#39;re using (in my case, a <a href="https://geni.us/dPSCanon580EXIIFlash" target="_blank" aria-label="Canon 550EX (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Canon 550EX</a> ) is only capable of a 199 Hz maximum. Even at that, the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> would have to be about 1/15s, not the 1/30s you wanted. Could you live with just eight steps in your shot?</p><p> <strong>8 flashes/150 Hz = ~1/20s shutter speed</strong></p><p> That&#39;s closer! If you slow down your swing, it just might work.</p><p> You will find that at the higher hertz rates, the flash fires so fast that it seems like just one burst. However, when you check your shot, a fast-moving subject lit with a high flash-per-second (hertz) rate should show the individual steps in the movement. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="exposing-for-a-stroboscopic-image"> Exposing for a stroboscopic image</h2><p> You&#39;ve used the formula to determine what numbers you want to enter into the flash, and that&#39;s determined your minimum shutter speed. Here, however, the flash is firing within the scope of the shutter duration, and shutter speed isn&#39;t really a factor in setting exposure.</p><p> Here are the factors that <em>will</em> affect your exposure:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="ambient-light">环境光</h3><p>You want the flash doing the work here. Also, you will typically be shooting at longer shutter speeds to capture the duration of the action.</p><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-mix-ambient-light-and-fill-flash-for-outdoor-portraits/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Ambient light</a> is not your friend as it will begin to force settings you may not want. You also want to eliminate distractions in the shot as the steps of the object in motion will create a busy enough image already. Your best bet is to work in a darkened room and use a black or very dark background.</p><p> Set everything up with a work light on, but switch it off before making the shot so the flash is the only source of illumination.</p><p> That leaves a few things you can do to adjust exposure:</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="set-the-iso"> Set the ISO</h4><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO adjustments (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO adjustments</a> can be helpful here as they allow you to have the aperture and shutter speed where you want them and adjust this third leg of the <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/mastering-the-exposure-triangle-for-newbies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure triangle</a> to get the exposure where you need it. As always, aim to keep the ISO as low as possible to limit noise – but also remember modern cameras have become far less noisy in recent times. Know what your camera can do and at what point you will get too much noise.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="set-the-aperture"> Set the aperture</h4><p> You will want to adjust your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> based on the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> you need for your particular shot. Also, keep in mind that most lenses perform best between f/8 and f/16, so try to be in that range if you can. You can also adjust your aperture for exposure if you need to. However, I recommend making exposure adjustments using ISO and flash power first.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="set-the-flash-power"> Set the flash power</h4><p> Remember, this is one of the settings you enter into the flash. The flash output will very much control your exposure. The best rule of thumb here is to only use as much power as you need.</p><p> To recap, these are the advantages of lower flash power settings:</p><ul><li> You&#39;ll use less battery. (If you have an external power source for your flash, use it.  Stroboscopic flash work drains batteries fast.)</li><li> The flash will recycle faster.</li><li> Lower power = shorter flash duration = more motion-stopping capabilities.</li></ul><p> Increase the flash output if you need to, but remember that increasing the ISO might be a better move.</p><p> You may also find the flash will limit what other settings you can input, especially with higher power settings. To allow sufficient time to recycle between flashes and to prevent the flash from overheating, it may not allow many flashes or a higher hertz setting at higher power settings.</p><p> For example, my Canon 550EX can shoot 70 continuous flashes at 10 Hz <em>if</em> the power is turned down to 1/128 power. However, it can only shoot 2 consecutive flashes at that same 10 Hz rate if the flash is turned up to 1/4 power.</p><p> The Multi-Mode on my Canon flash will not work at all if the flash power is set to anything higher than 1/4 power. Full or 1/2 power in Multi-Mode on the 500EX? It simply cannot do it.</p><p> My flash manual has a chart showing how many sequential flashes are possible at various power and hertz settings. Also, the flash&#39;s programming will not allow settings to be input that exceed its capabilities. Canon also warns: “To prevent overheating and deterioration of the flash head, do not use stroboscopic flash for more than 10 frames in rapid succession. After 10 frames, allow the 550EX to cool for at least 10 minutes.”</p><p> So whether you&#39;re using a Canon flash or another make/model, know that stroboscopic flash works your unit hard and be aware of its limitations. </p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-longer-shutter-speed-is-generally-okay"> A longer shutter speed is (generally) okay</h4><p> Here&#39;s one more thing to think about when inputting the three parameters into the flash and calculating the shutter speed:</p><p> When you click the shutter, the flash will immediately begin its strobed sequence.</p><p> If you input, say, 6 flashes at 6 hz at 1/32 power, per the formula, it will take 1 second for the flash to complete the programmed cycle. However, there&#39;s no reason that the shutter speed couldn&#39;t be <em>longer</em> , especially since in low ambient light conditions, little if any additional light will add to the exposure once the flash cycle completes.</p><p> So to amend the formula just slightly:</p><p> <strong>The number of flashes/Hz = The <em>minimum</em> shutter speed</strong></p><p> With no additional flashes after the sequence completes, further action is not likely to be seen in the shot. So overestimating the shutter speed is usually not a problem. Underestimating the shutter speed, however, won&#39;t allow the flash sequence to complete before the shutter closes. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-175459 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-175459" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:65.93%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="989" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Mode-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C989&#038;ssl=1" alt="Stroboscopic photography with multi-flash mode" class="wp-image-175459" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Mode-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Mode-4.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Mode-4.jpg?resize=768%2C506&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Mode-4.jpg?resize=600%2C396&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Mode-4.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Mode-4.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Mode-4.jpg?resize=717%2C473&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> These are the settings for the golf club shot below.

I&#39;ve offered some guidelines in the previous sections, but how can you ensure perfect exposure? There are a few ways to approach this:</p><ol><li> <strong>Use an external light meter.</strong> Fire the flash and take a reading as you normally would with an <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/photography-1018-meter/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">external meter</a> . Use that to determine your camera setting at the predetermined shutter speed. Adjust the ISO, aperture, and/or flash output power to get a proper exposure. If you are familiar with using an external flash meter, you will know how to do this. But if you don&#39;t have an external light meter, you might try the next method:</li><li> <strong>Do manual calculations.</strong> Look up the guide number of your flash, determine the distance to your subject, and then – using the formulas in your flash manual – calculate your settings. It can work! But if math is not your forte, or you don&#39;t fancy crunching numbers, you could always try the third option:</li><li> <strong>The trial-and-error chimping method.</strong> Okay, that&#39;s my name for it. But it simply involves starting at, say, an ISO of 100, an f-stop of about f/8, and a flash output of 1/32 power. Set the number of flashes and frequency that you think best. Shoot, take a look at the LCD playback (ie, chimp), and if the image is too dark, increase the flash power or open the aperture. Test, chimp, and repeat as needed until you get it dialed in. Digital storage is cheap, and once you figure out your settings, unless you change the flash-to-subject distance, you should be set for the session. </li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-get-even-better-multi-flash-photos"> How to get even better multi-flash photos</h2><p> At this point, you should be familiar with the basics of stroboscopic photography.

A remote trigger can help</h3><p> Unless you have an assistant (or maybe three hands), trying to control the camera while performing the action you&#39;re trying to capture and <em>also</em> nailing the timing is not impossible, but it makes things a lot more difficult. Therefore, a remote trigger that allows you to fire the camera as you start the action sequence can be a huge help.</p><p> If you are mounting your flash off-camera, a means of triggering the flash will also be necessary. Use either a wired connection, a wireless radio trigger, or an infrared camera/flash system.</p><p> Another level of sophistication, if you want to add it, would be a flash trigger, perhaps activated by sound, breaking a laser beam, etc. I have used the <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/review-of-the-miops-smart-trigger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">MIOPS Smart Trigger</a> on other photo projects with success. A real advantage it adds is precision and repeatability of a shot – something that you will otherwise be forced to leave up to luck and timing.</p><p> In a dark environment, use Bulb mode. Open the shutter, and when the action activates the flash trigger (ie, breaks the laser beam or creates a sound), the flash fires its strobe sequence.</p><p> Good flash triggers aren&#39;t cheap. However, if you do a lot of this kind of photography, they significantly speed up the work and permit the repeatability of a shot, which saves a <em>lot</em> of time and effort.</p><p> <span class="responsive-image aligncenter wp-image-175454 size-full" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:34.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-175454 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Golf-Swing-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C522&#038;ssl=1" alt="How-to-Use-Multi-flash-to-Capture-Compelling-Action-Photos" width="1500" height="522" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Golf-Swing-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Golf-Swing-2.jpg?resize=300%2C104&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Golf-Swing-2.jpg?resize=768%2C267&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Golf-Swing-2.jpg?resize=600%2C209&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Golf-Swing-2.jpg?resize=717%2C250&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="practice-makes-perfect">熟能生巧！</h2><p> Like any photography, practice will improve your results with stroboscopic flash work.

Your “Why?” doesn&#39;t have to be etched in stone, but a clear answer will guide how you invest your time and money into growing.</p><p> Here are some example objectives. “I invest time in my landscape photography because…”</p><ul><li> “我想旅行。”</li><li> “I want to make a full-time living.”</li><li> “I want to capture unique locations.”</li><li> “I want to grow my local following.”</li><li> “I want to be the best at my craft.”</li></ul><p> You probably have several objectives in mind, so the next step is to prioritize them. Which objective(s) trumps the others in the competition for your time? Objectives are critical because they help you identify conflicts of interest. Once you start formulating goals, you want to ensure they naturally support your objectives.</p><p> For example, you might be a landscape photographer because you love traveling, but your goal might be to sell prints at local art shows. These may well clash with each other, as manning a booth three days a week means less freedom to travel. In that case, you may need to adjust your goals and find another way to support your wanderlust, even if it&#39;s unrelated to photography.</p><p> You should write your objectives out on paper, or at least on the computer, by the way; this is important because it helps clarify your thoughts and gives you accountability.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="set-effective-goals"> 2.

We&#39;ve all made goals or resolutions that yielded no results other than self-reproach.</p><p> “Oh, I didn&#39;t lose 10 pounds.”</p><p> “I didn&#39;t write half as much as I wanted.”</p><p> “I didn&#39;t read a book this month.”</p><p> But self-reproach is often a symptom of a poorly chosen goal. Effective goals aren&#39;t about slapping yourself for missing them. They&#39;re about deliberately deciding how you want to invest your time and resources. It&#39;s about determining the trajectory you want to take instead of going with the fluctuations of each day.</p><p> Here are two of my personal goals:</p><ol><li> Capture and produce better photography.</li><li> Expand my photography audience.</li></ol><p> But while these goals offer a general direction, they aren&#39;t concrete. So I like to follow them up with more specific formulations for what success looks like.</p><ol><li> Expand my portfolio with shots that have a compelling foreground, middleground, and background.</li><li> Write for two new publications.</li></ol><p> Of course, your goals probably won&#39;t be the same as mine (though they can be!). As you write your goals, pay careful attention to your objectives, and try to pick specific, practical, measurable goals that will help you take steps toward achieving each objective.</p><p> Note that goal-setting can involve significant brainstorming and even guesswork; if your objective is to make money with your landscape photography, for instance, then you should think about various options (leading workshops? selling prints? teaching classes?) and craft your goals accordingly. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="apply-and-adapt-shoot-goals">3. Apply and adapt “shoot” goals</h2><p> Along with your general goals (see the previous section!), I recommend setting specific goals for each landscape photography trip. I call these “shoot” goals, and I often select them in response to notes I took in the field on a previous outing, or based on frustrations I faced in post-production. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/man-o-war_bay,_dorset,_england.jpg?ssl=1" alt="How to use goal planning to grow as a landscape photographer" class="wp-image-154676" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Man-O-War Bay, Dorset, England</figcaption></figure></div><p> Your “shoot” goals should be highly practical and focused on your photographic approach.

Break your goals into results </h2><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/brunate_lago_di_como,_italy.jpg?ssl=1" alt="How to use goal planning to grow as a landscape photographer" class="wp-image-154674" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Brunate Lago Di Como, Italy</figcaption></figure></div><p> Objectives give you direction. Goals give you outcomes. But neither tells you <em>how</em> to accomplish them or how much progress you&#39;ve made towards them. That&#39;s where <em>results</em> come in.</p><p> How will you accomplish your goals? You can&#39;t – at least, you can&#39;t accomplish them all at once. They&#39;re too big, and they say nothing about what actions you should take. To reach your goals, they need to be broken down into small, measurable steps – ie, results. These are small tasks you can complete in no more than a day, and that contribute toward the overall goal.</p><p> Results need to be carefully phrased so they reflect tangible outcomes. Here are some examples of poorly formulated results:</p><ul><li> “Edit for one hour every day.”</li><li> “Spend 30 minutes writing about photography.”</li></ul><p> These results are ineffective because they involve time. Who cares whether you spent 30 minutes editing or three hours? Instead, phrase them in terms of tangible outcomes:</p><ul><li> “Finish a rough edit of three photos today.”</li><li> “Finish outlining my landscape photography article.”</li></ul><p> Each of these results produces something of value – edited photos and an outlined article – and can be completed in one sitting. Plus, the faster you complete each result, the sooner you can move on to other things.</p><p> Breaking down goals into results is hard to do in any field, whether it&#39;s productivity, photography, or software development. But failing to formulate effective results is the number one reason we fail to accomplish anything.</p><p> Don&#39;t tackle a goal and plan as you go. Planning and execution are two different skills. And when you do them simultaneously, you ironically spend the least amount of time on the hardest part: planning. It sounds counterintuitive, but (at least for me), once I break the goal into results, executing them is usually the easiest part.</p><p> What about self-imposed deadlines? Personally, I&#39;ve had limited success with them because time is a poor measure of progress. I sketch out a rough timeline (“by this time next year”), but I write those dates alongside my goals instead of my results. As long as my results are prioritized, deadlines are often arbitrary because I&#39;m always working on the most valuable results.</p><p> How are you spending your time so each minute counts? Focus on <em>results</em> , not <em>time</em> .</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="do-a-retrospective"> 5. Do a retrospective</h2><p> The learning doesn&#39;t end after a shoot. In fact, I learn the most by reviewing photographs from shoots that <em>didn&#39;t</em> quite work out. It sounds counterintuitive, but thanks to something called <em>survival bias</em> , we tend to:</p><ul><li> Overestimate what we can learn from successful shots</li><li> Underestimate what we can learn from shots that didn&#39;t make the cut.</li></ul><p> Consequently, we end up discarding our best source of learning material!</p><p> To beat survivorship bias, conduct a retrospective on some of your failed shots to understand <em>why</em> they didn&#39;t work, and what you&#39;ll do differently next time. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/slea_head,_dingle,_ireland.jpg?ssl=1" alt="How to use goal planning to grow as a landscape photographer" class="wp-image-154680" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Slea Head, Dingle, Ireland</figcaption></figure></div><p> None of my shots from Slea Head on Ireland&#39;s Dingle Peninsula worked out.

And for me, they often form my shoot goals for the <em>next</em> trip. On this year&#39;s trip to Oregon, my goals changed to reflect the lessons I learned from Ireland and the UK. I&#39;ve reproduced them here:</p><ul><li> Capture two stunning images per day for a total of 26 from the trip.</li><li> Identify the emotion of a scene, then highlight it with composition and light.</li><li> Spend 30% less time snapping photos and instead spend it testing compositions.</li><li> Shoot exclusively at dawn and twilight and spend the rest of the day trying compositions on my smartphone.</li><li> Use an <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/neutral-density-filters-landscape-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="ND filter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ND filter</a> for water without exception.</li><li> Identify a strong foreground, middleground, and background before snapping.</li><li> Don&#39;t waste a second on angles filled with busy textures.</li></ul><p> I would have forgotten many of these shoot goals if I hadn&#39;t written them down and reviewed them before each shoot. But I took my shoot goals seriously, and being so intentional paid off. As I said earlier, I learned more in two weeks than I had in two years of shooting – and I produced some of my favorite work to date. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/roads_end,_oregon.jpg?ssl=1" alt="How to use goal planning to grow as a landscape photographer" class="wp-image-154678" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Roads End, Oregon </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="start-intentionally-growing-as-a-landscape-photographer"> Start intentionally growing as a landscape photographer!</h2><p> While approaches to goal planning come in many flavors with various terminologies, they all aim to help individuals connect desired outcomes with strategic actions.

Seeing such a tiny and perfect little human being stirs emotions in everyone. It&#39;s no wonder that there has been a significant rise in the number of photographers offering their services not only for pregnancy and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/newborn-photography-tips-for-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="newborn images (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">newborn images</a> but also for photographing the birth itself as a way to tell the story of that particular moment in time.</p><p> That said, while photographing childbirth can make for deeply meaningful pictures that parents will treasure for decades, it&#39;s very tough to do well. I&#39;m sure you can understand why: your photographic subjects will not be focused on you, you&#39;ll likely be in a busy area with medical professionals moving around, and the parent(s) will be extremely stressed (to say the least) 。</p><p> And let&#39;s not forget the privacy concerns, the low light, the raw emotions, the responsibility that comes from a complete lack of do-overs…it&#39;s enough to make any professional photographer think twice before agreeing to such a photoshoot.</p><p> (Note: If you&#39;re thinking of photographing the birth of your own child, only some of the above difficulties will apply – but you&#39;ll run into additional problems, such as the need to divide your attention between your partner&#39;s labor and your camera, all while feeling unbelievably stressed. It <em>is</em> possible to do your own birth photography, and during COVID, a lot of couples took this approach out of necessity. However, before you commit to photographing your partner&#39;s upcoming childbirth, you should think long and hard about hiring a professional.)</p><p> If you&#39;re still reading, then I&#39;m guessing you do indeed plan to photograph a childbirth in the near future. At the very least, you want to know what birth photography involves so you can make an informed decision. Below, I walk you through considerations, tips, and techniques to help you handle such a difficult but profoundly meaningful photoshoot.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="you-are-always-on-call"> 1. You are <em>always</em> on call</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-261577" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:72.17%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="433" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-14.jpeg?resize=600%2C433&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to photograph childbirth" class="wp-image-261577" title="Story 1.jpg" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-14.jpeg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-14.jpeg?resize=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you are interested in birth photography, you will want to make sure that you have the time and flexibility for it. Your client can go into labor at any time (even with a cesarean birth because a doctor&#39;s schedule can change if there is an emergency!). You might get a call at 3 AM, or when you&#39;re running your own child&#39;s birthday party, or two months before the baby is due.</p><p> That&#39;s all part of the job, so make sure you have arranged for child care for your own children and that you can clear anything off your schedule if the need arises. Also remember that births can be short or they can be very long, so you may find yourself spending long hours at the hospital, which again requires extreme schedule flexibility.</p><p> Oh, and because you&#39;re always on call, you must be reachable; in other words, once you&#39;ve been hired to photograph a birth, you must keep your phone on at all times, and you cannot head off for an off-the-grid yoga retreat in the mountains.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="you-cant-set-the-scene"> 2. You can&#39;t set the scene</h2><p> During a childbirth, nurses, doctors, techs, and interns will all be walking in and out of the room. This is something that you&#39;ll have to accept because you simply cannot ask medical professionals to stay out so you can set up the perfect shot.</p><p> You have to just go with the flow and work within the space you have and around the people in the room. This means being ready with a <a aria-label="variety of different lenses (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/choosing-lenses-when-to-use-which-lens-and-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">variety of different lenses</a> and <a aria-label="compositional strategies (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/four-rules-of-photographic-composition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">compositional strategies</a> , and it also means working fast, since photographic opportunities will appear and disappear in the blink of an eye. You must know your camera exceedingly well; otherwise, you&#39;re bound to end up with a bunch of missed images while you&#39;re fiddling around with your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure</a> or <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/choosing-a-focus-mode/" target="_blank" aria-label="focus settings (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">focus settings</a> .</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-use-a-flash"> 3. Don&#39;t use a flash</h2><p> The parent(s) will be working hard, and flash is a distraction. Therefore, you should not bring <em>any</em> speedlights of your own, and you should make sure that your camera&#39;s pop-up flash stays off throughout the birth.</p><p> Yes, you&#39;ll be working in a relatively low-light environment, but you&#39;ll need to compensate for that in other ways: by paying attention to the artificial lighting within the room, by adjusting your position to make the most of any <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/portraits-with-window-light/" target="_blank" aria-label="window light (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">window light</a> , and by raising your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> as needed. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="youre-there-to-photograph-not-learn"> 4. You&#39;re there to photograph, not learn</h2><p> Asking questions about procedures and medications, or offering your own opinions on childbirth and on what the medical staff is doing is neither necessary nor appropriate. You&#39;ve been hired to document the childbirth, not to quiz medical professionals or provide input. You wouldn&#39;t want a client to instruct you on how to properly conduct a portrait session, would you?</p><p> Let the medical professionals and parents do their jobs, while you focus on doing yours! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="if-at-all-possible-arrange-to-meet-the-doctor-before-the-birth"> 5. If at all possible, arrange to meet the doctor before the birth</h2><p> Meeting the doctor ahead of time can give you an opportunity to talk to them and find out if they have any particular rules for photographing or recording labor and birth.</p><p> It also gives you a chance to talk to them about what happens if your client has a cesarean. Some doctors will arrange with the anesthesiologist to get the photographer back into the operating room in non-emergency cases. (In an emergency, you will not be allowed back there.) In most cases, the anesthesiologist has the final say because you would be in their area to shoot. Don&#39;t take it personally if they say no to a photographer in the OR. They are looking out for your client.</p><p>说到这里：</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="have-a-backup-plan"> 6. Have a backup plan</h2><p> If your client does have an emergency cesarean and you&#39;re not allowed into the operating room, it&#39;s important that you&#39;re ready to make the most of the time you <em>do</em> have to photograph. While you never know for sure what&#39;s going to happen, with a backup plan in place, you&#39;ll be much more likely to end up with shots that your client will love.</p><p> This means making sure you know where the nursery is and where your client will be brought to after delivery. The doctor will fill you in during your meeting about their standard protocol (see above!), but make sure you know where everything is once you are there.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-261576" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="399" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-13.jpeg?resize=600%2C399&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to photograph childbirth" class="wp-image-261576" title="OR.jpg" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-13.jpeg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-13.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-13.jpeg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-13.jpeg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="be-prepared-for-the-unexpected"> 7. Be prepared for the unexpected</h2><p> As I explained at the beginning of this article, babies pay no attention to your time frame, the doctor&#39;s time frame, or anyone else&#39;s. They come when they want to. Be ready for a short labor and be even more prepared for a long one. Make sure you have a battery supply for your camera and your phone and extra memory cards. Make sure you have money for vending machines.</p><p> It&#39;s better to have all of that and not need it than to suddenly find yourself on hour 13 of a birth, needing something to snack on but having no money and with a near-dead camera and no extra batteries or chargers.</p><p> Bottom line: Be overprepared, not underprepared. Not only will it give you the best chance at photographic success, but it&#39;ll keep your stress levels (and your client&#39;s stress levels) from going higher than expected. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="make-sure-your-images-tell-the-story-of-the-day"> 8. Make sure your images tell the story of the day</h2><p> Birth photography isn&#39;t just about photographing the actual birth. It&#39;s about telling the story of the entire day, both before and after the birth itself.</p><p> Flowers, balloons, visitors – they all help tell the story. Capture the moments that you think your clients will want to remember. Even take a photo of the dry-erase board where their nurse writes their name and room number. The parents will want to remember their nurse&#39;s name. And if there is a shift change, take a new photo of the board. Record it until the baby is born! They may have a favorite nurse, and you will help them remember their name. Some parents send thank-you cards to the staff, and it&#39;s nice when they can include the names of the people who took care of them.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-261574" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-11.jpeg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to photograph childbirth" class="wp-image-261574" title="Chucks.jpg" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-11.jpeg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-11.jpeg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="remember-that-the-day-is-not-about-you"> 9. Remember that the day is not about you</h2><p> Don&#39;t try to chat with everyone and make yourself the focus of the day. It&#39;s easy to get consumed in the activity and not even realize that you have distracted from the real star of the day! Let your clients know that you are there documenting everything that they want you to. That makes their job a little easier and allows them to focus.</p><p> Relatedly, meet with your clients ahead of time (well in advance, to be safe!) and discuss any concerns they might have and the photos that they do and don&#39;t want you to take. Different clients will have different preferences and comfort levels, and you want to make sure you cater to their needs. Your goal shouldn&#39;t be to capture the pictures that <em>you</em> think matter but to capture the pictures that the <em>client</em> thinks matter. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="convert-the-images-to-black-and-white-but-give-color-versions-too"> 10. Convert the images to black and white (but give color versions, too)</h3><p> Give your clients color versions of your photos, but also black and white.原因很简单：<br /> some people do not like medical stuff. Some people can&#39;t stand the sight or even the idea of blood, while others prefer not to view the vernix (that cheesy-type substance that covers newborns).</p><p> Even for parents who aren&#39;t bothered by medical stuff in color, it&#39;s a good idea to provide the black-and-white files. When they put together a scrapbook for the birth, they might want black and white. Don&#39;t let them be the ones to <a aria-label="convert the images (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-convert-photos-to-black-and-white-in-lightroom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">convert the images</a> . Take control of the edits and make sure you include the black-and-white versions. They might use all the color ones anyway, but give them the option.</p><p> (Make sure you capture the little details of the baby like toes and ears when you take the photographs as well! Those are always loved and appreciated by the parents.)</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-261575" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:72.17%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="433" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-12.jpeg?resize=600%2C433&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to photograph childbirth" class="wp-image-261575" title="Story 2.jpg" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-12.jpeg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-12.jpeg?resize=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-photograph-childbirth-final-words"> How to photograph childbirth: final words</h2><p> Birth photography is unlike conventional portrait photography. You may not get everything perfect. People may walk into the shot. Someone may turn on a light or turn off a light.事情发生。 The scene can move quickly.</p><p> Make sure you are prepared with camera in hand and make sure to expect the random things that may occur. Document the moments and learn from your experience. The next birth will be easier, and you will gradually learn to adapt and navigate your way through the whole birthing process. You&#39;ll tell better stories each time. Your clients will love you for it, and you will grow as a photographer, an artist, and as a person with each moment you help bring to life!</p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/guide-birth-photography/">A Practical Guide to Birth Photography</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com">Digital Photography School</a> .
