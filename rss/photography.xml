GPS 标记您的精确位置。这样，您就不会浪费时间寻找在侦察过程中找到的完美地点。记下您想象的构图、您设想的镜头类型以及您可能预见的任何挑战。</p><p>仔细记录您的侦察结果将为您节省时间并减轻以后的压力。您将带着一系列想法进入实际拍摄，为捕捉那些最初吸引您进入摄影领域的令人惊叹的风景做好更好的准备。 </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"

这将帮助您尝试不同的构图，并且还可以帮助您记住精确的构图。测试镜头就像快速草图一样，提供了一个粗略的想法，可以在以后转化为杰作。您的手机通常就足够了，因此您在探索时无需携带数码单反相机或无反光镜相机。</p><p>当您进行这些测试拍摄时，目标是获得同一场景的不同角度。尝试不同的高度，靠近或远离，并改变你的视角。这可以让您超越显而易见的事物，发现乍一看可能并不明显的构图。但请记住：您的目标不是完美，而是可能性。</p><p>现在，关于组织这些测试图像。在手机或计算机上创建文件夹，以便您以后可以轻松找到它们。按位置或任何其他对您有意义的指标对它们进行分类。在最后一次外出之前查看这些照片，并考虑随身携带它们（当然是通过手机！）。它们可以提供很容易被忽视的最后一刻的见解，但可以对您的最终镜头产生重大影响。

</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="landscape-photography-scouting-final-words">风景摄影考察：最后的话</h2><p>侦察使您能够在正确的时间出现在正确的地点，为应对大自然的任何挑战做好充分准备。你会了解地形，你会仔细考虑你的构图，并且你会针对意外天气制定应急计划。您还将为任何可能的挑战做好准备。</p><p>如果您在风景摄影拍摄之前没有进行侦察，那么现在就开始吧。这是时间和精力的投资，但回报是值得的。您将拍摄出更具吸引力、更引人注目且效果<em>更好的</em>照片。</p><p>因此，走出去，探索，带回的不仅仅是照片，还有经历和故事。风景摄影是一段旅程，就像任何旅程一样，适当的准备为实现冒险奠定了基础。</p><p>现在交给你：</p><p><em>您在进行风景探险之前会进行侦察吗？如果是这样，你会怎么做？在下面的评论中分享您的想法！</em></p><div

padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PoochRacing.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="狗狗赛跑" class="wp-image-78488" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PoochRacing.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PoochRacing.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PoochRacing.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>对四足物体的事先了解可以决定你的摄影过程的成败。您需要了解基础知识，例如狗的训练水平，才能有效地制定射击策略。</p><p>从与狗主人的对话开始。了解狗的健康状况，特别是它们是否有任何行动问题或饮食限制。这些信息将帮助您决定摄影活动的活跃程度以及您可以使用哪些款待。</p><p>询问他们的性格特征。狗是精力充沛、外向，还是比较害羞、内向？了解这一点将使您能够以展现其真实性格的方式设置镜头。</p><p>询问他们的培训水平。狗知道基本命令，如坐下、停留和过来吗？这会对您安排拍摄的方式产生巨大影响。训练有素的狗可能允许更复杂的设置，而年轻或训练不足的狗可能需要更简单的方法。</p><p>安全是另一个可以追溯到了解狗的问题。如果您了解他们的性格和任何潜在的健康问题，您将能够更好地确保每个参与者都能享受安全、愉快的会议。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="for-running-shots-have-the-owner-call-the-dog"> 4. 对于跑动镜头，请主人呼叫狗</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ArticleImage2.jpg?ssl=1" alt="ArticleImage2" title="文章图片2.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>让狗跑只是成功的一半。真正的技巧是引导他们朝你想要的方向发展。对于训练有素、“坐稳”的狗狗，我通常会将主人放在我身后约 20 米的地方。他们叫来狗，然后狗径直冲向镜头。</p><p>对于年幼或训练较少的幼犬来说，选择一个干扰最小的安全位置非常重要。想想一个适合狗的公园，甚至是狗的后院。如果狗没有掌握“坐下并保持不动”的命令，您也可以寻求额外的人的帮助来将狗固定到位。</p><p>一些摄影师选择用皮带拴住狗。这是可行的，尤其是当主人和他们一起慢跑时。如果皮带干扰了拍摄，您可以稍后编辑它。</p><p>牢记你的立场。如果您希望狗直接朝您跑来，请确保您所在的位置允许这样做。另一种选择是让你的狗穿过你的道路，让你有足够的机会捕捉一系列动作镜头。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="let-the-dogs-be-themselves"> 5. Let the dogs be themselves </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ArticleImage3.jpg?ssl=1" alt="ArticleImage3" title="ArticleImage3.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> While it&#39;s natural to have a list of shots you want to capture, remember that dogs have personalities too. And sometimes, they just want to do their own thing.</p><p> Let them! Some of my best shots have come from moments when the dogs were simply enjoying themselves. They could be chasing after a ball, bounding through tall grass, or playing a game of tug-of-war.</p><p> When you let dogs be themselves, their personalities shine through. And that makes for truly unforgettable photographs. You&#39;ll find that the spontaneity adds a layer of authenticity and emotion that is often missing in overly staged shots.</p><p> So if you find that the dog isn&#39;t interested in running directly towards you, but would rather sniff around and explore, go with it. Capture those candid moments. They&#39;ll likely end up being some of your favorites from the shoot. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-the-right-gear-for-action-dog-photography"> 6. Use the right gear for action dog photography</h2><p> The importance of the right gear can&#39;t be overstated. It can make or break your action shots. Most modern mirrorless cameras come equipped with excellent tracking capabilities, so you&#39;re already off to a good start if you own one.</p><p> A fast burst mode can be a game-changer. A camera capable of shooting at least 8 frames per second allows you to capture every nuance of a dog&#39;s movement, from the take-off to the joyful landing.</p><p> As for lenses, speed is of the essence. I frequently use a 70-200mm f/2.8 lens for my dog action shots. The focal length is versatile enough for close-ups and wide shots, while the large aperture allows for shooting in lower light conditions.</p><p> This lens also delivers stunning bokeh, creating soft backgrounds that make your subject stand out. The key here is to opt for lenses that focus quickly, ensuring you won&#39;t miss that crucial moment when the dog leaps into the air to catch a Frisbee.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="get-down-low"> 7. Get down low</h2><p> Photographing from up high might work for humans, but dogs?没那么多。 The simple act of lowering your camera can transform your dog action photos.</p><p> When you&#39;re at the dog&#39;s level, the images have a unique intimacy. You&#39;re entering their world, capturing life from their viewpoint. This makes for some really compelling photos.</p><p> Another perk is the background. Being low increases the separation between the dog and the background. This helps in creating that beautiful, blurry backdrop, also known as bokeh, which makes the dog pop in the image.</p><p> So don&#39;t hesitate to get a bit dirty. Crouch down, kneel, or even go flat on your stomach. Experimenting with these angles can add a dynamic touch to your images.</p><p> Remember, varying your height and angle can yield a variety of shots, all in one session. So pack some knee pads along with your camera gear and get down to the dog&#39;s eye level. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="choose-the-right-settings-for-dogs-in-action"> 8. Choose the right settings for dogs in action </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ArticleImage4.jpg?ssl=1" alt="ArticleImage4" title="ArticleImage4.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Camera settings can make or break action shots. For starters, I like to use Manual mode. This gives me complete control over the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.</p><p> Fast shutter speeds are essential. Dogs are quick creatures, so to freeze their motion, I generally start with a shutter speed of 1/1000s. Don&#39;t be afraid to ramp it up even more if the dog is particularly fast.</p><p> Aperture plays a role too. A wide aperture like f/2.8 can help create a shallow depth of field, blurring the background and making the dog stand out.</p><p> Then there&#39;s ISO. While you&#39;ll want to keep it as low as possible to avoid grain, don&#39;t be too concerned if you have to increase it to maintain a fast shutter speed. A slightly grainy shot is far better than a blurry one.</p><p> If Manual mode intimidates you, Aperture Priority and Shutter Priority are solid alternatives. They allow you to control one aspect, while the camera adjusts the other. Just make sure you&#39;re still keeping an eye on those crucial settings like shutter speed.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="nail-that-focus"> 9. Nail that focus! </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ArticleImage5.jpg?ssl=1" alt="ArticleImage5" title="ArticleImage5.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Ah, focus: the nemesis of many action photographers. With dogs bounding around, keeping them sharp in your frame can be challenging.</p><p> For fast-paced action, using a single focus point and continuous focusing mode (AF-C) has always worked for me. With back-button focusing, the camera continues to refocus as long as you hold down the button.</p><p> Some cameras offer tracking options. These can lock onto the subject and adjust the focus as they move. Give it a try; it may work wonders depending on your camera&#39;s capabilities.</p><p> Animal eye autofocus is another feature to explore if your camera has it. This function focuses directly on the animal&#39;s eyes, ensuring a sharp, expressive face.</p><p> Don&#39;t underestimate the power of practice. Take the time to understand how your camera&#39;s focusing system responds to fast-moving subjects. Get out there and shoot, analyze your results, adjust, and shoot some more.</p><p> Mastering focus in action photography isn&#39;t something you&#39;ll do overnight. But with consistent effort and the right techniques, you&#39;ll see marked improvements in your work. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ArticleImage6.jpg?ssl=1" alt="ArticleImage6" title="ArticleImage6.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="practice-your-timing"> 10. Practice your timing</h2><p> Timing is everything in action photography, especially with subjects as quick and unpredictable as dogs. So how can you get that perfect mid-air leap or playful sprint?</p><p> Start by observing the dog&#39;s movements. Dogs, like many animals, have a natural rhythm when they move. Take the time to notice this pattern before you start clicking away.</p><p> Adopt a technique often used by equestrians: counting strides. When a horse rider is learning to jump, they count the horse&#39;s strides to anticipate the perfect moment for a jump. Apply this method to dog action photography.</p><p> Each time the dog&#39;s front legs leave the ground, count it out. One, two, three, and so on. This rhythm helps you anticipate when the dog will be in the ideal position for a fantastic shot.</p><p> This counting method might be easier with larger breeds that have a longer stride, but don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re photographing a small dog. Practice will help you adapt this technique to any dog size or speed.</p><p> Ultimately, your timing will improve with experience. The more you practice, the better you&#39;ll get at capturing that decisive moment. And remember, digital film is free—so don&#39;t hesitate to take many shots and refine your timing as you go. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ArticleImage7.jpg?ssl=1" alt="ArticleImage7" title="ArticleImage7.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-photograph-dogs-in-action-final-words"> How to photograph dogs in action: final words</h2><p> And there you have it—the nuts and bolts of capturing dogs in exhilarating action. The journey from being an admirer of those energetic dog photos to becoming the photographer behind them is fulfilling, to say the least.</p><p> The safety of your furry subject is paramount, so always choose a secure location and be aware of the dog&#39;s comfort level. Each dog is unique, and getting to know them can inform your approach and result in more authentic photos.</p><p> Your gear and settings are crucial, but remember, they are just tools. It&#39;s your understanding of the dog, your timing, and your technique that will set your images apart. Your role is that of both a photographer and an animal lover. Never lose sight of the latter.</p><p> Be prepared to adapt. Dogs, like any other models, have their own personalities and quirks. Sometimes the unplanned shots are the ones that capture the essence of their spirit in the most beautiful way.</p><p> As you practice and develop your skills, you&#39;ll find that you&#39;re not just taking photos; you&#39;re creating memories. Whether it&#39;s for a client or your own family album, these images will be treasured for years to come.</p><p> Thank you for joining me in this exciting realm of photography.

I love photo walks, I think they&#39;re a great idea for a host of reasons: they challenge you to use your photographic skills in a new way, they help you meet people with similar interests, and they&#39;re a ton of fun.</p><p> The great thing about enjoying a photo walk is that it doesn&#39;t have to be a formal, structured occasion. You can be by yourself or with a group of friends. You can wander familiar streets, or you can explore an area that is brand new. The whole point is to get you out there, explore your surroundings, exercise your creativity, and take some pictures.</p><p> Below, I delve into the photo walk – what it is, how it works, and how you can find (or create) one near you. So whether you&#39;re planning to attend an upcoming photo walk and you&#39;re looking for some tips to make the most out of it, or you want to better understand how you can start participating, this is an article you don&#39;t want to miss.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-is-a-photo-walk"> What is a photo walk?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256972" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:70.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1061" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo-walk-photography-17.jpg?resize=1500%2C1061&#038;ssl=1" alt="Photo walk photography" class="wp-image-256972" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo-walk-photography-17.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo-walk-photography-17.jpg?resize=300%2C212&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo-walk-photography-17.jpg?resize=600%2C424&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo-walk-photography-17.jpg?resize=768%2C543&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo-walk-photography-17.jpg?resize=717%2C507&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Simply put, a photo walk is an organized outing where a group of photography enthusiasts journeys through a specific area to take pictures. But it&#39;s more than a casual stroll with a camera. These walks are an adventure in observation, a chance to see the world in a new light—quite literally.</p><p> Photo walks have become a staple activity for many photography clubs and individual photographers alike. These are communal events, attracting lens-lovers from various corners of a city or even from different cities altogether. And the settings are as diverse as the photographers themselves. While urban areas often serve as popular backdrops, given the wealth of architectural and human subjects, photo walks aren&#39;t confined to city limits.</p><p> You can just as easily find photo walks meandering through parks filled with the colors of changing seasons or the soft, dappled light of a late afternoon. Residential areas, with their unique blend of personal and public spaces, can offer a different yet equally enriching canvas. Whether it&#39;s the pulse of a bustling market or the serenity of a secluded nature trail, each setting offers its own set of challenges and rewards. The locale dictates the mood, and the possibilities are endless. So, whether you&#39;re a city slicker who thrives on street photography or a nature lover aiming to catch a bird in flight, there&#39;s a photo walk out there for you. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-find-a-photo-walk-near-you"> How to find a photo walk near you</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256973" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="998" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo-walk-photography-5.jpg?resize=1500%2C998&#038;ssl=1" alt="Photo walk photography" class="wp-image-256973" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo-walk-photography-5.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo-walk-photography-5.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo-walk-photography-5.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo-walk-photography-5.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo-walk-photography-5.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo-walk-photography-5.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> So you&#39;re intrigued and ready to dive into the photo walk experience.伟大的！ But where do you start? Locating a photo walk in your vicinity is often easier than you might think. A fantastic place to begin your search is Meetup.com. This platform caters to all sorts of interests, including photography. Search for photography groups in your area and check their events calendar. Even if they don&#39;t advertise a specific photo walk, you can always reach out to the group&#39;s leaders. A quick message can unveil hidden opportunities.</p><p> Another method to find a nearby photo walk is a good old Google search. Try keywords like “camera clubs near me” or “local photography groups.” Once you identify a few, a short email to inquire about photo walks can go a long way. Don&#39;t hesitate to take this step; photography communities are generally friendly and open to newcomers.</p><p> And what if your search comes up empty? Well, that might be a sign for you to take the reins and start your own photo walk. All you need is a couple of interested photographers to get the ball rolling. Use social media or photography forums to connect with local photographers. You&#39;d be surprised how many people are interested in something like this but just need someone to take the first step. Over time, your small get-together can evolve into a larger, thriving community of avid photographers. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="tips-for-the-best-photo-walk-experience"> 10 tips for the best photo walk experience</h2><p> If you&#39;re embarking on a photo walk for the first time, it&#39;s worth taking some time to prepare.

Opt for pants with roomy pockets and leave the big camera bag at home. Your extra batteries? Tuck them into a pocket.</p><p> Some photographers even ditch lens caps and filters to trim down further. A cross-body strap for your camera can be a real game-changer, giving you the freedom to use your hands when you need to.

Photo walks often last longer than a standard photoshoot session with a client – but the pressure isn&#39;t as high, and you won&#39;t be photographing the whole time, so keep your equipment simple.</p><p> One or two spare batteries should suffice if your camera&#39;s battery is fully charged. A couple of memory cards should be more than enough to capture the day&#39;s inspirations. Toss a lens cleaning cloth in your pocket, and you&#39;re good to go. Remember, the idea is to focus on your surroundings, not fuss over gear. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="be-confident-enough-to-bring-only-one-lens"> 4.

Bracket your shots. This technique minimizes the need for heavy post-processing. The closer you get it in-camera, the less time you&#39;ll spend in front of your computer later.</p><p> Sure, this method uses more memory, so just bring extra cards. If you&#39;re sure of your skills, consider shooting in high-quality JPEG. It saves space and eliminates the need for RAW conversion, depending on how much post-editing flexibility you&#39;re after. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="walk-a-lot-and-sit-a-lot"> 7.

In fact, just voicing and acknowledging what is in your head is the first step toward achieving success!</p><p> So think about what you want to do photographically, and draw up a list. If you&#39;re just starting out, limit yourself to a couple of reasonable goals (though if you&#39;re a more experienced photographer, feel free to push yourself here – really think about what you want to achieve and the kind of photos you&#39;d like to take over the next year or two).</p><p> Maybe you want to get comfortable shooting in <a aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> , or perhaps you want to understand how to successfully use <a aria-label="off-camera flash (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/a-beginners-guide-to-working-with-flash-off-camera/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">off-camera flash</a> . Maybe you want to get better at <a aria-label="composition (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/composition-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">composition</a> , or perhaps you want to track moving subjects effectively.</p><p> But don&#39;t just make a list and call it a day; also spend some time determining <em>how</em> you&#39;ll achieve your goals. Will you read dPS articles? Check out books on photography from the library? Take several workshops? Watch some online courses? Spend an hour each day practicing with your camera?</p><p> No matter the goal, it&#39;s easier to achieve when you have an actionable plan to help you get there. And if you want to boost your chances of following through, take this a step further by actually writing down the steps needed to achieve the results you&#39;re after! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="look-at-work-from-your-favorite-photographers"> 2.

It&#39;s about allowing yourself to learn from the works that resonate with you. So when a particular image grabs you, take a moment and ask yourself: What is it about the photograph that&#39;s so appealing?

Think again! Diving into the history of photography is actually wildly exciting. From the earliest daguerreotypes to the advent of digital photography, each era came with a novel way of capturing the world, and understanding this evolution can spark your imagination and give you a fresh perspective on what&#39;s possible and what photography is all about.</p><p> You might discover, for instance, that techniques or styles you consider groundbreaking today were actually pioneered decades ago. Ever heard of “Pictorialism”? This early 20th-century movement focused on elevating photography to an art form by playing with soft focus and painterly lighting – techniques that are making a comeback in some modern styles.</p><p> Even more fascinating is how technological constraints shaped artistic expression. Back in the days of film, photographers had to be incredibly thoughtful about each shot, as film was costly and limited. This “limitation” led to some of the most iconic images we know today. Imagine bringing that level of consideration into your work now.</p><p> And what about the social and cultural impact? Photography has been a crucial tool for documentation, activism, and storytelling. Recognizing this wider context can deepen your understanding of why you shoot and what you aim to convey, influencing your work in powerful ways. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="work-on-personal-projects"> 4. Work on personal projects</h2><p> While it&#39;s great to be busy and earn a living doing what you love, it can also start to drain your creative spirit. So if you&#39;re a professional shooter, don&#39;t just work on your money-making projects; give yourself permission to take on a passion project (ie, a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/12-creative-photography-project-ideas-motivated/" target="_blank" aria-label="personal project (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">personal project</a> ) or two. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-121308 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-121308" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Memorable-Jaunts-black-and-white-photo-of-lilacs-3.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Find photography inspiration" class="wp-image-121308" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Memorable-Jaunts-black-and-white-photo-of-lilacs-3.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Memorable-Jaunts-black-and-white-photo-of-lilacs-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Memorable-Jaunts-black-and-white-photo-of-lilacs-3.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Memorable-Jaunts-black-and-white-photo-of-lilacs-3.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Memorable-Jaunts-black-and-white-photo-of-lilacs-3.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> I captured this image as part of a personal exercise that focused on finding monochromatic patterns and frames.</figcaption></figure></div><p> See this project as a way for you to fall back in love with photography without any pressure or expectations.

These timeless compilations showcase the work of masters whose contributions have stood the test of time. Names like Walker Evans, Edward Weston, Paul Strand, and Minor White might not mean much to you now, but crack open one of their books, and you&#39;re in for an enlightening experience.</p><p> What sets these classics apart? It&#39;s not just the age of the photographs; it&#39;s the enduring relevance of their compositions, techniques, and subjects. Studying these works offers you a chance to break out of the current trends and standards, challenging you to think differently about your own shots.</p><p> For instance, have you ever noticed how modern photography often leans heavily on vivid colors? Some of the greats, like Ansel Adams, worked primarily in black and white. Exploring their grayscale worlds can open your eyes to the nuances of light and shadow, giving you a whole new toolkit for your own work.</p><p> And don&#39;t just skim through these books. Really <em>look</em> at each photograph. Think about the choices the photographer made. How did they use light? What&#39;s in focus, and why? This deeper engagement can be a source of invaluable inspiration.</p><p> So next time you&#39;re in a creative rut, take a detour to your local bookstore or library and head to the photography section. You&#39;ll find a world of inspiration that predates hashtags and filters! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="go-shoot-without-an-agenda"> 6.

But hear me out, because this unassuming piece of equipment can be a great way to revitalize your creative energy.</p><p> You see, when you use a tripod, you&#39;re forced to slow down and pay attention to details that you might otherwise overlook in the quest for that next stunning shot. Setting up a tripod is slow, deliberate work – which means you have the time to adjust every parameter carefully, to think about the best focal length, to fine-tune your composition. In a way, working with a tripod gives you the chance to reconnect with the very act of photographing.</p><p> Even if you like to do fast-paced photography – on the streets or of wildlife, for instance – a tripod can help direct your focus. You&#39;ll pay more attention to timing, to the movement of your subjects, to the changing light conditions.</p><p> One note, however: Make sure you use a tripod that fits your needs. If you&#39;re into travel photography, you might go for something lightweight yet sturdy. If you shoot in rugged conditions, you&#39;ll want a tripod that can stand its ground. While tripods can be perfect for regaining inspiration, it&#39;s important that you don&#39;t needlessly restrict yourself by picking the wrong model. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="do-something-creative-thats-not-photography"> 8.

That&#39;s why I encourage you to try something that&#39;s creative, but that&#39;s <em>not</em> artistic.</p><p> For instance, you might cook a meal from scratch, do some knitting, enjoy gardening in your backyard, write a story, do some journaling, or even just go for a walk outside and study the different leaf patterns you see.</p><p> Of course, there&#39;s nothing wrong with working on an alternative artistic pursuit, such as painting or drawing (and this can be an effective way to gain new inspiration, too). But if you&#39;re feeling burnt out, distancing yourself from all things artistic might be a good idea.</p><p> Whatever you choose, let it flow without structure or planning. Use it as a means to release the creative energy building up inside. Be kind to yourself, and just give yourself some time to take a break from photography; the inspiration will return in time. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-a-different-photography-genre"> 9.

I don&#39;t mean that you should make a permanent change, of course, but a little genre-hopping can do wonders for your creativity. If you&#39;re a die-hard portrait photographer, consider shooting landscapes or architecture for a while. If street photography is your jam, try some macro or cityscapes.</p><p> Switching genres is often like learning a new language. Initially, it feels uncomfortable, but as you get the hang of it, you start to see patterns and gain new insights into how language works. For instance, if you move from portraits to landscapes, you may begin to appreciate the subtleties of natural light in a new way. If you transition from street scenes to macro shots, you may find yourself engrossed in the minute details of the world.</p><p> And here&#39;s the kicker: The skills and insights you pick up in one genre can often be transferred back to your primary area of interest. Those natural lighting techniques might inspire a unique headshot in your next portrait session. Or the way you frame a cityscape could add a new layer to your street photography.</p><p> So don&#39;t confine yourself to a single box. Break free, try something new, and see if you can&#39;t reignite that passion! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="complete-a-self-challenge"> 10.

The idea is to set yourself specific rules, and then use them to direct your shooting. You can always invent your own self-challenge, though here are a few popular ones:</p><ul><li> Take a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/self-portrait-photography-tips/" target="_blank" aria-label="self-portrait (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">self-portrait</a> every day</li><li> Capture a set of photos that convey the essence of each week (for a whole year)</li><li> Photograph a single color for a week</li><li> Photograph your daily meals</li><li> Take one shot a day for a month</li><li> Capture every sunrise and sunset for a month</li></ul><p> Whatever self-challenge you choose, document and work on it. Perhaps even join or start a group online where others can participate with you. (As I discuss below, working with other photographers can motivate you further and help keep the inspiration alive!)</p><p> One tip: If you start a self-challenge and you struggle from the get-go, that might be a sign you should try something else. There&#39;s nothing wrong with pushing yourself, but because challenges are nearly <em>always</em> tough to complete, it&#39;s important that you genuinely like what you&#39;re doing. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="spend-time-photographing-with-others"> 11.

Photo walks and photography meetups are very popular, and they&#39;re a great place to talk with others who are passionate about the same kind of thing! Plus, photo walks and meetups are more than social events; they&#39;re a great place to develop skills and find photographic inspiration. Working side by side with other photographers can offer fresh perspectives that break you out of your creative rut.</p><p> You see, there&#39;s a unique energy that appears when photographers gather. You&#39;ll find people who share your particular genre interests, and you&#39;ll find people who don&#39;t. This medley of viewpoints can be as inspiring as any world-class photo book or historic image.</p><p> And we shouldn&#39;t forget the power of immediate feedback. Imagine taking a shot and then instantly sharing your excitement or doubts with someone who gets it, someone who speaks the nuanced language of apertures, compositions, and light. It&#39;s the kind of conversation that can spark new ideas and help you see the world – and your craft – differently.</p><p> And if big meetups aren&#39;t your thing?不用担心。 Even just having a buddy to shoot with on weekends can offer a regular dose of inspiration. You can bounce ideas off each other, critique each other&#39;s work in real time, and collectively aim for better shots. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="go-on-a-photography-trip"> 12.

So why not venture far afield? A photography trip can breathe new life into your portfolio and, most importantly, your inspiration.</p><p> Suppose you&#39;re a landscape photographer who&#39;s been capturing forests for years. How about heading up north to capture the snowy tundra? The shift from green and brown to stunning whites and icy blues could be the jolt your creativity needs. Or maybe you&#39;re a street photographer, routinely capturing the hustle of New York City. Consider making your way to smaller, quainter coastal towns.</p><p> You don&#39;t have to cross oceans for this (although if you can, go for it!). Even a neighboring town, a nearby state park, or a historic site can make a difference. The key is to explore new environments that challenge you to see the world in a new light.</p><p> Of course, before you go, do some research. Get to know the area, look up potential shoot locations, and plan your days to maximize the time you spend shooting. Once you&#39;re there, the change of scenery will likely trigger new ways to consider compositions, lighting, and subjects.</p><p> When you come back, you&#39;ll likely find that the trip has given you not just photos, but a fresh enthusiasm for photographing locations that are closer to home. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="look-through-your-photo-archives"> 13.

And now that you&#39;re feeling uninspired by your existing work, it might be the perfect time to revisit and possibly complete those incomplete stories.</p><p> Start by taking some time to systematically go through your photos, ideally going back a few years. Don&#39;t rush. Let yourself absorb the work you&#39;ve done and reflect on your growth and changes in style.</p><p> What should you be looking for? Perhaps an old but interesting technique or an unfinished series that could be turned into a portfolio piece. Maybe a type of photography you haven&#39;t done in a while.</p><p> Then, when you find something inspiring, think of ways to take your old ideas to new heights. Maybe modernize them with skills you&#39;ve acquired since then or combine old and new approaches to create something entirely different. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="work-on-your-editing-skills">14.

It makes sense: When you&#39;re burnt out, a break can make a big difference. But you don&#39;t have to drop photography <em>entirely</em> . Instead, you can focus on skills that don&#39;t require a camera, such as editing.</p><p> Editing is far more than a final coat of paint; it&#39;s where your images come alive and take form. And by learning new editing techniques, you may find yourself inspired by all of the photographic possibilities – the way you can combine editing and photography to create breathtaking results.</p><p> Even if you&#39;re well-versed in the basics – cropping, adjusting exposure and color – you might be missing out on some of the most effective professional techniques. Color grading, blending modes, masking, dodging and burning; they&#39;re all advanced approaches and tools that really can revolutionize your portfolio.</p><p> Developing your editing skills might seem difficult, but a plethora of online tutorials can guide you through these processes. YouTube is full of skilled editors sharing their favorite tricks. And you can find courses that go more in-depth, teaching you how to harness the full potential of your editing software.</p><p> So, instead of walking away from photography, channel your energy into mastering post-processing techniques. You may find that by improving your editing skills, you&#39;ll view your past and future work with new enthusiasm. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="take-a-photography-course"> 15.

In the industry, we often affectionately call this lens the “nifty fifty,” and for good reason.</p><p>为什么？ Because 50mm lenses are incredibly versatile. They can capture great photos in tons of situations, and they offer plenty of other amazing benefits, too. I myself use a 50mm lens <em>all the time</em> , and in this article, I share everything you need to know about 50mm photography, including:</p><ul><li> Key 50mm lens features</li><li> What genres of photography are best suited by a 50mm focal length</li><li> My top reasons for doing 50mm photography</li></ul><p>让我们开始吧。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-is-a-mm-lens"> What is a 50mm lens?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256866" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:63.13%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="947" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-203.jpg?resize=1500%2C947&#038;ssl=1" alt="50mm photography and 50mm lenses" class="wp-image-256866" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-203.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-203.jpg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-203.jpg?resize=600%2C379&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-203.jpg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-203.jpg?resize=717%2C453&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> To start, it&#39;s a prime lens, which means it has a fixed focal length. You can&#39;t zoom in or out; what you see is what you get. But trust me, that&#39;s a good thing. It forces you to engage more with your surroundings, making you move to find the perfect shot.</p><p> The 50mm lens is often dubbed the “standard lens” because its perspective closely resembles that of human vision. There&#39;s a natural feel to the images it captures. The view is neither distorted nor overly compressed; it&#39;s just like how you&#39;d see the world with your own eyes.</p><p> It&#39;s been around for decades, and it&#39;s often the first lens people buy after they decide to upgrade from their kit lens.为什么？ Because it&#39;s incredibly accessible. Most 50mm lenses are affordable, especially compared to other prime lenses with similar image quality. This makes it an excellent starting point for amateur photographers and a reliable choice for professionals.</p><p> Now, the 50mm lens isn&#39;t just for newbies. Even seasoned photographers swear by it. They&#39;ll often have at least one 50mm lens in their kit because of its unmatched combination of quality, portability, and versatility. Whether you&#39;re a beginner or an expert, the 50mm lens can be your go-to for a broad range of photography styles and scenarios. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="reasons-to-do-mm-photography"> Reasons to do 50mm photography</h2><p> You&#39;ve likely heard photographers sing praises of the 50mm lens.

We&#39;ll delve into how they excel in creating beautiful bokeh, perform admirably in low-light conditions, and offer incredible versatility. Each of these aspects makes the 50mm a lens you won&#39;t regret adding to your camera bag. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="mm-lenses-are-shockingly-cheap-yet-the-quality-is-great"> 1. 50mm lenses are shockingly cheap (yet the quality is great!)</h3><p> Most lenses – especially the latest mirrorless lenses from Canon, Nikon, and Sony – cost a pretty penny.

But many shooters, especially beginners, don&#39;t really need these lenses; in my experience, they&#39;ll be perfectly happy with an excellent 50mm f/1.8 model. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="mm-lenses-produce-gorgeous-bokeh"> 2. 50mm lenses produce gorgeous bokeh</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256867" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2011.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="50mm photography and 50mm lenses" class="wp-image-256867" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2011.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2011.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2011.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2011.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2011.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2011.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The first thing to catch your eye when shooting with a 50mm lens is often the beautiful, dreamy background blur, known as bokeh. This is not accidental. 50mm lenses are usually designed with wide maximum apertures. Even a budget-friendly 50mm can come with an f/1.8 or an f/2.8 aperture.</p><p> A wide aperture is the key to achieving that professional-looking shallow depth of field. When you&#39;re shooting with your aperture wide open, your subject stays sharp and focused, but the background melts into a soft blur. This adds a certain magic to your photos, making them pop and guiding the viewer&#39;s eye directly to the subject.</p><p> You&#39;ll find that this bokeh effect is especially compelling in portrait and product photography. A softly blurred background elevates a simple portrait into a poignant capture of character. The same goes for product photos. That tube of lipstick or handmade necklace becomes the uncontested star of the show against a gentle haze of colors in the backdrop.</p><p> But bokeh isn&#39;t just for portraits and still life. Imagine a dew-kissed spider web with each droplet crisp and clear, while the garden in the background takes on a painterly quality. Or a bustling street scene where the subject&#39;s face is crystal clear, but the surrounding crowd is an impressionistic blur.

Standard 50mm glass generally offers enough magnification to capture gorgeous flower photos, insect images, still life shots, and more. And you can capture amazing background bokeh by getting up close and widening that aperture to f/1.4 or f/1.8!</p><p> Pro tip: If you <em>do</em> decide to shoot at f/1.4 or f/1.8, I&#39;d recommend <a aria-label="focusing manually (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dont-afraid-manual-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">focusing manually</a> .

No – but as long as you have some sort of nearby illumination, such as a street light, you&#39;ll generally be fine! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="mm-lenses-are-highly-portable"> 5. 50mm lenses are highly portable</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256871" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:62.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="938" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2015.jpg?resize=1500%2C938&#038;ssl=1" alt="50mm photography and 50mm lenses" class="wp-image-256871" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2015.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2015.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2015.jpg?resize=600%2C375&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2015.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2015.jpg?resize=717%2C448&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Here&#39;s yet another reason why I love 50mm lenses: They&#39;re incredibly small <em>and</em> they&#39;re lightweight, so you can take one pretty much anywhere without issue.</p><p> For instance, you can pack a 50mm lens away in a small camera bag and still have plenty of room for cameras, accessories, and other lenses. You can also mount a 50mm lens on your camera, then carry it around as you head out with your kids, go on a street photography walk, and more.</p><p> Plenty of travel photographers keep a 50mm lens as their primary glass, and many street photographers use a 50mm lens almost exclusively (including famous street shooters like Henri Cartier-Bresson!).</p><p> You can also shoot in certain public areas (such as sports stadiums) with a 50mm lens – whereas a long zoom lens may get you denied entry. And if you like to go for long walks or hikes, a 50mm lens won&#39;t start to feel like a brick after a few hours.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256876" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2014.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="50mm photography and 50mm lenses" class="wp-image-256876" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2014.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2014.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2014.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2014.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2014.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2014.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Bottom line: The 50mm lens is the most inconspicuous, travel-ready lens you can buy. If you want a lens for walkaround photography, if you plan to travel frequently, or you simply like the idea of keeping a barely noticeable lens on your camera, then it&#39;s a great pick! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="mm-lenses-are-extraordinarily-versatile"> 6. 50mm lenses are extraordinarily versatile</h3><p> If you haven&#39;t picked up on it yet, 50mm lenses are the Swiss Army knives of the photography world. They&#39;re incredibly adaptable, fitting perfectly into a multitude of shooting situations. Portraits are the first genre that usually comes to mind, and rightly so.</p><p> A 50mm lens excels at capturing stunning headshots with a beautifully blurred background. But don&#39;t stop there. You can also pull back for an environmental portrait that includes a subject in their natural habitat, whether it&#39;s a bustling kitchen or a serene meadow.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256872" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2012.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="50mm photography and 50mm lenses" class="wp-image-256872" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2012.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2012.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2012.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2012.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2012.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2012.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Street photography is another arena where the 50mm lens shines. The natural field of view and quick focus allow you to capture candid moments as they unfold. With the lens&#39;s unobtrusive size, you can blend into the crowd, capturing life as it happens without drawing attention to yourself.</p><p> Lastly, let&#39;s not forget nature and landscape photography. While wide-angle lenses are often the go-to for capturing sweeping vistas, a 50mm lens allows you to focus on the details. Think close-ups of flowers, textured bark, or the intricate patterns of a leaf.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256877" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-204.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="50mm photography and 50mm lenses" class="wp-image-256877" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-204.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-204.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-204.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-204.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-204.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-204.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The adaptability doesn&#39;t stop there.

Good news: its versatility will blow you away.</p><p> Firstly, let&#39;s talk about portrait photography. The 50mm lens is a favorite among portrait photographers for good reason. The focal length is incredibly flattering. It doesn&#39;t distort facial features, and the wide aperture options help you isolate your subject from the background. It works great for both close-up shots of the face and environmental portraits. Environmental portraits capture the subject within a context, offering a more rounded depiction of their personality or lifestyle.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256873" style="width:397px"><span class="space" style="width:397px; padding-top:151.13%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="397" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2010.jpg?resize=397%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="50mm photography and 50mm lenses" class="wp-image-256873" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2010.jpg?resize=397%2C600&amp;ssl=1 397w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2010.jpg?resize=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1 199w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2010.jpg?resize=768%2C1160&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2010.jpg?resize=717%2C1083&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-2010.jpg?w=993&amp;ssl=1 993w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Street photography?绝对地。 With a 50mm lens, you can capture the world as your eyes see it. This is wonderful for capturing candid moments. People look natural, not distorted. Street scenes feel alive and dynamic. Plus, its compact size won&#39;t draw attention, allowing you to capture life as it happens.</p><p> But wait, can you use it for landscapes? Definitely. While it won&#39;t provide the sweeping vistas that wide-angle lenses can offer, it allows for a unique approach to landscape photography. It lets you focus on smaller, intimate aspects of nature: think a single mountain peak, a close-up of leaves, or a specific bend in a river. It&#39;s about capturing the soul of a place, not just its face.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256874" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-207.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="50mm photography and 50mm lenses" class="wp-image-256874" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-207.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-207.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-207.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-207.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-207.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/50mm-photography-207.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Event photography?查看。 You&#39;ll find the 50mm lens to be your trusted companion, whether you&#39;re covering a wedding, a birthday, or a corporate function.

Now, it&#39;s time to choose the right one for you. Believe me, you&#39;ve got options.</p><p> First off, let&#39;s consider the beginner-friendly 50mm f/1.8. I can&#39;t recommend this lens enough for those starting out. It&#39;s incredibly affordable but doesn&#39;t skimp on image quality. The wide f/1.8 aperture will let you practice creating dreamy bokeh and excel in low-light situations. It&#39;s an ideal starting point and offers a good taste of what 50mm lenses can deliver.</p><p> If you&#39;re ready to invest a little more, the 50mm f/1.4 or f/1.2 could be your next move. These lenses have even wider apertures, which means you can create an even more isolated depth of field. Simply put, if you&#39;re diving into portrait or wedding photography, these lenses are solid gold. But keep in mind, they come with a higher price tag and can be a bit bulkier.</p><p> Don&#39;t disregard the used market either. Often, you can find excellent 50mm lenses that are gently used and still in fantastic condition. They&#39;ll deliver the same quality shots but at a fraction of the price. It&#39;s worth a look.</p><p> Last but not least, consider third-party lenses. Brands like Sigma and Tamron offer 50mm options that compete with the big names. While you might trade off some features, you often gain in terms of price. It&#39;s a trade-off that might just be worth it if you&#39;re budget-conscious.</p><p> Here are a few of our favorites:</p><ul><li> The <a href="https://geni.us/dPSCanon50mmf1-8lens" target="_blank" aria-label="insanely cheap Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">insanely cheap Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM</a></li><li> The <a href="https://geni.us/Nikon50mmf1-8" target="_blank" aria-label="high-quality Nikon AF-S 50mm f/1.8G (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">high-quality Nikon AF-S 50mm f/1.8G</a></li><li> The <a href="https://geni.us/Sony50mmf1-8dPS" target="_blank" aria-label="impressively sharp Sony FE 50mm f/1.8 (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">impressively sharp Sony FE 50mm f/1.8</a></li><li> The <a href="https://geni.us/dPSSigma50mmF1-4lens" target="_blank" aria-label="gorgeous (but pricier) Sigma ART 50mm f/1.4 (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">gorgeous (but pricier) Sigma ART 50mm f/1.4</a> </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="mm-photography-final-words"> 50mm photography: final words</h2><p> By now, I hope you&#39;re as enchanted by the 50mm lens as I am.</p><p> It&#39;s the kind of lens that adapts to you, rather than forcing you to adapt to it.

Artists have developed a handful of rules (guidelines, really) that allow you to create balance, flow, impact, and beauty without tons of practice.</p><p> In this article, I share my favorite 13 photography composition rules – all tried and tested methods for improving your image arrangements. So read through the article. Memorize the rules. And then watch as your photos are transformed!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-rule-of-thirds"> 1. The rule of thirds</h2><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/" target="_blank" aria-label="The rule of thirds (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">The rule of thirds</a> is the most famous compositional rule there is, and for good reason: It really is a great way to produce balanced, dynamic compositions, and it&#39;s pretty easy to master. But how does it work?</p><p> The rule of thirds states that you should place your key compositional elements a third of the way into the frame. It even comes with a handy set of gridlines to help you out:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-243497" style="width:250px"><span class="space" style="width:250px; padding-top:74%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="250" height="185" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-100.jpg?resize=250%2C185&#038;ssl=1" alt="Composition rules in photography" class="wp-image-243497" data-recalc-dims="1"/></span></figure></div><p> So if you&#39;re photographing a beach sunset scene, instead of putting the horizon line smack-dab in the middle of the frame, you&#39;d want to place it along the upper third or lower third gridline.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-243499" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-12.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="Composition rules in photography" class="wp-image-243499" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-12.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-12.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-12.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-12.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-12.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> And if you&#39;re photographing a cluster of trees in a field, instead of putting the trees in the center of the shot, you&#39;d want to position them a third of the way from the right or left edge.</p><p> By the way, if you can position your main subject at the intersection of two gridlines (ie, a third of the way from <em>two</em> image edges), you&#39;ll get an even more powerful result.</p><p> In general, rule-of-thirds compositions feel balanced. But they feel dynamic, not static, which helps the viewer better engage with the shot. Nice, right?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="symmetry"> 2. Symmetry</h2><p> <a aria-label="Symmetry (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-break-the-rules-with-a-central-composition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Symmetry</a> refers to areas of reflection across the frame. It&#39;s a great way to produce powerful, in-your-face images, the kind that feature lots of tension – though you do need to be careful not to create photos that are a bit too static (see my discussion of the rule of thirds above!).</p><p> You can create vertical symmetry by including subjects that reflect across the horizontal axis, you can create horizontal symmetry by including subjects that reflect across the vertical axis, and you can create diagonal symmetry by including subjects that reflect across a diagonal. Any of these options can work, though each effect will give you a different result, so I encourage you to experiment and see what you think.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-243503" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-10.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Composition rules in photography" class="wp-image-243503" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-10.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-10.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-10.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-10.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-10.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-10.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The toughest part about using symmetry is actually <em>finding</em> symmetrical subjects. Bear in mind, however, that you can still create a symmetrical effect by featuring roughly – but not perfectly – symmetrical elements.</p><p> Trees, for instance, are roughly symmetrical subjects, so you might position one in the center of the frame so it divides the composition in two.</p><p> Pro tip: For the most compelling results, aim to fill the frame with your symmetrical elements. Physically get in close, or use a telephoto lens to really punch in.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-243501" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-11.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Composition rules in photography" class="wp-image-243501" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-11.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-11.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-11.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-11.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-11.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-11.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="layering"> 3. Layering</h2><p> A photograph isn&#39;t just a flat image; it can have depth, texture, and layers that guide the viewer&#39;s eye.

These aren&#39;t just arbitrary divisions; they&#39;re strategic zones where you can place different elements to create depth.</p><p> Take, for example, a beach scene. The foreground could be filled with shells and pebbles. Your midground? Maybe some frothy waves or children playing.

More layers can add complexity and richness to your image. Sometimes you&#39;ll find multiple layers even within a single “zone,” like several rows of trees in what you&#39;d typically call the “background.”</p><p> What if all your layers are far away?没问题！ Even distant layers can add to the composition. A skyline behind a row of trees and a mountain range? That&#39;s a multi-layered photo that draws the eye and keeps a viewer engaged.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-rule-of-odds"> 4.

The brain groups in pairs, so while an even number of items is easily groupable, an odd number of items will always leave out the final element – causing the viewer to become further engaged.</p><p> The rule of odds is most commonly used by still life, food, and product photographers.

Foreground interest</h2><p> Have you ever looked at a landscape photo and felt like you could walk right into it? That&#39;s likely due to a technique called foreground interest. In essence, it involves placing an object—be it a rock, a flower, or even a stream—close to the camera, in the foreground of your shot. This subject grabs your attention before your eyes wander to the background. It&#39;s like the visual equivalent of an opening act that warms up the audience for the main event.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256748" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-59.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="Composition rules in photography" class="wp-image-256748" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-59.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-59.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-59.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-59.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-59.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> One thing to note is the importance of lens choice. A wide-angle lens is your best friend here. It allows you to capture both the foreground element and the background in one frame. That way, you can create a sense of depth and three-dimensionality that&#39;s truly immersive.</p><p> Aperture settings also play a huge role. If you want everything from the foreground to the background to be in focus, you&#39;ll need a narrow aperture. Think f/16 or smaller. However, be prepared to focus carefully; a slight misstep and either your foreground or your background could turn out blurry. This is where practice comes in, so don&#39;t shy away from experimenting.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256749" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-60.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Composition rules in photography" class="wp-image-256749" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-60.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-60.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-60.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-60.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-60.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-60.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Now, this technique is often seen in landscape photography.

The photographer arranges the scene with a subject in the background (such as a mountain, a tree, or a sunset), then finds some sort of foreground line that guides the viewer&#39;s gaze. The resulting image boasts lots of depth and plenty of foreground-to-background flow, plus the background subject gets some much-needed emphasis.</p><p> Common leading lines include:</p><ul><li> Roads</li><li> Fallen logs</li><li> Rivers</li><li> Lines in the sand</li><li> Cracks in ice</li><li> Jagged rocks</li></ul><p> That said, leading lines can also be used in portrait photography, street photography, architectural photography, and much more. An outstretched arm can lead the eye through a street scene toward an interaction between subjects, while a subtly bent hand can lead the viewer to the face of a portrait subject.</p><p> When you&#39;re just getting started with leading lines, you may struggle to find them, but don&#39;t give up. Train your mind to look for relevant lines, and pretty soon, you&#39;ll be seeing them <em>everywhere</em> .</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-243519" style="width:480px"><span class="space" style="width:480px; padding-top:125%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="480" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-4.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Composition rules in photography" class="wp-image-243519" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-4.jpg?resize=480%2C600&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-4.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-4.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-4.jpg?resize=717%2C896&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-4.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-odd-one-out"> 9.

Triangles</h2><p> Moving on, let&#39;s explore the concept of triangles in composition. This shape serves as an powerful framework to organize your photo&#39;s elements.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256751" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75.07%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1126" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-53.jpg?resize=1500%2C1126&#038;ssl=1" alt="Composition rules in photography" class="wp-image-256751" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-53.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-53.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-53.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-53.jpg?resize=768%2C577&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-53.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Why triangles, you ask? They create a sense of balance and stability. Plus, they add a touch of dynamism to your shots. That&#39;s because the three corners and the connecting lines guide the viewer&#39;s eye in a perpetual loop. Your gaze travels from one element to the other without coming to a complete stop.</p><p> Finding triangles might seem tricky at first, but it becomes easier over time. And it&#39;s not just about obvious triangles like those in architectural features. Even in a cluttered market scene or a busy street, groups of people can form triangles. Adjust your angle, and suddenly you&#39;ve framed a dynamic, well-balanced shot.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256752" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-52.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Composition rules in photography" class="wp-image-256752" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-52.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-52.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-52.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-52.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-52.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-52.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Say you&#39;re at a park and you see a bench, a tree, and a lamp post. Arrange yourself so these three elements form a triangle within your frame.</p><p> This technique is all about recognizing patterns and then positioning yourself to capitalize on them. The next time you&#39;re framing a shot, look for that hidden triangle. Whether it&#39;s formed by people, buildings, or natural elements, it will add a layer of complexity to your composition without confusing the viewer.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-golden-ratio"> 12. The golden ratio</h2><p> The golden ratio is 1.618, a number that constantly crops up in nature <em>and</em> tends to look very pleasing when incorporated into compositions.</p><p> What do I mean by this? Well, it&#39;s possible to create a grid that is spaced out using<em> </em>the golden ratio. It works just like the rule of thirds – the goal is to position key elements along the gridlines – though it&#39;s slightly more compressed in the center.</p><p> You can also use the golden ratio to produce a golden spiral overlay, which looks like the whorl of a nautilus shell. Then, by aligning key compositional elements with the spiral, you can capture unusually dynamic photos.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-243525" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-15.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="Composition rules in photography" class="wp-image-243525" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-15.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-15.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-15.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-15.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-15.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Most photographers find the golden ratio grid far easier to use, but if you want to really take your compositions to the next level, memorize the golden spiral, then look for compositions that seem to fit. (Note: It&#39;s tough to find an arrangement of elements that perfectly mirrors the golden spiral. Instead, search for elements that roughly follow the spiral; you&#39;ll still get a powerful effect, but with a little less frustration!)</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-243527" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="Composition rules in photography" class="wp-image-243527" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-1.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-1.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/photography-composition-rules-1.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="frame-within-a-frame"> 13.

Picture this: you have a beautiful building you want to capture. Now imagine fitting that building within an archway or a window frame. What you&#39;ve done is created a “frame” for your main subject.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256753" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-51.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Composition rules in photography" class="wp-image-256753" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-51.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-51.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-51.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-51.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-51.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/composition-rules-photography-51.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> A doorway can offer an additional layer of context to a historic building, or a tree branch can add a natural touch to a mountain scene. This technique creates depth and draws your viewer&#39;s eye straight to the subject.</p><p> But the challenge lies in spotting these opportunities. You&#39;ll need to train your eye to see not just the subject, but also potential frames within your environment. Walk around your subject; sometimes a great framing element is just a few steps away.</p><p> Once you become aware of this technique, you&#39;ll start seeing frames everywhere. It could be a bridge framing a cityscape, or an overhanging tree framing a trail.

Ansel Adams said it succinctly: “You don&#39;t take a photograph, you make it.”</p><p>有什么不同？ The idea is that you <em>think</em> about what you&#39;re trying to communicate with your photo, then do everything you can to include that, and <em>only</em> that, in your shot. Another way to put it: Snapshots are <em>taken</em> by people who just point and click. Photographs are <em>made</em> by artists who give thought to the image they are creating.</p><p> Ultimately, it doesn&#39;t matter what instrument you use, smartphone or high-end digital camera. What counts is the thought you put into your work. You generally won&#39;t need to make a landscape photograph in a hurry, so slow down and think about what you&#39;re doing.</p><p> If you only take one tip from this article, make sure it&#39;s this one. Your smartphone landscape photography will be far ahead of the rest of the happy snappers who just point and shoot. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="carefully-choose-a-composition"> 2.

On the other hand, <em>don&#39;t</em> use digital zoom. Sure, it might seem easy to “zoom” into a composition with a simple touch of the screen, but you&#39;re actually just cropping the image and losing resolution in the process.</p><p> I&#39;d also discourage clip-on lenses for smartphones. These are always fiddly to work with, and in my experience, they almost never produce quality images.省下你的钱。 If you need a more versatile lens than your smartphone but still want something pocketable, check out some of the great point-and-shoot cameras that have superzooms and good specs. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="grab-a-smartphone-tripod"> 6. Grab a smartphone tripod</h3><p> I shoot from a tripod about 85% of the time. However, I often see other landscape photographers happily working away with no tripod in sight.</p><p> Yes, lens and IBIS (in-body image stabilization) has brought us a long way, and if the light permits, a fast shutter speed might negate the advantage of a tripod. But I&#39;ve got to say it: A tripod does have a place in smartphone landscape photography. When the light is low and your shutter speed gets longer, being able to keep the camera still is the difference between a fuzzy shot and a tack-sharp shot.

Work in HDR</h3><p> HDR mode is a staple in modern smartphones, and it&#39;s especially useful for landscape photography. What HDR does is simple yet effective: it takes multiple photos at varying exposure levels and blends them into a single, well-exposed image.</p><p> In most landscape scenarios, this means capturing the bright sky, the darker terrain, and everything in between without losing detail. You won&#39;t end up with blown-out skies or overly dark shadows. It&#39;s like having your cake and eating it too (photographically speaking).</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-210703" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:57.93%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="869" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Colchester-Bridge.jpg?resize=1500%2C869&#038;ssl=1" alt="waterfall with flowers smartphone landscape photography" class="wp-image-210703" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Colchester-Bridge.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Colchester-Bridge.jpg?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Colchester-Bridge.jpg?resize=600%2C348&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Colchester-Bridge.jpg?resize=768%2C445&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Colchester-Bridge.jpg?resize=717%2C415&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> I&#39;d driven past this location many times and had already visualized the image in my head.

Make sure the mode is activated, then let your smartphone capture several shots for blending. (It&#39;s often so fast you won&#39;t even notice!)</p><p> But what if your phone&#39;s built-in HDR mode isn&#39;t cutting it for you? No worries – you have options. For instance, you can work with a different camera app, or you can manually capture several photos at different exposures, then blend them together using an editing app on your phone.</p><p> The goal is to create a balanced image that includes nice detail (and minimal noise) from corner to corner. In landscape photography, HDR techniques can make an enormous difference!</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="got-a-backup-make-one"> 8. Got a backup? Make one!</h3><p> With standard cameras, we typically have image files stored on a card in the camera. Remove that card, copy the files to the computer, and make a backup – that&#39;s the standard workflow.</p><p> Shooting with a smartphone, however, the images are stored in internal memory and sometimes on a micro SD card in the phone. You can connect your phone to your computer or plug in the micro SD card, but who does that? Most people just let the images stay on their phone. Which is fine, until your phone crashes, the storage is corrupted, or you break or lose your phone.</p><p> Now, what if your images were backed up to the cloud – as soon as you shot them? Not only would you have a backup, you&#39;d have the images in a place where they could be easily shared to social media, emailed, whatever you prefer. There are many apps that will do this, but as an Android user, I look no further than Google Photos. iPhone users can also use Google Photos, but might instead opt for iCloud.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-210732" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:76.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1148" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Traveling-Light-Motorcyle.jpg?resize=1500%2C1148&#038;ssl=1" alt="motorcycle on the road" class="wp-image-210732" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Traveling-Light-Motorcyle.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Traveling-Light-Motorcyle.jpg?resize=300%2C230&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Traveling-Light-Motorcyle.jpg?resize=600%2C459&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Traveling-Light-Motorcyle.jpg?resize=768%2C588&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Traveling-Light-Motorcyle.jpg?resize=717%2C549&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> I don&#39;t like carrying my regular camera on a dirt bike ride, but my smartphone camera?

If you post a GPS-tagged image on social media, viewers can determine exactly where the photo was taken. This has caused an ethical dilemma for landscape photographers. Places that used to be known only to a few are now known widely. Photographers seeing a great photo online often think, “I want to go to that spot, too!” The problem is that beautiful places are being overrun, trampled down, littered, and even vandalized by unscrupulous people. Some places are now closed off because they were “loved to death” by the crowds who discovered them online.</p><p> So as an ethical landscape photographer, you may wish to consider stripping off the GPS data from your images before posting. It may not be necessary for the most well-known spots, as people already know where those are. But if you find a really great waterfall way up a mountain trail, consider keeping it a secret. Not only will you have an exclusive shot, but you&#39;ll prevent hordes of people from descending upon it.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-210708" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:49.2%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="738" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GPS-Location-Google-Maps.jpg?resize=1500%2C738&#038;ssl=1" alt="GPS data for a lighthouse image" class="wp-image-210708" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GPS-Location-Google-Maps.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GPS-Location-Google-Maps.jpg?resize=300%2C148&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GPS-Location-Google-Maps.jpg?resize=600%2C295&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GPS-Location-Google-Maps.jpg?resize=768%2C378&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GPS-Location-Google-Maps.jpg?resize=717%2C353&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Take a look at a GPS-tagged photo with Google Maps or Lightroom, and you can see right where the photo was taken.

Don&#39;t fret; most smartphones have a built-in panorama mode, and it can be incredibly effective when you want to capture wide, sprawling landscapes.</p><p> You&#39;ll generally find the panorama mode in the camera app, sometimes indicated by an icon resembling a mountain range. Once you&#39;ve activate the panorama capability, it&#39;s all about stability. Hold your phone carefully, then tap the shutter button and carefully pan your phone from one side to the other. Usually, your phone will guide you with on-screen directions to ensure you&#39;re maintaining a level image. When you&#39;re done, you&#39;ll have the entire scene captured in a single image.</p><p> Now, if you&#39;re aiming for an even more detailed panorama, you do have another option: rather than relying solely on your phone&#39;s panorama mode, take multiple overlapping photos of the scene manually. (These should be regular photos, <em>not</em> photos shot in panorama mode.)</p><p> Then upload them to an app designed to stitch photos together into a panorama.

I&#39;ll make some photos, consider my vantage point, and then determine if I even want to set up my tripod and bring out my other gear. This has several advantages.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-210700" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:68.2%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1023" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bristlecone-color-and-Mono.jpg?resize=1500%2C1023&#038;ssl=1" alt="bristlecone pines in California smartphone landscape photography" class="wp-image-210700" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bristlecone-color-and-Mono.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bristlecone-color-and-Mono.jpg?resize=300%2C205&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bristlecone-color-and-Mono.jpg?resize=600%2C409&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bristlecone-color-and-Mono.jpg?resize=768%2C524&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bristlecone-color-and-Mono.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Bristlecone-color-and-Mono.jpg?resize=717%2C489&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> These bristlecone pines in the White Mountains of California are the oldest living things on earth (over 5,000 years old!).

On the other hand, if it is a good shot, I will have captured GPS data, plus I&#39;ll have a smartphone image that will be uploaded to the cloud.</p><p> And here&#39;s the kicker: Occasionally, my smartphone shot will be better than what I later shoot with my main camera. There have been times when, with changing light, the first capture is best. Sometimes the smartphone camera will process the image as a JPEG and achieve better results than I get when editing the RAW file from my main camera. There have also been times when I didn&#39;t bother to shoot a DSLR photo – the smartphone shot was all I took – and was later happy I did because it turned out great.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-210711" style="width:1080px"><span class="space" style="width:1080px; padding-top:138.89%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1080" height="1500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lucky-Stop-at-Mono-2.jpg?resize=1080%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="black and white rock formations" class="wp-image-210711" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lucky-Stop-at-Mono-2.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lucky-Stop-at-Mono-2.jpg?resize=216%2C300&amp;ssl=1 216w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lucky-Stop-at-Mono-2.jpg?resize=432%2C600&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lucky-Stop-at-Mono-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1067&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lucky-Stop-at-Mono-2.jpg?resize=717%2C996&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> We left the cameras in the car and hiked down to the shore of Mono Lake to check out the tufa formations.

Your smartphone, however, slides effortlessly into your pocket or bag, making it the ultimate travel companion.</p><p> Imagine climbing a mountain or trekking through a forest. The last thing you want is a heavy camera bag weighing you down. With a smartphone, you can hike more freely and still capture the natural beauty surrounding you. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="pro-computational-abilities">Pro: Computational abilities</h3><p> Your smartphone isn&#39;t just a camera; it&#39;s a mini-computer with advanced software. Features like HDR and depth mapping offer you technical advantages that even some dedicated cameras lack.</p><p> As discussed above, HDR helps balance out shadows and highlights, producing images that closely resemble what your eyes see, and it involves significant file processing. And depth mapping technology allows your phone to create a more realistic background blur. Sure, many landscape photographers prefer to keep the entire shot sharp – but a nice depth of field effect can draw attention to foreground subjects such as flowers or wildlife. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="pro-an-all-in-one-workflow"> Pro: An all-in-one workflow</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256716" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smartphone-landscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="Smartphone landscape photography" class="wp-image-256716" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smartphone-landscape-photography-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smartphone-landscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smartphone-landscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smartphone-landscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smartphone-landscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smartphone-landscape-photography-2.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Another game-changing benefit of smartphones is the all-in-one workflow. You shoot, edit, and share – all without leaving your device.</p><p> Various editing apps let you tweak your landscape shots to perfection right after capturing them, and many of them are well-made <em>and</em> free. Once you&#39;ve edited a batch of shots, you can share them on social media and/or send the files to friends and family, all in a matter of seconds.</p><p> This streamlined workflow not only saves time but also keeps the creative process flowing. You can visualize, execute, and share your artistic vision almost instantaneously. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="con-limited-focal-length"> Con: Limited focal length</h3><p> One drawback to using smartphones for landscape photography? The limited focal length range. While many smartphones come with several lenses, they can&#39;t compete with the extensive lens lineups offered by dedicated camera manufacturers.</p><p> It&#39;s not a huge deal if you always like to capture wide-angle shots, but if you ever want to capture distant details, like the snow-covered peaks of a mountain range, the focal-length limitations start to become evident. And while lots of smartphone cameras offer a digital zoom feature, it almost always leads to a loss of image quality, making the picture appear grainy or pixelated.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="con-smaller-sensors"> Con: Smaller sensors</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256717" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smartphone-landscape-photography-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Smartphone landscape photography" class="wp-image-256717" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smartphone-landscape-photography-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smartphone-landscape-photography-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smartphone-landscape-photography-4.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smartphone-landscape-photography-4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smartphone-landscape-photography-4.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/smartphone-landscape-photography-4.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Sensors in smartphones are getting better, but they&#39;re still pretty disappointing compared to what you&#39;ll find in a dedicated camera, in large part due to their size. Smartphone imaging sensors are very small – it&#39;s part of what makes smartphones so portable – and a smaller sensor tends to produce images that are noisier, particularly in low-light situations.</p><p> You can get around this by using a tripod and manually setting the ISO to a low value, but it&#39;s certainly an obstracle to be aware of.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="con-softer-lenses"> Con: Softer lenses</h3><p> As you start to develop a landscape portfolio, you may decide to print your images. That&#39;s when another con of smartphone cameras becomes apparent: reduced sharpness in larger prints.</p><p> When you blow up a photo for printing, every little flaw becomes magnified. The optics of smartphone lenses, while impressive, often don&#39;t stand up to close scrutiny in larger formats. Your image may appear sharp on the phone screen – but when printed, you might notice a lack of fine detail that a dedicated camera lens would have captured.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="con-lack-of-control"> Con: Lack of control</h3><p> One thing that seasoned photographers appreciate about DSLRs and mirrorless cameras is the control they offer. From manually adjusting focus to adjusting the aperture settings, these cameras provide more hands-on control over the final image.</p><p> While many smartphones offer “pro” or “manual” modes that provide some level of customization, these options are often not as comprehensive as those on a dedicated camera, so you might find yourself a bit handcuffed when trying to achieve a specific look or feel in challenging shooting conditions. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="so-can-you-really-capture-high-quality-landscape-photos-using-a-smartphone"> So can you really capture high-quality landscape photos using a smartphone?</h2><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-210718" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:56.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="848" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Oregon-Coast.jpg?resize=1500%2C848&#038;ssl=1" alt="smartphone landscape photography of a beach" class="wp-image-210718" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Oregon-Coast.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Oregon-Coast.jpg?resize=300%2C170&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Oregon-Coast.jpg?resize=600%2C339&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Oregon-Coast.jpg?resize=768%2C434&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Oregon-Coast.jpg?resize=717%2C405&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> My current Android smartphone (an <a aria-label="LG V30 - LG-H931 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://geni.us/LGV30dPS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">LG V30 H931</a> ) may not have the best camera, but it&#39;s often the best camera I have with me, and that&#39;s what counts.

Knowing I shoot both phone and dedicated camera images, they sometimes admire an image I&#39;ve made, but then ask, “Did you take that with your real camera?”</p><p> My “real camera?” Why do some think a smartphone camera isn&#39;t real, or that a person that shoots with one isn&#39;t a real photographer?</p><p> I would argue that if you make a nice landscape image, it doesn&#39;t matter what you use to make it. Hopefully, the images throughout this article prove that a smartphone is more than capable of producing great shots – and that with the right approach, smartphone landscape photography can be both beautiful and compelling.</p><p> And when it comes down to it, most modern smartphone cameras have far better specs than DSLRs from a decade ago. Sure, certain factors favor DSLRs, such as the greater control, the ability to use interchangeable lenses, and the larger sensor size.

Hogwash, I say! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="smartphone-landscape-photography-tips-final-words"> Smartphone landscape photography tips: final words</h2><p> I&#39;d never tell you to sell your dedicated camera and shoot only with a smartphone. As a dedicated photography tool, your DSLR or mirrorless camera should generally be capable of making superior images, especially if you&#39;ll be printing large. But smartphone cameras get better with every generation, and it&#39;s evident that the camera in your pocket is more than capable of capturing the grandeur of the natural world.</p><p> Sure, a smartphone won&#39;t replace a professional camera in all aspects.

The focus is almost always on the person&#39;s face, and the image is usually set against a neutral background to eliminate distractions (though as you&#39;ll see, it&#39;s possible to capture lifestyle-type headshots that situate a person in their surroundings).</p><p> The goal of headshot photography is simple yet crucial: to present the individual in a professional and approachable manner. And depending on the context, a headshot can serve multiple purposes. In corporate settings, it&#39;s often the picture people see before a meeting. Actors use headshots to land roles. Even on social media, a quality headshot helps to establish a strong first impression. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="why-is-quality-headshot-photography-so-important"> Why is quality headshot photography so important?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256685" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-10.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="Headshot photography" class="wp-image-256685" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-10.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-10.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-10.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-10.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-10.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-10.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> In today&#39;s digital world, a headshot is practically a necessity – and you can&#39;t just head into your bedroom, pose against the wall, and snap a grainy selfie, either. You need a polished, professional image.</p><p> Whether you&#39;re a freelancer, a small business owner, or a student, your headshot serves as a visual resume. It can make or break opportunities for you. A quality headshot is your foot in the door. It&#39;s the first impression people have of you, and it often comes long before they meet you in person.</p><p> Your headshot is everywhere, from LinkedIn profiles to business cards, from personal websites to corporate directories. This ubiquity makes it more essential than ever to get it right. A poor or even just an average headshot can inadvertently convey a lack of professionalism, ruining a great opportunity before you can say, “Wait!”</p><p> So the better the headshot, the better the impression you make. And the better the impression, the more doors will open for you, both professionally and personally. Investing in a good headshot can bring returns that far exceed the initial cost. This is why mastering the art of headshot photography can be so effective for portrait photographers; it allows them to offer a service that <em>everyone</em> needs. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-best-headshot-photography-gear"> The best headshot photography gear</h2><p> Before you even press the shutter button, your gear plays a huge role in the quality of the headshots you&#39;ll capture. It&#39;s not just about the camera; your lens, lighting, and even your backdrop can impact the final product. Here&#39;s the equipment I recommend you use: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="an-interchangeable-lens-camera"> An interchangeable lens camera </h3><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/headshot-setup.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="Headshot setup" title="headshot setup.jpeg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Start with a camera that offers interchangeable lenses. This will be your primary tool, and it needs to be up to the task.</p><p> Why interchangeable lenses? Because they offer unparalleled flexibility and image quality. You get to choose the best lens for the specific shot you&#39;re taking, which means you&#39;re not compromising on the end result. With fixed-lens cameras, you might find yourself stuck with a suboptimal perspective that doesn&#39;t do your subject justice.</p><p> Plus, interchangeable-lens cameras offer larger sensors, which in turn delivers better image quality. For that reason, purchasing a DSLR or a mirrorless camera is a great starting point (though you don&#39;t need to go wild and spend thousands of dollars; there are some nice entry-level options that are capable of pro-level images.) </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-high-quality-portrait-lens"> A high-quality portrait lens</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256686" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-1013.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Headshot photography" class="wp-image-256686" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-1013.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-1013.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-1013.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-1013.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-1013.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-1013.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Selecting the right lens can make a world of difference in headshot photography, but what lens should you pick? There are a few different options, but if you can only work with one lens, a 50mm prime or an 85mm prime would be my top choice.</p><p> You see, the standard and short-telephoto focal lengths create a perspective close to the natural field of view of the human eye; as a result, they allow you to shoot from a reasonable distance and avoid unflattering distortion. Plus, 50mm and 85mm prime lenses come with wide apertures, allowing you to blur out the background so your subject stands out.</p><p> Now, between the 50mm and the 85mm, it mostly boils down to your shooting environment. If you have a smaller studio or shooting space, a 50mm lens might be more convenient. If you have room to step back and/or want a tighter composition, an 85mm lens is ideal.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="an-off-camera-flash"> An off-camera flash</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256688" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-105.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Headshot photography" class="wp-image-256688" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-105.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-105.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-105.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-105.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-105.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-105.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Most serious headshot photography takes place indoors – either in a studio or at the client&#39;s office – where light can be hard to come by. And even if you&#39;re working in an area with large windows and lots of light, you won&#39;t have much control over its intensity or direction. That&#39;s why I recommend using at least one off-camera flash.</p><p> Off-camera flashes allow you to position your light source at different angles, which allows you to achieve a variety of different effects. For instance, you can angle your flash to create a dramatic effect, a clean effect, and anything in between. This ability to control the direction and intensity of light can make a <em>huge</em> difference.</p><p> And no, I don&#39;t recommend you simply use your camera&#39;s pop-up flash. In addition to gaining plenty of flexibility, by taking your flash off-camera, you avoid the “deer in the headlights” look that on-camera flash often produces, and you can instead produce a more natural, subtle headshot.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-reflector"> A reflector</h3><p> Reflectors don&#39;t produce light; rather, they bounce it. And if you&#39;re only working with a single off-camera flash (or you&#39;re using natural light), a reflector is a great way to easily balance out the lighting on your subject.</p><p> A well-positioned reflector will fill in unwanted shadows, particularly those under the eyes or chin (common issues in headshot photography!). Reflectors are also very lightweight and can fold up for added portability, plus they usually come in various colors like white, silver, or gold, each offering a different quality of light bounce.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-tripod"> A tripod</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256689" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-103.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Headshot photography" class="wp-image-256689" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-103.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-103.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-103.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-103.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-103.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-103.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Whether or not you work with off-camera flashes, don&#39;t underestimate the role of a good tripod in your headshot setup! For one, it frees you up. Once you&#39;ve framed your shot, a tripod allows you to engage with your subject without worrying about losing your framing; you can walk out from behind the camera to talk to them, to show them different poses, etc.</p><p> It&#39;s also essential if you&#39;re photographing several people back-to-back (eg, when doing a quick office photoshoot for all the employees on the floor). You can establish your lighting and composition, lock in your camera, and capture consistent results.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="studio-backdrops"> Studio backdrops</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256690" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-104.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Headshot photography" class="wp-image-256690" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-104.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-104.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-104.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-104.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-104.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-104.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Last but not least, let&#39;s talk about backgrounds. Having a couple of studio backgrounds on hand can be crucial for your headshot sessions.</p><p> Some nice backgrounds allows you to give your subjects options – some people prefer a more natural setting, while others might request a formal backdrop like seamless paper in black or white. Offering such choices elevates your service and makes the session more personalized.</p><p> Additionally, the right background can drastically improve the overall feel of the headshot. It can add depth or simplicity, depending on the look you&#39;re aiming for. At the end of the day, having a variety of backgrounds on hand gives you the flexibility to meet different client expectations and opens up creative possibilities for your work.</p><p> Note: Make sure to invest in a reliable method for hanging these backgrounds as well, and if you&#39;ll be shooting on location, make sure it&#39;s one you can quickly set up and tear down. Whether you use a dedicated background stand or an improvised solution, it should be sturdy enough to hold the backdrop securely.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-light-like-a-pro"> Headshot photography lighting: a primer</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256691" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-108.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Headshot photography" class="wp-image-256691" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-108.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-108.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-108.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-108.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-108.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-108.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-portrait-lighting-patterns-every-photographer-should-know/" target="_blank" aria-label="Lighting (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Lighting</a> is an essential part of professional headshot photography, and you one-hundred percent <em>cannot</em> skimp on your lighting techniques.

Fortunately, once you know the basics, getting a good, consistent look is actually quite easy.</p><p> For business and actors&#39; headshots, I tend to light quite evenly.

You can also try positioning your key light slightly off-center to add a bit of definition to your subject&#39;s features.</p><p> I generally make sure the subject&#39;s body is turned 45 degrees away from the camera, while their face remains pointed toward me. (You may need to guide people to look straight down the lens – and you may be surprised how many people, when left to their own devices, will look off-camera, at the flash, or somewhere random – and it won&#39;t turn out so great!)</p><p> As you can see from the behind-the-scenes shot below, I&#39;ve asked my subject to turn her body 45 degrees from the camera. (She&#39;s still looking straight into the lens, though!) I&#39;ve added a large light in front (slightly to the left), and I&#39;m using a reflector below her face to reduce harsh shadows.

Here are my favorite tips to help you out, including a rundown of the best headshot photography settings:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-have-a-pre-session-consultation"> 1. Have a pre-session consultation</h3><p> There are <em>many</em> different headshot styles – and different models/clients/subjects will need specific stylistic results depending on the headshot purpose. For instance, an artistic, color-graded look might work great for a fashion model but won&#39;t be appreciated by a corporate client.</p><p> So before your session, have a sit-down with your subject. Make sure you know exactly how your headshot photograph will be used. You might even ask, point-blank: “What kind of style would you like?” And be prepared to show plenty of examples that convey their options.</p><p> This consultation can take place on the phone or face-to-face. I don&#39;t recommend communicating in writing, though; talking to your subject will help them relax much more than an email, and you can use the consultation to help them prepare for the session, too (by explaining what to expect and by answering their questions). </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Headshot-on-White-Background_1.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Headshot on White Background " title="Headshot on White Background_1.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Pro tip: If the headshots will be used for corporate materials, use the consultation to find out your subject&#39;s profession. A corporate lawyer may opt for a clean white background look (above), while a more relaxed professional (eg, a yoga instructor) may prefer a colorful, environmental image (below). </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Indoor-Headshot.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Indoor Headshot" title="Indoor Headshot.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> And an actor or writer may desire the more dramatic effect created by a black background: </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Headshot-on-Black-Background_1.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Headshot on Black Background" title="Headshot on Black Background_1.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-help-your-subject-choose-the-right-clothes"> 2. Help your subject choose the right clothes</h3><p> Generally speaking, solid, neutral colors work best for headshots, as you want to avoid anything that distracts from people&#39;s faces. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/What-to-wear-2.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="man with good headshot clothing" title="What to wear 2.jpeg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> If you&#39;re looking to achieve a formal style, make sure everyone remembers to bring their best work clothes. Men often forget their jackets, so for a consistent look, try to have a spare one on hand, even if you need to clip it at the back. And if possible, send out a reminder the day before your scheduled photo shoot. (Oh, and include an ironing reminder, too – there&#39;s nothing more frustrating than a photo ruined by wrinkled clothes!)</p><p> Also, if you&#39;ll have lots of time with a person, get them to bring a few items of clothing. You can do changes throughout the session and provide them with a variety of final images.</p><p> Here are some examples of <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/what-to-wear-for-a-photo-shoot/" target="_blank" aria-label="good clothing choices (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">good clothing choices</a> : </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/What-to-wear.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="women with good headshot clothing" title="What to wear.jpeg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/What-to-wear-3.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="man with good clothing for a headshot" title="What to wear 3.jpeg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Notice how the tops are generally solid in color and relatively plain? That keeps the focus on the subject&#39;s <em>face</em> .</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-create-separation-from-the-background"> 3. Create separation from the background</h3><p> Great headshot photography generally includes separation between the subject and the background. There should be a clear foreground subject (the head!) and a clear (ideally blurred) background.</p><p> The easiest way to achieve this effect is by positioning your subject a handful of feet in front of any background elements, be it trees, grass, a stairwell, a building, or a desk. For <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/create-beautiful-indoor-portraits-without-flash/" target="_blank" aria-label="indoor portraits (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">indoor portraits</a> , don&#39;t let your subject lean against the wall; instead, bring them out so the wall can blur.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256694" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-102.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="Headshot photography" class="wp-image-256694" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-102.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-102.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-102.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-102.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-102.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-102.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Also, if you are using a studio background (or the wall in an office) and you let your subject get too close, you may see shadows on the wall, which makes the images look less professional. Bottom line: get your subject away from the background, no matter how interesting or nondescript it seems.</p><p> You can also enhance the subject-background separation by widening your <a aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> , which will decrease <a aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> to create nice background <a aria-label="bokeh (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">bokeh</a> . Typically, I aim for an aperture of f/4 for environmental and natural light sessions; the aperture is wide enough for background blur but narrow enough to keep the subject&#39;s head sharp. However, you can always experiment with even wider apertures, such as f/2.8 or even f/1.8. You may struggle to shoot your entire subject in focus, but in the right scenario, this can look great.</p><p> (Note: If you&#39;re doing a studio session, with lights and prepared backgrounds, you&#39;ll have more leeway. For such portraits, I often just use an aperture of f/8.)</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shoot-in-manual-mode"> 4.

In my experience, this is the best way to help your subject relax, and relaxation leads to the best images.</p><p> Your chat can be pretty quick, too. It can be a 10-second, confident handshake and a “How are you?” Though if you have time, I&#39;d recommend going a little deeper; people generally feel very nervous about having their photograph taken, and talking about something within their comfort zone (where they live, if they have children or pets, etc.) will really help them become more comfortable.</p><p> If you&#39;re anxious about interacting with people – or you&#39;re just not sure what to say – try coming up with a few lines in advance. Obviously, you don&#39;t have to stick to your script, but a handful of memorized questions can be the difference between an engaging session and a stiff, uncomfortable one.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-ask-for-silly-faces"> 6. Ask for silly faces</h3><p> Here&#39;s one of my favorite tips for taking headshots, and while it&#39;s a little unorthodox, it gets the job done:</p><p> Once your subject sits down and you&#39;re ready to take a test shot or two, ask them to pull a funny face. You can shoot it as a first frame. It&#39;s a great way to break the ice, and very few people will refuse to do it.</p><p> Once your subject has pulled a silly face, everything else is easy! It&#39;s the technique I used for this headshot photo: </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/funny-faces.jpg?ssl=1" alt="person making a funny face" title="funny faces.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Which then led to this professional result: </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Headshot-Photography-London-0997.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Headshot Photography example" title="Headshot Photography London 0997.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Of course, don&#39;t go overboard, and if your subject feels uncomfortable with the idea, don&#39;t push it.

Because JPEGs are compressed, they don&#39;t retain all the data from the moment of capture, which means that you lose color information and tonal information when you hit that shutter button.</p><p> RAW files, on the other hand, are uncompressed. When you shoot in RAW, the files are a lot larger, but this is because they contain lots of extra information discarded by JPEGs. And it&#39;s this extra information that will allow you to recover detail and adjust colors without issue.</p><p> Sure, most of your JPEGs will look pretty good straight out of camera. But what if you accidentally overexpose or underexpose a series of headshots? If you had the RAW file, you would likely manage to recover the lost highlight or shadow detail – but because you&#39;re shooting in JPEG, that information will be lost forever, and your shots will be ruined.</p><p> So whatever you do, shoot in RAW! You&#39;ll need to spend a bit of time post-processing the images when you&#39;re done (see the final tip in this article), but I promise that it&#39;ll be worth the extra effort.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-sit-people-down"> 8.

It&#39;s hard to do, yes – but it&#39;s worth it because your subject will remain comfortable and you&#39;ll stay on track to get professional headshot results.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256699" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-1014.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Headshot photography" class="wp-image-256699" style="width:600px;height:400px" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-1014.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-1014.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-1014.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-1014.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-1014.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/headshot-photography-1014.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> In fact, even if you&#39;re not satisfied with the images you&#39;re getting, continue to praise your subject. When your subject turns their head in a certain direction or when the light falls in a bad way, never express those feelings. Instead, tell them they&#39;ve done a great job – then subtly prompt them to make adjustments to their pose.</p><p> Bottom line: Silence will kill the atmosphere, so no matter what is happening, just keep chatting.

And if you <em>don&#39;t</em> have all the equipment, consider investing, because tethered shooting can be an absolute game-changer.</p><p> Note: Tethered photography involves connecting your camera to your laptop or desktop computer. As soon as you fire off a shot, it&#39;ll appear on your monitor. You can even change your camera settings and hit the shutter button <em>using</em> your computer!</p><p> What makes tethering so effective? For one, when your subject can see a couple of shots on the screen, they&#39;ll quickly get an idea of what needs to be changed. And tethered shooting is great for you, the photographer; you can see whether your lighting looks good, whether your subject is in focus, whether they&#39;re nicely posed, etc., much more easily than on your camera&#39;s LCD preview or in the camera viewfinder. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-forget-to-process-your-photos"> 12.
