href="https://digital-photography-school.com/introduction-to-sports-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="how to photograph sports (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">如何拍摄体育运动</a>有了一个大概的了解。我想我不妨尝试一下；希望我能从父母那里得到一些印刷品销售。</p><p>现在摔跤比赛已经结束，我想分享我学到的东西，包括一些方便的提示和技巧，以帮助<em>您</em>获得自己的一流摔跤照片。无论您是摔跤手的家长，想要拍摄孩子的比赛，还是想为出版物拍摄摔跤，或者您只是喜欢这项运动并想要捕捉当地的比赛，这篇文章应该可以帮助您！</p><p>让我们开始吧！ </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="work-with-a-reasonably-fast-shutter-speed"> 1. 使用（相当）快的快门速度</h2><p>摔跤比赛在高中体育馆举行，4块垫子呈网格状放置。健身房里的灯光很亮，所以我并没有感觉自己是在超困难的弱光环境下拍摄。然而问题是这些摔跤手不会停滞不前。如果我想要清晰的镜头，我知道我必须保持足够高的快门速度，以便在竞争对手扭打时定格他们的动作。</p><p>现在，拍摄<em>任何</em>类型的体育运动的关键是速度。你<em>必须</em>有较快的快门速度才能定格动作。您确实可以选择减慢快门速度，但您必须<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/mastering-panning-to-photograph-moving-subjects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">随拍摄对象平移</a>。这可能会产生一些有趣的镜头（如下图所示，这是我在拍摄一张足球照片时拍摄的），但这并不是一种可靠的技术。 </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/1.jpg?ssl=1" alt="如何拍摄摔跤比赛" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">当您使用慢速快门但平移拍摄对象时会发生什么？你会得到（相对）清晰的主题和模糊的背景。</figcaption></figure></div><p>那么摔跤摄影的最佳快门速度是多少，如何实现呢？我喜欢将快门速度设置为比拍摄焦距的倒数高一级。 （这类似于<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/back-to-basics-what-is-the-reciprocal-rule-in-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="Reciprocal Rule (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">倒数规则</a>，尽管它稍微严格一些，以确保我可以保持移动主体相当清晰。）</p><p>例如，如果您以 200 毫米拍摄，理想的快门速度为 1/250 秒。如果您使用 50 毫米拍摄，理想的快门速度是 1/60 秒。但我已经成功地以 1/50 秒甚至 200 毫米进行拍摄。这完全取决于您使用相机的稳定性、动作的速度有多慢，以及您的相机和/或镜头是否提供图像稳定技术。</p><p>稍后，我将讨论我在拍摄过程中使用的快门速度设置。不过，现在请记住我在分享下一个技巧时上面提到的内容： </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="widen-your-aperture-and-raise-the-iso"> 2.扩大光圈并提高ISO</h2><p>我使用 55-200mm f/4-5.6 镜头进行拍摄，但我知道这样的镜头并不是摔跤摄影的最佳选择。相反，佳能 70-200mm f/2.8L 等镜头将是更好的选择 - f/2.8 最大光圈可以更轻松地实现更快的快门速度。我买不起这样的镜头，所以我就用我现有的镜头来拍摄。</p><p>我将相机设置为光圈优先模式并调至 f/5.6 光圈。我选择该设置是因为更宽的光圈会导致更多的光线照射到传感器上。另外，更宽的光圈提供更浅的景深，有助于模糊背景（里面挤满了人群和教练）。</p><p>然而，即使使用 f/5.6 光圈，我也没有得到遵循我在上一篇技巧中提到的指导原则的快门速度。因此，我将 ISO 从 100 提高到 1600。</p><p> （我个人不喜欢使用高 ISO - 它会在文件中产生令人不快的噪音 - 但我觉得最好宁可在图像中出现一些额外的噪音，而不是一张又一张的模糊图像。另外，在后处理软件中可以相当有效地减少噪声，并且当今的人工智能算法已经变得越来越好。） </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-continuous-focusing-and-burst-mode"> 3.使用连续对焦和连拍模式</h2><p>当我将相机设置为 f/5.6 和 ISO 1600 后，我将其设置为相机的人工智能伺服对焦设置。 （在某些相机上，这是 AF-C，或连续对焦。）</p><p>连续对焦对于任何体育摄影来说都是绝对必要的。通过半按住快门按钮并跟随动作，镜头将自动更新焦点以锁定拍摄对象，即使他们在移动。</p><p>请注意，您还需要特别注意 AF 区域模式。这决定了自动对焦点在画面周围的排列方式。不同的相机型号有不同的自动对焦区域模式，但如果您的相机具有某种跟踪模式 - 特别是如果它提供眼部自动对焦，其中自动对焦点锁定拍摄对象的眼睛 - 这通常值得使用。</p><p>如果您可以将连续自动对焦与精心选择的自动对焦区域模式结合起来，您会发现通常可以让摔跤手在移动时保持敏锐。当然，您会看到大量失焦的图像，但我们的目标并不是完美；最终我们会选择一系列精美的照片来讲述比赛的故事！</p><p>此外，将相机设置为连拍模式也非常有效。您不必在这里过分强调，但如果您的相机每秒可以拍摄 8 个以上的帧，那肯定有助于捕捉其中的一些动作时刻。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="experiment-and-adjust-as-needed"> 4. 根据需要进行试验和调整</h2><p>我很早就到达了比赛现场，我很高兴自己做到了。有些队伍正在热身，所以我趁这个机会自己练习投篮。它让我了解了我需要的设置（见上文！），并帮助我弄清楚了空间是如何安排的。</p><p>第一场比赛开始了，我拍了大约 50 张照片。然后，在时间过去之前，我确保检查结果。很多图像都很模糊——我的相机选择的快门速度范围是 1/5 秒到 1/60 秒。 （如上所述，我使用光圈优先进行拍摄，因此我的相机会根据我的光圈和 ISO 设置自动选择快门速度。）</p><p>基本上，所有的快门速度都太慢，这意味着我的图像很容易因相机抖动而模糊，<em>也容易</em>因移动的摔跤手而模糊。</p><p>由于体育馆周围的光线相对均匀，我决定做出改变：我从光圈优先切换到手动模式，这样我就可以独立调节快门速度、光圈和 ISO。具体来说，我选择了 1/50 秒的快门速度，同时保持光圈为 f/5.6，ISO 为 1600。因为整个体育馆和比赛过程中每场比赛的光线都是一致的，所以我可以舒适地拍摄这样在一天剩下的时间里不会遇到曝光问题。 （这正是我所做的！）</p><p>现在，我选择的设置仍然不完全有效，如下所示： </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/IMG_1544.jpg?ssl=1" alt="如何拍摄摔跤比赛" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">请注意，当一名参赛者试图压住另一名参赛者时，手臂变得模糊。那是因为我的 1/50 秒快门速度偏慢。</figcaption></figure></div><p>然而，1/50 秒的快门速度仍然足以定格大部分动作： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/IMG_2249.jpg?ssl=1" alt="如何拍摄摔跤比赛" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>基本上，我承认 1/50 秒不足以定格最快的动作，但它会给我带来相当数量的可接受的图像。我本可以提高 ISO 来提高快门速度而不至于曝光过度，但我不希望图像中出现更多噪点。</p><p>请注意，许多现代无反光镜相机确实提供出色的传感器，可以在 ISO 1600、3200 甚至 6400 下工作且噪音最小，因此这实际上取决于您的型号！尝试的机会越多越好。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="zoom-in-on-the-action"> 5. 放大动作</h2><p>拍摄体育运动最棘手的部分是捕捉运动员脸部的特写。这是因为动作移动得很快，当你试图近距离拍摄时，很难将所有东西都保持在狭小的视野内。</p><p>此外，特写镜头需要靠近运动员<em>或</em>超长镜头。但我喜欢特写镜头，所以我付出了很大的努力来拍摄一些激烈的、面对面的图像。</p><p>幸运的是，我发现通过摔跤，这些镜头更容易完成。垫子大约为 38 英尺 x 38 英尺，您可以安全地站在垫子边缘，而不必担心打扰竞争对手或自己受伤。</p><p>在这里，我放大到 200 毫米，能够拍摄到两名摔跤手的不错的照片： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/IMG_1856.jpg?ssl=1" alt="如何拍摄摔跤比赛" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shoot-with-both-eyes-open"> 6. 双眼睁开拍摄</h2><p>我最后的摔跤摄影技巧并不像听起来那么难！</p><p>大多数时候我们拍摄时都是一只眼睛闭着，一只眼睛通过取景器看。如果您睁开双眼，当您近距离放大时，您仍然可以通过取景器看到 - 但用另一只眼睛，您可以看到运动员的实际距离有多远。</p><p>这样，如果他们靠近垫子边缘，您就可以闪开！ （请注意，在本次锦标赛中，您可能无法像我一样接近竞争对手，并且您应该在比赛开始<em>前</em>询问自己可以处于什么位置。）</p><p>睁着双眼拍摄还有另一个好处：它可以帮助你预测动作。用一只眼睛，您可以看到构图的镜头，但用另一只眼睛，您可以看到是否有任何东西即将移入或移出镜头！</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="my-final-thoughts">我最后的想法</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-259438" style="width:1500px"><span class="space"

data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>如果我有机会做一些不同的事情，我会拥有更快的镜头。这是既定的。光圈更大的镜头会更有效，这样我就不需要以 1/50 秒和 ISO 1600 进行拍摄。最大光圈为 f/5.6 的镜头还可以，但以 f/2.8 拍摄就麻烦了。更好（特别是当让运动员从背景人群中“脱颖而出”时）。</p><p>拍摄体育赛事可能会很有趣，尤其是当您在比赛地点附近时。如果您像我一样拍摄一整天的比赛，请带上很多很多存储卡（我有五张卡，最终已满）。还要带点零食和水。你会整天<em>都</em>在移动。</p><p>还有一件事：</p><p>您可能想知道，鉴于快门速度较慢，为什么我不使用闪光灯来照亮物体呢？</p><p>但我不喜欢使用闪光灯，尤其是运动时。很多家长在摔跤比赛中都用闪光灯拍照，但作为一名运动员，我不希望看到灯光一直在我脸上闪烁。因此，我建议不要使用闪光灯，尤其是当您在场外时。我通常距离竞争对手只有 15 英尺，全程都在拍照，所以感觉不适合使用闪光灯。</p><p>好吧，希望这对您有所帮助 - 下次您拍摄摔跤比赛时，请记住这些提示。我不能保证你的情况会相同，但我的一些经验无疑是相关的！</p><p> <a rel="nofollow"

（最近，我听到一位摄影师说，你可以对图像进行狂野的编辑——比如奇怪的弯曲模糊——然后你就可以称之为“美术”。我不同意；奇怪的编辑不会一个图像“美术”，他们只是让它变得愚蠢。）</p><p>不管怎样，当我攻读美术学位时，所需要的一部分就是轮流把我们的作品挂在墙上供批评。在这些会议期间，我们讨论了技术、什么有效、什么无效。我们还会讨论工作背后的想法，以及每个项目的发展方向。</p><p>除了这些批评会议之外，我们还与讲师进行了单独的一对一会议，以帮助我们讨论我们的想法以及如何实现它们。我们的想法是确定一个继续我们工作的计划，考虑支持这项工作的途径，并观察其他从事类似工作的艺术家，看看他们如何传达他们的想法。这些会议非常宝贵，因为它们帮助我们弄清楚我们正在做什么以及我们需要走的方向。</p><p>下面，我提供了一系列在创作美术照片之前您通常需要考虑的事项

<em>“人类的天性是将环境塑造成我们喜欢的形状和形式。我们在这些建筑中生活、工作、娱乐、滋养。我们在旨在帮助我们度过人生各个阶段的学习的房间里度过了时光。当建筑物无法再维护时，它们很快就会腐烂。我的工作着眼于腐烂的速度以及它与人类状况的相似程度。当我们不再受到照顾时，我们很容易陷入同样的​​衰退。通过旧的和最近废弃的建筑的照片，我想探索废弃建筑对人类状况的隐喻。”</em></p><p>我刚刚发表了这个简短的声明，但我希望它能让您了解艺术家声明是什么样的（以及听起来应该是什么样的）。如果您进行 Google 搜索，您可以找到许多可以帮助您编写网站的网站。您还可以找到艺术家陈述的示例，以便您可以了解其他艺术家正在做什么以及他们如何创作作品。 </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-87362 size-post-large-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span

- 特别是如果您想通过图像赚钱 - 您需要考虑其他人的品味和需求。您需要考虑其他人是否喜欢特定的图像，并且您需要确定您的摄影在日常观看者眼中是否良好。</p><p>在本文中，我提供了一套指导原则来确定您的照片是否好。通过考虑我在下面分享的问题和技巧，您将能够更好地了解其他人是否会喜欢您的照片。而且您<em>还将</em>能够更好地从更客观、更清晰的角度看待图像，这在您<em>自己</em>评估照片时会很有帮助。 </p><h2

（如果您的图像存在色调或颜色问题，您可以随时尝试在后期处理中进行纠正。但是，有时您无法编辑掉这些技术问题，因此您需要转到另一张照片反而。） </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-142284 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span

data-section id="shoot-often-show-few"> 1.经常拍摄，显示很少</h2><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-196371"

/></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">无论您是一次还是100张照片，都可以尝试将投资组合降低到最好的，只显示这些图像。</figcaption></figure></div><p><br />您可以为投资组合做的最好的事情之一是减少与公众共享的任何给定会话的图像数量。这似乎是违反直觉的，但是通过仅显示您最好的工作，投资组合的质量及其对观众的印象就会增加。</p><p>假设您有一个<a aria-label="portrait session (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tips-preparing-portrait-session/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">肖像会话</a>，通常您会从一组中分享10-15张照片。所有图像都可能很好，但是很可能是其中一个或两个图像要比其余的要好得多。通过分享所有15张照片，您不会<em>增加</em>观众对质量的整体看法；相反，您正在稀释最好的质量。因此，只能分享最好的镜头 - 这就是使他们发光的原因。</p><p>当然，分享较少的图像也意味着您不会在社交媒体和投资组合中发布那么多图像。您如何抵消内容中的这种赤字？拍摄更多！</p><p>现在，这并不意味着您应该拍摄更多同一主题的图像。这意味着您应该一般要拍摄更多。例如，如果您是肖像射手，那么您应该与更多的人进行更多的肖像会议。</p><p>这将为您的投资组合提供更多的品种，并且还可以确保您有很多图像可共享。

If you can learn to accept that the only thing you can control is the process of creating the image, and then learn to love and focus on that process, you will be able to detach from the things you can&#39;t control.</p><p> When the inevitable does happen and you don&#39;t get the response you expected or wanted, you can shrug it off and move on to creating the next image.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="embrace-harsh-feedback"> 11.

Often, the best sort of feedback can also be the harshest, and it can be utterly deflating. Have you ever asked for a critique only to receive a huge list of errors? It can feel soul-crushing, especially to a new photographer. Unfortunately, embracing that sort of feedback remains one of the best ways to improve fast.</p><p> The trick is to learn how to detach from the emotional attachment you have with the image you created.</p><p>你怎么做到这一点？我希望我能说。每个人的答案都不同。 Once you have managed to do it, you&#39;ll find it much easier to take on even the harshest feedback.</p><p> Now, harsh feedback does not always mean good feedback. A critique should never include prescriptive mandates, personal attacks on character or motivation, unsolicited criticism, or abusive comments toward people in the images.</p><p> Also, take statements such as “I would have done such and such” with a grain of salt and judge their relevance on a case-by-case basis. If you come across any feedback like that, feel free to ignore it. The sort of person who behaves in that way does not have you or your photography in their best interests. They are only stroking their ego at your expense. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-force-your-ways-onto-others"> 12.

While landscape photography is generally done with wide-angle glass, if you use a focal length in the 50-200mm range, you can get in tight to focus on the more intimate natural colors and patterns, like trees behind a beautiful pond, or cattails surrounded by falling snow.</p><p> And if you can&#39;t get any good shots at first, persevere.

It&#39;s a photographic technique that allows you to achieve an array of creative effects, ranging from subtle fill lighting to eye-popping swirls and circles. In fact, if you can master light painting, then you can revolutionize your approach to photography in practically any genre – it really is that powerful.</p><p> What&#39;s especially cool about light painting – and what separates it from a lot of other creative techniques – is that it&#39;s extremely accessible. All you need is a camera, some basic accessories, and a space to spread out and have fun.</p><p> In this article, I&#39;m going to tackle the ins and outs of light painting photography. As you&#39;ll see from the many examples I share below, I&#39;ve put in the time and effort to master this creative technique (in fact, one of my light painting images netted me a major prize in a photo contest!). Therefore, drawing on many nights spent outside with my camera and my lights, I share all the essentials, including gear recommendations, key camera settings, and the painting techniques I encourage you to try.</p><p> And here&#39;s my guarantee:</p><p> By the time you&#39;re done reading, you&#39;ll be able to light-paint your images with ease!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-is-light-painting">什么是光画？</h2><p> Light painting is a photography technique that uses a moving light source (eg, a flashlight) to add light to a scene while taking a <a aria-label="long-exposure photograph (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/step-by-step-guide-to-long-exposure-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">long-exposure photograph</a> . </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-82128 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-82128" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DSC_3376.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="light painting for beginners" class="wp-image-82128" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DSC_3376.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DSC_3376.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DSC_3376.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Mill Falls in Logan, Ohio. The main source of light for this scene was the street lights on the bridge over the river, but I used light painting to take the image to the next level. I light-painted the bridge with a high-powered spotlight. I also added light to the rocks in the foreground. The exposure was 69 seconds, and I set the aperture to f/14 to maximize the starburst on the street lights. This image won me a Photographer&#39;s Choice award in the 2014 Shoot the Hills photo contest.</figcaption></figure></div><p> In other words, every light-painted image includes at least one moving light source that the photographer <em>paints</em> over the scene. That way, you can selectively boost the illumination or even add interesting colors to different portions of the shot.</p><p> When light painting, you, the photographer, become an entirely different kind of artist. Instead of just capturing an image as it&#39;s presented, you <em>create</em> the image that the camera is capturing. For me, a scene or object can be brought to life by painting with a beam of light.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-259316" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/light-painting-photography-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="Light painting photography" class="wp-image-259316" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/light-painting-photography-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/light-painting-photography-2.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/light-painting-photography-2.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/light-painting-photography-2.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/light-painting-photography-2.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@redzeppelin?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">Red Zeppelin</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-rainbow-over-a-body-of-water-sn-6Hw6ZYos?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div><p> Now, light painting may take lots of patience and practice to perfect, but the results can be very rewarding. And it&#39;s important to recognize the simplicity of lighting painting – it&#39;s a lot like any form of low-light photography, except you are putting an external light source <em>in motion</em> to enhance an image. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-two-types-of-light-painting"> The two types of light painting</h2><p> In photography, light painting is an umbrella that includes two different – but highly related – techniques. And before we get into the details of <em>how</em> to create light-painted photos, it&#39;s worth highlighting these different approaches.</p><p> First, you can do light painting from a distance. In other words, you shine your moving light on the scene similar to the way you&#39;d use a flash – to illuminate the subject, but without the light itself actually appearing in the shot. The result is often very subtle, and the viewer won&#39;t always know that light painting took place. (Note that you can – and often should! – use this approach while walking through the frame, the light should never point back directly at the camera.)</p><p> I captured the next image using that approach: </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-82605 size-large is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-82605" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/School_house_in_snow.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="school house in snow" class="wp-image-82605" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/School_house_in_snow.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/School_house_in_snow.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/School_house_in_snow.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Schoolhouse in the snow. This was a long, 170-second exposure, shot at f/8 (for depth of field) and ISO 100. Notice the light coming from inside the schoolhouse, added from the outside by shining a flashlight through windows at the back of the building 。</figcaption></figure></div><p> Second, you can do light painting <em>in front of</em> the camera. This type of light-painted photo tends to be a lot more obvious and eye-catching, because the handheld flashlight, light stick, or other light source adds directly to the shot. You&#39;ve undoubtedly seen images that feature words written with a sparkler or a flashlight across the frame – those are examples of this second type of light painting.</p><p> You can also apply this second technique to create swirls of light within the frame, to circle different subjects, to add cool patterns and streaks, and more.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-259317" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/light-painting-photography-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Light painting photography" class="wp-image-259317" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/light-painting-photography-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/light-painting-photography-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/light-painting-photography-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/light-painting-photography-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/light-painting-photography-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/light-painting-photography-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">摄影：Venti 在<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/man-in-black-jacket-and-blue-denim-jeans-standing-on-ground-during-night-time-yA5WWA4xwDA?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">Unsplash</a>上的<a href="https://unsplash.com/@ventiviews?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">观点</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Note that both types of light painting are completely valid! I favor the first, more subtle approach, but the advice I share in this article applies to both techniques. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="tools-for-light-painting"> Tools for light painting</h2><p> Before you start <em>doing</em> light painting, you&#39;ll need to make sure you have the proper tools:</p><ol><li> <strong>Camera</strong> – Any digital camera capable of manual settings (including <a aria-label="Bulb mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/using-bulb-mode-long-exposure-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Bulb mode</a> ). These days, even smartphones can work for light-painted shots, provided that you download an app with long-exposure capabilities.</li><li> <strong>Tripod</strong> – This is one of the most important tools to produce light paintings. In most cases, you&#39;ll need to keep your camera&#39;s shutter open for several seconds, or even minutes. Therefore, it&#39;s very important that your camera does not move during the exposure. (That said, you don&#39;t need to spend tons of money on a pro-level tripod; as long as the tripod is relatively sturdy and you&#39;re not dealing with windy conditions, even a budget tripod can do the trick.)</li><li> <strong>A remote shutter release</strong> – Either use a <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/using-shutter-release-cables-in-digital-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">cable release or a remote shutter release</a> to begin your exposure. If you don&#39;t have either of these, you can use your camera&#39;s self-timer function to initiate the shot, or you can try connecting your camera to an app for remote control. (It is very important that you never touch your camera or tripod during the exposure.)</li><li> <strong>A stopwatch</strong> – A stopwatch or some other way of timing your exposures is helpful, since most light-painting exposures will use Bulb mode. Your phone undoubtedly has plenty of stopwatch apps to choose from, or you can do a quick search to find a stopwatch program online.</li><li> <strong>A light source</strong> – Many different types of lights can be used for light painting. These light sources are your “brushes” and can include flashlights, torch lights, lasers, glow sticks, flashes, cell phones, and even candles. Just about anything that can produce light can be used for light painting. Note that different light sources will produce different colors of light. For example, an LED light source will produce a cooler (blue) colored light, while a halogen source will produce a much warmer (orange) colored light.</li><li> <strong>Color gels</strong> – Color gels are translucent materials that go over your light source; they&#39;re designed to alter the tint of your light and add color to your painting. </li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-best-light-camera-settings-for-light-painting"> The best light camera settings for light painting </h2><div class="wp-block-image size-large wp-image-82127 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-82127" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:80%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DSC_1076-Edit-4-Edit.jpg?resize=600%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="light painting farmhouse" class="wp-image-82127" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DSC_1076-Edit-4-Edit.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DSC_1076-Edit-4-Edit.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> A light-painted photo of a barn.

However, I avoided lighting other portions of the frame – and as a result, the image is a lot more dramatic!<br /> 30 seconds | f/8</figcaption></figure></div><p> Once you&#39;ve prepared your light-painting gear, it&#39;s time to think about the best camera settings for light painting. While there&#39;s certainly room for experimentation, these are the settings that I regularly use for my own shots, and they&#39;ll serve you well on your nighttime photoshoots, too.</p><ul><li> <strong>Camera mode</strong> – If possible, shoot in <a aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> , which allows you to set your <a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> and <a aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> independently. That way, you&#39;ll have maximum control over your image exposures, and you&#39;ll be able to make adjustments to achieve the exact effects you&#39;re after.</li><li> <strong>Image quality</strong> – Set your camera&#39;s image quality to <a aria-label="RAW (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/raw-vs-jpeg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">RAW</a> , which allows you to capture as much information as possible, and will give you a bit of extra leeway; for instance, if you underexpose your files, shooting in RAW will often allow you to recover missing shadow detail. (This is not a necessity, but it is an important recommendation.) These days, even smartphones offer the option to switch to RAW!</li><li> <strong>White balance</strong> – If your frame includes artificial light sources and you want to <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/introduction-to-white-balance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">balance them out</a> , choose either the Incandescent or Tungsten white balance setting. However, sometimes experimenting with other white balance settings can produce some interesting light effects. Daylight white balance is a good starting point if you want to maintain the original colors of your artificial light sources. I don&#39;t recommend using Auto White balance because it&#39;ll sometimes fail to give you natural colors – however, as long as you shoot in RAW (see above!) you&#39;ll have complete flexibility to make white balance adjustments in post-processing, so you don&#39;t need to stress <em>too</em> much.</li><li> <strong>ISO</strong> – Use a low <a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> , such as 100, in order to ensure minimal noise (and the highest possible image quality!).</li><li> <strong>F-stop or aperture</strong> – Stop down to f/8 and beyond for more <a aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> ; using a narrow aperture also enables you to use a longer shutter speed, which comes in handy when doing more complicated light painting photos.</li><li> <strong>Shutter speed</strong> – Set your shutter speed to Bulb mode, then choose your final shutter speed based on the amount of ambient light in the scene.</li><li> <strong>LCD brightness</strong> – Lower the brightness of your LCD preview. The normal setting is too bright at night and will make your image look nice when it&#39;s actually underexposed.</li><li> <strong>Histogram</strong> – <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-read-and-use-histograms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Use your histogram</a> to check your exposure, either before you&#39;ve captured the image or after you&#39;ve taken the shot. If the histogram skews heavily to the left, your image is likely too dark.</li><li> <strong>Blinkies</strong> – Turn on your blinkies (a highlight warning) to help you determine if your highlights are exposed properly. It is perfectly acceptable for your brightest highlights to be slightly clipped if the rest of your image is properly exposed.</li><li> <strong>Image stabilization</strong> – Set this to <em>Off</em> . With your camera on a tripod, having image stabilization turned on can actually cause blurring in your image.</li><li> <strong>Long exposure noise reduction</strong> – My recommended setting is <em>Off</em> . This can be set to <em>On</em> , but it will cause your exposure time to double (because the camera takes a second black exposure to help remove noise). If your camera is set to a reasonable ISO, the noise level will be low enough in most cases that in-camera noise reduction is unnecessary. Still, it is a good idea to check your noise levels in advance, and some older cameras may require this setting to be <em>On</em> to get acceptable noise levels. </li></ul><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-82606 size-large is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-82606" style="width:501px"><span class="space" style="width:501px; padding-top:119.76%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="501" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Still_life.jpg?resize=501%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="still life flowers" class="wp-image-82606" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Still_life.jpg?w=501&amp;ssl=1 501w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Still_life.jpg?resize=251%2C300&amp;ssl=1 251w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This vase was backlit with a candle, and I painted the flowers with a small penlight.<br /> 30 seconds | f/16 | ISO 100.</figcaption></figure></div><p>哇！ That was a long list of settings, but I wanted it to be comprehensive and leave no room for doubt. Like I said, you don&#39;t have to copy my light-painting settings exactly, but if you just want to get started taking great images, they&#39;ll definitely serve you well. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-create-amazing-light-painting-photography-the-basics"> How to create amazing light painting photography: the basics</h2><p> Once you have your gear and a good understanding of your camera settings, it&#39;s time to delve into the fun stuff: actually creating a light-painted photo. This will vary slightly depending on the type of image you want to produce, but here is the general workflow I recommend: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="step-set-up-your-camera-then-expose-for-the-ambient-light"> Step 1: Set up your camera, then expose for the ambient light</h3><p> The first step – before the actual light painting – is to compose your shot, then lock your camera down on the tripod.</p><p> Next, determine the correct exposure for any ambient light in your scene. You can start by checking your camera&#39;s exposure bar and aiming for an image that is well-exposed (or slightly underexposed, depending on the look you want to create). However, you&#39;ll also probably want to take some test shots, because your camera&#39;s meter can be unreliable.</p><p> Unfortunately, determining base exposures can be time-consuming when you&#39;re experimenting with three- to four-minute shutter speeds. (Do you really want to wait while your camera completes a 360-second exposure, only to find that it&#39;s far too bright and that you need to try again?)</p><p> Here&#39;s a little trick that can help expedite this process:</p><ol><li> Set your ISO to six stops <em>higher</em> than the ISO you plan to ultimately use. For example, if you are planning to shoot at ISO 100, set your ISO to 6400.</li><li> With your camera set to ISO 6400, experiment to find out how many seconds you will need for a nice exposure.

Then, using autofocus, focus on the light.</p><p> Finally, switch your lens from autofocus to manual focus (so that your focus point won&#39;t change).</p><p> But remember: If you move the camera, you must turn your autofocus back on and refocus. So make sure that you definitely like your composition before you proceed with step three: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="step-trigger-the-camera-shutter-and-paint-the-scene-with-light"> Step 3: Trigger the camera shutter, and paint the scene with light!</h3><p> At this point, you should have determined your exposure time, and your camera should be focused on your subject. That means you can begin your exposure and start painting!</p><p> Use your cable release or remote to trigger your shutter button. If your camera is set to Bulb mode – and it generally needs to be, unless you&#39;re doing a relatively short exposure – your shutter will remain open until you press the release again. Use your stopwatch, or the timer on your phone, to time the exposure length.</p><p> Then, once the exposure has begun, turn on your lights and use them to paint the scene. You can use the beam to illuminate interesting details that would otherwise be hidden in the shadows, you can use it to paint streaks or words in the frame, or you can use it to bring out bright colors.

But here is some advice for getting the most impressive results:</p><ul><li> <strong>Paint from the sides</strong> – Don&#39;t just stand behind your camera and wave the light across your image. Painting flat surfaces from the side will allow you to bring out textures.</li><li> <strong>Use lots of different angles</strong> – For instance, when painting the ground, hold the beam low and pan the light along the floor. This will keep the ground from appearing flat, and it&#39;ll bring out all the details of the surface. Also, by adding light from many angles, the resulting image will have an interesting three-dimensional effect.</li><li> <strong>Don&#39;t stand between the camera and your light source</strong> – If you do this, you will show up as a silhouetted ghost in the final photo!</li><li> <strong>Wear dark, non-reflective clothing and keep moving</strong> – Again, you do not want to appear as a ghost in your image!</li><li> <strong>Use a flashlight with a red filter</strong> when you check your camera to make adjustments. The red light will keep you from ruining your night vision.</li><li> <strong>Different surfaces are going to react to light differently</strong> – Wood surfaces may require more light than shiny surfaces such as metal or glass, because rougher surfaces absorb more light than smooth surfaces.</li><li> <strong>Keep your light moving</strong> – Move the beam in slow strokes to add lots of light and make faster strokes in areas where less light is needed.</li><li> <strong>Paint in up-and-down or side-to-side strokes</strong> , just like you&#39;d work with real paint.</li><li> <strong>You probably won&#39;t get the shot you want on the first try</strong> – It may take multiple attempts to get an image that you&#39;re satisfied with. For this reason, try to keep track of how much light you add to each surface. Develop a plan so that you can make adjustments to each exposure until you get the image you&#39;ve visualized.</li></ul><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-259319" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:56.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="844" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/light-painting-photography-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C844&#038;ssl=1" alt="Light painting photography" class="wp-image-259319" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/light-painting-photography-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/light-painting-photography-4.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/light-painting-photography-4.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/light-painting-photography-4.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/light-painting-photography-4.jpg?resize=717%2C403&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@_aaarthy?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">Arthur Humeau</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/alleyway-between-houses-during-nighttime-DVZuH1eBflc?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">Unsplash</a> </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-beginners-guide-to-light-painting-final-words"> A beginner&#39;s guide to light painting: final words</h2><p> I&#39;ve shared lots of tips and techniques to get you started with light painting, but there is so much more you can do with the medium!

When done well, flat lay shots get tons of attention on social media – plus they&#39;re a great way to please product, food, and other commercial photography clients.</p><p> But for those exploring the genre for the first time, capturing beautiful flat lays can seem frustrating, even impossible. There&#39;s so much to consider, from subject choice and compositional arrangements to lighting and colors, that many photographers give up without really giving the flat lay approach a chance.</p><p> That&#39;s where this article should help you out. I discuss <em>all</em> of the basics, and I also include plenty of flat lay examples so you can see <em>exactly</em> what my advice can do for your photos.</p><p>让我们开始吧。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-flat-lay-photography"> What is flat lay photography?</h2><p> Flay lay photography refers to photos where subjects are arranged on a flat surface and photographed from above, with the camera pointing downward. The flat surface and the camera sensor are perfectly parallel; therefore, all objects are captured using a top-down, or bird&#39;s-eye, view, like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-186203 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-186203" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0002.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully" class="wp-image-186203" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0002.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0002.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0002.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0002.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0002.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0002.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> But while flat lay <em>does</em> involve arranging subjects on a flat surface, this does <em>not</em> mean your image should look flat. Some flat lay photos look flat, of course, but others have lots of depth, and I later discuss how to achieve interesting flat lay shots while still maintaining plenty of three-dimensionality.</p><p> Note that flat lay images must be captured from above the flat surface, but this can be at any distance. Yes, most flat lay photography is shot from a few feet above a table arrangement, but this isn&#39;t a requirement. If you have a drone camera, for instance, you can shoot landscapes and mansions in a flat lay fashion!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="flat-lay-photography-subjects-what-can-you-shoot"> Flat lay photography subjects: What can you shoot?</h2><p> Because flat lay photography is a broad genre, you can shoot just about anything – assuming you can arrange it (or find it arranged) on a flat surface.</p><p> Here are a few potential subjects to consider:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="people">人们</h3><p>Flat lay portrait photography features people lying in the grass or in the bed, generally taken with wide-angle lenses from above.</p><p> (Pro tip: When doing flat lay portraits, be sure to watch your shadow carefully and ensure it doesn&#39;t end up in the final photo.)</p><p> Newborns are easier to photograph from the necessary angle because they&#39;re small.

Use the composition basics</h3><p> Flat lay composition starts with layers – but what if you want to create more sophisticated results?然后怎样呢？</p><p> Well, composition in flat lay photography is pretty much identical to composition in standard photography, which means that you can rely on helpful compositional guidelines, like symmetry, the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/" target="_blank" aria-label="rule of thirds (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">rule of thirds</a> , and the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/the-rule-of-odds-in-photography-an-easy-trick-for-better-compositions/" target="_blank" aria-label="rule of odds (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">rule of odds</a> to get pleasing images.</p><p> For instance, you can identify the focal point of your arrangement, then position it along a rule of thirds gridline for a well-balanced effect.</p><p> Or you can take your focal point and place it smack-dab in the middle of your shot for an in-your-face, symmetrical look.</p><p> Here is a rule-of-thirds style image, followed by a symmetrical photo:</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-186205 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-186205" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:133.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="2001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0004.jpg?resize=1500%2C2001&#038;ssl=1" alt="dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully" class="wp-image-186205" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0004.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0004.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0004.jpg?resize=450%2C600&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0004.jpg?resize=768%2C1025&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0004.jpg?resize=1151%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1151w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0004.jpg?resize=717%2C956&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> At the end of the day, well-executed compositions will hugely elevate your photos, so it pays to spend time painstakingly arranging your elements before taking a single shot.</p><p> One final note: It&#39;s easier to play around with composition when you have a variety of objects to use.

Aim for a neutral focal length</h3><p> Choosing the right lens for flat lay photography is crucial. A telephoto focal length – such as 100mm – is often too long, making it challenging to capture the entire scene from above. Conversely, a wide-angle lens, like 35mm or wider, can introduce unwanted distortion, especially in scenes with depth.</p><p> But a 50mm lens often hits the sweet spot for flat lays. It allows you to cover a large area <em>without</em> getting excessively high above your setup. And the 50mm focal length minimizes distortion while providing a natural perspective, akin to what the human eye sees.</p><p> Plus, 50mm lenses are quite affordable and tend to offer excellent image quality, which makes them ideal for those new to flat lay photography.</p><p> Of course, you can always experiment with other focal lengths – maybe you like the distortion that a wide-angle lens can create, or perhaps you enjoy cropping in tight with a telephoto lens – but when in doubt, 50mm is a good way to go ！ </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-be-afraid-to-use-your-smartphone"> 3. Don&#39;t be afraid to use your smartphone</h3><p> Yes, professional flat lay photographers tend to work with full-frame DSLR and mirrorless cameras, but did you know that you can capture images of comparable quality using just a smartphone?</p><p>这是真的。 Assuming your lighting is good, then you can get stunning flat lays <em>simply</em> by holding your phone above your subject and shooting. (In line with the previous tip, I recommend using your phone&#39;s 2x zoom, if it has one – this will generally give you a field of view akin to a 50mm lens.)</p><p> Smartphone flat lay photography is insanely convenient, too. If you&#39;re out at a restaurant and you love the look of the food, just pull out your phone, and – snap! – you&#39;ve got the shot.</p><p> Note that you <em>will</em> struggle to take beautiful smartphone flat lays in low light, however. Always pay careful attention to the light, and do what you can to ensure your subjects are illuminated by beautiful artificial or natural lighting.</p><p>说到这里：</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-choose-your-lighting-carefully"> 4. Choose your lighting carefully</h3><p> In addition to your flat lay compositional techniques and equipment, you <em>must</em> think about the light. Specifically, you should always keep in mind:</p><ul><li> How much light is present</li><li> <span style="color: initial;">How soft or hard it is</span></li><li> The direction from which the light hits the subject</li></ul><p> First and foremost, make sure you have enough light to shoot. I don&#39;t recommend shooting flat lays at night; instead, work in the day when you have plenty of ambient lighting to brighten up your subjects.</p><p> (The exception, of course, is if you&#39;re a studio photographer. You can capture beautiful flat lays whenever you want with the right artificial lighting.)</p><p> Next, ask yourself:</p><p> What <em>quality</em> of light am I after?</p><p> Hard light will produce intense shadows, which are great for a dramatic, edgier look. Soft light will produce soft, even lighting with limited shadows.</p><p> Neither type of light is <em>better</em> than the other, and there&#39;s a place for both hard and soft light, but if you&#39;re not sure which direction to consider, go with soft lighting. It&#39;s flattering, it looks amazing, and it&#39;s commonly used by professionals.</p><p> To get soft light, by the way, you&#39;ll want to either shoot on cloudy days or add a diffuser over your artifical lights.</p><p> Finally, you should think about the direction of the light. Sidelight is a great way to add three-dimensionality and texture, while backlight produces extra drama.</p><p> For the baby photo below, the room was bright and airy. The main light came from a huge window on the left, which offered beautiful diffused lighting. Thanks to the diffusion, the shadows are subtle.</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-186284 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-186284" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0019.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="dps-how-to-do-flat-lay-photography-successfully" class="wp-image-186284" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0019.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0019.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0019.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0019.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0019.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0019.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> These images, on the other hand, were taken with a slightly harder light source, hence the darker shadows:</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-186210 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-186210" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:74.93%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1124" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0009.jpg?resize=1500%2C1124&#038;ssl=1" alt="dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully" class="wp-image-186210" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0009.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0009.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0009.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0009.jpg?resize=768%2C575&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0009.jpg?resize=717%2C537&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-don-t-forget-about-contrast"> 5.

This approach can help you add depth to your photoshoot, and it can be particularly effective when shooting food or showcasing products.</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-186219 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-186219" style="width:429px"><span class="space" style="width:429px; padding-top:139.86%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="429" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0018.jpg?resize=429%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully" class="wp-image-186219" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0018.jpg?resize=429%2C600&amp;ssl=1 429w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0018.jpg?resize=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1 214w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0018.jpg?resize=768%2C1075&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0018.jpg?resize=1097%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1097w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0018.jpg?resize=1463%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1463w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0018.jpg?resize=717%2C1004&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dps-how-to-do-flatlay-photography-successfully_0018.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> To craft a compelling series, I encourage you to start with a central theme or idea, then arrange your items in ways that help your story unfold. For instance, in a food flat lay, you could start with untouched dishes, then progress to partially eaten plates, and end with empty, crumb-strewn tableware.</p><p> You can plan out your series in advance, but I&#39;d also like to emphasize that <em>experimentation is key</em> . Sometimes the best narratives emerge through trial and error. Arrange, photograph, then reassess. This iterative process can reveal surprising patterns or stories you hadn&#39;t anticipated. The goal is to create a sequence that, when viewed together, offers more insight and engagement than a single image can offer!</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-tethering"> 7. Try tethering</h3><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tutorial-shoot-tethered/" target="_blank" aria-label="Tethering (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Tethering</a> isn&#39;t a technique that&#39;s known by many beginners – but in my experience, it can absolutely transform your flat lay photography by offering a more precise way to compose and review shots.</p><p> The idea behind tethering is simple: You connect your camera to a computer so that you can review your images on the larger screen moments after they&#39;re taken. In other words, after you press the shutter button on your camera (or on your computer – tethering generally offers full computer control over your camera settings!), you can see the image appear in its entirety in your tethering program, where you can zoom in to check details, make edits, and even export for sharing.</p><p> As you can probably imagine, tethering has many advantages, but the biggest benefit is that seeing your images on a bigger screen makes it easier to spot details that might go unnoticed on your camera&#39;s LCD. This immediate feedback loop enables quick adjustments, ensuring each element in your flat lay is perfectly placed and lit.</p><p> Plus, while tethering might sound complicated, getting started might be easier than you think. Many modern cameras offer wireless connectivity – and once you set up a connection between your camera and your PC, you&#39;ll basically be good to go! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-forget-about-post-processing"> 8. Don&#39;t forget about post-processing!</h3><p> Post-processing might seem unimportant, especially if you get everything right in camera – but for flat lay photographers seeking refined, polished, professional-looking photos, it&#39;s an essential part of the workflow. Even with meticulous planning and execution, some adjustments in post-processing are often necessary to achieve perfect tones and colors in your images.</p><p> So how should you edit your flat lay shots? Every photographer develops their own preferred workflow over time, but if you&#39;re not sure where to start, I&#39;d recommend beginning with a compositional evaluation. In other words, is your image strongly composed, or could a crop help balance or simplify the scene more? This step is crucial for eliminating distractions and focusing the viewer&#39;s attention on the main subjects.</p><p> Next, consider the image&#39;s tones and contrast. Adjusting these can add depth and mood to your flat lays, highlighting (or deemphasizing) different parts of the image.</p><p> Color grading is a more advanced tool, but once you get comfortable with basic edits, it&#39;s definitely worth considering. You see, by manipulating colors – often in the highlights and shadows – you can create distinctive looks that make your flat lays stand out. The technique can evoke different atmospheres, from warm and inviting to cool and minimalist, depending on your vision.</p><p> At the end of the day, post-processing should be an important part of your workflow, but you don&#39;t need to spend long hours behind the computer. A basic set of edits can make a huge difference to your shots (and once you get the hang of processing, you can start creating presets to make things go even faster!).</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="flat-lay-photography-final-words"> Flat lay photography: final words</h2><p> Flat lay photography is lots of fun, plus it&#39;s a wildly creative genre of photography.
