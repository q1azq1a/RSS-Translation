data-section id="how-to-manually-focus-step-by-step">如何手动对焦：一步一步</h2><p>首先，找到相机或镜头上的对焦模式开关。它可能会标有“AF/MF”，其中“AF”激活自动对焦，“MF”激活手动对焦。像这样：</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter

（请注意，某些镜头无法手动对焦；在这种情况下，您将找不到任何开关。如果您不确定是否属于这种情况，请检查镜头手册。）</p><p>其次，找到对焦环，它通常位于镜筒中部附近（如果您使用定焦镜头）或靠近镜筒末端（如果您使用变焦镜头）。</p><p>通过相机取景器查看，然后将对焦环旋转到一侧。</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure

这为您提供了良好的景深窗口 - 然后提前手动对焦。</p><p>这种方法的优点在于，随着时间的推移，您将准确地了解焦点窗口所在的位置。然后，当您发现完美的主题或场景时，您根本不必为对焦而苦恼。您只需就位并拍摄即可。</p><p>因此，手动对焦并不会减慢您的速度，实际上<em>可以消除</em>延迟，并可以拍摄出一些非凡的照片。请记住，在街头摄影中相信手动对焦并不是一个限制；这是一个以新的、有益的方式掌握你的手艺的机会。</p><h3

f/11，这有助于使更多场景清晰对焦，但这只是等式的一部分。如果没有完美放置的焦点，即使是窄光圈也无法保持整个场景清晰，特别是当您的构图包含前景元素时。</p><p>这就是超焦距发挥作用的地方。正是特定的焦点可以最大化您拍摄的景深。 （注意：您的相机没有内置超焦距计算器。在野外时，您可以使用经验法则，也可以找到一个可以为您进行计算的工具。）</p><p>一旦确定了超焦距所在的位置，就可以手动对焦该确切位置。自动对焦通常不会在这里发挥作用，因为它缺乏该技术所需的精度。手动对焦再次让您掌控一切，让您将镜头准确地设置在需要的位置，以捕捉令人惊叹的风景或城市景观的所有辉煌。</p><h3 data-section

Since there&#39;s no fill light, the shadows on the nose and chin remain heavy, giving more dramatic and intense results. It&#39;s an effect that can be particularly well-suited for fashion photography.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255906" style="width:464px"><span class="space" style="width:464px; padding-top:129.31%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="464" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-101.jpg?resize=464%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Clamshell lighting photography" class="wp-image-255906" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-101.jpg?resize=464%2C600&amp;ssl=1 464w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-101.jpg?resize=232%2C300&amp;ssl=1 232w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-101.jpg?resize=768%2C994&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-101.jpg?resize=717%2C928&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-101.jpg?w=1159&amp;ssl=1 1159w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Notice the strong shadows under the subject&#39;s nose; that&#39;s a result of butterfly lighting.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Now, let&#39;s compare this to clamshell lighting. Clamshell lighting involves placing a second light below the subject, softening the shadows. This produces a gentler, more soothing effect, so it&#39;s often seen in conventional headshot photography or applications with far less drama.</p><p> Pro tip: If you&#39;re uncertain about the final look you want, you can always start with butterfly lighting. Experiment with the shadows and angles, then simply add a fill light to achieve the clamshell look if you desire something softer. This way, you can play around with two different lighting styles with very little effort. It&#39;s a convenient and creative approach to portrait lighting.</p><h2 data-section id="clamshell-vs-rembrandt-lighting"> Clamshell vs Rembrandt lighting</h2><p> Another classic lighting technique to consider? Rembrandt lighting. The Rembrandt pattern involves placing a light off to the side of the subject – often around 45 degrees – to create a clear triangle of light on the subject&#39;s cheek.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255907" style="width:480px"><span class="space" style="width:480px; padding-top:125%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="480" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-100.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Clamshell lighting photography" class="wp-image-255907" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-100.jpg?resize=480%2C600&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-100.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-100.jpg?resize=768%2C961&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-100.jpg?resize=717%2C897&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-100.jpg?w=1199&amp;ssl=1 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Rembrandt lighting produces a triangle under the subject&#39;s eye.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Because it covers so much of the face in shadows, Rembrandt lighting is known for its dark and moody qualities. It&#39;s a favorite among those seeking a dramatic, theatrical style in their images.</p><p> So how does clamshell lighting stack up against Rembrandt? Clamshell lighting is the better choice if you want a more cheerful, detailed shot. By positioning lights both above and below your subject, you can illuminate the face more evenly and reduce harsh shadows. This brings out more of the facial details and gives the image a livelier, more approachable feeling.</p><p> In short, if drama and moodiness are your goals, Rembrandt lighting may be the way to go. But for a more uplifting and detailed portrait, clamshell lighting fits the bill. Understanding the nuances of these lighting techniques will allow you to choose the right style for each unique portrait session. Experiment with both, and see what you think!</p><h2 data-section id="clamshell-photography-setup-a-few-quick-tips"> Clamshell photography setup: a few quick tips</h2><p> You know how to capture a basic clamshell image.

Their focused light can accentuate textures and details. On the other hand, umbrellas can really soften up the shadows. By throwing around a lot of light, they make everything feel more diffused and ethereal.</p><p> By testing out different modifiers, you&#39;ll learn how they affect your images. So don&#39;t be afraid to try something new. Just remember to keep the essence of clamshell lighting in mind: that beautiful, flattering glow that makes portraits shine.</p><h3 data-section id="try-repositioning-your-lights"> 2. Try repositioning your lights</h3><p> Light position matters in clamshell lighting, and even an adjustment of a few inches can dramatically change the final image.</p><p> Move the lights closer to your subject, and the shadows will soften and become more gradated for a gentle and delicate look.</p><p> Move the lights farther from your subject, and the shadows will harden and become sharper. This can add a sense of depth and drama to the image.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133410" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133410" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> But it&#39;s not just about distance. You can move your key light higher to create longer shadows or lower to create shorter shadows. You can do the same with the fill light.</p><p> Just be cautious not to go overboard. The 45-degree positions that I discussed in my initial step-by-step section are designed to look flattering. Playing with the positioning is great, but don&#39;t lose sight of your original goals!</p><h3 data-section id="add-more-lights"> 3. Add more lights</h3><p> Once you&#39;ve set up your clamshell lighting just right, you might think you&#39;re done. But there&#39;s more you can do to enhance the scene and create striking images.</p><p> For instance, you can add rim lights behind your subject, either on one side or both, to create a delicate sliver of light around the head. This effect will help your subject pop off the background and make the image more dynamic.</p><p> A hair light can add depth to your photograph. Positioned above and behind the subject, it shines subtly on the hair to separate it from the background.</p><p> Don&#39;t hesitate to experiment with background lights, as well. Placing a light behind the subject (that&#39;s pointed at the backdrop) can create a beautiful cone of light that adds extra depth. It&#39;s how many photographers combine a well-lit subject with a well-lit background!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133409" style="width:500px"><span class="space" style="width:500px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="500" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-8580.jpg?resize=500%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133409" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-8580.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-8580.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-8580.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Bottom line: By adding these additional lights, you give yourself more creative freedom and open up a world of possibilities in your clamshell lighting setups.</p><h3 data-section id="convert-to-black-and-white"> 4. Convert to black and white</h3><p> Clamshell lighting produces wonderful images that can look stunning in both color and black and white. Converting your shot to black and white will emphasize the interplay of shadows and highlights while potentially adding a layer of three-dimensionality to the photo.</p><p> If you shoot in RAW, and I highly recommend you do, you have the flexibility to photograph using your camera&#39;s Monochrome mode and still convert back to color if needed. Or you can start in color and convert to black and white later on.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133399" style="width:500px"><span class="space" style="width:500px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="500" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-7627-2.jpg?resize=500%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133399" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-7627-2.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-7627-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-7627-2.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The black-and-white conversion can make the features of the face stand out in a unique way. It might bring out textures, emphasize contrasts, or even create a mood that color doesn&#39;t capture. Experimenting with this conversion allows you to explore a range of visual expressions within a single lighting setup, which is always a good idea!</p><h3 data-section id="watch-the-catchlights"> 5. Watch the catchlights</h3><p> Catchlight is that magical spot of light in the subject&#39;s eyes, one that&#39;s created by a reflection from the light source. It brings life to the eyes; without a catchlight, the eyes – and the entire portrait – can appear flat and lifeless.</p><p> Therefore, it&#39;s important that you always make sure your clamshell photos include catchlights! If a catchlight isn&#39;t present, you may need to ask your subject to angle their head, or you may need to make slight adjustments to your lights. Make sure to review each test shot on your camera&#39;s LCD to ensure that the catchlight is just as you want it.</p><p> Note that with clamshell lighting, since it involves two lights rather than one, you might notice a double catchlight. This is a feature some photographers love, while others are less enthusiastic.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133400" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3713-crop.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3713-crop.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3713-crop.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3713-crop.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3713-crop.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3713-crop.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you&#39;re not a fan of the bottom catchlight, don&#39;t fret!

In fact, if you want to create gorgeous photos, you must master negative space; that way, you can take shots that feature balanced, harmonious, eye-catching arrangements. (You can also capture wonderfully <em>minimalistic</em> compositions, as I discuss down below.)</p><p> In this article, I&#39;ll explain everything you need to know about negative space, including:</p><ul><li> What negative space actually is</li><li> Why negative space is important</li><li> Simple tips and tricks to use negative space in your images, whether you shoot landscapes, portraits, street scenes, or architecture</li></ul><p> Ready to become a compositional master? Then let&#39;s get started.</p><h2 data-section id="what-is-negative-space"> What is negative space?</h2><p> Negative space refers to areas of a composition that are empty, bland, or otherwise uninteresting. That&#39;s why <em>negative space</em> is also called <em>white space</em> ; it&#39;s where nothing is really happening.</p><p> Check out this next image, where the foggy sky and the empty water act as negative space:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174286" style="width:741px"><span class="space" style="width:741px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="741" height="494" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-03.jpg?resize=741%2C494&#038;ssl=1" alt="negative space in photography woman near tree" class="wp-image-174286" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-03.jpg?w=741&amp;ssl=1 741w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-03.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-03.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-03.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-03.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> In photography, negative space is often made up of certain elements:</p><ul><li> Water</li><li> Sky</li><li> Walls</li><li> Sand</li></ul><p> Note that all of these elements tend to fade easily into the background, and that&#39;s why they make such great negative space. An empty sky does <em>not</em> draw the eye, any more than a blank white wall, a stretch of empty sand, and so on.</p><p> Now, some photos are full of negative space. These compositions are often very abstract, such as a stretch of empty blue sky, or a sand dune stretching off in every direction. Such negative-space-centric compositions can also be <em>minimalistic</em> , with a single eye-catching element surrounded by emptiness.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255876" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Negative space photography" class="wp-image-255876" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Other photos, however, feature plenty of non-negative space, also known as <em>positive</em> space:</p><h2 data-section id="positive-space-versus-negative-space"> Positive space versus negative space</h2><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/positive-space-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Positive space</a> is the complete opposite of negative space. Negative space rejects the eye, while positive space steals the spotlight. You see, positive space is the area of a photo that includes elements of interest, the area that includes the main subject, the area where the viewer&#39;s eye goes <em>first</em> .</p><p> In the photo below, there is plenty of positive space but very little negative space. The flag, the buildings, and the trees all act as positive space. Even the clouds provide some positive space thanks to their interesting arrangement and texture. The biggest patch of negative space is the sky, which takes up a tiny portion of the shot.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174284" style="width:1080px"><span class="space" style="width:1080px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1080" height="720" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?resize=1080%2C720&#038;ssl=1" alt="flag above a city Negative space photography" class="wp-image-174284" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Now, positive space can be anything, but here are some common examples:</p><ul><li> Faces</li><li> People</li><li> Buildings</li><li> Birds</li><li> Wildlife</li><li> Mountains</li></ul><p> So which is better, positive or negative space?</p><p> Neither.</p><p> In photography, the goal is to combine <em>both</em> types of space to create a balanced composition. You want negative space, yes, but you also want positive space. That&#39;s how you can get consistently stunning photos!</p><h2 data-section id="negative-space-and-minimalism"> Negative space and minimalism</h2><p> Technically, negative space is present in nearly every image, even if the compositions are chaotic, messy, and otherwise overwhelming. But when you think of negative space, you might associate it with minimalism.为什么？</p><p> Minimalism in photography heavily emphasizes negative space to create a tranquil effect. This type of image uses lots of negative space to give the viewer plenty of room to breathe and focus on the subject.</p><p> Think of a lone tree or a solitary figure in a field, surrounded by emptiness. It makes for an eye-catching composition, and that&#39;s primarily due to the power of negative space!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255882" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:80%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1200" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-21.jpg?resize=1500%2C1200&#038;ssl=1" alt="Negative space photography" class="wp-image-255882" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-21.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-21.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-21.jpg?resize=600%2C480&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-21.jpg?resize=768%2C614&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-21.jpg?resize=717%2C574&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> But there&#39;s an essential point that I want to emphasize: Not all images with negative space are minimalistic. Minimalism uses negative space in a unique way, and you <em>can</em> go for striking results by taking a minimalistic approach, but you don&#39;t have to. You can always compose with a balanced combination of positive and negative space for a different effect.</p><h2 data-section id="the-best-genres-for-negative-space-photography"> The best genres for negative space photography</h2><p> Negative space isn&#39;t confined to a single genre. In fact, you can apply this concept across various types of photography.</p><p> Take landscape shooting, for instance. The wide expanses of sky, beach, mountains, and desert often lend themselves to heavy use of negative space. And this allows the main subject, such as a mountain or a tree, to truly stand out.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255883" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Negative space photography" class="wp-image-255883" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Travel photography also benefits from negative space. Imagine a road stretching through an empty landscape, or a person standing at the edge of a lake; the results are meaningful and striking at the same time.</p><p> Even certain forms of street photography can look great with lots of negative space. A lone figure crossing a wide-open plaza can speak volumes about urban life and isolation.</p><p> On the flip side, portrait photography, event photography, documentary photography, and sports photography often focus more on positive space. The aim here is to convey information about a person, setting, or story, and positive space generally communicates more details.</p><p> But don&#39;t let that limit you! If you feel inspired to shoot documentary images with lots of negative space, go for it. Creativity knows no boundaries, and it&#39;s always refreshing to try new approaches.</p><p> The genres and ideas I shared above are merely suggestions. The beauty of photography lies in personal interpretation and experimentation. Dive into different subjects and see how negative space can enhance your style.</p><h2 data-section id="negative-space-photography-tips-and-tricks"> Negative space photography tips and tricks</h2><p> Hopefully, you now feel ready to capture some negative space images of your own. To that end, here are my favorite tips and techniques for working with negative space:</p><h3 data-section id="let-the-scene-dictate-your-negative-space-and-positive-space-combination"> 1. Let the scene dictate your negative space and positive space combination</h3><p> Every scene has a different ratio of negative space to positive space.</p><p> And while you, as the photographer, can zoom in, change perspective, and crop to emphasize certain parts of the scene, you need to be flexible; you need to be able to embrace a scene that&#39;s full of negative space, just the same as you embrace a scene filled with positive space.</p><p> So don&#39;t try to force a scene in a certain direction. Instead, ask yourself: What is the scene <em>already</em> like?

It was early morning and some fog had rolled in, covering most of the impressive structure. The woman standing next to me turned to me and said, “It&#39;s so sad, we&#39;re driving by today, and I wanted to get a photo of the Percé Rock. But due to the fog, it seems it won&#39;t be possible.”</p><p> She left, disappointed that she didn&#39;t get her shot. But I stayed, and I stood for a long time, examining the fog and the way it draped the rock like a heavy blanket. I thought it was one of the most amazing things to happen that day. I felt so lucky to be there at that exact moment to capture the wonder unfolding. I embraced the negative space, and I captured a beautiful, minimalistic image.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174287" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="foggy rock on the water" class="wp-image-174287" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>底线：</p><p> Be adaptable. Be flexible. If negative space dominates a scene, let it, even if you generally prefer to avoid minimalistic compositions. Make sense?</p><h3 data-section id="use-negative-space-to-balance-out-positive-space"> 2. Use negative space to balance out positive space</h3><p> A key goal of photographic composition is to <em>achieve visual balance</em> . You want your images to feel whole, complete, <em>satisfying</em> .</p><p> And one way to achieve balance is by identifying your positive space, then countering it with negative space.</p><p> For instance, look at the image below. You can see the positive space – the clenched fist. It&#39;s a powerful, eye-catching subject, but it&#39;s countered by all the surrounding negative space. It creates an overall balance, as you can see:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-222171" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="negative space raised fist" class="wp-image-222171" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> By the way, it&#39;s important to recognize how <em>lots</em> of negative space can balance out just a little positive space. Positive space is aggressive and powerful. Negative space is much more subdued, even soothing. So unless you&#39;re specifically after a very in-your-face image, positive space should come in small doses.</p><p> Some photographers practice a “2:1” negative space rule, where you add two parts negative space for every one part positive space. I don&#39;t like to restrict myself in this way, but it&#39;s a good guideline to bear in mind.</p><h3 data-section id="experiment-with-minimalism"> 3.

They&#39;re all about negative space; they take lots of negative space, include a touch of positive space, and create an eye-catching result.</p><p> Here&#39;s an example of a minimalist image, where the shadow acts as positive space, while the bricks provide some empty negative space:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174289" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:67.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1011" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=1500%2C1011&#038;ssl=1" alt="cross on the bricks negative space" class="wp-image-174289" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=300%2C202&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=768%2C518&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=600%2C404&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=436%2C293&amp;ssl=1 436w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=717%2C483&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you like the minimalistic look, I highly recommend you try it out. It&#39;s pretty simple to pull off.</p><p> Here are my recommendations:</p><ol><li> Start by identifying a main subject, like a tree, a person, or a building. This will be your <em>positive</em> space.</li><li> Adjust your positive, focal length, and camera angle until your main subject is all alone, surrounded by nothing but negative space. (A low perspective is great for this; by dropping down to the ground, you can frame your subject against the sky.)</li><li> Eliminate as much color as possible. You want uniformity, if you can get it: just one or two colors in a highly harmonious scene.</li><li> Position your main subject toward the edge of the composition. You can try putting the subject at a rule of thirds power point or along a gridline, but you might also consider moving it closer to the edge of the frame.</li></ol><p> The tree photo below is highly minimalistic. It includes a small tree positioned in the corner as positive space, while the rest of the photo is (for the most part) negative space, for a nice overall balance.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174290" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:69.13%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1037" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-07.jpg?resize=1500%2C1037&#038;ssl=1" alt="tree and clouds" class="wp-image-174290" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-07.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-07.jpg?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-07.jpg?resize=768%2C531&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-07.jpg?resize=600%2C415&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-07.jpg?resize=717%2C496&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="use-negative-space-to-convey-emotion"> 4.

Look for anything that doesn&#39;t belong and adjust your composition to exclude it. This might mean changing your angle, repositioning your camera, or waiting for the right moment.

Note that infrared waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation that lies below the visible spectrum. Humans cannot see infrared light, but camera sensors can, and this IR sensitivity can be used to create images.</p><p> That said, cameras aren&#39;t well-equipped to capture infrared wavelengths – after all, they&#39;re designed to use <em>visible</em> light, not IR light! – so infrared imaging requires special filters or adjusted camera sensors.</p><p> When you capture an infrared photo, the result usually looks like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-140750" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><span class="responsive-image wp-image-140750" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="499" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=750%2C499&#038;ssl=1" alt="Infrared photography" class="wp-image-140750" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></span></figure></div><p> It&#39;s interesting, but not what most photographers are after.

While it&#39;s suitable for various subjects, there are a few in particular that stand out.</p><p> Landscapes and nature scenes are popular choices among IR photographers. Foliage can produce a wide array of tones, resulting in shots that are haunting yet touched with a subtle sense of realism. Skies and water, with their vast and open spaces, also turn out beautifully in infrared.</p><p> Portraits of people might seem like an infrared no-no – people often look unsettling in infrared – but with the right approach, you might discover a unique way to capture human subjects. And buildings, especially under high-contrast light, can look fascinating in infrared.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255850" style="width:399px"><span class="space" style="width:399px; padding-top:150.38%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="399" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/infrared-photography-1.jpg?resize=399%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Infrared photography" class="wp-image-255850" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/infrared-photography-1.jpg?resize=399%2C600&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/infrared-photography-1.jpg?resize=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1 199w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/infrared-photography-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1155&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/infrared-photography-1.jpg?resize=717%2C1079&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/infrared-photography-1.jpg?w=997&amp;ssl=1 997w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> At the end of the day, don&#39;t restrict yourself to a few specific subjects.

You won&#39;t be capturing thousands of shots, so space shouldn&#39;t be an issue, and RAWs and JPEGs each offer valuable benefits.</p><p> On the one hand, RAW files give you the most scope when processing (and infrared photos do require significant edits). A RAW file will let you recover blown out highlights and clipped shadows, which is essential for infrared photography, as the right exposure settings can be tough to nail down (more on that later!).</p><p> On the other hand, JPEGs are easily viewable, so you can see the results of your infrared photos on your computer screen <em>without</em> any processing.</p><p> It&#39;s important to emphasize, though: Straight-out-of-camera infrared photos look <em>horrible</em> . At first, you&#39;ll probably be turned off by their flat, pink appearance – but over time, you&#39;ll get used to it, and you&#39;ll soon develop the skills to identify a good IR image from a bad IR image at a glance.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-140761" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="499" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_BTLighthouse.jpg?resize=750%2C499&#038;ssl=1" alt="Infrared photography" class="wp-image-140761" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_BTLighthouse.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_BTLighthouse.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_BTLighthouse.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_BTLighthouse.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_BTLighthouse.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="infrared-exposure-settings"> Infrared exposure settings</h3><p> When you&#39;re exposing for infrared photos, all common wisdom goes out the window. You can&#39;t trust your camera&#39;s meter, you can&#39;t trust handheld meters, and you&#39;ll simply need to take some test shots, preview the results on your LCD, and keep going until you get a good result.</p><p> (I&#39;d recommend you take careful notes; that way, as you progress, you&#39;ll start to figure out the right settings for the look you&#39;re after.)</p><p> Infrared filters require extremely long exposure times; they block out visible light but don&#39;t let any <em>extra</em> infrared light through, so on a bright sunny day, you&#39;ll often work with exposure times between 30 and 120 seconds (assuming you&#39;re shooting at f/8). Here, a tripod is essential.</p><p> If your camera is infrared converted, your settings will be much more standard. On sunny days, you might shoot at f/8 and 1/125s, though the settings will vary depending on the light.</p><p> Whether you use a filter or an IR-converted body, review your photos <em>constantly</em> , especially in the beginning. As soon as you&#39;ve taken a shot, check the LCD and view the image histogram. You might consider bracketing your photos to increase your chances of capturing a nice exposure.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-140747" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="499" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_OldFactory.jpg?resize=750%2C499&#038;ssl=1" alt="Infrared photography" class="wp-image-140747" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_OldFactory.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_OldFactory.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_OldFactory.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_OldFactory.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_OldFactory.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="post-processing-your-infrared-photos"> Post-processing your infrared photos</h2><p> As previously mentioned, when you shoot RAW infrared images, you&#39;ll get a dull pinkish-red image, like this: </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-140750 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-140750" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><span class="responsive-image wp-image-140750" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="499" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=750%2C499&#038;ssl=1" alt="Infrared photography" class="wp-image-140750" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Infrared RAW image straight out of the camera.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Not such a great look, right?

When you&#39;re just starting out with infrared, the rule of thirds can be very helpful; it&#39;s simple enough that you can focus on the technical aspects of infrared shooting, but it&#39;s powerful enough to keep your compositions looking good.</p><p> (How do you use the rule of thirds? Imagine your image is divided into nine equal parts by two vertical and two horizontal lines.

Wedding albums, newborn albums, Bar and Bat Mitzvah albums – they look gorgeous, tell the event&#39;s story, and make fantastic gifts. In other words, offering custom-made albums is a superb way to satisfy clients, and they can help you boost profits, too.</p><p> But designing high-quality albums can be tedious, difficult, and time-consuming. That&#39;s where an album-design app like <a href="https://www.zno.com/album-designer.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Zno Designer (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Zno Designer</a> comes in.</p><p> Zno Designer provides a straightforward, intuitive method for designing, creating, and even printing breathtaking photo albums. It&#39;s cloud-based, so there&#39;s no software to download, and it integrates smoothly with Zno&#39;s other apps like Zno Proofer, Zno Gallery, Zno Estore, and Zno Retoucher. This means you can create client galleries, sell products, design albums, get client feedback, and retouch images without ever leaving the Zno workspace. Plus, it&#39;s remarkably affordable; Zno even offers a fantastic free plan, and paid users enjoy huge discounts from Zno&#39;s professional print lab.</p><p> I&#39;ve spent dozens of hours testing Zno Designer, and I genuinely believe that the company offers one of the most compelling photographer software packages in the business. If you&#39;re looking to offer custom albums but aren&#39;t sure how to begin, <em>or</em> you&#39;re searching for an album designer but aren&#39;t sure if Zno&#39;s software is the right fit, this article is exactly what you need. Below, I explore the ins and outs of Zno Designer, including the software&#39;s main benefits. I also compare its pricing and features to other photo album designers like Fundy Designer and Pixellu SmartAlbums.</p><p> Ready to create photo albums that&#39;ll leave your clients speechless?

Here are just a few of the reasons why I&#39;m a fan:</p><h3 data-section id="zno-designer-is-free"> Zno Designer is free</h3><p> Zno Designer comes with a Free Plan that offers unlimited album creation and full access to all design templates and features.</p><p> It&#39;s surprisingly powerful, and the main limitation is that you can&#39;t regularly export album designs for third-party order fulfillment. So if you&#39;re creating dozens of albums, you&#39;ll need to order through Zno or upgrade to the Pro Plan, which only costs $5 per month and includes 10 monthly exports to third-party labs (along with impressive discounts).</p><p> However, the Free Plan does include three free exports, which can be useful if you only occasionally need to do third-party printing.</p><h3 data-section id="zno-designer-is-cloud-based"> Zno Designer is cloud-based</h3><p> Zno Designer is cloud-based, so you do everything in the browser, <em>not</em> on your desktop. In contrast, desktop-based album designers require downloads and installations, and often require additional fees if you want to access the latest versions.</p><p> Thanks to Zno&#39;s cloud platform, the Designer app also boasts unique integration with other Zno software, including <a href="https://www.zno.com/client-gallery.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Zno Gallery (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Zno Gallery</a> .</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255768" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:44.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="672" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Zno-album-designer-13.jpg?resize=1500%2C672&#038;ssl=1" alt="Zno album designer" class="wp-image-255768" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Zno-album-designer-13.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Zno-album-designer-13.jpg?resize=300%2C134&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Zno-album-designer-13.jpg?resize=600%2C269&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Zno-album-designer-13.jpg?resize=768%2C344&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Zno-album-designer-13.jpg?resize=717%2C321&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> For instance, you can instantly design albums using files already uploaded to your client galleries.

And Zno Retoucher isn&#39;t some barebones editing program, either; it&#39;s powered by Perfectly Clear, a popular retouching program that boasts presets, batch editing, and individual editing so you can get results consistent with your style. Plus, it&#39;s used by a variety of big-name portrait businesses, so you know it works great.</p><p> You also don&#39;t need to pay a regular fee to access Zno Retoucher; you get 50 free editing credits, then you can purchase additional credits as needed (at around 100 credits per dollar).</p><h2 data-section id="znos-album-designer-is-part-of-an-all-in-one-platform"> Zno&#39;s album designer is part of an all-in-one platform</h2><p> Zno Designer isn&#39;t only integrated with the Zno Gallery and Zno Retoucher apps.

And within Zno Gallery, there&#39;s the Zno Estore feature so you can directly offer print products – including albums! – to clients.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255763" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:49.13%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="737" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Zno-album-designer-6.png?resize=1500%2C737&#038;ssl=1" alt="Zno album designer" class="wp-image-255763" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Zno-album-designer-6.png?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Zno-album-designer-6.png?resize=300%2C147&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Zno-album-designer-6.png?resize=600%2C295&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Zno-album-designer-6.png?resize=768%2C377&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Zno-album-designer-6.png?resize=717%2C352&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> One broad benefit of this cloud-based software suite is that you can keep all your work in one streamlined location. You don&#39;t need to maintain accounts with six different companies; you create one account, and you can access everything – client galleries, print orders, slideshows, albums, and even powerful retouching software – from the same dashboard.</p><p> But it&#39;s also about functionality. Since the Zno apps can all “talk” to one another, you can jump between apps, pull files from one app, then use those files in another app without ever needing to leave the Zno workspace. It&#39;s insanely convenient, and it&#39;s what allows Zno to seamlessly combine album design and retouching, gallery display and print orders, and album creation and proofing.</p><p> Subscribing to an entire suite of apps might sound costly, and normally, it would be – but Zno offers a <a href="https://www.zno.com/fulfillment-apps-bundle.html" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Fulfillment Apps Bundle</a> , which provides access to the Cloud Platform software at a massively discounted rate. The Fulfillment Apps Bundle also includes Zno Lab credit rebates, product discounts, dropshipping options, and more.</p><p> So if you&#39;re looking for a hassle-free solution for creating gorgeous display galleries, slideshows, and albums, the Fulfillment Apps Bundle is an outstanding choice.</p><h2 data-section id="how-does-zno-designers-pricing-compare-to-other-album-designers"> How does Zno Designer&#39;s pricing compare to other album designers?</h2><p> As I&#39;ve detailed above, Zno&#39;s album designer is packed with enough features to impress any veteran event photographer.

It&#39;s designed to provide both flexibility and speed; that way, you can focus on the subject, composition, and artistry while the camera optimizes the exposure.</p><h2 data-section id="aperture-priority-mode-variables-aperture-shutter-speed-and-iso"> Aperture Priority mode variables: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO</h2><p> If you set your camera to Aperture Priority mode, you immediately gain control over the aperture and ISO while your camera takes control of the shutter speed – but what do these different settings offer, and why do they matter?</p><p> Together, aperture, shutter speed, and ISO are part of the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/mastering-the-exposure-triangle-for-newbies/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure triangle (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure triangle</a> . By adjusting any of the three variables, you consequently adjust the exposure (ie, brightness) of the resulting image. However, when you use Aperture Priority mode, your camera automatically compensates for aperture and ISO adjustments by changing the shutter speed (with the goal of creating a spot-on exposure).</p><p> So if you widen the aperture, your camera will increase the shutter speed to compensate for the brighter exposure. And if you drop the ISO, your camera will decrease the shutter speed to compensate for the darker exposure. Make sense?</p><p> Here&#39;s the bottom line: When using Aperture Priority, your camera will always try to maintain a good exposure, even as you adjust the aperture and ISO.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-237094" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-12.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="portrait with wide aperture" class="wp-image-237094" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-12.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-12.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-12.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-12.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-12.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-12.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> But you might be wondering: If the aperture and ISO don&#39;t adjust the exposure, then <em>why</em> would I want to change the aperture? Why would I want to change the ISO? What do those two settings offer me?</p><p> Aperture and ISO produce three key effects:</p><ol><li> By widening or narrowing the aperture, you can adjust the <a aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> (that is, the amount of the image that&#39;s in focus). A wide aperture (eg, f/1.8) creates a very thin plane of focus, so most of the image blurs away. And a narrow aperture (eg, f/16) creates a very deep plane of focus, so the entire scene remains sharp.</li><li> By increasing or decreasing the ISO, you can adjust the level of <a aria-label="noise (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-avoid-and-reduce-noise-in-your-images/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">noise</a> in the image. Noise appears as tiny specks of color and light, and it obscures image detail – so by keeping the ISO low, you can maximize image quality.</li><li> By adjusting the aperture <em>or</em> ISO, you can force the camera to change the shutter speed. A fast shutter speed is essential for capturing action scenes (eg, birds in flight or basketball players on the move), and by widening the aperture and/or raising the ISO, you make the camera boost the shutter speed. A slow shutter speed is essential for capturing beautiful <a aria-label="long-exposure effects (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/step-by-step-guide-to-long-exposure-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">long-exposure effects</a> , and by narrowing the aperture and/or lowering the ISO, you make the camera drop the shutter speed.</li></ol><p> So by adjusting settings in Aperture Priority mode, you can improve image quality, add beautiful depth of field effects, and even create some long-exposure artistry.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-237092" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="waterfall photographed with a slow shutter speed aperture priority mode" class="wp-image-237092" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-1.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-1.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-1.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-1.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-1.jpg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-1.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="the-fourth-variable-exposure-compensation"> The fourth variable: exposure compensation</h2><p> As I emphasized above, Aperture Priority mode tells your camera to set the exposure (by adjusting the shutter speed) while you handle other image variables. And in general, the camera will do a good job and you&#39;ll get nice, detailed exposures.</p><p> But <a aria-label="camera exposure meters (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understand-camera-light-meter-desired-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">camera exposure meters</a> aren&#39;t perfect, and there are times when you should deliberately overexpose or underexpose your images (often when photographing very light scenes and very dark scenes, respectively).</p><p> Now, you <em>cannot</em> adjust the exposure by changing the aperture, ISO, or shutter speed. In Aperture Priority mode, the shutter speed setting is locked – and a change in the aperture and ISO settings will be automatically counteracted by a change in the shutter speed.</p><p> That&#39;s why cameras offer another setting, called <em><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-exposure-compensation-to-take-control-of-your-exposure/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure compensation</a></em> . Exposure compensation is generally represented by plus (+) and minus (-) symbols, and it lets you instruct your camera to increase or decrease the shutter speed for a brighter or darker effect.</p><p> In most cases, you won&#39;t need exposure compensation. But if you find yourself wanting to adjust the exposure, don&#39;t be afraid to use it!</p><h2 data-section id="aperture-priority-mode-vs-shutter-priority-mode"> Aperture Priority mode vs Shutter Priority mode</h2><p> Aperture Priority offers control over the aperture and ISO, while your camera takes care of adjusting the shutter speed. It&#39;s a great tool if you need to control the depth of field in your images.</p><p> Shutter Priority, on the other hand, lets you adjust the shutter speed and ISO. Your camera then selects a corresponding aperture for a proper exposure. This mode is especially useful if you&#39;re dealing with fast-moving subjects.</p><p> Comparing the two, you&#39;ll find that Aperture Priority is generally more popular. Many photographers appreciate the ability to manipulate the appearance of sharpness and blurriness in the background.</p><p> But Shutter Priority has its fans too, especially among those photographing sports or other high-speed activities. The mode allows for precise control of motion so you can capture every exciting detail or even introduce intentional blur.</p><p> However, when you need to control the overall composition with regard to both depth of field and motion, you might find Aperture Priority more appealing. Shutter Priority can be indispensable in some situations, but Aperture Priority often offers greater creative freedom.</p><h2 data-section id="aperture-priority-mode-vs-manual-mode"> Aperture Priority mode vs Manual mode</h2><p> Manual mode takes things a step further by offering <em>complete</em> control over every camera setting, including shutter speed, aperture, and ISO. It&#39;s a powerful way to ensure you get the exact exposure results you desire.</p><p> This complete control comes at the cost of speed, however. Adjusting all these variables manually means that Manual mode is often slower to use. It&#39;s ideal for scenarios where you can work very deliberately, such as landscapes or studio settings.</p><p> Note that, compared to Manual mode, Aperture Priority provides a quick way to adapt to changes in lighting conditions or subject movement. The automatic adjustments your camera makes to the shutter speed can be especially invaluable when time is of the essence.</p><p> In scenarios where the light is changing rapidly or subjects are moving from shadow to sunlight and back, Aperture Priority mode offers the speed needed to capture the moment. Manual mode, while unmatched in control, may not be the best choice in these dynamic situations.</p><p> In the end, your choice between Aperture Priority and Manual mode will likely depend on the specific demands of the scene and your personal preferences as a photographer. Aperture Priority offers speed and some control, while Manual mode provides the opportunity to fine-tune every aspect of your image. Both modes have unique advantages and applications, so understanding their differences will help you select the right tool for your creative vision.</p><h2 data-section id="when-should-you-use-aperture-priority-mode"> When should you use Aperture Priority mode?</h2><p> First of all, Aperture Priority is a great mode to use if you&#39;re a beginner hoping to better understand your camera settings. Because your camera will automatically select the shutter speed, you don&#39;t have to worry about messing up the exposure – but at the same time, you can experiment with different apertures and see how your images change.</p><p> Plus, as you gain in skill, you can start to use the aperture to deliberately adjust the shutter speed and use the exposure compensation function to improve image detail.</p><p> But Aperture Priority mode is <em>also</em> popular among professionals who have already mastered their camera settings. For one, if you don&#39;t need to think about the shutter speed but you <em>do</em> care about the aperture, Aperture Priority will focus your attention on the settings that matter (and let you forget about the less-important shutter speed setting). If you&#39;re conducting a portrait photoshoot in good light, for instance, Aperture Priority will let you adjust the depth of field without distraction.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-237096" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-14.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="man with blurry background" class="wp-image-237096" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-14.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-14.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-14.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-14.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-14.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Additionally, Aperture Priority, unlike <a aria-label="full Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">full Manual mode</a> , helps you react to lighting changes.

Aperture Priority mode allows you to select a reasonably wide aperture, but not <em>so</em> wide that your subjects will only be partially in focus.</p><p> Choosing the right aperture is the first step. You can then check the selected shutter speed and adjust it as needed by raising or lowering the ISO. This method allows for quick adjustments as your subjects move.</p><p> Remember: Wildlife photography often involves unpredictable movements. A bird might suddenly take flight, or an animal might dart from sun to shade.</p><p> In these dynamic scenarios, Aperture Priority helps you maintain focus on the subject while still allowing for adjustments to capture the action. This blend of control and adaptability is why many photographers opt for Aperture Priority when out in the wild!</p><h2 data-section id="aperture-priority-mode-final-words"> Aperture Priority mode: final words</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-237106" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:80.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1204" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-19.jpg?resize=1500%2C1204&#038;ssl=1" alt="camera with mode dial aperture priority mode" class="wp-image-237106" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-19.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-19.jpg?resize=300%2C241&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-19.jpg?resize=600%2C482&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-19.jpg?resize=768%2C616&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aperture-priority-mode-19.jpg?resize=717%2C576&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Aperture Priority is a powerful camera mode, one that&#39;s great for both professionals and beginners.</p><p> So try out Aperture Priority.

Then let&#39;s dive right in, starting with my first tip:</p><h2 data-section id="take-proper-safety-precautions"> 1. Take proper safety precautions</h2><p> First things first:</p><p> Seascape photography can be dangerous. As a seascape photographer, you&#39;ll spend time hiking over slippery and sharp rocks as the tide rises and the waves come closer and closer.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255724" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.2%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="993" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-5.jpg?resize=1500%2C993&#038;ssl=1" alt="Seascape photography" class="wp-image-255724" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-5.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-5.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-5.jpg?resize=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-5.jpg?resize=768%2C508&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-5.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-5.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-5.jpg?resize=717%2C475&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> So always be aware of your surroundings and constantly observe what is happening around you. I&#39;ve been trapped on a rocky outcrop with nothing but a wild sea around me. I&#39;ve also been completely soaked by freak waves, and I&#39;ve almost lost my camera more than once.</p><p> On the other hand, if you take proper precautions, you&#39;ll find that the results of your sea adventures will be well worth it! Wear shoes with plenty of traction, always carry a phone, and keep waterproof bags on hand in case you need to protect your camera. And be mindful of the tide; if it starts to come in, make sure you have a clear exit strategy.</p><p> Finally, shoot with fellow photographers so you can help one other if necessary.</p><h2 data-section id="scout-the-area-and-follow-the-tides"> 2. Scout the area and follow the tides</h2><p> Once you pick a seascape photography location, start with a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/importance-scouting-landscape-photographers/" target="_blank" aria-label="scouting trip (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">scouting trip</a> . Consider possible <a aria-label="foreground elements (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/using-layers-foreground-interest-better-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">foreground elements</a> (such as rocks and sand patterns), look for stunning backgrounds (such as sea stacks), and pay careful attention to water levels.</p><p> Additionally, spend plenty of time researching the tides. Most coastal towns will have a tide table or chart available (you can also simply Google “tide table for [location]”), and I encourage you to study it carefully.</p><p> Now, there is no <em>best</em> tide for seascape photos. The right tide depends on the location, which is why a scouting trip is so critical. As you identify key foregrounds and backgrounds, you&#39;ll need to note the tide – then make sure you plan your photo outing for a time when the essential compositional elements are exposed. (You don&#39;t want to scout at low tide, only to return with your camera at high tide and find that the rock you were planning to photograph is now submerged!)</p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-75766"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-75766" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:56%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="336" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Seascape.jpg?resize=600%2C336&#038;ssl=1" alt="seascape photography" class="wp-image-75766" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Seascape.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Seascape.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> And bear in mind that the tide can affect the water movement and wave size. High tide will often offer lots of wave movement on beaches, but it might restrict water movement in other areas, so pay careful attention and head out when the conditions are right.</p><p> Oh, and always remember to look out for areas where the tide might rise. Little channels and gullies might seem innocuous, but they can be <em>very</em> dangerous at high tide; the water may recede when the tide is out, but as the tide comes in, such areas can become impossible to cross.</p><p> Pro tip: It can be a good idea to chat with local photographers and fishermen when planning a shoot. The locals often possess <em>tons</em> of knowledge you won&#39;t get from tide charts.</p><h2 data-section id="track-the-weather"> 3. Track the weather</h2><p> Do you want soft, serene seascape images? Or intense, dramatic shots with stormy skies? Here, the weather makes a huge difference – so it&#39;s important to plan ahead.</p><p> Unfortunately, the weather in most coastal areas can be pretty unpredictable. A storm can roll in pretty quickly; alternatively, you may find yourself frustrated by clear skies when you were hoping for dark clouds.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255723" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-7.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Seascape photography" class="wp-image-255723" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-7.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-7.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-7.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-7.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seascape-photography-7.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> So be sure to check the weather forecast a few hours before you plan to shoot, and then again right before you head out. I&#39;d also encourage you to frequently watch the skies when you&#39;re shooting. That way, if an unexpected storm whips up, you can be prepared.</p><p> And bear in mind that the weather, and particularly the wind, can make it tough to shoot sharp seascape photos.

That way, I can give the water a soft, silky effect and create images that look somewhat surreal. To get the look I&#39;m after, I generally need a shutter speed of 1/30s or slower, which is easy to achieve when shooting during the blue hour but tougher to get when the sun is still above the horizon. It&#39;s a good idea to carry a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/neutral-density-filters-landscape-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="neutral density filter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">neutral density filter</a> or two; these simply darken down the scene so that you can use a longer shutter speed even in brighter light.</p><p> Pro tip: Try combining a neutral density filter with blue-hour light. You can <em>really</em> drop that shutter speed and create a fantasy-like effect – with misty water and streaky clouds.</p><p> Note that it&#39;s not always possible to perfectly predict the effect of a slow shutter speed on the water. Different water speeds will produce different types of long-exposure blur, so I&#39;d encourage you to experiment as much as possible and take plenty of images!</p><p> If you&#39;re faced with intense wave action, you may wish to freeze the scene instead.
