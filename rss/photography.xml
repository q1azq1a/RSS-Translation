Keep your photos simple</h2><p> When it comes to street portraits, <em>simplicity is your friend</em> . Aim for simple subjects, simple backgrounds, and simple compositions.</p><p> So before pressing the shutter button, carefully observe the scene. Are there unnecessary elements? Is the background simple enough to emphasize the subject? Does the entire shot feel balanced and uncluttered?</p><p> If you <em>do</em> notice unnecessary parts of a composition, try to remove them. Sometimes, this is as simple as moving a few steps to the right or the left. Other times, you may need to get close, move farther away, or get up high.</p><p> Pro tip: One of the quickest ways to ruin a street portrait is by including a busy, complex background. A busy background will make your image look flat, it will swallow up your subject, and it&#39;ll distract the viewer&#39;s eye. Personally, I love backgrounds that are clean, colorful, and strong, like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-109206" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160415_venice_197.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="man walking in front of colorful background" class="wp-image-109206" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160415_venice_197.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160415_venice_197.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160415_venice_197.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160415_venice_197.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160415_venice_197.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The line in the middle nicely balances the subject, plus the strength of the colors and line contrasts nicely with the older man.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-break-the-world-into-elements"> 2. Break the world into elements</h2><p> Composition is a fundamental part of street portrait photography, but it&#39;s often a sticking point for beginners. After all, how do you arrange the elements of a scene for that perfect amount of dynamism and balance?</p><p> My advice? Try to break down the world into elements. Then tell yourself that you&#39;re simply <em>organizing the world in an interesting way</em> .</p><p> See, 3D eyes and brains make things unnecessarily complex, and – as I discussed in the previous tip – the best street portraits tend to be simple. So you need to see the world simply, too.</p><p> You might break down the world into objects (eg, roads, windows, doors, bricks, roofs, people, etc.). Or you might go even further and view the world in terms of geometry (eg, squares, circles, rectangles, and so on). Either can work; the key is to pick a method and stick with it.</p><p> Then build your composition from there. Look for relationships among the different elements. Consider ways they can balance out one another across the frame. Remember: You only need one or two interesting elements to make a photo. If you can identify the right elements, and you can put them together in the right way, you&#39;ll end up with a beautiful image.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-109217" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-6.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="two people standing by a wall street portrait" class="wp-image-109217" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-6.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-6.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-6.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-6.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-6.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-use-a-slow-contemplative-approach"> 3.

You might find yourself rushing in an attempt to prevent tension between yourself and your subject.</p><p> But here&#39;s the problem:</p><p> The best <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/ultimate-guide-street-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="street photography (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">street photography</a> requires <em>contemplation</em> . You need to take a proper look at your subject – especially their eyes, which tell you how the subject is feeling and even thinking.</p><p> So do what you can to <em>relax</em> into the experience. Go slow. If you need to, use your camera as a sort of shield between yourself and your subject; that way, you feel less tension, and you can spend time observing your subject&#39;s face and understanding how they really feel.</p><p> If you&#39;re just starting out, you can ease into this approach. First, simply look through your camera <em>without</em> firing the shutter. Then once you feel comfortable looking, take an image. Over time, you&#39;ll gain confidence, and you&#39;ll be able to see a subject and capture a photo in a single instant.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-109220" style="width:1080px"><span class="space" style="width:1080px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1080" height="720" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20141019__ws_london__785.jpg?resize=1080%2C720&#038;ssl=1" alt="woman on a motorcycle street portrait" class="wp-image-109220" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20141019__ws_london__785.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20141019__ws_london__785.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20141019__ws_london__785.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20141019__ws_london__785.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20141019__ws_london__785.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20141019__ws_london__785.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-look-for-weird-or-humorous-situations"> 4.

It&#39;s one of the simplest ways to get started capturing <em>meaningful</em> street photos – plus, when you&#39;re out shooting, it&#39;ll give you some direction and keep you aware of your surroundings.</p><p> For instance, you might look for people making unusual <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/importance-capturing-gesture-emotion-street-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="gestures (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">gestures</a> or expressions:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-109207" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160416_venice_377.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="woman taking a selfie" class="wp-image-109207" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160416_venice_377.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160416_venice_377.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160416_venice_377.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Or you might capture subjects that offer an interesting juxtaposition with background elements:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-109222" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-23.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="woman with silvery cloak in front of a building" class="wp-image-109222" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-23.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-23.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-23.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Note that your images don&#39;t need to be eye-popping odd or laugh-out-loud funny. Just train yourself to notice interesting or confusing behavior – and as soon as it happens, raise the camera to your eye and take a photo. Some of the shots will work and others won&#39;t. That&#39;s okay! With practice, you&#39;ll refine your style.

Find a great background and wait</h2><p> There is a simple technique among serious street photographers:</p><p> You find an interesting location, such as a colorful background, an eye-catching display, or even a sign. Then you wait for someone to walk in front. If you pick an area with significant foot traffic, the right person <em>will</em> meander on through, and you&#39;ll get your street portrait – one that combines a stunning background and an interesting subject.</p><p> Plus, when you continually gaze at one area for many long minutes, you become very familiar with it. You notice things that you didn&#39;t initially see, and you start to understand what makes the location special. You may even decide to come back a second or third or tenth time – in different conditions, under different <a aria-label="lighting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/bad-light-street-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">lighting</a> , using different compositions.</p><p> Of course, this technique does require patience, which is a very good thing for a street shooter to develop (and something that beginners often lack). If you find yourself struggling to stay in one place for more than a few seconds, remind yourself that a good scene <em>will</em> appear; you just have to be ready when it does!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-109216" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-8.jpg?resize=750%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="man in front of psychedelic background" class="wp-image-109216" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-8.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-8.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-8.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-8.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-8.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-8.jpg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-8.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-make-use-of-color"> 6.

Color allows you to communicate different feelings, and you can use it to <em>move</em> the viewer, just the same as you can move them with light or interesting subjects.</p><p> So as you walk with your camera, look for color. Notice colorful backgrounds, notice the color of subjects&#39; clothing, notice the color of the shopping bags in their hands. And when you find pairs of colors that seem to work well together, take a photo!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-109210" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:65.87%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="494" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-26.jpg?resize=750%2C494&#038;ssl=1" alt="man on roller coaster ride" class="wp-image-109210" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-26.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-26.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-26.jpg?resize=600%2C395&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-26.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-26.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-26.jpg?resize=717%2C472&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> You can also approach color street portraits in a more deliberate way. Colors communicate different feelings (eg, yellow is warm and happy, green is peaceful, red signals confidence or anger).

Don&#39;t be afraid to ask strangers for a photo</h2><p> Photographing people up close can be intimidating. But <em>most people are happy to be photographed!</em> That&#39;s essential to remember when you&#39;re going out and about with your camera.</p><p> It&#39;s especially true if you ask permission first. Simply be confident and friendly. Say, politely, “Would you mind if I take your photo?” Sometimes, you can simply gesture to your camera, and you&#39;ll get a nod or smile in return.</p><p> After all, humans are built to connect with other humans, and photography is a powerful form of connection. When you take someone&#39;s photo, you are basically saying, “I see you! You matter.” And for most people, that&#39;s a wonderful compliment.</p><p> But be ethical in your approach. Don&#39;t photograph kids or the obviously vulnerable, and if someone doesn&#39;t wish to be photographed, simply walk away. Photography is an exchange, and if you photograph someone, it should be with respect.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-109208" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20150718_ws_london_014.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="group street portrait four people together" class="wp-image-109208" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20150718_ws_london_014.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20150718_ws_london_014.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20150718_ws_london_014.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20150718_ws_london_014.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20150718_ws_london_014.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-pay-attention-to-gestures"> 8. Pay attention to gestures</h2><p> The more closely you watch humans, the more they reveal themselves through gestures. And it&#39;s in that moment – when a gesture occurs and conveys something meaningful – that you can capture an interesting portrait.</p><p> Note that gestures simply refer to movements of the body. So a person can create powerful gestures with their hands, but also their eyes, their legs, their fingers, or even their feet.</p><p> When it comes to capturing gestures, you should pay careful attention to <em>timing</em> . A millisecond can be the difference between a stunning shot of an evocative gesture or a boring, flat shot with nothing at all – so practice hitting the shutter button at the exact right moment. (You might also consider using your camera&#39;s <a aria-label="continuous shooting mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/burst-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">continuous shooting mode</a> , especially when starting out.)</p><p> I took the image below for a project on stomachs. Each photo from the project was totally different; the way that a person presented their stomach and the gestures they made conveyed so much about their personality and about how they feel about themselves.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-109223" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/zen_bellies-17.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="man showing off stomach" class="wp-image-109223" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/zen_bellies-17.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/zen_bellies-17.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/zen_bellies-17.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/zen_bellies-17.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/zen_bellies-17.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-be-yourself"> 9. Be yourself</h2><p> When I lead workshops, I&#39;m often confronted with concerns about originality. My students worry about how over-photographed the world seems. They worry they won&#39;t have anything interesting to contribute and that it&#39;s all been done before.</p><p> <em>That&#39;s the wrong way to think about street portrait photography</em> .</p><p> Of course the world is heavily photographed, and it has been for years. But the world isn&#39;t static. It&#39;s an ever-changing, ever-moving organism. Nothing stays the same, so the possibilities for original and interesting photos are literally infinite.</p><p> Plus, while the world itself might be frequently photographed, individuals are not. Of how many street portraits have <em>you</em> been the subject? The answer is “not many,” right? My point is that, by finding individuals to photograph, you&#39;re creating new and interesting photos.</p><p> More importantly, though, photography is an expression of who <em>you</em> are. You might start out by capturing unoriginal photos. But the more you fire that camera, the more you&#39;ll create images that are a total expression of you: your passions, your experience, and your way of seeing the world. And <em>that</em> is enough to create the unique and interesting photographs you&#39;re aiming for.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-109211" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="501" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-4.jpg?resize=750%2C501&#038;ssl=1" alt="man standing by tram line street portrait photography" class="wp-image-109211" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-4.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-4.jpg?resize=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-4.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/street-portrait-tips-4.jpg?resize=717%2C479&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="street-portrait-photography-final-words"> Street portrait photography: final words</h2><p> Street portraits might seem difficult to create, but they&#39;re not as tough as you might think.

Confidently direct your model</h2><p> If you want great fashion photos, you must be prepared to confidently and self-assuredly direct your model.</p><p> Models reflect the direction they&#39;re given, so if you show signs of anxiety or stress – or you give them a lack of direction – this will inevitably come through in the final photos.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236081" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-5.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="fashion photography tips and techniques" class="wp-image-236081" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-5.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-5.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-5.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-5.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-5.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Instead, act confident and personable. At the beginning of the shoot, communicate your agenda. Then, as you work, talk to your subject. Explain what you want to see, and offer plenty of praise when you get the shot you&#39;re after (and even when you don&#39;t!).</p><p> If you&#39;re feeling anxious about the shoot and you&#39;re worried you won&#39;t be able to offer confident direction, then it can help to spend extra time getting prepared. In fact, if you&#39;re nervous, then over-preparedness can be a good thing! Organize a shot list, and mentally rehearse technique and composition for each image. Prepare the location, props, and clothes ahead of time. That way, you&#39;re free to focus on your model during the actual shoot.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236091" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-7.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="fashion photography tips and techniques" class="wp-image-236091" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-7.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-7.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-7.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-7.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-7.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="determine-an-overall-theme"> 2. Determine an overall theme</h2><p> The best fashion photography isn&#39;t just about photographing a fashionably dressed model; instead, it&#39;s about conveying an overall <em>look</em> and a specific <em>mood</em> .</p><p> So before you start shooting, identify the particular effect that you&#39;re after, whether it&#39;s dark and dramatic, bright and airy, or even a specific narrative or concept. Then make sure that <em>everything</em> about the model, the scene, and your photographic approach reflects this.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236083" style="width:511px"><span class="space" style="width:511px; padding-top:117.42%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="511" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=511%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="fashion photography tips and techniques" class="wp-image-236083" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=511%2C600&amp;ssl=1 511w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=256%2C300&amp;ssl=1 256w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=768%2C901&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=717%2C842&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-4.jpg?w=1278&amp;ssl=1 1278w" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Use makeup and hair styling to complement the clothes and the model. If you want a provocative or seductive look, opt for dark, heavy makeup and over-styled hair; if you want an innocent or natural look, choose subdued pastel tones, gentle makeup, and soft, flowing hairstyles.</p><p> You should also light the scene accordingly. Sidelight produces dramatic, moody, three-dimensional images, while <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/front-light-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="frontlight (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">frontlight</a> is eye-catching and energetic but has a flattening effect.</p><p> And you can bring in specific props to add that perfect final touch. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="inspire-yourself-with-sample-poses"> 3.

You can also browse through the portfolios of top fashion photographers, look on Instagram, etc.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236085" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="fashion photography tips and techniques" class="wp-image-236085" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-6.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> As you collect poses, add them to a file on your phone. Then look at them frequently – whenever you get the chance. Study them. For each shot, ask yourself: What makes this pose work? What do I like about it? What would I improve?</p><p> You&#39;ll soon have a mental repository of poses you can draw on during your photoshoots. And if you forget the details of a pose or you&#39;re in need of inspiration during a session, feel free to pull out your phone and swipe through a few collection items!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="work-in-a-studio"> 4. Work in a studio</h2><p> Yes, it&#39;s possible to do outdoor fashion photography shoots. But studios are <em>so much easier</em> to work in because you can easily control the lighting and stabilize the conditions – so unless you&#39;re extremely confident in your skills, a studio is the place to be.</p><p> Prepare the studio ahead of time with the backdrops, props, plenty of space, lights, and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/a-beginners-guide-to-light-modifiers/" target="_blank" aria-label="modifiers (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">modifiers</a> that you anticipate needing.

You might even take a few test shots before your model arrives just to make sure everything is working properly.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236087" style="width:399px"><span class="space" style="width:399px; padding-top:150.38%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="399" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-8-1.jpg?resize=399%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="fashion photography tips and techniques" class="wp-image-236087" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-8-1.jpg?resize=399%2C600&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-8-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-8-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1154&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-8-1.jpg?resize=717%2C1078&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-8-1.jpg?w=998&amp;ssl=1 998w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> While you can rent professional studio space, this isn&#39;t always necessary, especially if you&#39;re just starting out. Instead, create a home studio space – basements are great for this! – and furnish it with a backdrop stand and your lighting kit.</p><p> Professionals tend to use studio strobes, but these can get pretty expensive. Speedlights are a good substitute, and if you&#39;re strapped for cash, you can even create a basic studio setup <em>without</em> any fancy artificial lights; just work in a room with a large window, then hang a white sheet across it. On a bright, sunny day, you&#39;ll have yourself a homemade <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/softbox/" target="_blank" aria-label="softbox (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">softbox</a> , which will produce flattering, even light! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="carefully-light-your-model"> 5. Carefully light your model</h2><p> Lighting is a huge part of fashion photography, and as you practice, you&#39;ll develop both an eye for light <em>and</em> your overall lighting kit.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236077" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-9.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="fashion photography tips and techniques" class="wp-image-236077" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-9.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-9.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-9.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-9.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-9.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> For each new photoshoot, I&#39;d recommend starting with a single light. This should be your main light, or key light, and you should angle it to create the effect you&#39;re after (here, the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-portrait-lighting-patterns-every-photographer-should-know/" target="_blank" aria-label="standard portrait photography lighting patterns (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">standard portrait photography lighting patterns</a> can be helpful!). Don&#39;t be afraid to experiment with different positions and angles until you find one you like.</p><p> Then, once you have your key light in position, go ahead and <em>build</em> the rest of your setup. Take a few test shots, then identify areas that are shadow-heavy and require fill. Move additional lights or reflectors into position, then continue to take test shots so you can gauge the effect.</p><p> Pretty soon, you&#39;ll end up with a result that you like. And pro tip: After each session, draw lighting diagrams to help you remember the setups that worked. That way, you can use them again at your next shoot! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-props-including-a-mirror"> 6. Use props (including a mirror)</h2><p> Props are a great way to create a narrative within a fashion shot, and I highly recommend them. It helps to acquire plenty of props ahead of time, and then – after you identify your shoot theme – you can pick out the props that seem to work best.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236089" style="width:399px"><span class="space" style="width:399px; padding-top:150.38%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="399" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-1.jpg?resize=399%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="fashion photography tips and techniques" class="wp-image-236089" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-1.jpg?resize=399%2C600&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1154&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-1.jpg?resize=717%2C1078&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-1.jpg?w=998&amp;ssl=1 998w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Of course, don&#39;t <em>overdo</em> it. Props should complement the model, but they shouldn&#39;t draw the eye away from the main areas of interest.</p><p> One of my favorite props is the humble mirror, which every fashion photographer should keep on hand. A mirror can tell a story, plus it is an effective way to display the front and back of your model.</p><p> To get the mirror exposure right, you may need to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/bracketing-what-is-it-and-what-to-do-with-the-images/" target="_blank" aria-label="bracket your images (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">bracket your images</a> . You&#39;ll also need to be careful when positioning yourself and your lighting equipment; you don&#39;t want a lighting stand, your computer, or a strobe to be reflected in the final image! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="pick-a-background-to-match-your-theme"> 7. Pick a background to match your theme</h2><p> Beginners often forget to think about the background, but this is a mistake. A <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-types-portrait-backgrounds-creative-images/" target="_blank" aria-label="good background (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">good background</a> can complement the main subject and unify the image, while a bad background will distract the viewer and may feel out of place.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236075" style="width:434px"><span class="space" style="width:434px; padding-top:138.25%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="434" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-10.jpg?resize=434%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="fashion photography tips and techniques" class="wp-image-236075" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-10.jpg?resize=434%2C600&amp;ssl=1 434w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-10.jpg?resize=217%2C300&amp;ssl=1 217w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-10.jpg?resize=768%2C1063&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-10.jpg?resize=717%2C992&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-10.jpg?w=1084&amp;ssl=1 1084w" sizes="(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you&#39;re working in a studio, you can purchase backdrops and hang them behind your model. Solid colors are a good starting point, but as you get more serious, you may want to invest in some quality hand-painted backdrops. (If you&#39;re very artsy, you might try painting them yourself!)</p><p> And if you&#39;re shooting outdoors, make sure you choose your location carefully. If the clothing and styling are edgy, hard, or provocative, an urban setting – with a worn brick wall in the background – will work well. On the other hand, if you want a spring or summer look, you might work in a field, a meadow, a beach, a woodland, or on a river bank. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="experiment-with-different-angles"> 8. Experiment with different angles</h2><p> Your vantage point can make or break a fashion image.</p><p> So when you&#39;re working with your model, be sure to shoot from plenty of different angles.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-236073" style="width:401px"><span class="space" style="width:401px; padding-top:149.63%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="401" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=401%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="fashion photography tips and techniques" class="wp-image-236073" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=401%2C600&amp;ssl=1 401w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1150&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-2.jpg?resize=717%2C1073&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fashion-photography-tips-2.jpg?w=1002&amp;ssl=1 1002w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Try getting up high (here, stairs or even a ladder can be helpful!), crouching down low, getting on the ground, moving around the model, and so on. Make sure you always keep your overall theme in mind and consider how different vantage points affect the look of the image.</p><p> Also, once you find an angle you like, spend some time <em>working</em> it. Try a few different compositional variations, move slightly from side to side, take a step forward or back, and so on. That way, you&#39;re guaranteed to get the best possible shot.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="bring-an-assistant"> 9. Bring an assistant</h2><p> Fashion photography can be done on your own…</p><p> …but if you want to <em>really</em> kick your work up a notch, then bring along an assistant to each photoshoot. That way, you have an extra pair of hands to position reflectors, angle and reset lighting equipment, tweak the positions of garments, and clear the scene.</p><p> You can always hire someone, but I&#39;d recommend roping in a friend or family member. Photography students may also be willing to help you out, especially if you&#39;re willing to provide some mentoring.</p><p> Note that you don&#39;t need someone with experience.

In other words, the light travels over the photographer&#39;s shoulder and impacts the subject head-on.</p><p> Because front lighting hits objects directly, front-lit photos tend to feature limited shadows and eye-catching, in-your-face subjects. Here&#39;s an example front-lit image; pay attention to how the front of the hook is bright and lacks shadows: </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-232477" style="width:1024px"><span class="space" style="width:1024px; padding-top:66.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&#038;ssl=1" alt="crane hook front light photography" class="wp-image-232477" style="width:1024px;height:681px" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?resize=1536%2C1022&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?resize=2048%2C1363&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/crane-hook.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> <a href="https://geni.us/NikonD800" target="_blank" aria-label="Nikon D800 (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Nikon D800</a> | 105mm | f/8 | 1/100s | ISO 200</figcaption></figure></div><p> Note, however, that front lighting can come from high above the subject, far below the subject, or on a level with the subject.

Use open shade for front-lit portraits</h3><p> As I explained in the previous section, front lighting is great for portrait photography. However, you need to be careful when doing front-lit portraits; unless you&#39;re working on an overcast day or late in the afternoon, a bright sun will produce all sorts of unpleasant shadows. It&#39;ll also cause your subject to squint.</p><p> My recommendation? Maintain the front-lit direction, but move your subject into open shade. Position your subject <em>near</em> the edge of the shade, but don&#39;t let them step over the shadow line; that way, their face will be softly illuminated and they won&#39;t need to squint, but you&#39;ll have plenty of bright light to work with.</p><p> By the way, you should also pay attention to reflective objects. Light can reflect off the ground, nearby cars, or building walls, and by positioning your subject near these reflective light sources, you can get beautiful effects.</p><p> Finally, if you&#39;re stuck shooting with <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/photography-in-harsh-mid-day-light/" target="_blank" aria-label="harsh midday light (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">harsh midday light</a> and you cannot move your subject into a shaded area, I encourage you to bring in some artificial lighting.

Trust your camera&#39;s exposure recommendations</h3><p> As I emphasized above, front lighting is very <em>even</em> – which means that, when you point your camera at a front-lit subject, you&#39;ll generally get a good exposure reading.</p><p> Of course, your camera can still make mistakes, especially when you&#39;re shooting very light or very dark subjects.

Don&#39;t be afraid to turn your subject</h3><p> Front lighting can produce flat images.</p><p> And while flat shots <em>can</em> look interesting, many types of photography thrive off of three-dimensionality and depth.</p><p> Fortunately, there&#39;s an easy solution:</p><p> If your shot is looking a little flat, then just <em>turn your subject</em> . This works great for portraits, and it&#39;s also a good trick for shooting products and certain still-life subjects.</p><p> Of course, you don&#39;t want to turn your subject <em>too</em> dramatically, but go for a subtle turn and see what you think. If you&#39;re working with a portrait subject, ask them to turn slowly, and carefully watch how the light and shadows affect their face. (You may only need a <em>slight</em> turn to create a more three-dimensional photo!)</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="height-of-light"> 4. Pay attention to the light height</h3><p> The height of the light source will dramatically affect your photos, so whenever you&#39;re doing front light photography, you <em>must</em> pay careful attention to the light&#39;s position!</p><p> Note that this is true for natural light <em>and</em> artificial light – though you do have more control over a flash or LED panel. If the sun is positioned too high or too low, you&#39;ll often need to wait a few hours or come back another day, but if you don&#39;t like the height of your off-camera flash, you can simply raise or lower the light stand. Make sense?</p><p> So when you&#39;re using a flash or continuous light, experiment constantly with the light height. And as you work, watch how the light position affects shadows and creates different effects.</p><p> You&#39;ll also need to watch out for unpleasant reflections. When shooting shiny subjects, for instance, a light positioned on a level with the subject will reflect right back into the camera lens, producing a distracting highlight. To avoid these reflections, try moving the light higher, lower, or (slightly) to the side.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-232475" style="width:2500px"><span class="space" style="width:2500px; padding-top:66.56%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2500" height="1664" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/teen-girl.jpg?resize=2500%2C1664&#038;ssl=1" alt="teen girl dressed as the mad hatter front light photography" class="wp-image-232475" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/teen-girl.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/teen-girl.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/teen-girl.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/teen-girl.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/teen-girl.jpg?resize=1536%2C1022&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/teen-girl.jpg?resize=2048%2C1363&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/teen-girl.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/teen-girl.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Nikon D800 | 105mm | f/16 | 1/200s | ISO 200 </figcaption></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="make-the-best-use-of-front-light-during-golden-hour"> 5.

Here&#39;s a quick rundown of some of the technical things you should become familiar with:</p><ul><li> <strong>Understanding the basics:</strong> Get comfortable with your camera and learn about the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/mastering-the-exposure-triangle-for-newbies/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure triangle (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure triangle</a> . In other words, learn how exposure works and know what your setup&#39;s ISO, aperture, and shutter speed do.</li><li> <strong>Composition:</strong> Techniques like the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/" target="_blank" aria-label="rule of thirds (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">rule of thirds</a> and s-curves aren&#39;t just buzzwords; they can make or break a portrait.</li><li> <strong>Lighting and flash photography:</strong> Whether you&#39;re a fan of natural light or prefer the controlled environment of a studio, understanding lighting is non-negotiable. And don&#39;t underestimate the power of flash photography; it can be a game-changer. (I offer several popular resources on lighting, including my course, <a href="https://geni.us/flashphotographycourse" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Flash Photography for Portraits</a> .)</li></ul><ul><li> <strong>Post-processing:</strong> Lightroom and Photoshop are your friends, not foes. You don&#39;t have to be an expert at <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/11-steps-basic-portrait-editing-lightroom-beginners-guide/" target="_blank" aria-label="portrait editing and retouching (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">portrait editing and retouching</a> , but a basic understanding will go a long way.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-art-of-seeing">The art of seeing</h2><p> Developing an eye for what makes a compelling portrait is one of the differences between a snap-shooter and a pro. Here&#39;s how you can cultivate that:</p><ul><li> <strong>Study the masters:</strong> Take some time to analyze the work of great portrait photographers. This can be an education in itself. Check out books or look up their work online. I would focus not only on contemporary artists but also on the work of portraitists from the late 1800s through the 1970s.</li><li> <strong>Practice constantly:</strong> The more you shoot, the better you get. It&#39;s that simple. Over time, you&#39;ll develop a relationship with the art of portraiture that reveals your own unique style.</li></ul><ul><li> <strong>Stay updated but be yourself:</strong> Trends come and go, but your style is your own. Don&#39;t lose it while trying to be someone you&#39;re not. </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="soft-skills-portrait-photography-is-about-people"> Soft skills: portrait photography is about people</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-257494" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/become-portrait-photographer-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to Become a Professional Portrait Photographer (+ Course)" class="wp-image-257494" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/become-portrait-photographer-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/become-portrait-photographer-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/become-portrait-photographer-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/become-portrait-photographer-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/become-portrait-photographer-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/become-portrait-photographer-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Capturing a portrait is more than just clicking the shutter; it&#39;s about creating a connection with the person in front of your lens. I&#39;ve had many sessions that started off with the typical looks, body language, and expressions – elements that would probably fail to make any real connection with the viewer.</p><p> However, given a little time, my clients become so comfortable and have so much fun with the portraiture <em>process</em> that their personalities start to shine through. Authenticity, open communication, and a touch of empathy can go a long way in making your subject feel at ease.</p><ul><li> <strong>Building trust:</strong> The comfort level between you and your subject will be obvious in the final image. Build that trust, and it will naturally reflect in your portraits.</li><li> <strong>Guidance and posing:</strong> You don&#39;t have to be an <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-pose-and-angle-the-body-for-better-portraits/" target="_blank" aria-label="expert in posing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">expert in posing</a> to get a good shot. A few well-practiced, natural poses can make all the difference. Guide your subjects in these poses, and you&#39;ll find the results to be more organic and flattering.</li><li> <strong>Adaptability:</strong> In the world of portrait photography, not everything goes as planned. Being prepared to pivot and tackle unforeseen challenges is just part of the job. This also reassures your subject that they&#39;re in good, competent hands, as you&#39;ll be able to create compelling portraits even when conditions are less than favorable. </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="marketing-and-career-growth-the-other-side-of-the-lens"> Marketing and career growth: the other side of the lens</h2><p> Turning a hobby into a full-time career involves more than just technical skills and an artistic eye; it requires a knack for business. Believe it or not, the business side of photography can be just as creative and fulfilling as the art itself. There&#39;s a lot to learn about going pro and building a thriving portrait business!</p><p> Here are some things that you&#39;ll want to get a handle on:</p><ul><li> <strong>How to curate a portfolio:</strong> Your portfolio is your visual resume. Make it compelling, and you&#39;ll draw in the right types of clients.</li><li> <strong>Networking and collaboration:</strong> The power of a strong network can&#39;t be overstated. Create connections with fellow photographers and potential clients. You never know when a collaboration could lead to your next big opportunity.</li><li> <strong>Pricing and packages:</strong> Know your market and tailor your packages accordingly. Offering value is key to attracting and retaining clients.</li></ul><ul><li> <strong>Client relationship management:</strong> A happy client is not just a repeat customer but also a walking advertisement for your services. Listen to their feedback and aim for excellence in every project you take on.</li><li> <strong>How to master the art of selling:</strong> Let&#39;s face it, many of us aren&#39;t born salespeople.

Not only are butterflies unpredictable, but they&#39;re both very small and surprisingly fast – so without certain tricks and techniques, you&#39;re liable to come home with memory cards full of failures.</p><p> But don&#39;t worry! In this guide, I delve into the world of butterfly photography and reveal the secrets that will help you create stunning images. From selecting the right gear to employing creative approaches, I equip you with the tools and knowledge you need to become a butterfly photo master, no matter your prior experience.</p><p> So if you&#39;re ready to start capturing tack-sharp shots that showcase the world&#39;s most beautiful insects, let&#39;s get started! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-macro-or-telephoto-lens-for-the-best-results"> 1.

You want to let your gear do the heavy lifting, so here&#39;s what you need to know:</p><p> To capture intricate details and fill the frame with your fluttering subject, opt for a telephoto or long <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lenses-for-macro-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="macro lens (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">macro lens</a> . These lenses have the reach and magnification power to get you up close and personal with the butterflies.</p><p> If you have access to it, a telephoto lens in the range of 200-500mm can do a good job. However, pay attention to the lens&#39;s minimum focusing distance when making your selection. Some telephoto lenses excel at zooming in from a distance but struggle to focus on objects up close. Given the small size of butterflies, this is an essential factor to consider.</p><p> For exceptional results, a dedicated telephoto macro lens, such as a 150mm or 180mm lens, is hard to beat. These lenses are known for their outstanding sharpness. However, even with a 180mm lens, you&#39;ll still need to exercise patience and get fairly close to the butterflies to fill the frame effectively. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-tripod-but-keep-the-head-loose"> 2.

This means that you often won&#39;t have the luxury of time to set up your equipment and lock your tripod in place. However, using a tripod can still offer stability, minimizing the risk of camera shake and resulting in sharper images.</p><p> My suggestion? Bring a tripod along, but keep the head loose. This way, you can swiftly move your camera to follow the butterflies while still enjoying the benefits of added stability. It will also save your arms from fatigue while you wait for your subject to strike the perfect pose.</p><p> If a tripod feels too cumbersome or restrictive for your shooting style, consider a solid alternative: a monopod. Unlike tripods, monopods have just one leg, making them easy to maneuver and adjust as you track butterflies in motion. They are also lighter and more convenient to pack, which is a definite plus when you&#39;re out in the field.</p><p> Finally, some butterfly photographers prefer the freedom and flexibility of shooting handheld. If you opt for this approach, make sure your lens or camera has image stabilization to help counteract camera shake and work on your handholding technique. Remember to keep those elbows tucked in and consider bending your knees or even kneeling on the ground for added support! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="find-a-location-with-the-right-plants"> 3.

Not just any garden will do. You&#39;ll want to look for spots with flowering plants that are specifically known to attract these beautiful insects. The butterfly bush is a popular choice. You might even find a location in a park, zoo, or arboretum that has a designated flower garden for this very purpose.</p><p> When you&#39;re in a space that attracts butterflies, you&#39;re basically setting yourself up in a target-rich environment. The more butterflies there are, the more opportunities you&#39;ll have to get that perfect shot. And believe me, in butterfly photography, you can never have too many subjects to choose from!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="wait-for-colder-weather">4.

One secret to success lies in taking advantage of colder weather conditions. Butterflies tend to take it easy when it&#39;s chilly outside. They become less inclined to flutter about (even if they spot an enthusiastic photographer wielding a big lens!).</p><p> So to maximize your chances of getting those perfect shots, it&#39;s best to schedule your butterfly photography outings for days when the weather turns cold. Alternatively, you can aim for early morning sessions, as discussed later on in this article. Just after sunrise, you&#39;ll find the butterflies in a more relaxed state, and it&#39;ll give you ample opportunity to capture their delicate beauty.</p><p> Of course, don&#39;t forget to bundle up appropriately! Just as the butterflies may feel the chill, you don&#39;t want to freeze in pursuit of that perfect shot. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="position-your-camera-so-its-parallel-to-the-butterflys-wings"> 5.

Whether you choose to get up close or use a long lens, I often recommend positioning your camera so its sensor is parallel to the butterfly&#39;s wings.</p><p> Why is this important? Well, when you&#39;re shooting butterflies, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> becomes extremely limited, even with a narrow <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture setting (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture setting</a> . To keep the entire butterfly sharp – from wingtip to wingtip – it&#39;s essential to ensure that your camera&#39;s sensor is perfectly aligned with the wings of your subject. In other words, aim to photograph the butterfly in profile, especially for those ultra-close shots.</p><p> By positioning yourself correctly and aligning the sensor with the butterfly&#39;s wings, you increase the chances of capturing the entire butterfly in focus, wings and all. This technique will enhance the overall sharpness and detail of your photographs, and the results will speak for themselves.</p><p> However, if you&#39;re unable to capture a shot with the butterfly perfectly in profile, don&#39;t worry too much! Do what you can to increase the depth of field, and even if you can&#39;t get the wings completely sharp, at least make sure that the butterfly&#39;s body remains in focus. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="wait-until-the-butterfly-is-frontlit-by-the-sun"> 6. Wait until the butterfly is frontlit by the sun</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254702" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:56.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="844" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/butterfly-photography-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C844&#038;ssl=1" alt="Butterfly photography tips" class="wp-image-254702" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/butterfly-photography-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/butterfly-photography-1.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/butterfly-photography-1.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/butterfly-photography-1.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/butterfly-photography-1.jpg?resize=717%2C403&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Capturing stunning butterfly photographs requires paying attention to the lighting conditions. While you can experiment with different lighting directions, my experience has shown that the best results come when the butterfly is <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/front-light-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="frontlit by the sun (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">frontlit by the sun</a> . Here&#39;s why:</p><p> When the sun is positioned behind you, casting its warm rays over your shoulder, it creates beautiful illumination on the butterfly. This lighting setup brings out the intricate details and vibrant colors of the butterfly&#39;s wings, making your photos shine (no pun intended!).</p><p> While you may be tempted to shoot in backlight or sidelight, they can present challenges. Backlighting often leads to flare effects and makes it difficult to capture the butterfly&#39;s features clearly. Sidelighting, on the other hand, can create shadows that obscure the butterfly&#39;s delicate patterns.</p><p> To maximize your chances of getting that perfect frontlit shot, choose a good position in advance. Observe the butterfly and anticipate its movements. Wait patiently until it moves to a position where the sun is shining directly on it. Remember, butterflies won&#39;t pose on command, so a little patience goes a long way.</p><p> By the way, you might be wondering about the ideal time for butterfly photography. Most photographers prefer the <a aria-label="golden hours (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-photograph-golden-hour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">golden hours</a> , which occur early in the morning or late in the afternoon. During this time, the sunlight has a warm, golden quality that adds a magical touch to your images. However, even on cloudy days, you can still capture stunning butterfly photos. Just keep in mind that the light might be more limited, making it a bit challenging to achieve sharp shots. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="capture-both-narrow-and-wide-compositions"> 7. Capture both narrow and wide compositions</h2><p> Many people instinctively zoom in to capture the intricate details of a butterfly&#39;s wings. That&#39;s a great approach, but don&#39;t forget the beauty of a wider shot. Consider this butterfly image, which uses a close-focusing approach:</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-104754" style="width:717px"><span class="space" style="width:717px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="717" height="478" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/how-to-photograph-butterflies7.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#038;ssl=1" alt="how-to-photograph-butterflies7" class="wp-image-104754" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/how-to-photograph-butterflies7.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/how-to-photograph-butterflies7.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/how-to-photograph-butterflies7.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/how-to-photograph-butterflies7.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/how-to-photograph-butterflies7.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by Vickie Lewis</figcaption></figure></div><p> Then look at this next shot of the same butterfly, which features slightly wider framing:</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-104750" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/how-to-photograph-butterflies3.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="how-to-photograph-butterflies3" class="wp-image-104750" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/how-to-photograph-butterflies3.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/how-to-photograph-butterflies3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/how-to-photograph-butterflies3.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/how-to-photograph-butterflies3.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/how-to-photograph-butterflies3.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by Vickie Lewis</figcaption></figure></div><p> The second shot tells more of a story; after all, it shows the butterfly in the context of its vibrant environment.</p><p> Each of these composition types offers something different. The close-up emphasizes delicate beauty, while the wider composition shows the butterfly as part of a larger world. It shares the beauty of the flowers and foliage that surround it. Both types of shots can be compelling in their own way.</p><p> The choice between narrow and wide compositions isn&#39;t an either-or decision. By taking both, you&#39;ll tell a more complete story of your fluttery subject. And who knows? When you look back at your photos, you might find that you like the wider shots just as much as the close-ups, if not more. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-different-angles-and-frames"> 8.

Sure, this showcases the vibrant patterns and colors of their wings, but it&#39;s also a very <em>human</em> perspective. For a more compelling image, get down to eye level with your butterfly subject.</p><p> There&#39;s just something incredibly intimate about locking eyes with a butterfly. It helps convey that a butterfly isn&#39;t just a colorful set of wings; it&#39;s a living, breathing creature with a unique personality.</p><p> Don&#39;t be afraid to get creative, either. You&#39;re not stuck with only one angle or composition! Once you&#39;ve captured an initial shot, if the butterfly is sticking around, try out less common vantage points.</p><p> Finally, use the butterfly&#39;s natural environment to frame your composition. A butterfly perched on a uniquely shaped flower can add an extra layer of intrigue. Or imagine a butterfly with its wings fully expanded, framed by a loop of a twisting vine or a colorful leaf. That&#39;s a photo people will remember! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-fast-shutter-speed"> 9.

To capture a sharp and clear shot – which is definitely the goal! – using a fast <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> is crucial.</p><p> The ideal shutter speed will depend on factors such as your lens focal length, the distance to the butterfly, and whether the butterfly is in motion. However, as a general guideline, aim to keep your shutter speed above 1/250s, or even faster if possible.</p><p> If you&#39;re <a aria-label="shooting in Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shooting in Manual mode</a> , you have the freedom to dial in your desired shutter speed. Pair it with a somewhat narrow aperture setting like f/8, and then adjust the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> until you achieve a well-exposed shot. Personally, I often shoot at ISO 400 to maintain a balanced exposure while keeping my images sharp.</p><p> By using a fast shutter speed, you freeze the motion of the butterfly, ensuring that every intricate detail is captured without any blurriness. This way, you can showcase the delicate patterns on the wings and the beauty of these enchanting creatures. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-your-cameras-continuous-shooting-mode"> 10.

To increase your chances of capturing fleeting and dynamic moments, I highly recommend activating the <a aria-label="continuous shooting mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/burst-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">continuous shooting mode</a> on your camera.</p><p> This setting allows you to use the “spray and pray” approach, where you hold down the shutter button to capture a burst of rapid-fire shots, thus increasing the likelihood of capturing that perfect moment in focus.</p><p> To make the most of continuous shooting mode, start by ensuring that your camera has a relatively fast continuous shooting rate (preferably above 6 frames per second). Then make sure the continuous shooting mode is active and be ready to take advantage of any butterfly activity.</p><p> Before the butterflies arrive, focus on a flower or a specific area where they frequently land. This way, when you spot a butterfly approaching, you can simply hold down the shutter button and let the camera photograph away. While it&#39;s impossible to guarantee perfect results, the approach certainly increases your chances of capturing that split-second moment when the butterfly is perfectly positioned or in mid-flight.</p><p> When reviewing your shots at home, keep in mind that continuous shooting will generate a large number of images, including quite a few that are out of focus or less than ideal. But don&#39;t be discouraged! Remember that even professional photographers sift through numerous frames to find the gems. Take your time to carefully examine the series of shots. Select the ones that work and discard the rest! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="when-working-up-close-use-manual-focus"> 11.

That&#39;s where manual focus comes into play.</p><p> You might wonder: how do you focus manually on a creature as small and mobile as a butterfly? Don&#39;t worry; I have a trick for you. Pre-focus your camera on a flower, ideally one that butterflies frequent. When a butterfly lands there, you&#39;ll only need to make small adjustments to get your shot.</p><p> Of course, such a method isn&#39;t foolproof. But it does give you a head start in capturing a sharp, detailed image. Even then, don&#39;t settle for just one or two shots.

Approaching them directly may startle them and send them fluttering away. But don&#39;t worry, there&#39;s a strategy I like to use, and it&#39;s all about waiting patiently and letting the butterflies come to you.</p><p> Find a patch of flowers where these graceful creatures frequently land. Position yourself comfortably, and then settle in for some waiting time. (Yes, patience is key in butterfly photography!)</p><p> You&#39;ll notice that while butterflies may be wary of your approach, they often feel more at ease landing on flowers right next to you if you&#39;re already sitting there. So, be prepared to wait. It may take 15 to 20 minutes or even longer for a butterfly to make an appearance.</p><p> While you&#39;re waiting, take the opportunity to fine-tune your camera settings and prefocus on the area where the butterflies are likely to land. But remember, avoid any sudden movements. The goal is to blend into their surroundings and make the butterflies forget about your presence so they can go about their delicate business undisturbed. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="be-mindful-of-casting-shadows-on-butterflies"> 13.

Butterflies, like most critters, respond to sudden changes in the light – so if you cast a shadow over them, they&#39;re likely to flutter away. This is especially important to remember when shooting on sunny mornings and afternoons, as the low angle of the sun can easily create long shadows.</p><p> To minimize the risk of casting a shadow on your subject, try positioning yourself at a lower angle. By getting down closer to the ground, you can reduce the chances of your own shadow obstructing the butterfly&#39;s delicate presence. Not only does this technique decrease the likelihood of disturbing the butterfly, but it also grants you a more intimate perspective, and the resulting photos will immerse the viewer in the tiny world of these beautiful creatures. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shoot-in-the-morning-for-the-best-butterfly-photos"> 14. Shoot in the morning for the best butterfly photos</h2><p> If you want to capture breathtaking butterfly photos, the morning is your secret weapon.为什么？ Well, as I explained above, when the air is cool and crisp, butterflies tend to be more relaxed and less active. This means they&#39;re more likely to stay perched on plants and flowers, giving you the opportunity to get up close and personal.</p><p> But it&#39;s not just about the butterflies being more cooperative. Shooting in the morning also gives you some of the most enchanting light nature has to offer. The golden hour casts warm, gentle rays on your subjects, creating a magical glow that adds a touch of ethereal beauty to your shots.</p><p> So set your alarm early and head out to your favorite butterfly spot at the crack of dawn.

Unfortunately, however, a cluttered or distracting background can diminish the impact of even the best photos. So to make your butterfly images truly stand out, you need to pay attention to what&#39;s happening behind your subject.</p><p> Imagine: You&#39;ve found a perfect butterfly perched gracefully on a flower, ready for its close-up. You frame your shot, adjust the settings, and click the shutter button. But wait! In the background, there&#39;s a mess of branches, people walking by, or other objects that steal attention away from the butterfly.</p><p> To avoid this, take a moment to evaluate the background <em>before</em> pressing the shutter. Look for a clean and uncluttered space that will emphasize the butterfly, not distract from it. To achieve the best results, position yourself in a way that allows for ample space between the butterfly&#39;s perch and the area behind it.</p><p> Another trick is to use a wider aperture setting (smaller f-number) to create a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-get-shallow-depth-of-field-in-your-digital-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="shallow depth of field (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shallow depth of field</a> . That way, the background blurs into a soft wash of colors and shapes, focusing the viewer&#39;s attention on the sharp and vibrant butterfly in the foreground.</p><p> Remember, the background plays a crucial role in the overall impact of your butterfly photos. A clean, smooth, and complementary background will make your subject pop and captivate viewers – so always check behind your subject before shooting! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-the-shooting-through-approach"> 16.

Here&#39;s how you can get started:</p><p> First, find a suitable perch where you anticipate a butterfly will land. Look around for interesting vegetation, preferably flowers, that you can use as a foreground element.</p><p> Position yourself in such a way that the foreground element is situated between your lens and the butterfly perch. The closer the foreground element is to your lens, the better the effect. Dial in a wide aperture to create a soft blur in the foreground while manually focusing on the butterfly perch.</p><p> When the butterfly lands on the perch, seize the moment and snap a few shots. It may take some patience and persistence, but you&#39;ll end up with shots featuring a sharp butterfly surrounded by a soft blur. In my experience, this technique can create a dreamy and ethereal atmosphere that complements the beauty of the butterfly in a unique way.</p><p> Remember to experiment with different compositions and angles to ensure you get the most captivating results. With dedication and a creative mindset, this simple approach will help you produce breathtaking photographs that stand out from the crowd.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="have-fun"> 17.

The focus is on creating striking black shapes against a beautifully exposed background. It&#39;s a technique that emphasizes the shape and form of the subject, resulting in minimalistic and graphic effects:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253364" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-107.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Silhouette photography" class="wp-image-253364" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-107.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-107.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-107.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-107.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-107.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-107.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Silhouettes also allow you to showcase the vibrant colors of the sky behind your subject, adding an extra level of visual impact. Imagine capturing a stunning sunset or sunrise with the silhouette of a tree or a person standing tall against the vivid hues of the sky.</p><p> The best part? Silhouette photography is accessible to everyone, regardless of the equipment you own. Whether you&#39;re shooting with a high-end mirrorless model or a smartphone, you can try your hand at capturing these compelling shots, making it an ideal creative outlet for photographers of all levels! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="when-should-you-try-silhouette-photography"> When should you try silhouette photography?</h2><p> If you&#39;re looking to add some pizzazz to your portfolio or spice up your social media feed, silhouette photography is the way to go. These graphic, eye-catching shots can truly make your work stand out.</p><p> I talk a lot about light later on in this article, but in general, sunrise and sunset are like magic hours for silhouette photography. The soft, warm light during these times creates the perfect backdrop for your subjects to take center stage as striking silhouettes.

Silhouettes tend to lean towards the artsy side, so if you&#39;re doing more formal photography (eg, a real-estate photoshoot), you might want to opt for more straightforward shots.</p><p> Happily, silhouette photography is not limited to any specific skill level or equipment. Anyone can dive into this captivating genre without breaking the bank or spending hours learning new techniques, so if you&#39;re on the fence about trying out silhouettes, I highly recommend giving it a go. It&#39;s a whole lot of fun, and you never know what magical results you might create.

Get ready to elevate your photography game, starting with: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="find-a-flat-or-raised-location"> 1. Find a flat or raised location</h3><p> When it comes to capturing stunning silhouette shots, the location plays a crucial role. The right environment will help you achieve that captivating contrast between your subject and the sky, while the wrong environment will distract the viewer or even prevent you from creating a crisp silhouette.</p><p> First and foremost, opt for locations that offer a flat or raised vantage point. Why is this important? Well, silhouettes tend to work best when your subject is framed against the sky, with the dark figure standing out against the bright background.</p><p> Beaches are a popular choice for silhouette photography because their flat landscapes make it easy to position your subject against the vast expanse of the sky. The uninterrupted low horizon provides the ideal opportunity to capture the outline of your subject in all its glory. Prairies are another solid option, though you&#39;ll need to be careful to prevent high grasses from obscuring portions of your subject.</p><p> But what if you can&#39;t find a flat location nearby? Don&#39;t worry, you can still create captivating silhouettes in areas where your subjects are raised off the ground. Bridges, hills, boardwalks, mountains, and even parking garage roofs can serve as elevated platforms to showcase your silhouetted subjects against the backdrop of the sky.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253363" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-106.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Silhouette photography" class="wp-image-253363" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-106.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-106.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-106.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-106.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-106.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-106.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Pro tip: Crouching down low to the ground can also work wonders, especially when your subject isn&#39;t already raised above you.

However, some objects work better for silhouettes than others.</p><p> I recommend choosing a subject that has a strong and recognizable shape – one that&#39;ll be interesting in its <em>two</em> -dimensional form. Silhouettes can&#39;t draw on colors, textures, and tones to make themselves appealing, so the shape needs to be distinct.</p><p> Ask yourself: Can you tell what your subject is simply by seeing its shape? Or does it just look like a blob? Does the shape look eye-catching and interesting, or does it feel relatively boring? (Also, sometimes the things that seem boring during the day can make great subjects for silhouettes – remember that it&#39;s about the shape, not the overall look!)</p><p> People make great silhouette subjects, but if they&#39;re doing something interesting – running, jumping, or riding a bike – the shot will look even better. The best silhouette shots often feature props, such as a bike, a basketball, or a skateboard.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-205278" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="silhouette of a biker" class="wp-image-205278" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-4.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-4.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-4.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="find-your-subject-well-before-sunrise-or-sunset"> 3. Find your subject well before sunrise or sunset</h3><p> Preparation is key in silhouette photography. Timing plays a crucial role, especially if you&#39;re looking to capture the rich colors of sunrise or sunset. You&#39;ll want to identify your subject and set up your shot well in advance.</p><p> The sky can change dramatically within a short period. That&#39;s why I recommend being in your chosen location at least 30 minutes before the sun makes its appearance or takes its leave. You should have your camera (and tripod, if you&#39;re using one) set up and ready to go a few minutes before the magic begins, and if you&#39;re working with a model, ask them to arrive a little early and use the extra time to get them prepared for the photoshoot.</p><p> And you should also make an effort to stay <em>after</em> the sunrise or sunset. You might think you can predict when the sky will be at its most vivid, but nature often surprises us. Sometimes the most amazing colors appear when you least expect them. So it&#39;s wise to be present for the whole event – before, during, and after the sun crosses the horizon.</p><p> (How long should you stick around? At least 30 minutes after the sun has risen or set is a good rule of thumb. This ensures you don&#39;t miss out on any late surprises the sky might have for you.) </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="make-sure-your-flash-is-off">4. Make sure your flash is off</h3><p> Silhouette photograph often involves shooting in dim light (at the start and the end of the day), and most silhouette subjects look pretty dark, too.

Get the light right</h3><p> Silhouette lighting doesn&#39;t work like normal photographic lighting. To capture a conventional shot, you generally want to ensure that your subject is lit from the front (so that the sun is coming from over your shoulder and striking your subject) or the side (so that the sun is off to your right or left and is striking one half of the subject).</p><p> But when you&#39;re shooting silhouettes, you&#39;ll need to reverse this approach. Find the scene&#39;s main light source, then ensure that it&#39;s shining from the <em>back</em> of the subject, not the front. Remember, the goal is to keep the background bright and the subject dark. You don&#39;t need the light to come from directly behind the subject, but the brighter the background, the better.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-205276" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-8.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="silhouette photography statue" class="wp-image-205276" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-8.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-8.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-8.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-8.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-8.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> That&#39;s why it&#39;s easy to create silhouettes at sunrise or sunset; you can position yourself so that you&#39;re shooting into the low sun, and you can frame the dark subject with the bright sky in the background.

That can cause a problem; after all, you <em>don&#39;t</em> want your subject to turn out nice and bright in a silhouette shot.</p><p> So what do you do? You trick your camera.</p><p> Simply set the camera to your shooting mode of choice (Aperture Priority can work great for this, but you can try Auto mode, too). Then point your camera at the brightest part of the scene and press the shutter button halfway. On many cameras, this will set the exposure, and as long as you keep the shutter button half-pressed, it&#39;ll remain locked in.</p><p> Next, while still partially depressing the shutter button, point your camera at your subject and frame up your composition. Finally, press the shutter button the rest of the way.</p><p> With most digital cameras, this will result in a silhouetted subject! Pointing your camera at the bright part of the scene will cause your camera to darken the exposure – and then, when you do take the shot, the main subject will be rendered as a dark silhouette.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-205282" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-10.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="silhouette of a man on a beach" class="wp-image-205282" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-10.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-10.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-10.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-10.jpg?resize=1024%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-10.jpg?resize=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1365w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-10.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-10.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Note that some cameras also have a <a aria-label="spot metering mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/fine-tune-your-exposures-with-spot-metering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">spot metering mode</a> that helps with the above technique. Spot metering causes the camera to set the exposure based on the central part of your frame; with it, you can tell your camera the exact portion of bright background you want to use to determine the exposure. So if you&#39;re not getting the shots you want using the technique discussed above, you can always try switching your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-exposure-metering-modes/" target="_blank" aria-label="metering mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">metering mode</a> and see if that helps. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-shooting-in-manual-mode">9. Try shooting in Manual mode</h3><p> The technique I discussed above often works well, but if you want even more control over your settings, I&#39;d really recommend shooting in Manual mode.</p><p> Manual mode lets you input each and every exposure variable on your own. It can be a little difficult at first, but after a few hours of practice, you&#39;ll get the hang of it.</p><p> Once your camera is set to Manual, I&#39;d recommend dialing in a low <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> (100 is a good starting value) and a mid-level <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> (such as f/6.3). Then point your camera at the brightest part of the scene, and adjust the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> until the exposure bar in the viewfinder is balanced.</p><p> Take the first shot and review the results on your camera&#39;s LCD. If the image looks too dark, you can always lower the shutter speed, and if the image looks too bright, you can always increase the shutter speed instead.</p><p> (If you&#39;re working with very limited light and your shots are turning out dark, you can also widen the aperture or boost the ISO to increase the exposure, but do so sparingly; widening the aperture will limit the area of the photo that&#39;s in focus, while boosting the ISO will add unwanted noise to the image!)</p><p> I&#39;d also recommend capturing the same shot using a variety of different exposures – just so you have slightly darker and slightly lighter versions as backup files.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-205284" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-12.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="silhouette photography of a person holding a child" class="wp-image-205284" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-12.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-12.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-12.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-12.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-12.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-12.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="take-steps-to-keep-the-subject-sharp"> 10. Take steps to keep the subject sharp</h3><p> The best silhouette photograph tends to feature sharp, in-focus subjects.</p><p> Unfortunately, this can make the automatic metering process – described in Tip 6 – somewhat tricky. You see, pushing your shutter halfway down to get the metering right <em>also</em> means that your camera will focus on a spot in the background rather than on your subject.</p><p> If you&#39;re using the Manual mode shared above, you won&#39;t run into any issues. You can always acquire your exposure settings by pointing your camera at the background, dialing them in, then focusing on your subject. But if you prefer the Auto mode strategy, then you have two options.</p><p> First, if your camera offers <a aria-label="manual focusing (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dont-afraid-manual-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">manual focusing</a> , you can prefocus on your subject. Then, when you meter off the background, the point of focus won&#39;t change. You can effectively frame up your composition before triggering the shutter.</p><p> Second, you can try adjusting the aperture to maximize your <a aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> (ie, the amount of your image that is in focus). For this, you&#39;ll need to set a small aperture (ie, a large f-number, such as f/11 or f/16).</p><p> If the f-number is large enough and your subject isn&#39;t too close to the camera, you&#39;ll end up with a sharp subject and a sharp background, even if your camera is focused on the area <em>behind</em> your subject.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="look-for-action"> 11. Look for action</h3><p> If you&#39;re seeking silhouettes that pop off the screen, think action. A bit of movement can bring a unique layer of interest to your photos. Picture a dancer frozen in mid-leap or a skateboarder executing a trick. These dynamic moments create shapes and lines that captivate your audience.</p><p> The key is <em>timing</em> . You&#39;ll want to be ready to click the shutter at just the right moment. Don&#39;t worry; with practice, you&#39;ll get the hang of it (though burst mode can be helpful, too!).</p><p> Your camera settings are also crucial here. If your subject is moving fast, you&#39;ll need a quicker shutter speed (1/500s is a good starting point, though you can go slower or faster depending on the speed of your subject).</p><p> You don&#39;t always have to plan these action shots, either. Sometimes, the best moments are spontaneous. Keep your camera ready, and keep an eye out. You never know when a cyclist will zoom by, perfectly framed against the setting sun. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="be-aware-of-your-surroundings"> 12. Be aware of your surroundings</h3><p> Now that you&#39;re in your spot and set up, it&#39;s easy to become fixated on the spot where the sun is rising or setting. But don&#39;t let that narrow focus limit your creative vision. The sky is a vast canvas, and sometimes the most extraordinary colors appear where you least expect them.</p><p> Take a look around. Not just left and right, but also behind you. Sometimes, the sky opposite the rising or setting sun takes on hues just as dramatic, or even more so. These moments can be fleeting, and you have to be prepared to capture them.</p><p> If you&#39;re working with a tripod, it should be easy to move. In the rush of capturing a great shot, you might need to pivot quickly to face a different part of the sky. Make sure your tripod and camera setup allow for this.</p><p> Bottom line: Keep your eyes peeled and your camera ready. The sun has a way of illuminating clouds and creating color spectacles in unexpected places. So be aware of your surroundings, and be ready to capture the magic wherever it happens. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="incorporate-reflections-into-your-shots"> 13. Incorporate reflections into your shots</h3><p> One trick that can apply that extra touch of magic to your shots? Adding reflections. Not only do reflections add pizzazz to your images, but they also break up the monotony of an all-black foreground.</p><p> Once you&#39;ve found the perfect location for your silhouette shoot, keep your eyes peeled for a reflective surface in the foreground. Look out for small pools of water or wet areas, especially if you&#39;re shooting by the beach.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253361" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="998" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-102.jpg?resize=1500%2C998&#038;ssl=1" alt="Silhouette photography" class="wp-image-253361" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-102.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-102.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-102.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-102.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-102.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-102.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Once you&#39;ve found a nice surface, don&#39;t just shoot without thinking. Instead, you&#39;ll need to adjust your angle to ensure that your entire subject is reflected. For example, if you&#39;re photographing a graceful jogger against the vibrant sunset, you wouldn&#39;t want the reflection to accidentally cut off their head! Try shooting from higher or lower vantage points until you achieve the best composition.</p><p> Keep in mind that incorporating reflections into your silhouette photography can require some patience. It&#39;s not always easy to stumble upon the perfect combination of a reflective foreground, a compelling subject, and a captivating background. But the reward is well worth the effort. Don&#39;t give up! Keep exploring, keep searching for those hidden gems, and you&#39;ll be amazed at the incredible opportunities that you uncover. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-partial-silhouette-photography"> 14. Try partial silhouette photography</h3><p> While a total silhouette with a crisp, dark subject can be powerful, also consider capturing some partial silhouettes. I&#39;m talking about photos that include some detail on the subject, like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-205291" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-1001.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="silhouette of people on a beach" class="wp-image-205291" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-1001.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-1001.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-1001.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-1001.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-1001.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/silhouette-photography-1001.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> As you can see, the subjects are dark, but they&#39;re not <em>completely</em> dark, and you can still see a bit of detail in the sand and the subjects&#39; clothes.</p><p> Sometimes, a touch of light makes the subject slightly more three-dimensional and real, which – depending on your goals – can work well. Plus, a bit of extra detail can add to the mysterious feel of the image.</p><p> And if you&#39;re not sure whether to create a full silhouette or a partial silhouette, that&#39;s okay; just bracket your shots! That&#39;s the beauty of bracketing: it will leave you with both total and partial silhouettes to choose from.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="create-a-halo-effect"> 15. Create a halo effect</h3><p> Ever seen those breathtaking silhouettes framed by a heavenly glow? That&#39;s the halo effect, and it&#39;s not as hard to achieve as you might think. This effect adds a radiant outline around your subject.</p><p> Now, to get that glow, you&#39;ll need to position your subject directly in front of a light source. The setting sun is ideal for this, of course – so work hard to get the right angle as the sun lowers in the sky. If you can ensure that your subject is the right size in relation to the sun, and you can position your subject so the sun is almost entirely blocked, you can get a beautiful halo around the subject&#39;s edges.</p><p> Your camera&#39;s exposure settings come into play here. Experiment with different settings. You&#39;ll find that slight adjustments can make your halo more or less pronounced.</p><p> Composition matters, too. Make sure there&#39;s nothing intersecting with your subject&#39;s outline. Random objects or clutter can disrupt the halo. So aim for a clear and unobstructed view.</p><p> If you&#39;re struggling, don&#39;t get discouraged. This technique takes practice. Start with simple subjects and work your way up! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="include-props-for-unique-results"> 16. Include props for unique results</h3><p> Most photographers create candid silhouettes of distant strangers, but if you&#39;re up for a bit of creative experimentation, why not try some posed shots? While I generally wouldn&#39;t recommend capturing only silhouette shots during a portrait photoshoot, incorporating a few well-placed silhouettes can provide your subject with some cool and artistic photos that stand out from the crowd.</p><p> And if you&#39;re <em>really</em> looking to elevate those images, try adding a prop or two. Whether it&#39;s umbrellas, hats, musical instruments, or any other object that catches your fancy, props can inject personality and storytelling into your silhouette images. Just imagine a silhouette of a musician with a guitar, or a dancer with a flowing scarf.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253360" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-104.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Silhouette photography" class="wp-image-253360" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-104.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-104.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-104.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-104.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-104.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-104.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> When adding props to your compositions, keep in mind that they should be highly visible and not overshadow your subject. Also, ensure that the prop doesn&#39;t intersect with your subject in a way that detracts from the clear outline you&#39;re trying to create.</p><p> Remember, incorporating props is all about adding that extra touch of creativity and fun to your silhouette photography. So don&#39;t be afraid to experiment and think outside the box. Let your imagination run wild! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="take-a-storytelling-silhouette"> 17. Take a storytelling silhouette</h3><p> Silhouettes hold the power to tell a story in the simplest sense. Strip away the clutter, the colors, and the chaos, and what you&#39;re left with are raw emotions and actions that speak volumes. Picture a parent stooping to tie their child&#39;s shoelaces, or an elderly couple holding hands while watching the sunset. These moments tell stories that resonate with us all.</p><p> Adding more elements to your scene can make it even more dynamic. Think of a busy marketplace with various vendors and shoppers, all silhouetted against the evening sky. Props can also play a role. Imagine a fisherman with his net, or a musician playing a saxophone. Their outlines not only identify them but also say something profound about their life or passion.</p><p> As I&#39;ve emphasized throughout this article, it&#39;s crucial to keep your subjects&#39; outlines clean. Intersections are the enemy of good silhouette stories! So do your best to avoid these overlaps as much as possible.</p><p> One final tip: the environment can be a supporting actor in your storytelling. A silhouette framed against a stormy sky can add drama, while a peaceful sunrise can impart a sense of hope or a new beginning. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-just-photograph-people">18. Don&#39;t just photograph people</h3><p> Most silhouette photographers focus on people, and people <em>do</em> make great silhouette subjects. But you can also capture beautiful – and original – shots by focusing on other interesting objects.</p><p> For instance, you can create silhouettes of staircases (by getting down low and shooting upward), buildings, pets, planes, cars, and so much more.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253359" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-103.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Silhouette photography" class="wp-image-253359" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-103.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-103.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-103.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-103.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-103.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-103.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Really, whenever you see a subject with a compelling shape, see if you can position yourself so that you have a nice backlighting effect, then try to shoot a clear silhouette. You&#39;ll often fail to get the result you&#39;re after, but occasionally the photos will look <em>amazing</em> . </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-photographing-at-sunrise"> 19. Try photographing at sunrise</h3><p> There&#39;s no denying the challenge wind can pose in silhouette photography, especially with plant subjects. A slight breeze can introduce unwanted motion, turning what could have been a crisp silhouette into a blurry mess, especially when the light is very low. One way to circumvent this issue is to schedule your shoot for the early morning hours.</p><p> Generally, the wind is much calmer during the sunrise than at sunset. This tranquility allows for steadier shots, particularly if you&#39;re trying to capture delicate subjects like leaves or flowers. The early morning atmosphere tends to be more stable, making it easier to get that perfect shot without any motion blur.</p><p> Now, if you&#39;re not a morning person, don&#39;t fret. There are alternatives. For those instances when you have to shoot later in the day, consider increasing your shutter speed. This will help to freeze any motion, reducing the chance of blur. Of course, this might require adjustments to aperture and ISO settings to maintain proper exposure, so be sure to make any necessary tweaks! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-flash-as-your-main-light-source"> 20. Use a flash as your main light source</h3><p> Throughout this article, I&#39;ve talked about photographing silhouettes using natural light. But did you know that you can capture gorgeous shots using flash, too? One benefit of flash silhouette photography is that you can completely control the light direction and strength, which allows you to achieve all sorts of cool effects.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253358" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:71.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1071" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-101.jpg?resize=1500%2C1071&#038;ssl=1" alt="Silhouette photography" class="wp-image-253358" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-101.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-101.jpg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-101.jpg?resize=600%2C428&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-101.jpg?resize=768%2C548&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-101.jpg?resize=717%2C512&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Working with flash can be a bit intimidating, but the goal is simply to make the background brighter than the subject. Position your subject in front of a light-colored backdrop (such as a white wall), point the flash at the wall, then take some shots, with the goal of overexposing the background while underexposing the subject.</p><p> You might also try positioning the flash behind your subject so that it&#39;s pointed directly at their back; this will create a rim-lit effect, which can look wonderfully artistic. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="spend-some-time-processing-your-silhouette-photos"> 21. Spend some time processing your silhouette photos</h3><p> Even if you nail the silhouette exposure in-camera, I&#39;d recommend making a few minor tweaks using an editing program like Lightroom.</p><p> First, adjust the white balance until you get the results you want, then raise or lower the exposure to add or remove detail on the subject. You can also adjust specific tonal sliders for a more refined effect.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253357" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-100.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Silhouette photography" class="wp-image-253357" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-100.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-100.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-100.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-100.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-100.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/silhouette-photography-100.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you&#39;re after a punchy silhouette shot, try adding some contrast – and if the image features a beautiful sunrise or sunset in the background, consider boosting <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/vibrance-vs-saturation-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" aria-label="the vibrance or the saturation (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">the vibrance or the saturation</a> .</p><p> Finally, experiment by adding a vignette, creating an eye-catching <a aria-label="color grade (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/lightroom-color-grading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">color grade</a> , or selectively <a aria-label="dodging and burning (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/what-are-burning-and-dodging-and-how-they-can-help-your-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">dodging and burning</a> different parts of the image. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-a-black-and-white-conversion"> 22.

Composition involves the thoughtful arrangement of elements within your frame. For landscape photographers, it&#39;s all about where to place the horizon, what to include in the foreground, and what should occupy your background.</p><p> When determining a landscape photo composition, you&#39;ll often need to ask yourself a handful of key questions:</p><ul><li> What should my main subjects(s) be?</li><li> Where should I position them in the frame?</li><li> Does the scene have plenty of depth?</li><li> Have I removed all distractions from the shot?</li><li> Did I choose a good angle to showcase the landscape?</li></ul><p> When you&#39;re just getting started, it can be helpful to mentally run through a checklist before you capture each shot. Before you know it, however, you&#39;ll be setting up your shots without even having to think twice. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-importance-of-mastering-landscape-composition"> The importance of mastering landscape composition</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256360" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-composition-106.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Landscape photography composition" class="wp-image-256360" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-composition-106.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-composition-106.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-composition-106.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-composition-106.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-composition-106.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-composition-106.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Mastering composition isn&#39;t just for show. It serves a bigger purpose: to create images that captivate your audience. What makes an image engaging? The answer often lies in how well you&#39;ve positioned the different elements within the frame.</p><p> A well-composed landscape shot typically has a balanced feel, and you can frequently <em>sense</em> the depth, almost as if you could step right into the picture. Good compositions often add dynamism to your photos; the arrangements guide the viewer&#39;s eyes, making them linger on the details you want to emphasize.</p><p> The bottom line is that the better your compositional skills, the more striking your photos will be. If you&#39;re just getting started with landscape photography, all this may seem a bit overwhelming, but don&#39;t worry: landscape photographers have developed plenty of easy-to-apply techniques that work great for snappers of all levels, and they don&#39;t require any technical wizardry to pull off! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="tips-to-improve-your-landscape-photography-compositions"> 17 tips to improve your landscape photography compositions</h2><p> You know all about what landscape composition is and why it&#39;s important.

A mountain. A river. A shell on the beach. Waves crashing on the shore. Lightning in the sky.</p><p> The point is to include at least one element in your photo that a viewer can latch onto – something that sucks them into the frame and piques their interest. Otherwise, the viewer will become confused. They won&#39;t know where to focus, so they&#39;ll move on to a different image and never look back.</p><p> Is it okay to include multiple interesting subjects? Absolutely! In fact, many landscape photographers these days like to pack both a foreground subject and a background subject into a single photo. But make sure the subjects complement one another and be careful not to include so many subjects that the viewer no longer has a place to focus. When in doubt, keep it simple.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-use-the-rule-of-thirds-to-position-your-key-elements"> 2.

It&#39;s a great way for beginners to get started with composition, and it gives you an easy way to arrange key elements within the frame (eg, your main subject, your horizon, and other supporting elements).</p><p> If you&#39;re unfamiliar with the rule of thirds, here&#39;s a quick explanation:</p><p> The rule of thirds tells you to split your composition into vertical and horizontal thirds so you end up with a series of gridlines (displayed below). To create the most powerful compositions, you should place compositional elements along those gridlines and at their intersection points. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-158015 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-158015" style="width:1000px"><span class="space" style="width:1000px; padding-top:54.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="545" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rule-of-thirds-black.jpg?resize=1000%2C545&#038;ssl=1" alt="Rule of thirds grid landscape photography composition" class="wp-image-158015" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rule-of-thirds-black.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rule-of-thirds-black.jpg?resize=300%2C164&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rule-of-thirds-black.jpg?resize=768%2C419&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rule-of-thirds-black.jpg?resize=600%2C327&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rule-of-thirds-black.jpg?resize=160%2C88&amp;ssl=1 160w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rule-of-thirds-black.jpg?resize=717%2C391&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Graphic by Jeremy Flint</figcaption></figure></div><p> This often comes into play when working with horizon lines. Instead of putting the horizon smack-dab in the center of the frame, you can put it along the top rule of thirds gridline (a good idea if your foreground is especially interesting) or along the bottom rule of thirds gridline (a good idea if your sky is colorful or dramatic).</p><p> For this image, the blowing sand in the foreground is stunning – so the photographer chose to put the horizon along the upper gridline:</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-206581" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-composition-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="sand dunes with rule of thirds landscape composition" class="wp-image-206581" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-composition-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-composition-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-composition-4.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-composition-4.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-composition-4.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-composition-4.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> You can also use the rule of thirds to position your main subject. You might put the subject along one of the vertical gridlines, or – even better – at an intersection point. In fact, the rule of thirds gridline intersections are sometimes referred to as <em>power points</em> because they create such compelling compositions.</p><p> A quick word of caution, though:</p><p> The rule of thirds is a helpful technique. But despite the name, it&#39;s not a landscape composition rule. Rather, it&#39;s a guideline, so you don&#39;t need to follow it all the time. Instead, use it when it works, and break it when it doesn&#39;t.</p><p> Make sense?</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-use-foreground-interest-to-create-depth"> 3.

(This is also referred to as the <em>near-far composition technique</em> .)</p><p> It&#39;s a powerful tool, one that&#39;s insanely popular among today&#39;s professional landscape photographers. Check out the work of popular landscape shooters on Instagram or 500px, and you&#39;ll see thousands of stunning near-far compositions featuring:</p><ul><li> Foreground logs and background waterfalls</li><li> Foreground rocks and background sunsets</li><li> Foreground flowers and background mountains</li></ul><p> And the reason this technique is so popular? It helps create the illusion of <em>depth</em> in a scene.</p><p> For instance, a photo of a distant mountain can look nice, but it often appears <em>flat</em> .</p><p> But add some flowers or grass close to the camera, and the whole composition immediately deepens. The viewer first focuses on the foreground grass, then moves into the midground, and <em>then</em> finally sees the stunning mountain in the background:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-211079" style="width:453px"><span class="space" style="width:453px; padding-top:132.45%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="453" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landscape-photography-composition-123.jpg?resize=453%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="mountain with grasses in the foreground landscape photography composition" class="wp-image-211079" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landscape-photography-composition-123.jpg?resize=453%2C600&amp;ssl=1 453w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landscape-photography-composition-123.jpg?resize=226%2C300&amp;ssl=1 226w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landscape-photography-composition-123.jpg?resize=768%2C1018&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landscape-photography-composition-123.jpg?resize=717%2C950&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landscape-photography-composition-123.jpg?w=1132&amp;ssl=1 1132w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> So the next time you find a beautiful background subject, like the mountain I mentioned above…</p><p> …take a few moments to look for foreground interest. Then include <em>both</em> foreground and background in a single shot. (It can also help to use a wide-angle lens and get down low; that will magnify the foreground element and make it loom large in the frame, sucking the viewer right in.)</p><p> Note that the foreground interest can be a discrete subject, like a patch of grass. Or, as I discuss in the next tip, it can be a linear element that leads the eye into the frame:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-use-leading-lines-to-suck-the-viewer-into-the-scene"> 4.

But while you can certainly get great images that way, it often pays to go beyond the standing shot. Try getting down low over a foreground element; it&#39;ll create extra depth, plus it&#39;ll help draw the viewer into the frame.</p><p> Alternatively, find a vantage point and get up high. (A drone can be hugely useful here!) From an elevated perspective, the scene will look far more abstract, and you&#39;ll capture stunning images that convey the incredible scope of the landscape.</p><p> You can also carefully adjust your angle to block out distracting elements and create interesting framing opportunities (see below!). Sometimes, a couple of steps to the right or the left is all it takes to create a stunningly original composition. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photograph-with-a-tripod"> 6.

You notice how the foreground plays against the backdrop. You start to scrutinize the edges of your frame. Are there any distractions that need to be eliminated? What about gorgeous elements that lie just outside the frame but could look great as part of the shot?</p><p> You might think that tripods are a hassle, and in a way, you&#39;re right.

It&#39;s okay to use a somewhat circular rock, a vaguely triangular mountain, and so on. The point is to include shape-like elements when you can, without stressing too much about whether you have a complete shape or an implied one. That way, you create strong compositions that still feel natural.</p><p> Also, remember: When it comes to working with geometry in landscape photography composition, there are no hard and fast rules as to what works well. You can look for single bold shapes, you can look for multiple shapes that are similar, or you can look for several opposite shapes.

In fact, it&#39;s often these simple frames that take a good composition to the next level; they provide much-needed focus by showing the viewer <em>exactly</em> where to look (and when positioned carefully, they can also block out distracting elements).</p><p> Pro tip: When working with foreground frames, spend time experimenting with different apertures. A narrow aperture will help you capture lots of detail, while a wide aperture will blur the foreground frame for a cool creative effect. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="look-for-patterns-to-add-compositional-coherence"> 13.

It&#39;s more than just eye candy in your photos; it&#39;s a powerful tool in your composition arsenal. Often, we get so caught up in lines, shapes, and focal points that we forget the role color plays in our landscape shots. The mood, the emotion, the depth – color affects them all.</p><p> As you compose each landscape shot, take a moment to think about the colors present in your frame. Stick with 2-4 main colors to avoid overwhelming the viewer, and when you&#39;re scouting a scene, be on the lookout for complementary colors; think red and green or blue and orange. They sit opposite each other on the color wheel and create a dynamic tension when placed together in a photo. Contrasting colors naturally draw the eye and can make your image pop.</p><p> But don&#39;t exclude analogous color combinations, either! These are the colors that are adjacent on the wheel, like shades of blue and green. They create a sense of peace and can often give your photos a deeply tranquil mood.</p><p> Note that color, unlike framing, is something you can fine-tune during post-processing. Adjusting the hues or ramping up the saturation can enhance the natural color relationships in your scene, and you should always spend a bit of time working with these elements during photo editing. Of course, for the best results, you should always aim to get the colors right in camera and only use post-processing as a last resort.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="break-the-rules"> 17.

Yes, it breaks the rule of thirds, but the result is very powerful.

You see, cats aren&#39;t exactly known for posing on command or following your carefully crafted shot list. No, they prefer to embrace their independent nature, keeping you on your toes as they pounce, play, or simply stare you down with a look that says, “Who are you to interrupt my nap?”</p><p> Fortunately, while cat photography can be challenging, it&#39;s a passion of mine, and over the years, I&#39;ve developed techniques that produce beautiful results. Below, I share my favorite tips to improve your cat photography, including advice on:</p><ul><li>作品</li><li>Camera settings</li><li> Lighting</li><li> And more</li></ul><p> I also offer plenty of cat photography ideas to help you get inspired!</p><p> So grab your camera and prepare to embark on a whisker-filled adventure that will leave you with an album of cat photos guaranteed to make your friends go “Awww!”</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="cat-photography-tips"> 16 cat photography tips</h2><p> If you&#39;re struggling to capture outstanding images of cats, these techniques will make a <em>huge</em> difference.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-for-the-best-cat-photos-be-patient"> 1. For the best cat photos, be patient </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tips-photos-cats-01.jpg?ssl=1" alt="cat photography cats on the stairs" title="tips-photos-cats-01.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> First things first: When photographing cats, expect a high failure rate. Most of your shots won&#39;t work; after all, cats don&#39;t strike stunning poses for long periods of time!</p><p> (In my experience, they&#39;re likely to walk up to you and sniff your lens <em>just</em> as you hit the shutter button.)</p><p> Instead, you must embrace the randomness and slow progress of a cat photoshoot. Enjoy watching the cat, be patient, and have your camera ready.</p><p> That way, when your cat strikes an interesting pose, you can simply fire off a few frames and get the shot.</p><p> Also, if you&#39;re photographing a cat that lives with you (as opposed to conducting a scheduled photoshoot with a cat), then I highly recommend you always keep a camera handy, even if it&#39;s just a phone. Cats tend to strike funny poses, especially when they&#39;re half asleep, but you <em>must</em> have a camera nearby; otherwise, the cat will hear you digging around for your camera and change positions.</p><p> Similarly, if you&#39;re outside with your cat, keep your camera at the ready for some outdoor action shots. If you need to fetch your gear from inside the house, then you may miss some great opportunities. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tips-photos-cats-04.jpg?ssl=1" alt="cat sitting in terra cotta jar" title="tips-photos-cats-04.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="make-a-shot-list"> 2. Make a shot list</h3><p> One of the best cat photography ideas is to create a shot list. This will serve as a guideline when structuring your session.</p><p> You can also use a shot list to determine the materials you need before heading out to your cat photoshoot.</p><p> I recommend you include a close-up portrait on your list because it&#39;s one of the classic shots that you can&#39;t miss. When the cat&#39;s face fills the frame, it becomes the most important element – no distractions. Like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-204780" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cat-photography-ideas-close-up.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="cat licking face" class="wp-image-204780" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cat-photography-ideas-close-up.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cat-photography-ideas-close-up.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cat-photography-ideas-close-up.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cat-photography-ideas-close-up.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cat-photography-ideas-close-up.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cat-photography-ideas-close-up.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If it&#39;s a frontal portrait, you&#39;ll emphasize the eyes. Here, making eye contact with the cat is key to a successful photo.</p><p> (You can also try a close-up in profile or capture a specific expression.)</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-use-sounds-and-toys-to-get-the-cat-s-attention"> 3. Use sounds and toys to get the cat&#39;s attention</h3><p> As I emphasized in the previous tip, cats love to defy photographers. They&#39;ll turn away just as you frame up your shot, they&#39;ll lie down just as you&#39;re ready to shoot some action, and they&#39;ll sniff the lens right when you <em>know</em> you&#39;ve found the perfect composition.</p><p> Fortunately, cats aren&#39;t totally unpredictable. There are a few easy techniques you can use to get your cat&#39;s attention.</p><p> First, cats are intrigued by rustling noises, so if you crunch a paper bag with one hand while keeping the camera up with the other, your cat will often look over and you&#39;ll be able to nab a few frames.</p><p> An alternative is finger-snapping, where you snap your fingers until the cat turns to investigate. In my experience, this usually works, but only for a time – after a few moments, the cat will recognize what&#39;s going on and get bored.</p><p> Finally, if you prefer <em>livelier</em> photos, consider bringing out a toy.

Get down on your cat&#39;s level</h3><p> This cat photography tip is a <em>big</em> one, and it goes hand in hand with a mistake I see all the time from beginner cat shooters.</p><p> You see, most cat (and dog) photographers, when starting out, photograph their animal <em>from human height</em> . And this rarely works well, for two reasons:</p><ol><li> It shows the pet from so high up that the shot loses intimacy.</li><li> It decreases the distance between the cat and the background. The result is generally a cat surrounded by a sharp floor, as opposed to (ideally) a cat in front of a blurry wall or a blurry outdoor scene.</li></ol><p> Instead, it&#39;s important to get down on your cat&#39;s level. Look them in the eye with the camera. This type of photo – where you are part of the cat&#39;s world, not the other way around – tends to have more impact and better show off the animal&#39;s personality.</p><p> If you struggle to get down in such low positions, consider using a camera with a tilting or fully articulating screen. That way, you can compose eye-level shots while remaining comfortably above your camera.</p><p> And by the way, you don&#39;t always need to get on the ground for a good result. What&#39;s important is that you stay on a level with the cat, which means that you can capture climbing shots from a standing height: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tips-photos-cats-08.jpg?ssl=1" alt="a cat walking across a roof" title="tips-photos-cats-08.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="follow-your-cat"> 5.

Frame your subject for the best compositions</h3><p> Speaking of composition: in cat photography, it pays to emphasize your main subject as much as possible.</p><p> And one easy way to do this is by framing your cat with other compositional elements.</p><p> For instance, you can shoot through long grass, shrubs, or tree foliage, which will give the cat a nice, natural frame: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tips-photos-cats-02.jpg?ssl=1" alt="creative cat photography shooting-through technique" title="tips-photos-cats-02.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Or you can shoot through human-made objects, such as chair legs, banister railings, towel cupboards, and even windows. It&#39;s a fun technique, and one that comes with endless variations; the key is to get creative!</p><p> You should also experiment with different <a aria-label="apertures (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">apertures</a> as you work. For instance, a wide aperture – such as f/2.8 – is great for creating a blurry foreground frame, which works great when handling more natural elements (like leaves). Whereas a narrow aperture – f/8, for example – will keep the foreground frame sharp and create a completely different effect.</p><p> (The more you test your different camera settings, the more familiar you&#39;ll get – and the more your creative horizons will expand!) </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="choose-the-right-backgrounds"> 8. Choose the right backgrounds</h3><p> When it comes to capturing stunning cat photos, the background plays a major role. You don&#39;t want it to steal the spotlight or distract from your feline subject. Instead, you want a background that complements and enhances the overall composition of the image.</p><p> First off, simplicity is key. A background that&#39;s too busy or cluttered can take away from the main focus of your photo: the adorable cat in front of your lens. Consider opting for a clean and uniform background, like a simple white or black wall. This minimalist approach can help draw attention to your cat&#39;s charming features and personality.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-252889" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cat-photography-tips-447.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Cat photography tips" class="wp-image-252889" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cat-photography-tips-447.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cat-photography-tips-447.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cat-photography-tips-447.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cat-photography-tips-447.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cat-photography-tips-447.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cat-photography-tips-447.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> However, don&#39;t be afraid to get a little creative with your backgrounds. Experiment with different textured surfaces, vibrant patterns, or even natural elements like flowers or foliage. Just make sure that the background doesn&#39;t overpower your furry model. Remember, it&#39;s all about finding the right balance.</p><p> When choosing a background, also consider the mood and theme you want to convey. Is it a playful and lively shot? Then perhaps a bright and colorful background would work best. Are you aiming for a more serene and intimate feel? In that case, a muted or neutral background might be the way to go. In other words, the background should support the overall story you want your photograph to tell.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-nail-focus-on-the-eyes"> 9. Nail focus on the eyes</h3><p> Pet photos <em>must</em> include sharp eyes. This is true of cat photos, dog photos, bird photos, and even wildlife photos, because without sharp eyes, the whole image will feel off-kilter.</p><p> Unfortunately, keeping the eye in focus can be tough, especially if you&#39;re shooting up close or your cat is very active. Here are a few simple tips:</p><ul><li> If your camera has Animal Eye AF, test it out and see whether you like the result.</li><li> If your cat tends to be active for a few moments before becoming motionless, then consider using your camera&#39;s <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/choosing-a-focus-mode/" target="_blank" aria-label="AF-S mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">AF-S mode</a> . Wait until the cat is still, use a single AF point to lock focus on the eyes, then recompose and take your shot.</li><li> If all else fails, switch over to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dont-afraid-manual-focus/" target="_blank" aria-label="manual focusing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">manual focusing</a> . It might seem unwieldy, but if you can learn to accurately focus manually, you&#39;ll easily increase your keeper rate.</li></ul><p> By the way, if you&#39;re struggling to get an eye in focus, feel free to narrow the aperture (assuming you have sufficient light). Narrowing the aperture will increase the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> so that a larger portion of the image is sharp, which will in turn give greater leeway when focusing on the cat.</p><p> And one more thing: If you&#39;re taking a cat photo from an angle, aim to keep the nearest eye in focus, as it looks unnatural to feature a blurry near eye and a sharp far eye. Whereas if you&#39;re photographing the cat from the front, as I did in the photo below, make sure that <em>both</em> eyes are tack sharp: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tips-photos-cats-10.jpg?ssl=1" alt="cat close-up photo" title="tips-photos-cats-10.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-shooting-during-the-golden-hours"> 10.

Try shooting with the light directly hitting the front of your cat, showcasing its every adorable detail. Then play with sidelight, allowing the sun to create beautiful shadows and highlight the contours of your feline model.</p><p> Finally, test out some backlighting approaches. You might even try to capture a silhouette or two! (To achieve this effect, deliberately expose for the bright sky and let the cat turn dark.)</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-try-an-off-camera-flash-for-the-best-lighting-effects"> 11. Try an off-camera flash for the best lighting effects</h3><p> Most beginner cat photographers shoot in natural light, and that&#39;s completely fine. In fact, natural light – as discussed in the previous tip – can look <em>incredible</em> in cat shots.</p><p> But if you want to increase your flexibility as a cat photographer, I do recommend you <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/starting-with-off-camera-flash-techniques/" target="_blank" aria-label="learn how to use flash (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">learn how to use flash</a> ; it&#39;ll let you take photos even when the light is low or isn&#39;t cooperating, and the more flexible your approach, the better, right?</p><p> To get started with flash, I encourage you to purchase an adjustable speedlight. You can mount this to your camera <em>or</em> use it off-camera on a lighting stand, which makes for a versatile shooting setup. Plus, a speedlight lets you avoid the dreaded red-eye effect (just make sure you&#39;re not shooting <em>directly</em> into the eyes of the cat but are instead working from an angle).</p><p> Once you get a speedlight, add a small softbox or diffuser, which will soften the light to avoid harsh shadows and that unpleasant deer-in-the-headlights look.</p><p> Then just play around with different angles and approaches. You might try to bounce the flash off walls to create interesting sidelighting, or you might mount the flash on a stand at a 45-degree angle to create a dramatic effect.</p><p> Of course, you&#39;ll need to pay careful attention to the compositions of your photos, and good lighting doesn&#39;t necessarily guarantee great shots – but if you can master flash cat photography, then you&#39;ll be <em>miles</em> ahead of the game. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tips-photos-cats-06.jpg?ssl=1" alt="cat in beautiful lighting" title="tips-photos-cats-06.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-use-plenty-of-focal-lengths-for-a-variety-of-shots"> 12. Use plenty of focal lengths for a variety of shots</h3><p> You can shoot cats with a single prime lens – but if you want to capture a variety of photos that really tell a story, then I highly recommend you work with multiple focal lengths.</p><p> Here, a handful of primes is a decent option, though a zoom – such as a 70-200mm lens – will give you lots of flexibility and won&#39;t need to be swapped on and off your camera over the course of the photoshoot.</p><p> Personally, I&#39;m a fan of portrait-type lenses in the 85mm to 130mm focal-length range for cat photos, as these lenses let you shoot without getting in the cat&#39;s face, while <em>also</em> allowing you to get reasonably close (which is important if you plan to photograph indoors).</p><p> A good beginner cat photography lens is a macro option, like a Canon 100mm f/2.8 or a Nikon 105mm f/2.8. You can use it to capture beautiful portraits, then you can move in for some close-ups of the eyes and paws: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tips-photos-cats-12.jpg?ssl=1" alt="cat's paws on a red carpet" title="tips-photos-cats-12.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> I&#39;d also encourage you to invest in a wider lens, such as a 24-70mm zoom or a 35mm prime; a wide-angle lens is great for grabbing full-body and environmental shots of your cat, and while it probably won&#39;t see as much use as a short telephoto lens, it&#39;ll still be nice to have around. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tips-photos-cats-07.jpg?ssl=1" alt="cat lying down and stretching" title="tips-photos-cats-07.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> You can also photograph a cat with a smartphone camera. No, it won&#39;t offer the same level of image quality or settings flexibility as a dedicated DSLR or mirrorless body, but it&#39;s an easy way to get started with the equipment you have. Use your wide-angle lens to get environmental cat shots, and use the telephoto lens for headshots and standard portraits.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-use-the-right-cat-photography-settings"> 13. Use the right cat photography settings</h3><p> You can do cat photography with your camera set to Auto mode, but you&#39;re bound to get frustrated pretty quickly. Auto mode doesn&#39;t let you adjust exposure variables, which means that you&#39;ll be unable to control the shutter speed (which affects sharpness), the aperture (which affects depth of field), and the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> (which affects <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-avoid-and-reduce-noise-in-your-images/" target="_blank" aria-label="noise levels (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">noise levels</a> ).</p><p> Instead, most cameras offer several better options.</p><p> First, you might try Aperture Priority mode, which allows you to set the ISO and aperture while your camera selects the shutter speed. I generally recommend you set the ISO to its lowest value, then select the aperture for the depth of field effect you&#39;re after (remember, a wide aperture, such as f/2.8, will limit depth of field to create a very blurry background, while a narrow aperture, such as f/8, will increase depth of field to keep everything sharp). If your camera sets a too-slow shutter speed, you can always increase the ISO or widen the aperture further (this, in turn, will force the camera to increase the shutter speed).</p><p> If you&#39;re already familiar with basic camera settings or you want to dive straight into the deep end, then you can try shooting in <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> . Here, you pick your shutter speed, aperture, <em>and</em> ISO; the goal is to choose the three settings so your exposure bar (generally present in the camera viewfinder) is balanced.</p><p> I think Manual mode is good for slower-paced photoshoots with consistent lighting, whereas Aperture Priority mode does well when the cat is moving and/or the light is changing rapidly.
