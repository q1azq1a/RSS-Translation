/></span></figure></div><p>抓拍摄影在各种情况和类型中都非常有用，可让您捕捉自发和自然的瞬间。以下是一些偷拍摄影大放异彩的例子：</p><ul><li><strong>人像摄影：</strong>与摆姿势<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/six-ways-to-take-a-candid-portrait-of-somebody-you-know/" target="_blank" aria-label="Candid portraits (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">的照片相比，偷拍的人像</a>具有美妙的真实性。它们有效地捕捉了您的主题的真正本质。在拍摄肖像时，您可以鼓励拍摄对象表现自然或参与活动，谨慎地拍摄他们的动作。您还可以在姿势之间或从一个位置过渡到另一个位置时抓住坦诚的机会。</li><li><strong>婚礼和活动摄影：</strong> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-tips-for-doing-candid-wedding-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="Candid wedding and event photography (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">偷拍婚礼和活动摄影</a>非常受欢迎——这是有充分理由的！这些场合提供了多种可能性，从捕捉新娘准备到新郎调整领带，以及宾客在招待会上尽情享受。在这些场景中的抓拍通常是轻松且无压力的，因为拍摄对象通常在全神贯注于主要事件的同时接受相机的存在。</li><li><strong>街头摄影：</strong>几乎所有街头摄影都依赖于未经拍摄对象同意的偷拍。街头摄影师的目标是保持不被注意，捕捉自然状态下的个体。 <a aria-label="Street candids (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/7-vital-tips-improve-candid-street-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">街头抓拍</a>可以涵盖宽阔的街道景观、几个拍摄对象之间的互动，或者一个陷入沉思的孤独者、在雨中行走，或者只是观察周围的环境。</li><li><strong>旅行摄影：</strong>探索不同目的地时，抓拍可以帮助描绘一个地方的独特本质。旅行偷拍摄影通常类似于街头摄影，突出显示使某个地点与众不同的人物、服装、灯光和建筑。</li></ul><h2 data-section id="is-it-legal-to-take-candid-photos">偷拍照片合法吗？</h2><p>虽然未经同意的偷拍在许多地方（例如美国）通常是合法的，但规则可能会根据您所在的位置而有所不同。检查您计划进行偷拍的具体地点的法律至关重要，以避免任何法律麻烦。</p><p>也就是说，<em>经</em>同意的偷拍摄影几乎在所有地方都被广泛接受并且合法。这意味着，如果您所在的地区禁止未经同意进行拍摄，您仍然可以通过先获得许可来拍摄一些精彩的偷拍照片。一旦您的拍摄对象同意，您就可以在他们自然地进行活动时拍照。</p><h2

随身携带相机</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-254414" style="width:399px"><span class="space" style="width:399px; padding-top:150.38%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="399" height="600"

/></span></figure></div><p>拍摄自发照片的最佳方式？永远带着相机！这样，当时机出现时，您可以快速按下<em>“开启”</em>按钮，拍摄几张照片，并且（如果一切顺利！）获得出色的结果。</p><p>当我进行拍摄时，我会使用数码单反相机，但当我在拍摄<em>间隙</em>时，我会携带傻瓜相机。如果我看到一个好的机会，我就会抓住它并捕捉这一场景。当然，您不需要出去购买昂贵的第二机身 - 如今，智能手机相机的质量非常高，对于大多数偷拍摄影来说已经足够了。</p><p>此外，随身携带相机可以让人们对你拍照感到更加自在。我发现我的朋友和家人只是希望我拿出相机，所以当我打开相机时，这并不是要摆姿势的信号，这只是我们互动的正常部分。当我拍摄一两张照片时，拍摄对象很放松，照片看起来很自然。</p><h3 data-section id="use-a-long-focal-length"> 2.使用长焦距</h3><p>要在不被注意的情况下拍摄偷拍照片，请尝试使用长镜头拍摄 - 例如<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/review-sigma-135mm-art-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="135mm prime (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">135 毫米定焦镜头</a>、 <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tamron-18-200mm-zoom-f3-5-6-3-lll-vc-review/" target="_blank" aria-label="18-200mm zoom (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">18-200 毫米变焦镜头</a>或<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/every-photographer-needs-70-200mm-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="70-200mm zoom (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">70-200 毫米变焦镜头</a>。正如您可能已经猜到的那样，您离拍摄对象越远，他们就越不可能知道您正在拍照，他们的行为也会越自然和放松。</p><p>不过，根据环境的不同，长镜头可能会非常明显，而且实际上可能会让人们感到不舒服（就像他们被监视一样）。因此，广泛选择您的镜头，如果您担心人们的反应，请考虑选择最紧凑的变焦镜头。</p><p>这样，您就可以从人们的个人空间之外拍摄您的偷拍照片，您可以不被注意到，并且可以在您的作品中保持亲密感。</p><h3 data-section id="kill-the-flash"> 3.关闭闪光灯</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-208005" style="width:1500px"><span class="space"

data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>也许您可以向另一个人发出您正在拍摄他们的信号的最<em>明显</em>方式？使用闪光灯（尤其是相机顶部的闪光灯！）。毕竟，没有什么比眩目的闪光更能引起人们的注意并消磨时间了。</p><p>因此，如果可能的话，请关闭闪光灯以进行抓拍。当您在弱光下拍摄时，不要使用闪光灯，而是尝试提高<a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> 、打开<a

都可以帮助您创建专注于场景本质的迷人图像。</li><li><strong>移动主题：</strong>不要让名字欺骗了你； ICM 不仅仅适用于静止的主体。事实上，当应用于汽车、运动员或野生动物等移动物体时，它会特别引人注目。通过故意用相机跟踪运动，您可以创建迷人的效果，使拍摄对象在美丽平滑且动态的背景下保持相对清晰。 （此技术也称为<em><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-tips-master-panning-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">平移</a></em>。）</li><li><strong>花卉摄影：</strong>如果您热衷于捕捉花朵的精致之美，ICM 可以为您的图像添加一丝抽象感。通过有意模糊场景，可以突出花朵鲜艳的色彩和优雅的形状，创造出对自然的梦幻和艺术诠释。</li><li><strong>街头摄影：</strong>令人惊讶的是，ICM 甚至可以融入街头摄影。它提供了一种独特的方式来强调建筑物的建筑线条并传达城市生活的快节奏能量。通过在捕捉场景时有意移动相机，您可以为街头照片注入运动感和活力。</li></ul><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image

ICM摄影必备设备</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async"

data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>有意的相机移动方法非常容易实现。您不需要花哨或昂贵的装备即可开始。这是我的建议：</p><ul><li><strong>相机：</strong>任何允许您手动调整快门速度的相机都可以。这包括数码单反相机和可互换镜头无反光镜相机。</li><li><strong>镜头：</strong>虽然您可以使用任何镜头进行 ICM 摄影，但稍长的镜头（例如 85 毫米或 70-200 毫米）可以更轻松地实现强烈的模糊效果。较长的镜片还可以帮助您专注于有趣的图案和颜色。如果可能，请使用具有手动对焦功能的镜头。</li><li><strong>滤镜：</strong> ICM 摄影需要较长的快门速度，这意味着您需要控制照射到相机传感器的光线量。如果您在清晨或傍晚拍摄，那就可以出发了。但如果您想在白天尝试 ICM，请考虑使用<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/neutral-density-filters-landscape-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="neutral density (ND) filter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">中性密度 (ND) 滤镜</a>。它就像镜片的太阳镜一样，可以减少光线并防止过度曝光。另一种选择是<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-and-buy-polarizing-filters/" target="_blank" aria-label="polarizing filter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">偏光滤镜</a>，它可以减少光线并增强颜色。我个人更喜欢从偏光滤镜开始，然后根据需要添加 2 级或 4 级 ND 滤镜。</li><li><strong>三脚架（可选）：</strong>如果您想要具有平坦地平线或垂直线的超平滑 ICM 图像，三脚架可能会有所帮助。使用云台可获得最佳效果。然而，在大多数情况下，三脚架是不必要的。您只需使用相机、镜头和创意动作即可获得出色的 ICM 图像。</li></ul><p>请记住，装备并不能成就摄影师。在 ICM 摄影中真正重要的是您的创造力和远见。因此，如果您没有最新的设备，请不要担心。专注于探索技术并利用现有技术捕捉独特的图像。</p><h2 data-section id="the-best-icm-photography-settings">最佳 ICM 摄影设置</h2><p>如果您准备好进入令人兴奋的有意相机运动摄影世界，那么正确设置相机以实现那些迷人且梦幻的效果至关重要。以下是我推荐的基本 ICM 设置：</p><ul><li>快门优先模式</li><li>1/2秒快门速度</li><li>ISO 100</li><li>手动对焦</li><li>图像稳定关闭</li></ul><p>现在让我们更详细地研究这些设置。进行有意的相机运动摄影就是控制<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">快门速度</a>。较长的快门速度可以让您移动相机的时间更长，从而增加模糊效果，而较短的快门速度只能让您移动相机几分之一秒，从而减少模糊效果。因此，通过手动改变快门速度值，就可以改变效果的强度！</p><p>与光圈优先、程序或自动模式不同， <a aria-label="Shutter Priority mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">快门优先</a>模式可以完全控制相机的快门速度，使其成为 ICM 技术的理想选择。您可以设置所需的快门速度和 ISO，同时相机会自动选择合适的光圈以获得曝光良好的图像。</p><p>在为 ICM 摄影选择特定的快门速度时，没有通用的最佳选择。所需的效果取决于您想要实现的外观。对于超抽象镜头，您可以选择较长的曝光时间，例如 10 秒。另一方面，如果您喜欢稍微模糊的图像，则更快的快门速度（例如 1/30 秒）可能会合适。</p><p>此外，请考虑镜头的长度会影响模糊程度，较长的镜头比较宽的镜头产生的模糊程度更大。不过，作为起点，我建议尝试 1/2 秒的快门速度。如果您不确定，请尝试不同的快门速度，在相机屏幕上查看结果，进行调整，并继续完善您的技术。</p><p>我强烈建议您使用相机的基本<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO setting (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO 设置</a>。它不仅可以防止难看的噪点损害您的图像，而且还可以让您进一步延长快门速度，即使在明亮的照明条件下也是如此。</p><p>为了确保拍摄对象保持（相对）清晰，请提前<a aria-label="manually focus (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dont-afraid-manual-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">手动对焦</a>镜头。这样，您就不必担心相机难以找到焦点，这在低光照条件下或使用中性密度滤镜时可能会出现问题。</p><p>最后，如果您的镜头具有图像稳定功能，请记住将其停用。 Image stabilization tries to compensate for motion, which can hinder the desired blur effect in ICM photography.</p><h2 data-section id="how-to-do-icm-photography-my-three-step-approach"> How to do ICM photography: My three-step approach</h2><p> Now that you&#39;re familiar with the basic ICM

But as you&#39;re starting out, it&#39;s helpful to pick a subject with clear lines and interesting shapes.</p><p> Imagine rows of majestic trees in a forest or the captivating horizon line at a beautiful beach. Even the edges of tall buildings can make for captivating ICM subjects. The more color and texture you can include in your scene, the better – it adds some wonderful pizzazz to your shot!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254365" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:62.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="941" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-24.jpg?resize=1500%2C941&#038;ssl=1" alt="Intentional camera movement (ICM) photography" class="wp-image-254365" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-24.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-24.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-24.jpg?resize=600%2C376&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-24.jpg?resize=768%2C482&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-24.jpg?resize=717%2C450&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Here&#39;s a little tip: Shooting in low-light conditions is ideal for ICM. So if you can, try to plan your ICM adventures during the magical <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-photograph-golden-hour/" target="_blank" aria-label="golden hours (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">golden hours</a> – just after sunrise and just before sunset – or during the enchanting <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-quick-tips-for-better-blue-hour-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="blue hour (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">blue hour</a> . Working at night can also produce some stunning results.</p><p> Of course, you can experiment with ICM in bright light too – like on a sunny afternoon – but in that case, you&#39;ll often need to use a filter to prevent overexposure.</p><h3 data-section id="step-select-your-settings-and-compose"> Step 2: Select your settings and compose</h3><p> Once you&#39;ve got your subject in mind, let&#39;s dive into the nitty-gritty of setting up your shot. It&#39;s time to position your subject just right and get those settings dialed in. Here&#39;s how to do it:</p><p> First things first, take a moment to frame your shot. Remember, the end result won&#39;t resemble what you see through the viewfinder, but it&#39;s still important to consider the size and position of the main elements in your scene. Move closer or farther away, or adjust your zoom, until you&#39;re satisfied with the composition. Then switch your lens to manual focus and turn the lens focus ring until your subject is reasonably sharp.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254366" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:80%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1200" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-23.jpg?resize=1500%2C1200&#038;ssl=1" alt="Intentional camera movement (ICM) photography" class="wp-image-254366" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-23.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-23.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-23.jpg?resize=600%2C480&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-23.jpg?resize=768%2C614&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-23.jpg?resize=717%2C574&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Set your camera to Shutter Priority mode and immediately choose ISO 100. Think about how heavily you want your subject to blur and choose a shutter speed accordingly. As I said above, 1/2s is a good starting point, but you might potentially start at 1s or more if you want a lot of blur.</p><p> One important note: Keep an eye on the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture value (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture value</a> suggested by your camera. If it&#39;s blinking or showing “high,” it means the light is too strong, and your image will be overexposed. In that case, you have two options. You can either increase the shutter speed until the blinking disappears, or you can use a filter to reduce the amount of light entering the camera. (If you do add a filter, make sure you check the aperture value one more time before proceeding!)</p><h3 data-section id="step-move-your-camera-while-pressing-the-shutter"> Step 3: Move your camera while pressing the shutter</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254367" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Intentional camera movement (ICM) photography" class="wp-image-254367" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> At this point, you&#39;re ready to take a photo, so start moving your camera in a smooth and deliberate manner.

So, don&#39;t be afraid to try out different techniques and experiment with various styles. Each shot you take will have its own distinctive character. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ICMwarehamtreesunset750.jpg?ssl=1" alt="tree at sunset ICM" title="ICMwarehamtreesunset750.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> After capturing a shot, take a moment to review it on the LCD screen of your camera. Ask yourself some questions: Was the shutter speed too fast or too slow? Does the composition look pleasing to the eye? How did the camera movement you chose impact the overall image?</p><p> Based on your assessment, make any necessary adjustments to your settings and approach, and give it another go. Don&#39;t be discouraged if your first attempts don&#39;t turn out as expected. ICM photography is all about trial and error, so keep exploring and refining your technique.</p><h2 data-section id="intentional-camera-movement-tips"> Intentional camera movement tips</h2><p> Looking to quickly elevate your ICM photography? These tips and tricks can make a huge difference!</p><h3 data-section id="take-a-lot-of-photos"> 1. Take a lot of photos </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/riverweedsICMblandford750.jpg?ssl=1" alt="river weeds ICM" title="riverweedsICMblandford750.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> ICM photography is a fascinating and unpredictable technique that requires a bit of trial and error to master. If you&#39;re only snapping a few shots, chances are you won&#39;t end up with anything extraordinary, and you&#39;ll miss out on valuable learning opportunities.</p><p> To truly excel at intentional camera movement, you need to dedicate ample time to shooting and exploring different possibilities. Don&#39;t be afraid to click that shutter button repeatedly! The more photos you take, the more you&#39;ll familiarize yourself with the nuances of ICM and understand what works and what doesn&#39;t.</p><p> Once you&#39;ve captured a bunch of shots, set aside some quality time to review them. Take a close look at each image and consider what you like and dislike about it. Pay attention to the various elements, the movement, and the overall composition. This process of reflection and analysis will help you refine your technique and develop your own unique style.</p><p> Additionally, don&#39;t be afraid to experiment with different focal lengths and subjects. By trying out various approaches, you&#39;ll gain a better sense of your preferences and discover the aspects of ICM photography that truly resonate with you.</p><h3 data-section id="consider-including-one-sharp-element"> 2. Consider including one sharp element </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bluebellaction750.jpg?ssl=1" alt="intentional camera movement in bluebell woods" title="bluebellaction750.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Intentional camera movement photography is all about creating abstract images, but adding a touch of clarity or a recognizable element can enhance the overall impact of your final photo. Think of it as giving your viewer an anchor amidst the artistic chaos.</p><p> Including at least one sharp or easily identifiable subject within your abstract composition can provide a point of reference for your audience. It gives them something to hold onto while they explore the mesmerizing swirls and blurs of the image.</p><p> For example, imagine capturing the graceful movement of trees in a forest, with branches blending into a dreamy haze. Amidst this captivating blur, having one tree trunk sharply in focus can create a striking contrast. It draws attention and adds a sense of structure to the otherwise ethereal scene.</p><p> The sharp element could be anything that stands out in the midst of your intentional camera movements. It could be a person&#39;s silhouette, a prominent architectural feature, or even a colorful object placed strategically within the frame. The key is to ensure that this element remains clear and distinct, providing a visual focal point.</p><h3 data-section id="shoot-the-same-subject-at-different-times"> 3.

Light and shadow play a significant role in ICM, and by capturing your subject during various lighting conditions, you&#39;ll discover how the atmosphere and mood can change dramatically.</p><p> Once you&#39;ve found a subject that catches your eye, don&#39;t just snap a single shot and move on. Make a mental note of the subject and return to it repeatedly, capturing ICM shots at different times, such as during the golden hours (just after sunrise and just before sunset), the blue hour (the brief period before sunrise and after sunset), or even at night.</p><p> By exploring these different timeframes, you&#39;ll witness how the interplay of light and shadow transforms your subject, creating unique and captivating ICM images. Not only will this allow you to experiment with different effects, but it will also give you a chance to refine your skills and find your own personal style.</p><h2 data-section id="intentional-camera-movement-photography-final-words"> Intentional camera movement photography: final words</h2><p>现在你就拥有了！ We&#39;ve reached the end of our wild and wonderful journey through the world of ICM photography. You&#39;ve learned the ins and outs of this mesmerizing technique, including what it is, how it works, and you can use it to capture amazing abstract images.</p><p> Remember, intentional camera movement is all about breaking free from the constraints of traditional photography and letting your imagination run wild.

We&#39;ve handpicked 16 outstanding options to elevate your photos.</em></strong></p><p> Selecting the best lens for <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-ways-to-take-stunning-portraits/" class="ek-link">portrait photography</a> can be overwhelming, but it&#39;s also an essential task, whether you&#39;re a beginner, an intermediate enthusiast, or a professional. The right portrait lens will capture crisp, flattering images with a beautiful background blur – while the <em>wrong</em> portrait lens will produce soft photos that are prone to unpleasant distortion.</p><p> The good news is that there are plenty of amazing portrait lenses available, and many of them come with relatively affordable price tags. The bad news is that sorting through the wide array of focal lengths, features, compatibilities, sizes, and prices can be a time-consuming headache. Fortunately, I&#39;ve been capturing portraits for years, and I think I can help you out.</p><p> Below, I share the 16 best portrait lenses for photographers, including options for a variety of different camera types (DSLR and mirrorless, full-frame and APS-C), and portrait specialties. My list of top-notch portrait glass also offers selections for beginners on a budget, professionals seeking the best of the best, and everything in between.</p><p> Ready to grab the lens that&#39;ll take your portraits to the next level? Let&#39;s dive right in, starting with my number one pick:</p><h2 id="1-nikon-50mm-f-1-8g"> 1.

The lens is tack sharp and focuses quickly, and the 50mm focal length is great for headshots, medium shots, and even wider shots with groups. The large f/1.8 aperture turns busy backgrounds into buttery smooth <a aria-label="bokeh (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">bokeh</a> , and it works great in low-light situations, too. I have been shooting with this lens for nearly a decade and still bring it with me to portrait sessions because it just works so well.</p><p> You can also find similar inexpensive lenses from Sony, Canon, and other manufacturers – several of which are featured on this list! – so if you don&#39;t shoot with Nikon cameras, you can still pick up a 50mm f/1.8 lens for your camera at a great price. That said, I have used versions from other brands and tend to prefer the Nikon, but perhaps that&#39;s just my own personal bias; all of them do a great job with portraits and other photography situations, too.</p><p> These 50mm lenses often don&#39;t include advanced features like weather sealing or metal construction, but if you keep your expectations in check and are just looking for an outstanding lens to shoot portraits without breaking the bank, this is the one to get.</p><h3 id="pros">优点</h3><ul><li>Inexpensive; great price-to-performance ratio</li><li> Well-built</li><li> Very sharp</li><li> Amazing upgrade choice for new photographers who want better portraits than what their kit lens can offer</li></ul><h3 id="cons">缺点</h3><ul><li>Shooting wide open results in some unpleasant image artifacts like <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/chromatic-aberration-what-is-it-and-how-to-avoid-it/" target="_blank" aria-label="chromatic aberration (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">chromatic aberration</a> and an overall drop in sharpness</li><li> The focusing ring feels a little cheap and stiff</li></ul><h2 id="7-sony-fe-85mm-f-1-4-gm"> 2.

Everything you might expect is here: exquisite sharpness, beautiful background blur, fast autofocus, and sealing against dust and moisture. However, this lens also includes a few extra features that certain portrait photographers will appreciate.</p><p> The built-in focus lock button is great if you want to use the shutter button for focusing while instantly locking focus at a moment&#39;s notice (it essentially eliminates the need for <a aria-label="back-button focus (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/back-button-focus-what-is-it-and-why-should-you-try-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">back-button focus</a> ).

This lens offers a plethora of benefits that will take your portrait shots to the next level.</p><p> First and foremost, the 50mm focal length of this lens is incredibly versatile. It allows you to capture a wide range of portrait styles, from half-body shots that highlight the subject&#39;s expression and details, to full-body compositions that showcase their entire presence. Additionally, if you&#39;re into <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/environmental-portraits/" target="_blank" aria-label="environmental portraits (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">environmental portraits</a> where the subject is placed within a specific context or location, the 50mm focal length excels in capturing the perfect balance between the subject and their surroundings.</p><p> One standout feature of the Canon RF 50mm f/1.8 STM is its impressive maximum <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> of f/1.8. This wide aperture not only allows you to create stunning background bokeh, with creamy and beautifully blurred backgrounds, but it also proves to be invaluable in low-light situations. When shooting without flash in dimly lit environments, the wide maximum aperture enables you to maintain a fast shutter speed, resulting in sharp and well-exposed portraits even in challenging lighting conditions.</p><p> In terms of ergonomics, this lens hits the mark. It&#39;s compact, lightweight, and incredibly portable, making it an ideal choice for photographers on the go. Whether you&#39;re exploring the streets or traveling to distant lands, you can easily slip the Canon RF 50mm f/1.8 STM into your bag or purse and have it readily available whenever the perfect portrait opportunity arises.</p><p> And let&#39;s not forget the best part: the price.

It has long been a favorite of Canon shooters and with good reason: the 85mm focal length is great for headshots and medium shots, plus full-body and group photos, too. It&#39;s light, reasonably sized, and built to withstand the elements as well as some drops and falls. I know professional portrait photographers who use this lens exclusively, even over other options at their disposal like a 70-200mm f/2.8.</p><p> One key advantage of this particular lens is its built-in image stabilization, which is exceptionally useful when handholding at slower <a aria-label="shutter speeds (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speeds</a> .

There are plenty of other choices, including newer lenses from Nikon, Canon, and Sony that are specifically designed for mirrorless cameras, but this particular 70-200mm f/2.8 represents the pinnacle of lens construction for DSLR cameras. It&#39;s tack sharp at every aperture including wide open at f/2.8, it&#39;s designed to withstand years of daily use, and it has customizable buttons built right into the barrel so you can adapt the lens to your needs.</p><p> Portrait photographers love 70-200mm f/2.8 lenses because they give outstanding results without many compromises. You can get headshots, full-body portraits, and entire group photos where everyone is in focus but the background is beautifully blurry.

The Sony FE 135mm f/1.8 is a master of sharpness, capturing every intricate detail with breathtaking clarity. Whether you&#39;re photographing a professional model or a loved one, this lens ensures that your portraits will come out tack-sharp and highly detailed.</p><p> One of the standout features of this lens is its telephoto focal length of 135mm. This length provides a beautiful compression effect, which is not only highly flattering for your subjects but also helps in creating stunning bokeh. The background blur produced by the wide f/1.8 maximum aperture is simply mesmerizing, instantly elevating the overall aesthetics of your portraits.</p><p> Low-light situations pose no challenge for the Sony FE 135mm f/1.8. With its wide aperture, you can confidently shoot in dimly lit environments without compromising image quality. Whether you&#39;re capturing portraits at a dimly lit venue or during the golden hour, this lens allows you to maintain a fast shutter speed, resulting in sharp images that truly shine.</p><p> It&#39;s important to note that this lens is not the most compact option out there, so it may not be the best choice for casual or travel-oriented portrait photography. However, if you&#39;re seeking to take your portraits to the next level and already have a 50mm and an 85mm lens in your kit, the Sony FE 135mm f/1.8 is an excellent addition. Its exceptional image quality, telephoto reach, and ability to handle low light make it a go-to choice for professionals and serious enthusiasts.</p><p> While the Sony FE 135mm f/1.8 comes with a higher price tag, its performance and image results make it worth every penny.

Its 40mm focal length is wider than every other lens on this list, perfect for photographers who prefer to let a little more into their field of view to get a unique look.

The 40mm focal length results in a bit of distortion when shooting close-ups and headshots, but in normal daily use this wasn&#39;t a huge problem for me. Despite these drawbacks, there&#39;s almost an intangible beauty to this lens that&#39;s difficult to describe, which makes it wonderful for portraits as well as everyday shooting. I especially like how I can get several people in a shot for group portrait scenarios and still create a beautiful blurry background; at the end of the day, those results matter to me more than anything else.</p><h3 id="pros">优点</h3><ul><li>Amazing sharpness, even wide open at f/1.4</li><li> Good choice for daily use in mixed environments, not just portraits</li><li> Solid construction and an extra-large rubber grip around the focusing ring</li></ul><h3 id="cons">缺点</h3><ul><li>Expensive; it shoots great photos, but you pay a premium</li><li> 40mm is good for portraits, but not as widely used as longer focal lengths like 85mm</li><li> Autofocus is fine, but not as fast as some class-leading lenses</li></ul><h2 id="9-nikon-z-85mm-f-1-8-s"> 10.

Why not include other lenses with more varied focal lengths? Well, 85mm is the sweet spot for many portrait photographers, and when Nikon made this lens for their Z-mount mirrorless cameras, they took everything they had learned from their already-exceptional F-mount DSLR lenses and kicked it up a notch. It&#39;s got everything you would expect in a lens of this caliber and in this price range: sharp optics, solid construction, a massive grip for focusing, and good weather sealing – all in a package that isn&#39;t too big and won&#39;t weigh you down during long photo sessions.</p><p> While it&#39;s true that the f/1.8 aperture isn&#39;t as wide as the Canon 85mm f/1.4 or Sony 85mm f/1.4, this lens is also much less expensive and gets the job done nearly as well. And f/1.8 lenses can still be used in low light and are capable of very shallow depth of field, even if it&#39;s not quite as shallow as its f/1.4 brethren. (For reference, I almost never shoot my Nikon 85mm lens wider than f/2 or f/2.4, since the depth of field is wafer-thin.) The 85mm f/1.8 doesn&#39;t have built-in image stabilization, but almost every Nikon mirrorless camera comes with that already, so you can get sharp shots at slow shutter speeds even with non-stabilized lenses.

It checks nearly every possible box a portrait photographer might have on their wishlist, and to this day, it is widely regarded as one of the best portrait lenses of all time. Its medium telephoto focal length of 105mm means you can get beautiful close-ups without standing nose-to-nose with your subjects, and its incredible sharpness is the envy of many photographers. The insane f/1.4 aperture on this lens makes 70-200mm f/2.8 lenses weep, its autofocus is fast and reliable, and it even includes weather sealing so you can shoot in inclement weather.</p><p> If you like photographing portraits with medium-telephoto focal lengths, you&#39;ll love the 105mm f/1.4. You can get stunning close-ups and beautiful medium shots, all with amazing sharpness and beautiful background blur. This performance doesn&#39;t come cheap, though, and you can&#39;t really use the Nikon 105mm f/1.4 for much besides portraits. It&#39;s too bulky for daily casual shooting, and the 105mm focal length is ill-suited for nature, sports, and most other types of photography.

Why not have one lens that does both? Most zoom lenses have too many tradeoffs to be taken seriously by portrait photographers, but Canon set out to solve that problem with this <a aria-label="28-70mm f/2 zoom lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://geni.us/Canon28-70dPS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">28-70mm f/2 zoom lens</a> . Built for Canon RF mirrorless cameras, this lens pushes past most of its peers thanks to the f/2 aperture instead of the f/2.8 aperture that is common for similar zoom lenses (albeit with the tiny sacrifice of 28mm at the wide end instead of 24mm).</p><p> I tend to prefer longer focal lengths than what this lens offers, but just like the Sigma 40mm f/1.4, there are plenty of people for whom this lens is ideal. While the 28-70mm focal length essentially does the same work as two or three other lenses, its price is so high you could just purchase individual lenses instead. However, for an all-in-one workhorse, this lens is hard to beat. As you might expect, it is extremely sharp wide open at all focal lengths, has fast and reliable autofocus, and even sports a control ring that can be customized to change settings like aperture and ISO. If you shoot with Canon mirrorless cameras, like wider focal lengths, and want one lens to rule them all, this should be at the top of your list.</p><h3 id="pros">优点</h3><ul><li>Incredible versatility thanks to the extra-large f/2 maximum aperture across the entire focal range</li><li> Beautiful image quality at every focal length and aperture</li><li> Fast, reliable autofocus</li><li> Weather-resistant construction</li></ul><h3 id="cons">缺点</h3><ul><li>Very expensive; given the price of this lens, some photographers might prefer buying a few prime lenses, instead</li><li> Minimum focal length isn&#39;t as wide as the 24mm found on other lenses (however, 24-70mm lenses have smaller maximum apertures of f/2.8 instead of f/2)</li></ul><h2 id="10-tamron-70-210mm-f-4-di-vc-usd"> 14.

It&#39;s not a major drawback by any means, but it doesn&#39;t quite stack up against some of the more professional-oriented portrait lenses you can buy. This lens also isn&#39;t as sharp as its more expensive counterparts, especially in the corners, and build quality isn&#39;t as solid as other lenses, either. However, what this lens lacks in features it more than makes up for in price.

This lens marks a significant milestone for Nikon, as it&#39;s been a while since they released a 50mm lens with autofocus technology. But let me tell you, it&#39;s worth the wait!</p><p> Now, we all know the benefits of the classic 50mm focal length for portrait photography. It&#39;s versatile, allowing you to capture a variety of shots from half-body portraits to headshots. But what sets this lens apart is its incredible f/1.2 maximum aperture. With such a wide aperture, you can achieve dreamy bokeh that adds a touch of magic to your portraits. Imagine a beautifully blurred background that makes your subject pop, creating that professional and artistic look.</p><p> When it comes to the optical quality, Nikon doesn&#39;t disappoint. The image quality is simply stunning, delivering sharpness and clarity that will leave you in awe. Whether you&#39;re capturing portraits for social media, printing large photos, or displaying your work on a website, this lens ensures your images will look their absolute best.</p><p> In terms of build quality, the Nikon Z 50mm f/1.2 S doesn&#39;t cut any corners.

It features a large manual focusing ring that provides precise control, perfect for when you want to fine-tune the focus manually. Additionally, there&#39;s a programmable control ring that allows you to customize its function according to your shooting preferences. It&#39;s these little details that make the shooting experience with this lens so enjoyable and efficient.</p><p> Now, it&#39;s worth noting that the Nikon Z 50mm f/1.2 S lens is not lightweight. It has a solid build and feels substantial in your hands. If you prefer a more casual shooting style or prioritize portability, this lens might not be the best choice for you. However, for passionate Nikon Z users who want top-of-the-line performance and are willing to invest in quality, this lens is an enticing option that will take your portrait photography to new heights.</p><h3 id="pros">优点</h3><ul><li>Breathtaking bokeh</li><li> Standard portrait focal length</li><li> Amazing low-light capabilities</li><li> Excellent ergonomics</li></ul><h3 id="cons">缺点</h3><ul><li>Ultra-expensive</li><li> Heavy</li></ul><h2 id="best-lenses-for-portrait-photography-final-words"> Best lenses for portrait photography: final words</h2><p> Those are my top picks for portrait lenses in 2023, and I hope this gives you several options to consider – whether you&#39;re new to portraiture or you&#39;re a seasoned professional looking to upgrade your gear.</p><p> Great glass is just one component of portrait photography, though.

Leave your thoughts in the comments below!</em></p><h2 id="best-portrait-photography-lenses-faq"> Best portrait photography lenses FAQ </h2><div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1634766075403"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Do I need a prime lens to shoot portraits?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> No, but it helps. Prime lenses have wide apertures and sharp optics, which is why they are preferred by portrait photographers. Today&#39;s zoom lenses are better than the zooms of ten or twenty years ago, but you will still get the best results with a prime lens.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1634766149961"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">What is the best focal length for portraits?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> While everyone has their own preferences, 85mm is often considered to be a good portrait focal length. If you can only get one portrait lens, I would recommend going with an 85mm; this works well for headshots, full-body portraits, and group shots, too.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1634766289723"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">How can I shoot portraits with the kit zoom lens that came with my camera?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> While I do not recommend kit zoom lenses for paid client work, it is certainly possible to shoot portraits with them. Zoom in as far as you can go, open your aperture as wide as possible, put a lot of distance between your subject and the background, and you can get some decent shots.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1634766420612"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Is a DSLR or mirrorless camera better for portraits?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> Either type of camera is fully capable of producing great portraits. Mirrorless cameras have features like eye-detect autofocus that can certainly help, but even today many photographers still prefer DSLRs over mirrorless. It all comes down to personal preference. Thankfully, if you currently shoot with a Nikon or Canon DSLR and want to upgrade to mirrorless someday, both companies make adapters that let you use your current lenses on mirrorless cameras without any drop in quality.</p></div></div><p> The post<a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lens-for-portrait-photography/">16 Best Lenses for Portrait Photography (2023)</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com">Digital Photography School</a> .

In other words, focus stacking is <em>only</em> necessary if you&#39;re faced with a scene that can&#39;t be well handled by your camera setup&#39;s current depth of field capabilities.</p><p> Now, if you&#39;re familiar with camera optics, you&#39;ll know that the depth of field is affected by three key factors:</p><ul><li> Lens focal length</li><li> Distance to the subject</li><li> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="Lens aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Lens aperture</a></li></ul><p> So as you zoom your lens, move closer to your subject, or widen your lens aperture, the amount of the scene that&#39;s in focus will decrease. On the other hand, as you widen your lens, move away from your subject, or narrow your lens aperture, the amount of the scene that&#39;s in focus will <em>increase</em> .</p><p> In most situations, you can handle your depth of field requirements <em>without</em> focus stacking. If you&#39;re faced by a sweeping landscape, you can choose a wide-angle lens and you can narrow your aperture; that way, you can capture the entire scene in focus using a deep depth of field. And if you&#39;re faced by a standard close-up subject such as a flower, you can back up slightly from your subject and narrow your aperture to get your desirable depth of field.</p><p> But in a few situations, you won&#39;t be able to achieve a deep enough depth of field to keep the entire shot sharp (from the nearest foreground element to the most distant background element).</p><p> Specifically, you&#39;ll run into depth-of-field problems when working with:</p><ol><li> Very deep landscape scenes</li><li> Ultra-close macro subjects</li><li> Deep building interiors</li></ol><p> Your depth of field just won&#39;t be deep enough, and only parts of the shot will turn out sharp (while other parts will turn blurry).</p><p> Of course, you can always try to back up or use a wider lens, but that isn&#39;t always feasible (especially if you&#39;ve already chosen your composition). And you can narrow your aperture, but at a certain point, you&#39;ll start to run into optical problems caused by diffraction.</p><p> In such cases, you have two options:</p><p> You can take a single shot with a shallower depth of field and try to make the effect work. ( <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-get-shallow-depth-of-field-in-your-digital-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="Shallow depth of field shots (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Shallow depth of field shots</a> <em>can</em> look beautiful when done carefully!)</p><p> Or you can focus stack.</p><h2 data-section id="essential-focus-stacking-gear"> Essential focus-stacking gear</h2><p> Focus stacking is a technique that can be done with just a smartphone camera and zero fancy equipment! However, if you&#39;re serious about getting the best results, there are a few basic items that I highly recommend investing in. Here&#39;s what I recommend:</p><ul><li> A tripod. A tripod is your steadfast companion in focus stacking. It keeps your camera steady and ensures consistent composition as you capture a series of images. It&#39;s a game-changer when it comes to achieving sharp, aligned shots.</li><li> An interchangeable-lens camera. To have full control over your camera settings and the flexibility to swap lenses for different compositions, an interchangeable-lens camera is the way to go. Whether it&#39;s a mirrorless camera or a DSLR, any model will do the job just fine. Don&#39;t fret too much about the specific camera model; focus on the features that suit your genres of interest.</li><li> A lens that offers manual focusing. When it comes to focus stacking, having a lens capable of manual focusing is crucial. Manual focus allows you to precisely control the point of focus by rotating a ring on the lens. Fortunately, most lenses offer a switch for toggling between manual and autofocus, but before you get started, it&#39;s essential to ensure you have at least one lens that can be manually focused.</li><li> Focus-stacking software. While some cameras offer built-in automatic focus stacking, I strongly recommend using dedicated stacking software for more control and optimal results. Options like Photoshop provide solid stacking capabilities, but you might also want to consider specialized programs like Helicon Focus or Zerene Stacker for their powerful stacking features.</li></ul><h2 id="how-to-focus-stack-step-by-step"> How to focus stack: step by step</h2><p> Want to get started stacking your images? Let&#39;s take a look at how you can successfully carry out this technique, from shooting in the field to blending the images on the computer.</p><h3 id="step-1-pick-your-subject-choose-a-composition-and-set-your-exposure"> Step 1: Pick your subject, choose a composition, and set your exposure</h3><p> Focus stacking starts by locking down a subject and a composition.</p><p> Mount your camera on a tripod and carefully compose your photo. If you don&#39;t have a tripod, you can do handheld focus stacking, but you&#39;ll need to maintain the composition as carefully as possible.</p><p> (Quick aside: You&#39;ll struggle to focus stack scenes that feature moving subjects, which is part of the reason why portrait photographers, wildlife photographers, and street photographers rarely use this technique. Pick a scene that will remain steady for the few minutes it takes to set up your shot.)</p><p> Next, set your camera to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> , then dial in an <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure</a> . You should use the camera&#39;s <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/metering-modes-and-how-your-camera-meter-works/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure meter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure meter</a> and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/histograms-for-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="histogram (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">histogram</a> to guide you, and note that the exposure will remain fixed across <em>all</em> focus-stacked shots. Once you&#39;ve set your exposure, you should not change it, or else you&#39;ll need to do extra work standardizing the exposures when blending your shots later. (For the same reason, I&#39;d also recommend you select a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/introduction-to-white-balance/" target="_blank" aria-label="white balance (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">white balance</a> preset and dial it in. It doesn&#39;t need to be perfect – you can always make changes in post-processing – but if you can keep the white balance consistent, it&#39;ll make your job much easier down the line.)</p><p> And by the way: Before you proceed with the rest of the focus-stacking steps, make sure that your scene <em>actually</em> requires focus stacking. If you&#39;re using a wide-angle lens, you can probably shoot most landscape scenes at f/16 or so and get an image that&#39;s sharp throughout. It&#39;s only when you add in close foreground objects – thus increasing scene depth – that focus stacking becomes essential.</p><p> Not sure whether focus stacking is necessary? Take a test shot with your lens focused about one-third of the way into the scene, then review it on your camera LCD. Zoom in and check both the foreground and background. If everything turned out sharp, then you&#39;re good to go – but if parts of the shot are blurry, then you&#39;ll need to proceed with the focus stacking technique.</p><h3 id="step-2-switch-your-lens-to-manual-focus-and-take-your-first-shot"> Step 2: Switch your lens to manual focus and take your first shot</h3><p> Set your lens to manual focus. (There&#39;s usually a little AF/MF switch on the barrel.)</p><p> Then manual focus on the <em>nearest</em> part of the scene, such as the sand in the foreground (if you&#39;re shooting a seascape) or the tip of the flower petal (if you&#39;re shooting a close-up).</p><p> (If you&#39;re using a camera that doesn&#39;t offer manual focus, then you can autofocus on the nearest part of the scene. Just make sure that you get the autofocus point <em>exactly</em> where you want it.)</p><p> Take the first shot, making sure your exposure and composition remain locked in place.</p><h3 id="step-3-take-your-remaining-images"> Step 3: Take your remaining images</h3><p> At this point, you simply need to take a series of images while slowly moving the focus away from the foreground. Adjust the focus, take a shot, adjust again, take another shot, and so on, until you&#39;ve captured a sharp version of every part of the scene.</p><p> How many images do you need? That really depends on your scene/subject. Most focus-stacked landscapes require just two or three shots (one for the foreground and one for the background, or one each for the foreground, middleground, and background). The exception is if the foreground is unusually close to your lens or you&#39;re using a telephoto focal length, in which case you may need four, five, or more images. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-98709 size-post-large-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-98709" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:81.07%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="608" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Focus-stacking-4.jpg?resize=750%2C608&#038;ssl=1" alt="focus-stacked building with fence and garden" class="wp-image-98709" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Focus-stacking-4.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Focus-stacking-4.jpg?resize=300%2C243&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Focus-stacking-4.jpg?resize=600%2C486&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Focus-stacking-4.jpg?resize=717%2C581&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> To get this shot, I took three photos.

However, if you want to take your stacks above and beyond, here are a handful of additional expert tips:</p><h3 data-section id="watch-out-for-moving-subjects"> 1. Watch out for moving subjects</h3><p> Getting beautiful focus-stacked shots can be pretty straightforward, especially when you&#39;re photographing scenes with minimal movement, like still-life images or desert landscapes. But as soon as you add movement into the mix, things get more complicated. Let&#39;s say your scene features a tree waving in the wind. In this case, each file in the stack will capture the tree in a different position, making it very difficult, or even impossible, to blend effectively.</p><p> To overcome this challenge, it&#39;s crucial to shoot without movement in the scene. If you&#39;re photographing a flower on a windy day, consider using a plamp to hold it in place or even use your body to block the wind. By ensuring a stationary subject, you&#39;ll be able to capture a series of images with consistent focus points for successful stacking.</p><p> Alternatively, if capturing a moving subject is essential to your composition, you can take a different approach. Capture an image stack while ensuring the moving subject is captured with sufficient depth of field in a single image. Then, if needed, you can use manual masking techniques to overlay the sharply focused moving subject onto the scene.</p><p> With careful masking, you can also remove any areas where the moving subject created a ghosting effect, resulting in a seamless and striking focus-stacked image.</p><h3 data-section id="use-a-remote-release-when-stacking-in-low-light"> 2. Use a remote release when stacking in low light</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254314" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/focus-stacking-photography-8.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Focus stacking in photography" class="wp-image-254314" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/focus-stacking-photography-8-scaled.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/focus-stacking-photography-8-scaled.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/focus-stacking-photography-8-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/focus-stacking-photography-8-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/focus-stacking-photography-8-scaled.jpg?resize=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1365w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/focus-stacking-photography-8-scaled.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/focus-stacking-photography-8-scaled.jpg?w=1707&amp;ssl=1 1707w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Stacking can be done in good light, in which case your shutter speed will generally be fast enough to prevent vibrations caused by pressing the shutter button.</p><p> But if you&#39;re shooting indoors or after the sun has set, you may struggle to get a shutter speed above 1/60s or so. If that&#39;s the case, your tripod will prevent more general camera shake, but a remote release offers a handy method of avoiding blur caused by each press of the shutter button. This device allows you to trigger the camera from a distance, ensuring minimal vibrations and maximum sharpness throughout your image stack.</p><p> Here&#39;s how it works in practice: After adjusting the focus, you can wait for any vibrations to settle, then trigger the camera using the remote release. Once the image is captured, you can adjust the focus again, wait for stability, and repeat the process until you have obtained the complete series of images for your focus stack.</p><h3 data-section id="dont-be-afraid-to-try-handheld-stacking"> 3. Don&#39;t be afraid to try handheld stacking</h3><p> While using a tripod is highly recommended for focus stacking, it&#39;s not always feasible or practical in every situation. Thankfully, there&#39;s an alternative technique known as <em>handheld focus stacking</em> that can produce impressive results without the need for cumbersome support.</p><p> To perform handheld focus stacking, you&#39;ll need to keep your framing consistent as you capture a series of images. You can lean against a sturdy object or find a comfortable position to stabilize yourself. The key is to minimize camera movement between shots.</p><p> While handheld stacking may not yield the same level of precision as using a tripod, the results can still be quite solid. It&#39;s important to note that you may lose some content along the edges of the frame, requiring a crop during post-processing. To mitigate this, it&#39;s advisable to deliberately compose a little wider than your desired final composition, providing room for cropping later on.</p><p> Keep in mind that practice and experimentation will help you refine your handheld focus stacking technique. With experience, you&#39;ll be able to capture a series of images with consistent framing and achieve impressive focus-stacked results even without a tripod!</p><h3 data-section id="combine-focus-stacking-and-hdr-photography-for-outstanding-results"> 4.

Modern cameras often struggle to capture such scenes without blowing out the highlights or underexposing the shadows.</p><p> The HDR technique involves capturing a series of shots of the same composition, each exposed separately for the dark portions, light portions, and mid-toned portions. These images are then blended together in post-processing to create a final result that retains detail throughout the entire dynamic range.</p><p> Now, what if you want to focus stack a scene with a high dynamic range? The good news is that you don&#39;t have to choose one technique at the expense of the other. You can combine focus stacking and HDR for exceptional outcomes.</p><p> Instead of capturing just one image each time you adjust the lens focus, capture multiple images for each focus point, ensuring that you also expose separately for the different tones in the image. In post-processing, merge each set of bracketed images in the stack, creating an HDR version of each file. Once you have the HDR versions, continue with the standard focus-stacking approach.</p><p> By employing this combined technique, you can achieve a final image that not only boasts incredible depth of field through focus stacking but also maintains accurate exposure across the scene&#39;s entire dynamic range. This powerful combination allows you to capture and showcase scenes with stunning detail, even in challenging lighting conditions.</p><h3 data-section id="achieve-precise-macro-stacking-with-a-focusing-rail"> 5.

This handy tool attaches to your tripod and supports your camera, allowing you to make incremental adjustments in the focus position. Instead of manually adjusting the focus ring at ultra-high magnifications, you can set the focus on the front of your subject, take a shot, and then use the focusing rail to make subtle and precise adjustments to the focus point for subsequent shots.</p><p> By using a focusing rail, you eliminate the need for delicate manual adjustments, making the process of capturing a series of images for stacking much more manageable. It provides you with the control and precision needed to achieve optimal focus throughout the subject, ensuring each image in the stack contributes to a final result with exceptional detail and clarity.</p><p> While a focusing rail is not a mandatory tool for macro stacking, it significantly simplifies the process and improves the quality of your stacked images. So if you plan to do frequent close-up photography with stacking, purchasing a focusing rail can make a huge difference!</p><h2 id="focus-stacking-in-photography-final-words"> Focus stacking in photography: final words</h2><p> Now that you know what focus stacking is and how it works, you&#39;re ready to achieve great results with nothing more than a camera, a tripod, and a bit of Photoshop wizardry.</p><p> So go out there, unleash your creativity, and experiment with focus stacking. Capture the delicate petals of a flower, the rugged textures of a landscape, or the mesmerizing details of a macro subject. Do some stacking, and watch as you produce a stunningly sharp photo!</p><p> Now over to you:</p><p> <em>What do you plan to focus stack? Have you tried focus stacking before?

Think of it as a visual narrative that designed to capture attention and spark emotions.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-204522" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/z_KL52629.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Karen woman portrait" class="wp-image-204522" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/z_KL52629.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/z_KL52629.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/z_KL52629.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/z_KL52629.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/z_KL52629.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/z_KL52629.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> <a href="https://geni.us/NikonD800" target="_blank" aria-label="Nikon D800 (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenersponsored noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">Nikon D800</a> | 105mm | f/8 | 1/125s | ISO 400<br /> © Kevin Landwer-Johan.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Now, these images can revolve around a broad theme or focus on a specific storyline. For instance, you might create a photo essay celebrating the joy of companionship by capturing 10 heartwarming pictures of people sharing genuine laughter. On the other hand, you could have a photo essay delving into the everyday lives of fishermen in Wales by following a single fisherman&#39;s journey for a day or even a week.</p><p> It&#39;s important to note that photo essays don&#39;t necessarily have to stick to absolute truth. While some documentary photographers prefer to keep it authentic, others may employ techniques like manipulation or staging to create a more artistic impact. So there <em>is</em> room for creativity and interpretation.</p><h2 data-section id="why-you-should-create-a-photo-essay"> Why you should create a photo essay</h2><p> Photo essays have a way of expressing ideas and stories that words sometimes struggle to capture. They offer a visual narrative that can be incredibly powerful and impactful.</p><p> Firstly, photo essays are perfect when you have an idea or a point you want to convey, but you find yourself at a loss for words. Sometimes, emotions and concepts are better conveyed through images rather than paragraphs. So if you&#39;re struggling to articulate a message, you can let your photos do the talking for you.</p><p> Second, if you&#39;re interested in subjects that are highly visual, like the mesmerizing forms of architecture within a single city, photo essays are the way to go. Trying to describe the intricate details of a building or the play of light and shadows with words alone can be challenging. But through a series of captivating images, you can immerse your audience in the architecture.</p><p> And finally, if you&#39;re aiming to evoke emotions or make a powerful statement, photo essays are outstanding. Images have an incredible ability to shock, inspire, and move people in ways that words often struggle to achieve. So if you want to raise awareness about an environmental issue or ignite a sense of empathy, a compelling series of photographs can have a profound impact.</p><h2 data-section id="photo-essay-examples-and-ideas"> Photo essay examples and ideas</h2><p> Looking to create a photo essay but don&#39;t know where to start?

Historic sites</h3><p> Historic sites are often iconic, and plenty of photographers take a snapshot or two.</p><p> But with a photo essay, you can illustrate the site&#39;s history in greater depth.</p><p> Look for details of the location that many visitors miss. And use these to build an interesting story.</p><h3 data-section id="show-the-construction-of-a-building"> 19. Show the construction of a building</h3><p> Ever been away from a familiar place for a while only to return and find that things have changed? It happens all the time, especially in areas undergoing constant development. So why not grab your camera and document this transformation?</p><p> Here&#39;s the idea: Find a building that&#39;s currently under construction in your area. It could be a towering skyscraper, a modern office complex, or even a small-scale residential project. Whatever catches your eye! Then let the magic of photography unfold.</p><p> Make it a habit to take a photo every day or two. Watch as the building gradually takes shape and evolves. Capture the construction workers in action, the cranes reaching for the sky, and the scaffolding supporting the structure.</p><p> Once the building is complete, you&#39;ll have a treasure trove of images that chronicle its construction from start to finish!</p><h3 data-section id="document-the-changing-skyline-of-the-city"> 20. Document the changing skyline of the city</h3><p> This photo essay example is like the previous one, except it works on a much larger scale. Instead of photographing a single building as it&#39;s built, find a nice vantage point outside your nearest city, then photograph the changing skyline.</p><p> To create a remarkable photo essay showcasing the changing skyline, you&#39;ll need to scout out the perfect vantage point. Seek high ground that offers a commanding view of the city, allowing you to frame the skyline against the horizon. Look for spots that give you an unobstructed perspective, whether a rooftop terrace, a hillside park, or even a nearby bridge.</p><p> As you set out on your photography expedition, be patient and observant. Cities don&#39;t transform overnight; they change gradually over time. Embrace the passage of days, weeks, and months as you witness the slow evolution unfold.</p><p> Pro tip: To capture the essence of this transformation, experiment with various photographic techniques. Play with different angles, framing, and compositions to convey the grandeur and dynamism of the changing skyline. Plus, try shooting during the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-photograph-golden-hour/" target="_blank" aria-label="golden hours of sunrise and sunset (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">golden hours of sunrise and sunset</a> , when the soft light bathes the city in a warm glow and accentuates the architectural details.</p><h3 data-section id="photograph-your-pet"> 21.

While it may not boast the grandeur of Yosemite National Park, these hidden gems hold their own beauty, just waiting to be discovered and captured through the lens of your camera.</p><p> To embark on this type of photo essay adventure, start by exploring all the nooks and crannies of your chosen nature preserve. Wander along its winding trails, keeping an eye out for unique and captivating subjects that convey the essence of the preserve.</p><p> As you go along, try to photograph the intricate details of delicate wildflowers, the interplay of light filtering through a dense forest canopy, and the lively activities of birds and other wildlife.</p><h3 data-section id="show-the-same-subject-from-multiple-perspectives"> 23. Show the same subject from multiple perspectives</h3><p> It&#39;s possible to create an entire photo essay in a single afternoon – or even in a handful of minutes. If you don&#39;t love the idea of dedicating yourself to days of photographing for a single essay, this is a great option.</p><p> Simply find a subject you like, then endeavor to capture 10 unique images that include it. I&#39;d recommend photographing from different angles: up above, down low, from the right and left. You can also try getting experimental with creative techniques, such as intentional camera movement and freelensing. If all goes well, you&#39;ll have a very cool set of images featuring one of your favorite subjects!</p><p> By showcasing the same subject from multiple perspectives, you invite viewers on a visual journey. They get to see different facets, textures, and details that they might have overlooked in a single photograph. It adds depth and richness to your photo essay, making it both immersive and dynamic.</p><h2 data-section id="photo-essay-ideas-final-words"> Photo essay ideas: final words</h2><p> Remember: Photo essays are all about communicating a concept or a story through images rather than words. So embrace the process and use images to express yourself!</p><p> Whether you choose to follow a sports team through a thrilling season, document the growth of your little ones, or explore the hidden treasures of your local town, each photo essay has its own magic waiting to be unlocked. It&#39;s a chance to explore your creativity and create images in your own style.</p><p> So look at the world around you. Grab your gear and venture out into the wild.

And indeed, printing a photo – or two dozen, or a hundred – is a wonderful experience for nearly every photographer who tries it; it comes with all sorts of benefits, including a newfound appreciation for the photographic medium, not to mention a deep and lasting sense of satisfaction.</p><p> But when photographers do get around to printing, they tend to gravitate toward wall art and small paper prints, overlooking one of the most elegant methods of image display: the photo book. I think that&#39;s a <em>huge</em> mistake. I&#39;ve printed hundreds of images for art shows, yet my favorite print product of all time is, without a doubt, a photo book I designed and purchased from <a href="https://www.saal-digital.com/?utm_source=content&amp;utm_medium=collaboration&amp;utm_campaign=DigitalPhotographySchool&amp;campid=CAMP00016005" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Saal Digital</a> . (No, I&#39;m not exaggerating; I keep it front and center on my coffee table at home.)</p><p> In this article, I explain why photo books are so incredible, and I offer five practical reasons you should definitely order a book of your own. Whether you&#39;re struggling to determine the best way to turn those digital files into physical works of art or you&#39;re simply on the fence about printing your images, it&#39;s time to explore some photo book magic!</p><h2 data-section id="a-photo-book-keeps-your-important-images-safe"> 1.

Your images might seem safe on your desktop or saved to the cloud, but so much can happen: hard drives can fail or get lost, servers can crash, or you can unwittingly delete years of photos with a couple of poorly chosen clicks.</p><p> On the other hand, high-quality photo books are made to <em>last</em> . My <a href="https://www.saal-digital.com/photo-book/professional-line/?utm_source=content&amp;utm_medium=collaboration&amp;utm_campaign=DigitalPhotographySchool&amp;campid=CAMP00016005" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Saal Digital Professional Line Photo Book</a> , for instance, features an acrylic cover that protects it from spills, dirt, and other domestic hazards, as well as archival-quality matte paper that won&#39;t fade for over 100 years. (In fact, a photo book is even more fade-resistant than a wall-mounted print because the images are lit only when being viewed.)</p><p> Plus, a photo book is very difficult to lose. It&#39;s not like a flash drive, which can fall behind your desk, or even little 4×6 prints, which often get filed away in a dark corner of the basement, never to be seen again. Simply set your photo book on your coffee table or bookshelf, and you&#39;ll always know precisely where to find it.</p><p> And because you can include dozens or hundreds of images in a single book, you don&#39;t have to worry about prioritizing a few photos over the rest. You have plenty of room to include your most essential shots – of landscapes, of your travels, or of your loved ones. So if you&#39;re serious about preserving your treasured images, a photo book is an excellent option.</p><h2 data-section id="a-photo-book-looks-great-on-your-coffee-table"> 2.

Then it&#39;s essential that you put your best foot forward when displaying your work. Since most photographers rely on portfolio websites, a photo book could be your ticket to standing out.</p><p> I&#39;m not claiming that you should neglect your online presence – only that you might use a physical book to supplement your marketing. If you have a meeting with potential commercial clients, for instance, you could take along a photo book to show them just how great your images look when printed. And if you&#39;re an event photographer trying to sell your services to a wedding couple, you could use the photo book to share samples of your best work.</p><p> You&#39;ll need to design the book carefully to give off professional vibes, and that&#39;s where custom design options come in handy. The best photo book printers let you pick out your preferred colors and materials, and some even let you adjust the page design. I also recommend ordering from a company that doesn&#39;t add its logo to any of the pages; that way, the final product has a truly authentic feel. Again, <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.saal-digital.com/photo-book/professional-line/?utm_source=content&amp;utm_medium=collaboration&amp;utm_campaign=DigitalPhotographySchool&amp;campid=CAMP00016005" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Saal Digital&#39;s Professional Line Photo Books</a> are a favorite here; they meet all of the above requirements and more!</p><p> By the way, while photo books are certainly a great way to share images with clients, you don&#39;t need to be an active professional to appreciate a nice physical portfolio. As an enthusiast, you likely encounter other photographers – perhaps at meetups and photo walks – and bringing out your custom photo book is a great way to start a discussion or even get feedback on your work.</p><h2 data-section id="you-can-carry-a-photo-book-everywhere"> 5.

You can take it with you when you visit friends, and you can carry it with you when you travel to see relatives.

In this article, I delve into the advantages and disadvantages of these two formats, and I explain who should pick JPEG and who should pick HEIC.</p><p> Let&#39;s dive right in!</p><h2 data-section id="jpeg-format-overview"> JPEG format: overview</h2><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253126" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-dog-frisbee.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="JPEG vs HEIC: A dog running across a field with a frisbee in its mouth." class="wp-image-253126" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-dog-frisbee.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-dog-frisbee.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-dog-frisbee.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-dog-frisbee.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-dog-frisbee.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-dog-frisbee.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> My Fuji X100F – used to capture this image – only offers two file format options: RAW and JPEG.

When I was a kid in the early days of the internet and connected computing, bandwidth was a precious commodity. Modems were slow and hard drives were measured in megabytes, not gigabytes. Downloading or uploading a few pictures meant waiting anywhere from minutes to hours, and that was on a <em>good</em> day. Formats such as GIF and BMP dominated the nascent networked landscape, but the former was limited to 256 colors and the latter took up far too much storage space. These troublesome limitations made <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-all-the-different-image-file-formats/" target="_blank" aria-label="GIF, BMP, and other image formats (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">GIF, BMP, and other image formats</a> frustrating and cumbersome even as the internet took hold in households across the world.</p><p> JPEG, an image format created by the Joint Picture Experts Group in the early 1990s, was designed to give the best of both worlds. Images saved as JPEGs could store significantly more color data than their outdated counterparts while simultaneously taking up less storage space. It was a win-win, and it was exactly what the world needed as image sharing exploded during the decade of grunge music, ripped jeans, and dial-up internet.</p><p> JPEG has since become the dominant image format across the entire digital-picture landscape, and all cameras, from mirrorless to DSLR to mobile, are able to create JPEG files.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253468" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-dog-frisbee-compressed.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="JPEG vs HEIC: A dog running across a field with a frisbee in its mouth.

Note the streaks in the blue sky, the reduction in sharpness in the grass, and the chunky pixelated trees in the background of this compressed version of my initial JPEG.</figcaption></figure></div><p> One of the most useful characteristics of the JPEG, and a key reason this format exploded in popularity, is the flexibility it gives people when creating images. You, the user, get to specify whether you want to prioritize image quality or file size. Most cameras let you select the level of compression you want to apply to your JPEG files; this is what affects their visual fidelity as well as their file size. Image editing software allows you to do the same, and even to this day, JPEG remains an excellent choice for photographers who want to balance visual quality with reasonable file sizes – as well as folks who want images that are easy to email, share on social media, and send to friends in a group text.</p><p> However, while JPEG excels at offering a great balance between image quality and storage space, it lacks many capabilities that are important to modern digital photography. JPEG files throw out lots of useful color data to shrink the file size, which means you have very little flexibility when adjusting colors, bringing details out from the shadows, or creating shots with a high dynamic range. Additionally, JPEG files are 8-bit, which means each pixel can contain 256 tonal values for each of the three primary colors of light (red/green/blue). That was plenty back in the 1990s, but modern digital cameras capture so much information that 8-bit color often just doesn&#39;t cut it anymore.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253470" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-roller-blading.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="JPEG vs HEIC: A child on rollerblades jumping over a ramp." class="wp-image-253470" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-roller-blading.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-roller-blading.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-roller-blading.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-roller-blading.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-roller-blading.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-roller-blading.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> I use JPEG for shots like this when I need to take lots of images and cull and share them quickly.</figcaption></figure></div><p> As cameras, especially smartphones, become increasingly capable, and with even casual photographers demanding better quality and expanded editing freedom, a new image format was needed to address these shortcomings: HEIC, which I explore in the next section.</p><p> <strong>JPEG pros:</strong><br /> • One of the most widely used image formats in the world<br /> • Easy to share and edit JPEG files due to the format&#39;s incredible popularity<br /> • Good mix of size and quality</p><p> <strong>JPEG cons:</strong><br /> • 8-bit color format can be limiting for modern photographers<br /> • Compression can leave unpleasant artifacts<br /> • Nearly unusable for video recording</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253678" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-mount-scott.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="JPEG vs HEIC: Tourists walking around on top of a mountain, with lakes in the distance." class="wp-image-253678" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-mount-scott.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-mount-scott.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-mount-scott.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-mount-scott.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-mount-scott.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-mount-scott.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> I take nearly all my casual, everyday shots and even travel snaps in JPEG.

HEIC was designed to meet the needs of modern digital photographers while <em>also</em> taking into consideration the small file sizes that remain essential for posting and sharing.</p><p> HEIC utilizes a compression algorithm that, much like JPEG, allows pictures to be small in size but also ensures the files include enough color information for in-depth editing. HEIC also supports features like transparency and storing more than one image in a single file. JPEG, while useful, simply cannot accommodate modern options like these because they didn&#39;t exist when JPEG was invented.</p><p> HEIC is a 10-bit image format. Therefore, each pixel can contain 1024 values of each red/green/blue color. That&#39;s a <em>dramatic</em> increase over JPEG&#39;s 256 color values per channel, and it allows HEIC images to capture rich color detail and sharpness that are impossible with JPEG images. Most mobile phone cameras use complex computing techniques to make everyday shots look amazing, and HEIC handles these kinds of photos with aplomb. Plus, because a single HEIC file can contain multiple images, the format can also be used for video – a medium that is increasingly popular among modern photographers and even casual shooters.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253677" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-lookout-mountain-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="JPEG vs HEIC: Tourists looking out over a city and a river from on top of a mountain." class="wp-image-253677" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-lookout-mountain-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-lookout-mountain-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-lookout-mountain-1.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-lookout-mountain-1.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-lookout-mountain-1.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> I shot this on my iPhone using the HEIC format.

If you&#39;re the type of photographer who prefers a hands-on approach to editing and post-processing, there are still a lot of good reasons to use JPEG.</p><p> Almost all modern <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-photo-editing-software/" target="_blank" aria-label="image-editing software (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">image-editing software</a> works with HEIC files, but legacy software – such as older versions of Photoshop and some computers running older operating systems – don&#39;t support them. You are more likely to encounter situations where, due to the software you are using or even your computer&#39;s operating system, you are unable to work with HEIC files, whereas JPEG files pose no problems at all.</p><p> Fortunately, these issues will become increasingly uncommon as software gets updated and more people upgrade to newer computers. And the fact that HEIC supports transparency gives this format a significant advantage over JPEG in many post-processing situations.</p><p> Because of this, there isn&#39;t a clear winner in terms of which format is best for post-processing flexibility; it all depends on your unique needs, the software you use, and your goals as a photo editor.

If you shoot in JPEG and share your picture over text or email, or you post it to a social network, it&#39;ll work just fine. It doesn&#39;t matter what device anyone is using, what software they&#39;ve installed, or what internet browser your friends and family use. JPEG works great, and it works <em>everywhere</em> . Even websites that require you to upload files for a warranty claim or proof of purchase will accept JPEG as a valid format, but they&#39;ll rarely accept HEIC.</p><p> HEIC, by contrast, is so new that you can never be quite sure that your photos will be viewable when you share them. The list of websites, apps, and social networks that allow HEIC is growing rapidly, but it just can&#39;t compete with the sheer dominance of JPEG in the photo-sharing landscape.</p><p> Even Apple, which uses HEIC by default on iPhones, acknowledges the format&#39;s compatibility limitations. You have two options for taking photos: HEIC (High Efficiency) or JPEG (Most Compatible.) As HEIC grows in popularity, this particular point will become less relevant – but for now, if you want your images to be shareable with the widest number of people across the most possible platforms, JPEG still wins.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253813" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:50.93%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="382" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-iphone-formats.jpeg?resize=750%2C382&#038;ssl=1" alt="JPEG vs HEIC: iPhone settings options for High Efficiency and Most Compatible." class="wp-image-253813" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-iphone-formats.jpeg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-iphone-formats.jpeg?resize=300%2C153&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-iphone-formats.jpeg?resize=600%2C306&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-heic-iphone-formats.jpeg?resize=717%2C365&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> To change the image format on your iPhone, go to <strong>Settings>;Camera>;Formats</strong> .

Both formats can store EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) data such as exposure, camera model, time, date, and even GPS location.</p><p> However, HEIC is capable of storing additional <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/photographers-metadata-defined-usage/" target="_blank" aria-label="metadata (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">metadata</a> such as a depth map, which can be used by software like Lightroom to apply masks based on how close or far away certain parts of the picture are. These extra metadata options might not be useful for many people, but for professionals, hobbyists, and those who just want to explore more editing options, HEIC metadata is simply better than what JPEG can offer.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-253827" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:74.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1122" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-lightroom-depth-range-dog-pool.jpg?resize=1500%2C1122&#038;ssl=1" alt="JPEG vs HEIC: A dog in a child's play pool." class="wp-image-253827" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-lightroom-depth-range-dog-pool.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-lightroom-depth-range-dog-pool.jpg?resize=300%2C224&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-lightroom-depth-range-dog-pool.jpg?resize=600%2C449&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-lightroom-depth-range-dog-pool.jpg?resize=768%2C574&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jpeg-vs-lightroom-depth-range-dog-pool.jpg?resize=717%2C536&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> HEIC can store metadata information beyond what JPEG allows, such as depth.

JPEG was an incredible option for decades, but it has been eclipsed by HEIC in almost every way.</p><p> Of course, JPEG is by no means unusable and continues to be the default option for many cameras and mobile phones, but HEIC offers more features with less storage space. While not as widely adopted as JPEG, HEIC will almost certainly become universal, and for people who want to make use of its advanced options right now, HEIC is an outstanding choice.</p><h2 data-section id="jpeg-vs-heic-faq"> JPEG vs HEIC FAQ </h2><div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1687145018774"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Can I convert a JPEG file to HEIC?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> JPEG files can be converted to HEIC with many modern software programs such as Photoshop and Luminar. While the resulting HEIC file will be smaller in size, you can&#39;t add metadata like a depth map by simply converting from JPEG.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1687192409965"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Can I convert a HEIC file to JPEG?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> Any application that can open HEIC files can export them as JPEG. This is a great option for people who want to shoot in HEIC but occasionally need to share files with people whose computers don&#39;t support HEIC.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1687192484532"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">How do I know if my camera shoots in HEIC?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> All DSLR and mirrorless cameras have options to select the file type and quality. Traditionally, the options have been limited to JPEG and RAW, but HEIC is now a standard option on many cameras. You will need to look in your camera&#39;s image-quality or image-format menu options or refer to the manufacturer&#39;s website. You can also do an online search for “[Your Camera Model] HEIC,” which should give you the information you need.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1687192671359"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Which format is best for sharing on social media from my mobile phone?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> If your mobile phone supports HEIC, that&#39;s generally preferred over JPEG. Most social media apps now support HEIC, and the increase in image quality that HEIC offers over JPEG will help make your images stand out and get noticed. Some social media filters even work with HEIC metadata like depth maps to help you get more creative with your edits.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1687192805966"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Will HEIC become outdated just like JPEG?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> Eventually, HEIC will likely be replaced with other image formats, but that&#39;s no reason not to embrace it now. No one knows what format will eventually take over from HEIC and it could be years, even decades, before that happens. Until then, the advantages that HEIC offers over JPEG will become increasingly important, especially as more people start to use HEIC instead of JPEG.</p></div></div><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/jpeg-vs-heic/">JPEG vs HEIC: Which File Format Is Right for You?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com">Digital Photography School</a> .

Whether you&#39;re juggling a demanding job, dealing with family responsibilities, or simply navigating the ups and downs of daily life, stress seems to be a constant companion.</p><p> But photography offers a unique escape, a chance to disconnect from the chaos and reconnect with your inner self. It&#39;s a mindful practice that encourages you to be fully present in the moment. As you frame a shot, adjusting your focus and composing the elements just right, the rest of the world fades into the background. Your attention shifts to the details, the interplay of light and shadow, and the subtle nuances that make each scene come alive.</p><p> Engaging in slower-paced forms of photography, like capturing delicate flowers up close, architectural marvels, or sweeping landscapes, can be especially soothing. These moments of stillness can become your sanctuary, and the act of creating something beautiful with your camera can become an act of self-care.</p><p> Some describe the act of photographing as if they&#39;re in a trance, completely absorbed in the process. Whether you&#39;re venturing into the great outdoors or photographing everyday scenes in your own backyard, photography offers a portal to serenity.</p><h2 data-section id="photography-will-improve-your-health-and-fitness"> 5.

Then you&#39;ll need to walk the streets, which requires plenty of physical activity.</p><p> Of course, not all forms of photography require strenuous exercise. If you prefer a more easygoing approach, that&#39;s okay, too; genres such as <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/macro-photography-for-beginners-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">macro photography</a> and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-ways-to-take-stunning-portraits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portrait photography</a> will get you out of the house, but won&#39;t make you feel like a marathon runner. Make sense?</p><p> One caveat: Camera gear is heavy, so it&#39;s important to be aware of any health or safety concerns. Carrying a camera on a strap around your neck (plus a backpack on your back) for a long time can be quite painful. Fortunately, there are many lightweight cameras available, not to mention excellent camera-carrying devices, compact tripods, and other burden-easing equipment.</p><h2 data-section id="you-get-to-be-creative"> 6.

She says that creativity is good for us as individuals, and that the feeling you get when you finally capture an awesome sunrise photo, the feeling you get when you finally capture <em>the image</em> , is a wonderful thing.</p><p> But being creative is something we rarely do as adults. Enter photography, which is hugely creative and allows for endless flexibility in shooting and artistic style. That style can grow as you learn more and start to experiment with different genres.</p><p> Bottom line: Creativity is fun, and it provides a necessary counterbalance for the stressful demands of a modern lifestyle.</p><h2 data-section id="photography-will-help-you-communicate-with-friends-and-family"> 7.

Our simple, step-by-step approach will elevate your images to a whole new level.</strong></em></p><p> Long exposure photography produces some of the most powerful, timeless, and all-around breathtaking images you&#39;ll <em>ever</em> encounter. It&#39;s a technique that&#39;s beloved by thousands of professionals, and many beginners spend hours, days, and even years attempting to master the approach.</p><p> Now, as a veteran in the field, I have good news and bad news. The good news is that creating stunning long exposure shots isn&#39;t nearly as hard as it seems – in fact, even beginners are capable of producing beautiful results. The bad news is that the technique <em>does</em> require some specialized knowledge; in other words, it&#39;s not an approach you can easily master by fiddling around with your camera settings.</p><p> Fortunately, I&#39;m here to help! I&#39;ve captured countless long exposure images, and in this article, I share everything I&#39;ve learned along the way, including:</p><ul><li> The gear you need to get started</li><li> A simple, step-by-step process for pro-level long exposure photography</li><li> Plenty of tips, examples, and ideas for amazing images</li><li> Much more!</li></ul><p> By the time you&#39;re done, you&#39;ll see how simple it is to get satisfying results on your first attempt, and you&#39;ll know <em>exactly</em> what to do the next time you&#39;re faced with a great long exposure opportunity.</p><p> Let&#39;s dive right in!</p><h2 data-section id="what-is-long-exposure-photography"> What is long exposure photography?</h2><p> Long exposure photography is a technique that involves capturing a single image over an extended period of time. By dialing in a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> that lasts 1/30s, 1s, 10s, or even an hour, it&#39;s possible to render moving subjects as beautiful blurs while keeping stationary subjects tack-sharp. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Picture-1.jpg?ssl=1" alt="long exposure rocks in the water" title="Picture-1.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Although it may sound complex, the theory behind long exposure images is actually quite simple. It&#39;s all about controlling the amount of time the camera sensor “sees” the world. While stationary subjects remain unchanged regardless of the shutter speed, subjects in motion start to reveal more movement as the exposure time increases. This creates a captivating contrast between sharpness and blur, resulting in images that evoke a sense of fantasy and reality combined.</p><p> Let me share a simple example: Imagine you&#39;re taking a photo of a wave crashing against a rock. If you use a fast shutter speed, like 1/1000s, the wave will be frozen in mid-action. But with long exposure, you can slow things down and make the wave look like a soft, ethereal mist. The longer you extend the shutter speed, from 1/100s to 1/10s to 1s or even an hour, the more the moving subjects will blur, adding a touch of magic to your final image.</p><h2 data-section id="when-is-the-long-exposure-technique-useful"> When is the long exposure technique useful?</h2><p> Simply put, a long exposures approach is perfect if you want to deliberately incorporate blur into your photos. While some blurring can happen naturally in photography, especially in low-light conditions, long exposure photographers intentionally use blur to create captivating, fine-art style images that blend fantasy and reality.</p><p> To get the best results, it&#39;s important to choose a scene that combines elements in motion with stationary subjects. <em>This balance is key</em> . If your scene is constantly moving, like a duck bobbing among the waves, using long exposure will turn the entire shot into a blur. On the other hand, if your scene lacks any motion, such as a leaf resting on a rock, the entire image will appear sharp and won&#39;t feature any of the the mesmerizing effects that long exposure snappers adore.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254138" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Long Exposure Photography: A Step-By-Step Guide (+ Tips)" class="wp-image-254138" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Landscape photographers particularly love the long exposure technique.为什么？ Because the beauty of landscapes often lies in their mix of movement and stillness. Waves crashing on the shore, clouds drifting across the sky, and trees swaying in the wind provide the perfect blend of elements. By using long exposures, you can capture these scenes in a way that makes clouds appear like painted streaks and moving water transform into a soft, misty flow.</p><p> But don&#39;t limit yourself to landscapes! Long exposure can enhance a variety of subjects and genres. Whether you&#39;re capturing the grandeur of architectural structures, the energy of bustling street scenes, the depth of portraiture, or even the beauty of wildlife, the technique offers endless creative possibilities.</p><h2 data-section id="essential-gear-for-long-exposure-images"> Essential gear for long exposure images</h2><p> Long exposure photography doesn&#39;t require sophisticated or expensive gear, but it&#39;s also not a technique you can pull off using a handheld point-and-shoot camera. Here&#39;s the equipment I recommend for both casual and serious photographers:</p><h3 data-section id="an-interchangeable-lens-camera"> An interchangeable-lens camera</h3><p> While it&#39;s true that you can achieve impressive results with various devices, including smartphones, using an interchangeable-lens camera, such as a DSLR or a mirrorless camera, will give you more control and flexibility.</p><p> An interchangeable-lens camera allows you to manually adjust your settings, giving you precise control over your long exposure shots. This level of control is invaluable when you want to fine-tune the results and capture the image exactly as you envision it.</p><p> Furthermore, interchangeable-lens cameras offer a wide range of lenses to choose from. Unlike smartphone cameras, which lack the same level of sharpness and versatility, interchangeable-lens cameras give you the freedom to choose from a variety of high-quality lenses produced by renowned brands like Canon, Nikon, or Sony.</p><h3 data-section id="a-wide-angle-lens"> A wide-angle lens</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254136" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Long Exposure Photography: A Step-By-Step Guide (+ Tips)" class="wp-image-254136" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-4.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-4.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-4.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Wide-angle lenses provide you with a broad perspective, allowing you to incorporate a wide range of elements in your composition. Whether it&#39;s capturing the movement of clouds in the background or the graceful flow of waves in the foreground, a wide-angle lens gives you the freedom to include multiple layers and create a sense of depth in your images.</p><p> By using a wide-angle lens, you can capture scenes with a three-dimensional feel. The expansive view helps you include captivating foreground, midground, and background elements, adding depth and visual interest to your photos.</p><h3 data-section id="a-tripod"> A tripod</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254137" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-7.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="Long Exposure Photography: A Step-By-Step Guide (+ Tips)" class="wp-image-254137" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-7.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-7.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-7.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-7.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-7.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Now, let&#39;s talk about an absolute essential accessory for long exposure photography: the tripod. When it comes to capturing those mesmerizing long exposure shots, a tripod is non-negotiable.</p><p>为什么？ A tripod will keep your camera rock-steady throughout those extended exposures. Without it, you&#39;ll end up with frustratingly blurry shots, no matter how advanced your camera&#39;s image stabilization is.</p><p> Note: Not all tripods are created equal. It&#39;s crucial to invest in a quality tripod that can withstand the elements, especially if you&#39;re shooting near the coast where gusts of wind can be quite demanding.</p><p> But while you want a tripod that is sturdy, you also don&#39;t want to feel like you&#39;re lugging around a heavy piece of equipment. Look for a tripod that strikes the right balance between durability and portability, making it easier for you to carry it on your photography adventures.</p><h3 data-section id="a-neutral-density-filter"> A neutral density filter</h3><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/neutral-density-filters-landscape-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="Neutral density filters (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Neutral density filters</a> are like sunglasses for your camera lens, allowing you to control the amount of light that reaches the sensor. They play a crucial role in long exposure photography, especially when shooting during the day or in bright conditions.</p><p> By using a neutral density filter, you can lengthen your shutter speed without overexposing the final image. This means you can capture those mesmerizing long exposures even in broad daylight or during <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-photograph-golden-hour/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">the golden hours</a> .</p><p> These filters come in various strengths, typically measured in stops. The higher the number of stops, the darker the filter, and the longer the exposure you can achieve. Common strengths include 3-stop, 6-stop, and 10-stop filters.</p><p> When using a neutral density filter, it&#39;s important to find a balance between the desired effect and the amount of light reduction. A lighter filter may be sufficient for slightly lengthened exposures, while a stronger filter is needed for ultra-long exposures.</p><h3 data-section id="a-remote-release"> A remote release</h3><p> A <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/8-benefits-using-wireless-remote-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="remote release (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">remote release</a> is technically optional for long exposures, but in my view, it really is a game-changer.

If you look at the long exposure shots throughout this article, you&#39;ll notice that they almost always feature <a aria-label="clouds (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-clouds-to-enhance-and-improve-your-images/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">clouds</a> as part of intense, eye-catching skies.</p><p> Therefore, partly cloudy skies are often best for long exposure photography, though you can also work with mostly cloudy or even moody, overcast horizons. Flat white skies (ie, clouds with no texture) are best avoided – in general, the long exposure effect will be lost on these scenes, and you&#39;ll end up with a drab shot.</p><p> Most important of all, a day with a cloudless sky is a good day to have a drink with friends, not to make long exposures. No clouds mean no drama, and as with flat overcast skies, a long exposure won&#39;t actually <em>do</em> much.</p><h3 data-section id="step-visit-the-location-well-in-advance"> Step 2: Visit the location well in advance</h3><p> In a long exposure photo, the world looks completely different from how you see it with your eyes. You must see a long exposure scene with your mind, imagining the look of moving clouds or the force of the sea. And this takes <em>time</em> – certainly longer than it takes to shoot a single, fast-shutter-speed composition.</p><p> To address this issue, and to ensure you return home with a strong shot or two, I recommend you <a aria-label="scout the location (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/importance-scouting-landscape-photographers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">scout the location</a> ahead of time. Think about any moving objects you might encounter, such as clouds, water, or even birds. Try to determine how they&#39;ll move on the day of your long exposure photoshoot (you might even take some long exposure test shots).</p><p> Also, use a <a aria-label="photo planning app (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/photopills-the-photographers-swiss-army-knife/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">photo planning app</a> to determine where the sun will be positioned during your final shot, then take steps to avoid putting it in the frame.为什么？ Well, the sun moves across the sky, so if you include it in your composition, you&#39;ll end up with a bright streak of light, which generally does <em>not</em> look great in an otherwise magical long exposure shot. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Picture-2.jpg?ssl=1" alt="seaside cliffs long exposure" title="Picture-2.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 data-section id="step-set-up-your-gear"> Step 3: Set up your gear</h3><p> At this point in the long exposure shooting process, you&#39;ll want to mount your camera on the tripod, then set up any relevant accessories, such as your filter holder (if you plan to use drop-in filters), and your remote shutter release. (As I discussed above, a remote release is hugely helpful, though you can also get away with a remote shooting app on your phone or your camera&#39;s self-timer).</p><p> Note: While you&#39;ll need to install the filter holder on the front of your lens, wait to actually add the filter. This is very important!</p><h3 data-section id="step-compose-the-image-and-lock-focus"> Step 4: Compose the image and lock focus</h3><p> Refine your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-elements-of-composition-in-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="composition (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">composition</a> , then set your focus.</p><p> In general, you&#39;ll want to keep the entire shot sharp from foreground to background, so focus at the <a aria-label="hyperfocal distance (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-find-and-use-hyperfocal-distance-for-sharp-backgrounds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">hyperfocal distance</a> (about a third of the way into the scene). If you&#39;re struggling to determine where to focus, try using a depth-of-field calculator such as <a aria-label="PhotoPills (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.photopills.com/calculators/dof" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">PhotoPills</a> .</p><p> If you are using manual focus, go ahead and set the lens&#39;s focus ring exactly where you want it. If you are using autofocus, position your active autofocus point over your main subject, half-press the shutter button to engage the focus, then toggle your lens from <em>Autofocus</em> to <em>Manual</em> . That way, the focus will remain locked, even if you accidentally press the shutter button again. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Picture-3.jpg?ssl=1" alt="lighthouse long exposure" title="Picture-3.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 data-section id="step-set-the-exposure"> Step 5: Set the exposure</h3><p> Now it&#39;s time to choose your essential camera settings. First, set your camera to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="Manual (M) mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual (M) mode</a> or <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/" target="_blank" aria-label="Aperture Priority (A/Av) mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Aperture Priority (A/Av) mode</a> and your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> to your camera&#39;s lowest native value (probably ISO 50, ISO 100, or ISO 200).</p><p> Then set the <a aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> to an appropriate value for the scene (for <a aria-label="landscapes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/11-surefire-tips-for-improving-your-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">landscapes</a> , I suggest between f/8 and f/11), pick the <a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> based on your camera&#39;s recommendation, and take a test shot.</p><p> Check your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-read-and-use-histograms/" target="_blank" aria-label="histogram (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">histogram</a> to determine whether you&#39;ve nailed the exposure (do not trust your display; it is too bright!). The test is complete when you get a correct exposure, so adjust your shutter speed or exposure compensation, then keep shooting until you get the result you want.</p><p> (Side note: It&#39;s true that there is no universally correct result on the histogram, but there are histograms that are universally incorrect; namely, histograms skewed completely to the right or left side, indicating overexposure or underexposure, respectively.)</p><p> Once a test shot is successful, write down the shutter speed you used for that image, then move on to the next step.</p><h3 data-section id="step-add-your-filter"> Step 6: Add your filter</h3><p> Now add your neutral density filter. If you&#39;re shooting in near darkness and you don&#39;t need an ultra-long exposure (eg, you&#39;re okay with an exposure in the five-second to thirty-second range), you can get away with shooting filterless, but for most long exposure shots, a filter is a good idea.</p><p> If your filter is very strong (10 stops, for example), you will not be able to see through the viewfinder or Live View. Do not worry, though – if you have followed the guide up to this point, you will notice that we have already made the composition and set the focus. You may be shooting blind, but all is prepared and your camera will see everything perfectly. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Picture-4.jpg?ssl=1" alt="water moving on the rocks" title="Picture-4.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 data-section id="step-switch-to-bulb-mode"> Step 7: Switch to Bulb mode</h3><p> <a aria-label="Bulb mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/using-bulb-mode-long-exposure-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Bulb mode</a> allows you to discard your camera&#39;s thirty-second shutter speed limit, so if your camera has this option, I recommend using it. If your camera doesn&#39;t have Bulb mode, or if your filter isn&#39;t especially dark and/or you&#39;re shooting in strong light, you may not need to make this change.</p><h3 data-section id="step-calculate-the-right-shutter-speed-and-take-your-long-exposure-shot"> Step 8: Calculate the right shutter speed and take your long exposure shot</h3><p> You&#39;re almost there; how are you holding up? In this step, all you need to do is determine the perfect shutter speed, which requires a simple calculation.</p><p> Remember the shutter speed that you noted down from the test shot you took during Step 5? Now you must adjust the shutter speed to compensate for the number of stops introduced by the filter.</p><p> For example, if your test shot was 1/15s and you&#39;re using a 10-stop filter, you&#39;ll need to decrease the shutter speed by 10 stops, for a shutter speed of approximately 60 seconds.</p><p> (If you&#39;re <em>not</em> using a filter, then you&#39;ll decrease your shutter speed by zero stops.)</p><p> Also, don&#39;t let the mathematics intimidate you. On the internet, you can easily find conversion tables and apps for your smartphone that will do the conversion in moments.</p><p> Finally, take your photo! </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Picture-5.jpg?ssl=1" alt="seaside sunset" title="Picture-5.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 data-section id="step-check-the-histogram-again"> Step 9: Check the histogram again</h3><p> Once you&#39;ve taken the shot, check the histogram as a final precaution.</p><p> If the new histogram is approximately equal to the histogram of the test shot, you&#39;ve accomplished your mission (feel proud!). But if the new histogram is shifted too far to the right or the left, repeat the shot again, but adjust the shutter speed accordingly.</p><h2 data-section id="tips-and-ideas-for-amazing-long-exposure-images"> Tips and ideas for amazing long exposure images</h2><p> Now that you&#39;re familiar with the basics of the approach, I&#39;d like to share a few long exposure ideas and tips to ensure consistently outstanding results, starting with:</p><h3 data-section id="dont-be-afraid-to-use-ultra-long-shutter-speeds"> 1.

But here&#39;s the thing: By pushing beyond these limits and venturing into the realm of ultra-long exposures, you open up a whole new world of creative possibilities.</p><p> When you extend your shutter speed beyond 30 seconds, something magical happens. Clouds start streaking across the sky, resembling delicate brushstrokes on a canvas. Water loses its form and transforms into a dreamy, ethereal blur. And if you&#39;re patient enough to use a shutter speed of long minutes or even hours, your images can acquire an enchanting sense of timelessness.</p><p> Capturing these ultra-long exposures does require a specific approach. You&#39;ll need a powerful neutral density filter to control the amount of light entering your lens, and it&#39;s often best to shoot during the golden hours or even at night to avoid overexposure. But even with this inconvenience, the results are absolutely worth it!</p><h3 data-section id="try-capturing-light-trails"> 2.

If the sky features a scattering of clouds, these can add a touch of magic by streaking across the frame.</p><p> Pro tip: If you can position yourself near a body of water, such as a river or a lake, it will provide a captivating foreground element that complements the buildings in the background.</p><p> To capture these breathtaking cityscapes, set up your camera on a sturdy tripod to keep it steady throughout the long exposure. Select a shutter speed that allows for an extended period of light capture, such as several seconds or even minutes. This will create the desired effect of smooth, flowing lights and ethereal streaks. Experiment with different exposure times to find the perfect balance between capturing movement and maintaining sharpness in the stationary elements of the composition.</p><p> Don&#39;t forget to review and adjust your settings as you go. Take a moment to preview the images on your camera&#39;s LCD screen and make any necessary tweaks to achieve the desired result.

With a little bit of creativity and the right techniques, you can turn bustling city streets into mesmerizing works of art.</p><p> To get started, find a location with lots of movement, like a bustling square or a busy train station. Look for interesting architectural elements or captivating streetlights that can serve as your backdrop. These stationary elements will provide a solid foundation for your shot.</p><p> Now, here comes the fun part. Set your camera on a tripod to keep it steady and choose a shutter speed of around 1 second. This will allow enough time to capture the motion of people passing by. Position yourself strategically to compose the shot, making sure to include the stationary elements in the frame.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254128" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-11.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Long Exposure Photography: A Step-By-Step Guide (+ Tips)" class="wp-image-254128" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-11.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-11.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-11.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-11.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-11.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/long-exposure-photography-11.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Once everything is set, wait for the perfect moment when people are in motion. Press the shutter button and let the magic happen. As the exposure continues, the moving individuals will appear as ghostly figures, creating a sense of energy and movement in contrast to the static elements. It&#39;s like freezing a moment in time while everything else is in motion.</p><p> Experimentation is key here. Depending on the speed at which people are moving and the desired effect, you may need to adjust your shutter speed. Play around with different settings, reviewing each shot on your camera&#39;s LCD screen. Don&#39;t be afraid to slow things down even further or speed them up to achieve the desired level of motion blur.</p><h3 data-section id="photograph-buildings-with-cloud-streaks"> 6.

This next idea is all about capturing buildings with mesmerizing cloud streaks in the background.</p><p> First things first, find yourself a building with an interesting exterior. Think majestic churches, sleek skyscrapers, or even historic landmarks. The key is to have a subject that stands out and demands attention.</p><p> Now, choose a day with a decent amount of clouds. You don&#39;t want it to be completely overcast, but a few puffy white ones drifting by will do the trick. These fluffy creatures will become the perfect backdrop for your architectural masterpiece.</p><p> To achieve those dreamy cloud streaks, you&#39;ll need to slow down your shutter speed substantially. This is where a strong neutral density filter comes into play, allowing you to extend the exposure time without overexposing the shot.</p><p> Frame your shot to showcase the building in all its glory. Pay attention to the angles, lines, and unique details that make the structure stand out. Once you have the perfect composition, it&#39;s showtime!</p><p> Trigger the shutter and watch as the clouds gracefully drift across the sky. Aim for an exposure time of several minutes or more, depending on the desired effect. This will give the clouds enough time to create those beautiful streaks while keeping the building tack-sharp.</p><p> Pro tip: Once you&#39;ve captured the shot, consider converting it to black and white during post-processing. The contrast between the sharp architectural details and the ethereal cloud streaks is bound to leave a lasting impression!</p><h3 data-section id="bring-plenty-of-batteries"> 7. Bring plenty of batteries</h3><p> Long exposure photography can be an exhilarating experience, but it can also be a real drain on your camera&#39;s battery life. You wouldn&#39;t want to miss out on capturing that perfect shot just because your battery decides to call it quits. That&#39;s why it&#39;s crucial to come prepared with an ample supply of batteries to keep you shooting without interruption.</p><p> When you embark on your long exposure adventures, make sure you pack more than enough batteries to keep your camera powered up. While a single battery might last you a decent amount of time for regular photography outings, long exposures can put a heavier demand on power.</p><p> It&#39;s a good rule of thumb to bring at least two spare batteries with you, and if you&#39;re planning an all-day photography escapade, having three or even four extras can be a game-changer. This recommendation holds particularly true if you&#39;re using a mirrorless camera that&#39;s known for a shorter battery life.</p><p> Ensure that your extra batteries are fully charged before you head out. This simple step can save you from the disappointment of discovering that your backup batteries are just as drained as the one in your camera. A little proactive charging goes a long way in keeping your long exposure journey uninterrupted.</p><h2 data-section id="how-to-capture-stunning-long-exposure-photos-final-words"> How to capture stunning long exposure photos: final words</h2><p> Well, there you have it: This comprehensive guide to mastering long exposure photography is complete!

I recommend starting out with long exposure photography in the very early morning or the very late evening; that way, you&#39;ll be able to see what you&#39;re photographing, but the limited light will allow for impressively long exposures. Generally speaking, the <em>easiest</em> time to do long exposure photography is any moment when the light is limited.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1613197644843"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Can you take long exposure photos in daylight?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer">是的！ However, you&#39;ll need a neutral density filter. Otherwise, your long exposure images will turn out too bright.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1613197657440"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Why are my long exposure shots white?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> If your long exposure photos are white, then you&#39;re <em>overexposing</em> your images. You&#39;ll need to increase the shutter speed, narrow the aperture, or drop the ISO to compensate for this issue.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1613197678970"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">What is meant by “long exposure” in photography?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> Long exposure refers to a technique where you keep the shutter open for an unusually long period of time. So instead of capturing an image in a split second, you trigger the shutter button and wait – often for minutes or even hours – until the exposure is finished!</p></div></div><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/step-by-step-guide-to-long-exposure-photography/">Long Exposure Photography: A Step-By-Step Guide (+ Tips)</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com">Digital Photography School</a> .

Also, avoid setting up a group shot directly in front of a window where the light from your flash might reflect back in an unpleasant way.</p><h2 data-section id="use-a-wide-angle-lens"> 3. Use a wide-angle lens</h2><p> If you want to capture stunning group photos that include everyone from your best friends to your entire extended family, choosing the right lens is essential.</p><p> Forget about telephoto lenses or standard lenses that zoom in too far, limiting your ability to include everyone. Instead, opt for a <a aria-label="wide-angle lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/7-ways-to-get-more-out-of-a-wide-angle-lens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">wide-angle lens</a> , which provides a more expansive perspective and ensures that every smiling face is captured in the shot. If you&#39;re using a standard smartphone camera, you&#39;re in luck, as most of them come equipped with a wide-angle lens or offer it as part of their camera array.</p><p> For those using more advanced cameras like DSLRs or mirrorless models with interchangeable lenses, make sure to pick a lens in the 14-35mm range. This will provide a wide focal length that keeps all your subjects comfortably within the frame. Note that many standard kit lenses that come with these cameras offer wide-angle capabilities and can do a fantastic job of capturing your group photos.</p><h2 data-section id="try-to-coordinate-the-groups-clothing"> 4.

That&#39;s why coordinating clothing for group photos can make a big difference in how your images turn out.</p><p> Now, I know it&#39;s not always possible to have everyone wear matching outfits or go for a full-on uniform look. But whenever you have the opportunity to coordinate the clothing, I highly recommend taking it!</p><p> The key is to aim for a cohesive and harmonious visual appeal. Avoid busy patterns, flashy designs, or overly bright colors that could distract from the main focus – your beautiful group. Instead, opt for solid colors and more subdued tones that complement each other.</p><p> Think of it this way: You want the clothing choices to work together, like different instruments playing in harmony. It&#39;s not about everyone wearing the same exact outfit (although that can create a striking effect!). Rather, it&#39;s about ensuring that no single person stands out too much and that the colors play well with each other.</p><p> Consider suggesting a theme or color palette for the group. You can ask your subjects to work around earth tones, cool blues and purples, or warm reds and yellows. This way, even if they&#39;re wearing different clothes, the overall visual impact will be cohesive and pleasing to the eye.</p><p> Remember, clothing coordination is just one aspect of capturing a great group photo, but it can make a remarkable difference. So, take a little extra time to discuss clothing choices with your subjects before the shoot. When everyone looks well-coordinated and stylish, it adds an extra touch of professionalism and unity to your group photos.</p><h2 data-section id="take-multiple-shots"> 5. Take multiple shots</h2><p> Sometimes, it&#39;s tough to get <em>everyone</em> looking just right at the exact same time.</p><p> That&#39;s why I highly recommend you take multiple photos quickly; I often switch my camera to <a aria-label="continuous shooting mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/burst-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">continuous shooting mode</a> and photograph in short bursts. The first shot is often no good – but the shot or two directly after gives a group that looks less posed and more relaxed.</p><p> On a related note, shoot some frames before everyone is ready. Sometimes, the organization of a group shot can be quite comical and image-worthy (as people tell each other where to go and jostle for position).</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-205428" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-7.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="kids in a group waving" class="wp-image-205428" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-7.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-7.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-7.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-7.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-7.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-take-group-photos-7.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Also, mix up the framing of your shots a little. If you have a zoom lens, try capturing some shots at a wide focal length and some shots that are more tightly framed.</p><h2 data-section id="get-in-close"> 6. Get in close</h2><p> Try to get as close as you can to the group you&#39;re photographing (without cutting out group members, of course!). The closer you can get, the more detail you&#39;ll capture in their faces – something that can really elevate a shot.</p><p> If your group is small, step in and take some <a aria-label="head and shoulder shots (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-tips-for-photographing-great-headshots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">head and shoulder shots</a> .

Tall people will go to the back, short people to the front. But there are other things you can do to improve the photo&#39;s composition:</p><ul><li> If the event is centered around one or two people (like a wedding or a birthday), make the hosts the focal point by putting them right in the middle of the group (you can add variation by taking some shots of everyone looking at the camera and other shots of everyone looking at the person/couple).</li><li> For formal group photos, put taller members toward the back <em>center</em> of the shot, with shorter people along the edges.</li><li> Try not to make the group too deep (ie, keep the distance between the front line of people and the back line of people as small as you can). This will help keep everyone in focus. If the composition does end up being deep, use a narrow aperture.</li><li> Tell everyone to raise their chins a little; they&#39;ll thank you later when they see the shot without any double chins!</li></ul><h2 data-section id="do-some-candid-group-photos"> 8.

In fact, some of the most memorable shots come from capturing candid moments. So, let loose and have some fun with your group photography!</p><p> When you&#39;re starting your group session, it&#39;s great to begin with some traditional posed shots to ensure you have those classic portraits. Once you have those in the bag, it&#39;s time to mix things up a bit.</p><p> Instead of directing your subjects to pose, encourage them to interact naturally with each other. Tell jokes, share stories, or ask them to engage in an activity together. These genuine interactions will bring out their personalities and create authentic moments that make the photo come alive.</p><p> The key to capturing candid group photos is to be ready for those spontaneous moments. Keep your camera at the ready, observing the group dynamics and anticipating when those magic moments might happen. It might take a bit of patience, but the results will be worth it.</p><p> Don&#39;t worry if your subjects feel a bit self-conscious at first. Once they get absorbed in their conversations or activities, they&#39;ll forget about the camera, and that&#39;s when the magic happens. People laughing, sharing a genuine embrace, or lost in conversation – these are the moments that truly reflect the bond within the group.</p><p> If you want to encourage even more interaction, give your subjects a specific task or activity. It could be something simple like asking them to sing a song, play a game, or even guess each other&#39;s favorite things. These activities not only help them relax but also create opportunities for unique and spontaneous shots.</p><p> Remember, candid group photos bring out the joy and authenticity of the moment. They capture the true essence of the group&#39;s dynamic, making the photo more engaging and relatable.</p><p> So, embrace the unexpected, encourage laughter, and let your group be themselves.</p><h2 data-section id="time-your-group-shot-well"> 9.

The way you should do this varies from situation to situation – but consider using a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/starting-with-off-camera-flash-techniques/" target="_blank" aria-label="flash (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">flash</a> if the group is small enough and you are close enough for it to take effect, especially if the main source of light is coming from behind the group.</p><p> If it&#39;s a bright, sunny day and the sun is low in the sky, try not to face your subjects toward the light – otherwise, you&#39;ll end up with a collection of squinting faces.</p><h2 data-section id="use-the-right-aperture"> 11. Use the right aperture</h2><p> Capturing group portraits with everyone in sharp focus can be a challenge, especially when you have multiple rows of subjects. But fear not! With the right understanding of depth of field and the appropriate camera settings, you can achieve stunning group photos where every face shines through.</p><p> Depth of field refers to the range of distance in an image that appears acceptably sharp. To ensure everyone in your group photo remains in focus, you need to control your lens&#39;s depth of field. The key is to use a narrower aperture, which means selecting a higher f-stop value.</p><p> Here&#39;s how it works. When you set a higher f-stop, such as f/8, it creates a larger depth of field. This means that a larger area in front of and behind your focused point will be in sharp focus. By doing this, you&#39;ll be able to keep all your subjects, whether they&#39;re in the front row or the back row, beautifully sharp.</p><p> However, it&#39;s important to note that narrowing the aperture reduces the amount of light hitting the camera sensor. In bright outdoor conditions, this won&#39;t be a problem. But if you&#39;re shooting in lower light or indoors, you might need to compensate for the reduced light by using a tripod to keep your camera steady or adjusting other camera settings accordingly.</p><h2 data-section id="watch-the-edges-of-the-frame"> 12.

That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to check the edges of your frame before snapping the shot.</p><p> Take a quick look on the right and left sides of the frame to make sure nobody&#39;s been cut off. If you see any missing heads or limbs, just step back a bit or zoom out your lens a touch. And if you can&#39;t do either of those, try repositioning the group to get them closer together.</p><p> While you&#39;re at it, don&#39;t forget to check the bottom of the frame too. If you&#39;re doing a full-body shot, you don&#39;t want to chop off anybody&#39;s feet!</p><p> Remember, paying attention to the image edges ensures that everyone is included in the photo, making for a more complete and satisfying group shot.</p><h2 data-section id="take-control"> 13.

It happened for two reasons:</p><ol><li> They weren&#39;t quick enough.</li><li> They didn&#39;t communicate well with the group.</li></ol><p> When shooting a group photo, it&#39;s important to keep talking, let the group know what you want them to do, motivate them to smile, tell them that they look great, and make clear how long you&#39;ll need them for.</p><p> It&#39;s also important to give your subjects a reason to pose for the photograph (and to listen to you). At a wedding, you might motivate people by saying “The happy couple has asked me to get some group shots.” At a sporting event, you could say, “Let&#39;s take a group photo to celebrate our win.” When you give people a reason to pose, you&#39;ll find they are much more willing to stand for a few minutes while you snap photos.</p><p> Here&#39;s another very useful line to use with a group: “If you can see the camera, then it can see you.” This one is key if you want to be able to see each person&#39;s face in the final image.</p><p> If there are other photographers, just wait until they&#39;ve all finished their shots, then get the attention of the full group. Otherwise, you&#39;ll get everyone looking in different directions.</p><p> Of course, you don&#39;t want to be a dictator when posing your group – otherwise, your group shots will include some very angry expressions. The best photographers know how to get people&#39;s attention and communicate what they want, while also keeping people relaxed and having fun.</p><h2 data-section id="get-up-high-when-photographing-large-groups"> 14. Get up high when photographing large groups</h2><p> Large groups of people can be very difficult to photograph. Even with careful staggering and tiering, you&#39;ll struggle to fit everyone into the shot.</p><p> One solution is to <em>elevate</em> yourself. If I&#39;m photographing a wedding and the couple wants one big group shot, I&#39;ll arrange for a ladder to be present, or I&#39;ll find some other way to get up high (I&#39;ve even climbed up onto church roofs!). A high vantage point lets you fit a lot of people into the frame while still remaining quite close to the group. It also gives an interesting perspective, especially if you&#39;re using a nice, wide focal length.</p><h2 data-section id="use-a-tripod"> 15.

Simply set your camera on a tripod, set the exposure, and set the focus. Then guide your subjects through different poses – and when everything looks just right, you can quickly press the shutter button!</p><h2 data-section id="bring-a-remote-release"> 16. Bring a remote release</h2><p> If you want to be part of your group photos or take shots for clients without being stuck behind the camera, using a remote release is the way to go. This handy device lets you trigger your camera shutter from a distance, giving you the freedom to join in the photo while ensuring a steady shot.</p><p> A remote release is a small gadget that fits right in the palm of your hand. It connects wirelessly or via a cable to your camera, allowing you to snap the picture without physically touching the camera. It&#39;s a game-changer for capturing group shots with ease.</p><p> Imagine this: you gather everyone, carefully pose them, and then effortlessly join them in the frame. With a remote release, you simply stand among your group, press the button on the remote, and voila! The camera captures the perfect moment without any blurriness caused by camera shake.</p><p> Sure, you could use the self-timer function on your camera, but let&#39;s be honest, it&#39;s not the most convenient option. You have to set the timer, run into position, and then repeat the process for every shot. It can be a bit of a hassle, especially if you want to capture multiple group photos or spontaneous moments.</p><p> By using a remote release, you eliminate the need for rushing back and forth. You can relax, focus on your group, and be present in the moment while capturing fantastic group photos effortlessly.</p><h2 data-section id="use-an-assistant"> 17. Use an assistant</h2><p> If you have a very large group, an assistant can be super helpful. For one, they can get the group organized – tell people when to come, where to stand, etc.</p><p> An assistant is also incredibly handy if you are taking multiple group shots (like at a wedding when you&#39;re photographing different configurations of a family). In such a case, I often ask the couple to provide me with a family member or a friend who can ensure we have everyone we need in each shot.</p><p> Having a family member act as your assistant ensures you don&#39;t miss anyone (assuming they&#39;re related to members of the group). Plus, the group will be familiar with them and will therefore respond well when the “assistant” orders them around.</p><h2 data-section id="smile"> 18.

During a group session, there&#39;s nothing worse than a grumpy, stressed-out photographer. Have fun and enjoy the process of getting your shots, and you&#39;ll find the group will, too.</p><p> In fact, after photographing a wedding, I usually come home with an incredibly sore face from all the smiling I&#39;ve done! I find the best way to get the couple and their family to relax and smile is to smile at them. It really does work.</p><h2 data-section id="how-to-take-good-group-photos-final-words"> How to take good group photos: final words</h2><p> Well, there you have it!

Start by using the wide-angle lens on your smartphone camera. Make sure everyone is posed nicely, then frame the shot to include everyone in the frame. Set the focus on the front row, and when you&#39;re ready, simply tap the shutter button to capture the photo.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1687808868991"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">What are the best camera settings for a group photo?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> The ideal camera settings for a group photo may vary depending on the lighting conditions, but here&#39;s a good starting point: Use a low ISO setting, around 100, to minimize noise. Opt for a reasonably fast shutter speed, such as 1/250s, to avoid motion blur. Finally, select a fairly narrow aperture, like f/8, to ensure that most, if not all, of your subjects are in focus.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1687808876302"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">How do you take group pictures with everyone in focus?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> To ensure everyone is in focus, it&#39;s important to use a narrow aperture. Choose a higher f-stop value, like f/8, rather than a low f-stop value, which would create a shallow depth of field. By using a narrower aperture, you&#39;ll increase the depth of field, allowing more of your subjects to remain in focus.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1687808885359"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">What&#39;s the best lens for group shots?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> When it comes to group shots, wide-angle lenses are your best bet. They allow you to capture a larger field of view, making it easier to include everyone in the frame. Look for a lens in the wide-angle range, and keep in mind that wider is generally better. However, be cautious with ultra-wide lenses to avoid excessive distortion.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1687808895477"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">How can I be in my own group photo?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> If you want to be in your own group photo, there are a couple of options. One way is to use a remote release, which lets you trigger the camera from a distance after you&#39;ve positioned yourself with the group. Another option is to use the self-timer function on your camera. Set a short delay, like 2 or 10 seconds, then quickly join the group before the camera takes the shot. Just be prepared to move swiftly!</p></div></div><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-take-great-group-photos/">How to Take Group Photos: 18 Essential Tips</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com">Digital Photography School</a> .
