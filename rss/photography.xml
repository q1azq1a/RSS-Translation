The pop of orange in a sunset or the vibrancy of a field of wildflowers can be stunning. Yet, there&#39;s something captivating about black-and-white landscape photography. With a focus on contrast, texture, and form, black-and-white photos strip away distractions. They direct your attention to the core of the scene.</p><p> In the old days, photographers started with black-and-white because that&#39;s all they had. So when you&#39;re shooting in monochrome, you&#39;re kind of paying homage to the roots of landscape photography. Plus, you don&#39;t have to decide right away whether you&#39;ll keep the photo in black-and-white. If you&#39;re shooting in RAW, which I highly recommend, you can make that choice later during post-processing.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256052" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-628.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Landscape Photography: A Comprehensive Guide (+ 23 Expert Tips)" class="wp-image-256052" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-628.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-628.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-628.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-628.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-628.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-628.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> That said, it&#39;s useful to consider black-and-white conversion while shooting.

Here, viewfinder gridlines can be helpful. Most cameras have these activated by default, but if you don&#39;t see them, head into the settings menu and switch them on.</p><p> And if you use the gridlines but you still struggle to keep things straight, you might consider purchasing a bubble level. You can attach one of these to your camera&#39;s hot shoe, and you can use it as a reference when setting up new compositions.</p><h3 data-section id="combine-light-and-shadow"> 19. Combine light and shadow</h3><p> You might have heard the saying that photography is the art of painting with light. Well, it&#39;s not just about the light; it&#39;s also about the shadows. Combining light and shadow in your landscape shots can result in some truly stunning images. The contrast between illuminated areas and dark shadows adds depth, creates mood, and draws the eye to key parts of the frame.</p><p> Waiting for the perfect interplay of light and shadow often requires patience. One of the best times to capture this is when the sky is overcast, and the sun is peeking through the clouds. When that ray of sunshine breaks through and lights up a portion of the landscape while leaving the rest in shadow, you&#39;ve got yourself a golden opportunity.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256049" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-63.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="Landscape Photography: A Comprehensive Guide (+ 23 Expert Tips)" class="wp-image-256049" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-63.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-63.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-63.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-63.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-63.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-63.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Another scenario is during sunrise or sunset.

Try HDR techniques</h3><p> HDR photography sometimes gets a bad rap, largely because of overdone, unrealistic results. But this doesn&#39;t mean you should shy away from it. When you&#39;re faced with a challenging scene, such as a sunset over the ocean, your camera might not capture the full range of light. That&#39;s where HDR comes in handy. The idea is to take multiple shots at different exposure levels. One for the shadows, one for the midtones, and one for the highlights.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256071" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:65.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="983" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-614.jpg?resize=1500%2C983&#038;ssl=1" alt="Landscape Photography: A Comprehensive Guide (+ 23 Expert Tips)" class="wp-image-256071" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-614.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-614.jpg?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-614.jpg?resize=600%2C393&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-614.jpg?resize=768%2C503&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-614.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-614.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-614.jpg?resize=717%2C470&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Once you&#39;ve got your series of photos, the next step is blending them together. Software like Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom can merge these images into one. The result? A photo with details in both the darkest and brightest areas, much like how our eyes perceive the world.</p><p> But remember, subtlety is your friend. It&#39;s easy to go overboard with contrast and saturation sliders. Less is often more when it comes to HDR in landscape photography. Aim for a balanced, natural look to bring out the best in your photos.</p><h3 data-section id="change-your-point-of-view"> 21.

In particular, look for an interesting angle or point of view, where you approach the composition from an interesting direction. You should have fun with this; try getting down low, finding a high vantage point, walking off to the left or the right, or even shooting from directly above (see the next tip!).</p><p> Often, these unconventional images are astonishingly powerful, in part because they show the landscape from a never-before-seen perspective.</p><p> It&#39;s important to bear in mind, however, that you should still pay careful attention to your gear and lighting. A unique perspective can add a lot to an image, but the best landscape shots combine well-chosen gear, great lighting, <em>and</em> a great perspective for a beautiful result.</p><h3 data-section id="capture-aerial-landscape-images"> 22.

Aerial landscape photography has grown in popularity, thanks largely to the accessibility of drones. These nifty flying cameras allow you to capture views that were once only possible from helicopters or planes.</p><p> But capturing great aerial shots isn&#39;t as easy as simply sending a drone up and hitting the shutter button. It&#39;s an art form that has its own rules and challenges. Your composition skills are more important than ever. After all, from up high, you can see patterns and shapes that are invisible from ground level. Rivers look like veins, roads like stitches, and forests like broccoli!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256048" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="994" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-621.jpg?resize=1500%2C994&#038;ssl=1" alt="Landscape Photography: A Comprehensive Guide (+ 23 Expert Tips)" class="wp-image-256048" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-621.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-621.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-621.jpg?resize=600%2C398&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-621.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-621.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-621.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-621.jpg?resize=717%2C475&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> When you&#39;re starting out with aerial photography, I recommend studying the work of other drone photographers. Look for elements that make their shots effective. Is it the angle? The lighting? The way they&#39;ve framed a particular landscape feature? As you dissect these factors, you&#39;ll find it easier to replicate them in your own work.</p><p> Of course, safety and legality are paramount. Always abide by the rules governing drone use in your area. Most countries have regulations about where you can and can&#39;t fly, and some require a license. Make sure you&#39;re informed before taking off.</p><p> Once you&#39;re up there, the sky&#39;s the limit—literally. Whether you&#39;re capturing the intricate patterns of a cityscape or the sweeping vistas of a mountain range, aerial photography brings a fresh perspective to landscapes. With some practice and a good eye for composition, you&#39;ll be creating jaw-dropping images in no time.</p><h3 data-section id="dont-forget-to-edit-your-landscape-photos"> 23.

Don&#39;t think of editing as cheating or as something that sullies the “purity” of your photos. Trust me, even the best photos can benefit from a little post-processing.</p><p> Imagine editing as the final brushstroke in your creative process. Sure, you can get great shots straight out of the camera, but they&#39;ll almost always look better with a bit of tweaking. Simple things like adjusting exposure, white balance, and contrast can make a world of difference. These basic tweaks aim to make the photo match what your eyes saw. That&#39;s what we call “getting it right in camera.”</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256073" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-618.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Landscape Photography: A Comprehensive Guide (+ 23 Expert Tips)" class="wp-image-256073" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-618.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-618.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-618.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-618.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-618.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-618.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> But the fun doesn&#39;t stop there. Editing software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop offers tons of creative possibilities. Want to emphasize the golden hue of a sunset? You can do that. Fancy adding a vignette to make your subject pop? It&#39;s all possible. And as you grow more confident, you can start playing with advanced techniques like dodging and burning. This helps to add a sense of depth and dimension to your landscapes.</p><p> In essence, editing allows you to achieve the photo you envisioned – or even to put your personal stamp on a photo. So don&#39;t skip this step. Even a few small adjustments can transform a good photo into a masterpiece.</p><h2 data-section id="landscape-photography-tips-conclusion"> Landscape photography tips: conclusion</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-205175" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:60.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="908" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C908&#038;ssl=1" alt="landscape photography tips waterfall in Iceland" class="wp-image-205175" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=300%2C182&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=600%2C363&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=768%2C465&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=717%2C434&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Now that you&#39;ve finished this article, you&#39;re ready to capture some stunning landscape photography!

Accidents and thefts can – and will – happen. Be prepared!)</p><p> So if you&#39;re ready to put together a top-notch travel photography kit, then let&#39;s dive right in, starting with the most important gear item of all:</p><h2 id="1-a-camera"> 1. A camera</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256005" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-13.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="Essential Travel Photography Gear: 11 Must-Have Items" class="wp-image-256005" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-13.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-13.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-13.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-13.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-13.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-13.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Needless to say, every travel photographer needs at least <em>one</em> camera (and if you&#39;re serious about travel photography, I&#39;d really recommend you carry two: a main body and a backup).</p><p> What <a aria-label="travel photography camera (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-camera-for-travel-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">travel photography camera</a> is best? Honestly, there are so many different choices, plenty of which are capable of great images, so the only way to <em>really</em> know what&#39;s right is for you to think about your shooting preferences, then do some serious research.</p><p> But I do have a few pieces of advice.</p><p> For one, make sure that your camera is portable enough to carry all around the world, yet offers strong enough image quality to create stunning prints. It might sound like a tall order, but you can find entry-level mirrorless cameras, DSLRs, and even point-and-shoot models that are small, lightweight, and take great pictures (they won&#39;t break the bank, either).</p><p> Of course, there are also pro-level cameras that fit the bill, but they&#39;re far pricier. Professional travel photographers tend to use high-end mirrorless and DSLR cameras, which range from around $1,500 to $5,000 USD. One advantage of these cameras, in addition to the insane low-light capabilities and high megapixel counts, is the (often) robust weather sealing. If you plan to shoot in rain, snow, blowing sand, or sea spray, weather sealing is hugely beneficial. It might even be a must-have feature.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256017" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-6.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="Essential Travel Photography Gear: 11 Must-Have Items" class="wp-image-256017" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-6.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-6.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-6.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-6.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-6.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-6.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you&#39;re not sure whether a specific camera is right for you, I highly recommend renting before you buy. There are plenty of great online rental companies (and you can find in-person rental companies locally, too). Grab the camera for a day or three, go out and take some photos, and see what you think. You may end up frustrated or you may fall in love – but after a few hours, you&#39;ll know whether it&#39;s a camera worth buying.</p><p> By the way, when you&#39;re ready to purchase, shop around. Don&#39;t forget that you can always buy secondhand cameras; these cost half as much but are often in outstanding condition.</p><h2 id="2-lenses"> 2. Lenses</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256006" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-12.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Essential Travel Photography Gear: 11 Must-Have Items" class="wp-image-256006" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-12.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-12.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-12.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-12.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-12.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-12.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Usually, cameras come with just one low-quality lens, or they might come “body only,” which means that you&#39;ll need to purchase a lens separately.</p><p> Lenses do make a major difference, so I recommend you think about your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/travel-photography-which-lenses-to-take/" target="_blank" aria-label="travel photography lens choice (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">travel photography lens choice</a> very carefully. Wide-angle lenses, for instance, will get you completely different results from telephoto lenses. And wide-aperture lenses will let you shoot in very low light, though you&#39;ll pay for it in money, size, and weight.</p><p> To start, you&#39;ll need a workhorse lens, which you can use for most of your travel photography. It should offer a good range of focal lengths, should be relatively lightweight, and should offer decent optical quality. I&#39;d recommend looking into 24-70mm lenses, which are great for everything from landscapes to <a aria-label="travel portraits (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-ways-improve-travel-photography-portraits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">travel portraits</a> . (In fact, you could get away with <em>only</em> purchasing a 24-70mm lens; they really are that versatile!)</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256018" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:68.33%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1025" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1025&#038;ssl=1" alt="Essential Travel Photography Gear: 11 Must-Have Items" class="wp-image-256018" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-1.jpg?resize=300%2C205&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-1.jpg?resize=600%2C410&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-1.jpg?resize=768%2C525&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-1.jpg?resize=717%2C490&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If your budget allows it, however, I do recommend you add a telephoto lens to complement your workhorse lens. A 70-200mm lens, for instance, is great for tighter landscapes, architectural details, and even large (or tame) wildlife.</p><p> Over time, you can always build up your lens collection further by adding macro or prime lenses, but if you can start with a 24-70mm lens and a 70-200mm lens, or even just a 24-70mm lens, you&#39;ll be in great shape.</p><p> Here&#39;s my basic list of lenses, which I carry on every trip:</p><ul><li> A 24-70mm f/2.8 zoom</li><li> A 70-200mm f/2.8 zoom</li><li> A 50mm f/1.2 prime</li><li> A 100mm f/2.8 macro</li></ul><h2 id="3-a-tripod"> 3.

In fact, ask any travel photographer to name their favorite accessory, and they&#39;ll most likely say a tripod.</p><p> What makes tripods so special?</p><p> For one, without a tripod, you cannot take photos that require slow <a aria-label="shutter speeds (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speeds</a> . Image stabilization technology is great, but you can&#39;t use IS to capture ultra-long exposures at night; try it, and you&#39;ll likely end up with a series of blurry photos.</p><p> And yes, tripods do slow you down, but that&#39;s often a good thing. Tripods mean that you spend a bit more time <em>thinking</em> and <em>composing</em> rather than just snapping away.</p><p> There are plenty of amazing tripods, and the one that you choose will come down to personal preference, budget, and weight tolerance. Most travel photographers go with carbon fiber tripods, as they are stable and lightweight, and I recommend that you do the same.</p><p> Now, when you&#39;re looking at tripods, you&#39;ll probably notice plenty of cheap options – in the $50 to $150 range – and you&#39;ll wonder: <em>Why can&#39;t I get one of those?</em></p><p> Well, you <em>can</em> , but they&#39;ll often weigh a ton. You might not think that 7 lb sounds like a lot, but try carrying a 7 lb tripod for an entire day (along with your camera, lenses, and accessories) and you&#39;ll wish you had paid more money for a lighter model.</p><p> And if you find a cheap tripod that doesn&#39;t weigh a ton, it&#39;s likely very unstable. Do you really want to rely on something cheap and flimsy to hold up your expensive camera? In my view, you should always choose the best tripod that you can afford. It&#39;ll last you a long time, anyway, and will be well worth the initial investment.</p><h2 id="4-a-camera-bag"> 4.

You&#39;ll need to pick a bag that works for you, and as you become more experienced, you may want to buy different bags for different scenarios.</p><p> For instance, if I&#39;m hiking or out in the wilderness, I carry a large, comfortable bag, one that&#39;s good for long walks and that contains plenty of room for equipment, water, and more. On the other hand, if I&#39;m shooting in a city, I&#39;ll go with a smaller bag or even a shoulder bag, which holds less gear but won&#39;t get in the way.</p><h2 id="5-the-little-things"> 5.

Your camera&#39;s at the ready. But wait—your camera displays a warning that you&#39;re almost out of memory. The beauty of the moment fades as you frantically sift through your photos, deciding which ones to delete to make room. Frustrating, isn&#39;t it? To avoid this scenario, stock up on memory cards. Lots of them.</p><p> How many should you bring? Well, that depends. It&#39;s a balancing act between the length of your trip, your shooting style, the megapixels your camera has, and the capacity of the cards you&#39;re considering. If you&#39;re someone who loves shooting for long stretches, or if you&#39;re a fan of burst mode, then you&#39;ll need hefty storage—say, around 500 GB or even more for extended trips.</p><p> Don&#39;t just think about quantity; consider the safety of your digital treasures. I&#39;ll talk about external hard drives later, but even before that, invest in a quality memory card case. These nifty little containers shield your cards from elements like rain, dirt, and dust. It&#39;s a small investment that can save you a lot of heartache.</p><h2 data-section id="extra-batteries"> 6.

And just as you wouldn&#39;t leave for a trip with just one memory card, you shouldn&#39;t go without spare batteries either.</p><p> The need for extra batteries becomes even more pressing when you can&#39;t predict your access to a power outlet. Maybe you&#39;re in a remote village or trekking through the wilderness; it&#39;s not like you can just plug your charger into a tree.</p><p> While original batteries can be pricey, third-party options usually offer a more budget-friendly alternative without sacrificing much in terms of performance. In warm climates and where you know you&#39;ll have frequent access to power, one spare should suffice. But if you&#39;re headed to a colder climate, or places where charging might be a challenge, 3-5 spare batteries would be more appropriate, especially if you&#39;re using modern mirrorless cameras, which tend to be power-hungry.</p><h2 data-section id="an-external-hard-drive"> 7.

Yet, that moment of joy can turn to panic if something happens to your memory cards. This is where an external hard drive steps in as your safety net. I strongly recommend that every traveler keep one in their kit. When you get back to your lodging each night, you can transfer the day&#39;s photos onto the hard drive. This provides a dual safety net—keeping your shots safe and freeing up memory space for the next day.</p><p> Hard drives are quite affordable now, and even drives with terabytes of storage won&#39;t break the bank. The ones built for durability are particularly good for travel. They can handle a few bumps on the road and most are shock-resistant. You don&#39;t want a little tumble to wipe out your irreplaceable photos.</p><h2 data-section id="a-remote-release"> 8.

But let&#39;s extend that setup a bit. A remote release might not be the first thing you pack, but oh, the difference it makes. We&#39;re talking about crisp, clear shots when the sun&#39;s gone down or when you&#39;re indoors. Sure, you could use your camera&#39;s built-in timer or even your smartphone to snap a photo. But a remote release eliminates any risk of camera shake, which can ruin an otherwise perfect shot.</p><p> Especially useful for low-light photography, this tiny device allows you to trigger the camera without touching it. This is crucial when you&#39;re working with slow shutter speeds to get that perfect exposure. What&#39;s more, these gadgets aren&#39;t a major investment. Basic models often cost less than $20. So if you&#39;re planning to capture the serene twilight or the dynamic city lights, do consider adding a remote release to your kit.</p><h2 data-section id="a-raincover"> 9.

You&#39;re in a beautiful location, the light is perfect, and then—bam! Raindrops start falling. If you don&#39;t want your camera to be a casualty of unexpected weather, a rain cover is a smart addition to your gear. Think of it as an insurance policy for your camera, safeguarding your investment from water damage.</p><p> A basic rain cover should do the trick for most situations. These are generally affordable and easy to slip over your camera and lens. They&#39;re made of water-resistant materials like nylon or polyethylene and usually have a clear panel so you can still see your camera&#39;s settings. But if you find yourself in a situation where you have to improvise, a trash bag secured with rubber bands can also be a makeshift solution.</p><p> This gear isn&#39;t glamorous, but it&#39;s effective. And when you&#39;re far from home, capturing scenes you&#39;ve only dreamt of, practicality trumps glamour every time.</p><h2 data-section id="a-cleaning-kit"> 10.

So, just as you wouldn&#39;t venture out without your personal toiletries, don&#39;t forget your camera&#39;s cleaning kit.</p><p> A basic kit doesn&#39;t have to be bulky. A small pouch can hold all the essentials: microfiber cloths for your lens, a rocket blower to force out the pesky dust, and a small brush to reach into the crevices of your camera body. These simple tools can be lifesavers, ensuring that your camera remains functional and your photos remain clear.</p><h2 data-section id="filters"> 11.

Filters can be game-changers, particularly for travel photographers capturing diverse scenes. Say you&#39;re photographing a lake surrounded by lush trees. A polarizing filter will minimize glare on the water and make those green leaves pop. The difference it makes is like night and day.</p><p> Neutral density filters are another key accessory. These are useful when you want to experiment with long-exposure shots. Maybe you&#39;re near a flowing river and you want to capture that silky-smooth water effect. A neutral density filter will let you shoot at slower shutter speeds without overexposing your image.</p><p> Last but not least, let&#39;s talk about protective filters like UV or clear filters. These may not dramatically alter your images, but they safeguard your valuable lens from scratches, smudges, and even minor falls. I say it&#39;s a lot easier—and cheaper—to replace a filter than a lens.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256016" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-8.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Essential Travel Photography Gear: 11 Must-Have Items" class="wp-image-256016" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-8.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-8.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-8.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-8.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-8.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-8.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 id="essential-travel-photography-gear-final-words"> Essential travel photography gear: final words</h2><p> Buying your first camera, lenses, and accessories can be a daunting prospect.</p><p> But if you pay careful attention to this list, do your research, and get the absolute essentials, then your kit will turn out great.

Once you know how to use shutter speed, you&#39;ll be able to capture sharp photos at will. You&#39;ll also be prepared to capture interesting artistic effects (such as <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-capture-motion-blur-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">slow shutter speed blur</a> ).</p><p> In this article, I&#39;m going to take you through all the shutter speed basics, including:</p><ul><li> A simple definition of shutter speed</li><li> The effects that shutter speed has on your images</li><li> The different (and importance) of slow versus fast shutter speeds</li><li> How to use different shutter speeds for outstanding results</li></ul><p> So if you&#39;re ready to become a shutter speed photography expert, then let&#39;s dive right in!</p><h2 data-section id="what-is-shutter-speed"> What is shutter speed?</h2><p> Shutter speed is the length of time the camera shutter is open while the camera takes a photo.</p><p> You press the shutter button, the shutter opens for a predetermined time period (ie, the shutter speed), then the shutter closes and the image is complete.</p><p> When the shutter is open, light hits the camera sensor; therefore, the longer the shutter speed, the more light the sensor receives. This has various effects, as discussed in the next section.</p><p> Note that shutter speed is measured in seconds (or fractions of a second). Here are a few common shutter speeds:</p><ul><li> 10s</li><li> 1s</li><li> 1/10s</li><li> 1/30s</li><li> 1/60s</li><li> 1/125s</li><li> 1/250s</li><li> 1/500s</li><li> 1/1000s</li><li> 1/1600s</li><li> 1/2000s</li></ul><p> The list begins with a long, 10-second shutter speed, but the shutter speeds get shorter and shorter, ending with a lightning-fast 1/2000s shutter speed.</p><p> Note that the shutter speed measurements listed above certainly aren&#39;t comprehensive. Most DSLRs and mirrorless cameras let you select from 30-second shutter speeds all the way down to 1/4000s or 1/8000s, though you may also have access to a special mode – called Bulb mode – that lets you keep the shutter button open for your desired length of time.</p><p> Therefore, while most cameras offer several dozen basic shutter speed options (shutter speed <em>presets</em> , if you will), there are literally thousands of possible shutter speeds you can use, all of which expose the camera sensor to slightly different quantities of light. Make sense?</p><h2 data-section id="how-shutter-speed-affects-your-photos"> How shutter speed affects your photos</h2><p> Shutter speed impacts your images in two key ways:</p><ol><li> It increases and decreases <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure</a> (ie, image brightness)</li><li> It increases and decreases sharpness (ie, image detail)</li></ol><p> Let&#39;s take a look at each item in turn.</p><h3 data-section id="shutter-speed-increases-and-decreases-exposure"> Shutter speed increases and decreases exposure</h3><p> The longer the shutter speed, the more light that hits your camera sensor – and the <em>brighter the image becomes</em> .</p><p> So if you photograph a tree at 1/1000s, then you lower the shutter speed to 1s, your second image – with its slower shutter speed – will be noticeably brighter.</p><p> This has major consequences. Much of photography is about achieving the proper brightness, or <em>exposure</em> , for a scene, and by adjusting the shutter speed, you can get different results. For this reason, shutter speed is one of the three camera exposure variables (along with <a aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> and <a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> ).</p><p> So when you&#39;re out with your camera, you&#39;ll need to adjust the shutter speed to achieve a nice, balanced exposure. The specifics will depend on the scene, but watch for blown-out highlights and clipped shadows. In other words, make sure you don&#39;t over or underexpose so heavily that you lose information in the lightest or darkest parts of the photo.</p><h3 data-section id="shutter-speed-increases-and-decreases-sharpness"> Shutter speed increases and decreases sharpness</h3><p> Faster shutter speeds <em>freeze</em> motion. Slower shutter speeds <em>blur</em> motion.</p><p> So if you&#39;re photographing a bird in flight at 1/4000s, every feather will be crisp, even the flapping wings. But if you photograph that same bird at 1/15s, it will be an indecipherable blur.</p><p> Now, the shutter speed needed to freeze motion will change depending on the speed of the moving object. A feather drifting through the air may require a 1/200s shutter speed for maximum sharpness, while a fast-moving car may require 1/2000s or more.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-198367" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-25-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="shutter speed surfer action image" class="wp-image-198367" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-25-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-25-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-25-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-25-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-25-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-25-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> A too-slow shutter speed is one of the main reasons why pictures come out blurry – so you should pay <em>very</em> close attention to your shutter speed value. Always make sure it&#39;s fast enough to get the results you&#39;re after.</p><h2 data-section id="how-to-set-the-shutter-speed-on-your-camera"> How to set the shutter speed on your camera</h2><p> The precise shutter speed mechanisms vary from camera to camera – but changing the shutter speed is usually as simple as rotating a dial (to learn all the specifics, I recommend you check your camera manual).</p><p> Note that your ability to adjust the shutter speed will change depending on your camera mode.</p><p> If you use Auto mode, your camera will select the shutter speed for you, and you will have zero ability to make changes.</p><p> If you use <a aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> , you can dial in the shutter speed at will (and you can also independently select your aperture and ISO).</p><p> If you use <a aria-label="Shutter Priority mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Shutter Priority mode</a> , you can select the shutter speed and the ISO, while your camera will select the aperture for the optimal exposure (based on its evaluation of the scene).</p><p> If you use Aperture Priority mode, you can select the aperture and ISO, while your camera will select the shutter speed for an optimal exposure (again, based on its evaluation of the scene).</p><p> Different camera modes are good for different situations, so don&#39;t just pick a mode and stick to it; instead, learn to adjust your mode dial depending on your photographic needs.</p><h2 data-section id="how-to-choose-the-perfect-shutter-speed-step-by-step"> How to choose the perfect shutter speed: step by step</h2><p> Struggling to pick the perfect shutter speed? You&#39;re not alone.</p><p> But while selecting the best shutter speed for your shooting situation might seem hard, it&#39;s actually easy – once you get the hang of it. Here&#39;s the two-step process I recommend: </p><h3 data-section id="step-determine-the-lowest-possible-shutter-speed-that-will-get-you-a-sharp-shot"> Step 1: Determine the lowest-possible shutter speed that will get you a sharp shot</h3><p> Look at your scene. Ask yourself: Are any subjects <em>moving</em> ? And if so, what shutter speed do I need to <em>freeze</em> them?</p><p> You&#39;ll get better at determining the lowest-possible shutter speed over time, but at first, it will take a lot of trial and error. Here&#39;s a list of minimum sharp shutter speeds to get you started:</p><ul><li> Water flowing: 1/125s</li><li> People walking: 1/250s</li><li> People/animals running: 1/500s</li><li> Cars driving: 1/1000s</li><li> Birds flying: 1/2000s</li></ul><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-147934" style="width:2600px"><span class="space" style="width:2600px; padding-top:56.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2600" height="1463" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/introduction-to-shutter-speed.jpg?resize=2600%2C1463&#038;ssl=1" alt="fast shutter speed hummingbird with splashing water" class="wp-image-147934" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/introduction-to-shutter-speed.jpg?w=2600&amp;ssl=1 2600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/introduction-to-shutter-speed.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/introduction-to-shutter-speed.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/introduction-to-shutter-speed.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/introduction-to-shutter-speed.jpg?resize=717%2C403&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/introduction-to-shutter-speed.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Also note that, if your scene has zero movement, you cannot simply select whatever shutter speed you like. If you&#39;re handholding your camera, then your hands will shake, and this will create blur – unless your shutter speed is fast enough.</p><p> The lowest-possible handheld shutter speed varies from person to person, plus it depends on your lens (longer lenses increase camera shake). And thanks to image stabilization technology, some cameras and lenses allow for slower handheld shooting. But I&#39;d recommend keeping the shutter speed above 1/60s or so for short lenses, and 1/160s or so for long lenses, at least until you&#39;ve done some tests.</p><p> Of course, if you&#39;re shooting a scene with no movement, you do have another option: you can shoot with a tripod. Assuming your tripod is sturdy, it will let you drop your shutter speed as low as you like (which is how you can create beautiful moving water effects, as I discuss later in this article!). </p><h3 data-section id="step-boost-your-shutter-speed-or-adjust-other-variables-for-the-proper-exposure"> Step 2: Boost your shutter speed (or adjust other variables) for the proper exposure</h3><p> At this point, you should know your <em>minimum</em> shutter speed for a sharp shot. You shouldn&#39;t drop below this speed – but you can always go above it, depending on your exposure needs.</p><p> If you&#39;re in Manual mode, check your camera&#39;s exposure bar (in the viewfinder). If the scene is overexposed, go ahead and boost the shutter speed.</p><p> If you&#39;re in Shutter Priority mode, your camera will automatically select an aperture for a good exposure. But feel free to raise the shutter speed as long as your camera continues to choose an aperture you like.</p><p> On the other hand, if the scene is <em>underexposed</em> according to your camera&#39;s exposure bar, you&#39;ll need to change other camera settings to get the right exposure. Consider widening the aperture – but if this isn&#39;t possible, you&#39;ll need to raise the ISO.</p><p> Do <em>not</em> drop the shutter speed, however. Better to increase the ISO for a noisy image than to end up with unwanted blur.</p><p>就是这样！ To recap: Start by identifying your lowest-possible shutter speed for a sharp shot, then simply make tweaks for the optimal exposure.</p><p> That way, you get a crisp photo – with a balanced exposure, too.</p><h2 data-section id="slow-shutter-speed-photography"> Slow shutter speed photography</h2><p> The advice I&#39;ve given above is perfect for situations where you want to freeze a moving subject.</p><p> But what if a sharp shot isn&#39;t your goal? What if, instead, you want to creatively <em>blur</em> your photo for a beautiful effect?</p><p> You see, blur isn&#39;t always bad; it can communicate motion, plus it can look truly breathtaking, as in this waterfall shot:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-198368" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-26.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="waterfalls slow shutter speed" class="wp-image-198368" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-26.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-26.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-26.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-26.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-26.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-26.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> In deliberate motion-blur situations, you should set your camera to Manual mode, then dial in the exact shutter speed you&#39;re after.</p><p> At this point, you should check your camera&#39;s exposure bar and adjust the aperture and/or ISO for a good exposure.</p><p> Note that you definitely need a tripod for this type of long-exposure photography. Otherwise, the entire shot will blur!</p><p> Pro tip: If you&#39;re struggling to get a slow enough shutter speed without overexposing the image, consider using a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-nd-filters/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">neutral density filter</a> , which blocks out light and is perfect for <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/step-by-step-guide-to-long-exposure-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="long exposure shooting (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">long exposure shooting</a> . It&#39;s commonly used to create long-exposure images in bright conditions.</p><p> Alternatively, you can shoot in near darkness (either indoors or at night).

Basic recommendations</h2><p> Now that you&#39;re familiar with the ins and outs of selecting a shutter speed, I&#39;d like to share a few basic recommendations for selecting the right shutter speed. These recommendations won&#39;t <em>always</em> work, but they should certainly offer you a good starting point when adjusting your camera settings.</p><h3 data-section id="the-best-shutter-speeds-for-landscape-photography"> The best shutter speeds for landscape photography</h3><p> Landscape photographers generally have two shutter-related goals:</p><ol><li> Get the image sharp from foreground to background</li><li> Create artistic motion blur in moving water and clouds</li></ol><p> Now, foreground-to-background sharpness refers to a <em>deep depth of field</em> . And while this isn&#39;t directly related to shutter speed, the longer the shutter speed, the easier it becomes to achieve a deep depth of field.</p><p> (Why? The depth of field is controlled by the aperture – and lengthier shutter speeds allow you to adjust the aperture without underexposing the scene.)</p><p> Plus, as I explained in a previous section, if you want artistic motion blur, you need to lengthen the shutter speed.</p><p> Bottom line: Landscape photography thrives on long exposures. Most landscape photographers shoot at 1s to 1/200s in bright daylight, and as the light falls, the shutter speeds slow. Many landscape shooters work at 1/30s to 30s (or more) around sunrise, sunset, and at night.</p><p> Such lengthy shutter speeds are only possible with a tripod. If you <em>don&#39;t</em> have a tripod, then it&#39;s often best to drop your shutter speed as low as you can go without creating camera shake (often around 1/60s or so).</p><h3 data-section id="the-best-shutter-speeds-for-portrait-photography"> The best shutter speeds for portrait photography</h3><p> Portrait photographers can be pretty flexible when choosing shutter speeds. The key goal is to keep your shots sharp – by avoiding camera shake as well as motion blur – but because you can generally instruct your subject and work from a stable position, this shouldn&#39;t be too tough.</p><p> If you&#39;re shooting a stationary subject, feel free to drop your shutter speed to around 1/80s or so (though 1/200s is safer).</p><p> And if you&#39;re shooting a moving subject, such as a person dancing, I&#39;d recommend working at 1/500s and beyond.</p><h3 data-section id="the-best-shutter-speeds-for-wildlife-and-bird-photography"> The best shutter speeds for wildlife and bird photography</h3><p> Bird and wildlife photography generally involves capturing fast-moving subjects with long lenses.</p><p> Therefore, you should generally use the fastest shutter speed you can get away with. For slower-moving animals, 1/500s is a reasonable starting point (and you <em>can</em> go lower if the animal is completely stationary – just make sure you keep your lens on a tripod or handheld as stably as possible).</p><p> For fast-moving animals and birds, 1/1000s is the place to start. And when action is occurring, I&#39;d really recommend pushing your shutter speed to 1/2000s and beyond.</p><h3 data-section id="the-best-shutter-speeds-for-street-photography"> The best shutter speeds for street photography</h3><p> Street photographers tend to be less concerned with sharpness than other shooters, so your choice of shutter speed isn&#39;t nearly as important.</p><p> That said, if you&#39;re walking while shooting and/or photographing walking people, 1/250s is a safe starting point. If both you and your subject are stationary, then you can often shoot at 1/100s or slower (assuming you&#39;re using good handholding techniques and relatively short lenses).</p><h2 data-section id="shutter-speed-in-photography-final-words"> Shutter speed in photography: final words</h2><p> Now that you&#39;ve finished this article, you&#39;re well-equipped to create some gorgeous photos.</p><p> So head out with your camera and test out different shutter speeds. Get familiar with your options. And try the two-step process I outlined above!</p><p>现在交给你：</p><p> <em>How do you plan to select your shutter speed from now on? Do you have any shutter speed tips?在下面的评论中分享您的想法！</em> </p><div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1653337356359"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">What is the best shutter speed?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> Fast-moving subjects shot with long lenses require a short shutter speed (such as 1/250s or higher). But you can get sharp shots of stationary subjects shot with short lenses at 1/60s to 1/200s. And if you have a tripod, you can go even slower!</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1653337467052"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">What is the shutter speed in a camera?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> The shutter speed refers to the length of time the shutter is open when you press the shutter button. The longer the shutter is open, the more light that hits the sensor, and the brighter the image becomes.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1653337537012"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">What is a fast shutter speed?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> Shutter speeds around 1/1000s and above are fast, while shutter speeds in the 1/100s to 1/1000s range are average, and shutter speeds from 1/100s on down are slow.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1653337545157"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Is a higher shutter speed better?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> A higher shutter speed helps guarantee a sharp photo. However, if your subject isn&#39;t moving, a high shutter speed can be overkill (and it will decrease the image exposure, which can be a problem). Also, a slower shutter speed can create artistic effects (such as blurry water).</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1653337557229"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">What is a safe shutter speed?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> A basic safe shutter speed is 1/250s, which will let you capture sharp shots of stationary and slow-moving subjects. But if you&#39;re photographing cars driving, birds in flight, or other fast action, you&#39;ll generally need to shoot at 1/1000s or above.</p></div></div><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/">Shutter Speed in Photography: The Essential Guide</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com">Digital Photography School</a> .

Don&#39;t be afraid to try different settings until you achieve the look you&#39;re after.</p><p> Also, consider the specific elements that will be affected by the long exposure and adjust your composition accordingly. Incorporating elements like streaking clouds can add dynamism and visual interest.</p><p> Taking the time to master long exposures in low light can open up a world of creative possibilities. With patience, practice, and a willingness to experiment, you&#39;ll find yourself capturing images that stand out from the crowd.</p><h2 data-section id="bracket-your-exposures-for-maximum-detail"> 10.

A histogram is ultra-helpful, as I mentioned in the last section – but what if you&#39;re not sure whether you got the result you wanted, even with the histogram? And even more concerning: What if a good result is impossible, simply because the difference because the brightest brights and the darkest darks in your photos are too significant?</p><p> That&#39;s where <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/bracketing-what-is-it-and-what-to-do-with-the-images/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure bracketing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure bracketing</a> comes in. It&#39;s a simple technique, but it&#39;s a <em>huge</em> deal for the committed landscape photographer. Here&#39;s how it works:</p><ol><li> Take a shot with a middle exposure value.</li><li> Adjust your settings (generally the shutter speed) to slightly underexpose the scene, then take a shot.</li><li> Adjust your settings (again, generally the shutter speed) to slightly overexpose the scene, then take a shot.</li></ol><p> To some extent, you&#39;re creating backups, so that if you get the exposure slightly wrong, you still have a well-exposed image to fall back on. However, exposure bracketing can do more than that; you can actually blend several bracketed images together in Lightroom or Photoshop, taking the most detail from different parts of the images, so that the underexposed image contributes a beautiful sky, while the overexposed image contributes rich shadows. That way, you get the best of both worlds (and a stunning final result). Make sense?</p><p> And by the way: You can bracket as broadly as you like. Three bracketed images are pretty common (often with a margin of two stops), but you can also capture five, seven, nine, or more bracketed shots!</p><h2 data-section

In my experience, it&#39;s often what turns an ordinary snapshot into a professional-looking image. Clamshell lighting is a technique that&#39;s simple yet powerful, and it can take your photography to the next level.</p><p> But what is clamshell lighting? And how can you master clamshell <a aria-label="lighting setups (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-portrait-lighting-patterns-every-photographer-should-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">lighting setups</a> for stunning results?</p><p> In this article, I explain the ins and outs of this simple – yet incredibly powerful – two-light portrait setup. From experimenting with different modifiers to playing with light positions and beyond, I&#39;ll explore all the details to help you master this wonderful lighting technique. By the time you&#39;re finished reading, you&#39;ll know how to create clamshell-lit <a aria-label="portraits (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-ways-to-take-stunning-portraits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">portraits</a> like a pro (no matter your lighting gear!).</p><p> So if you&#39;re ready to become a clamshell portrait master, then let&#39;s dive right in, starting with the basics:</p><h2 data-section id="what-is-clamshell-lighting"> What is clamshell lighting?</h2><p> Clamshell lighting is a simple, two-light configuration: You place both lights facing your subject at a 45-degree angle, one angled up, one angled down. Note that your <em>key</em> light (ie, your primary, brighter light) should point 45 degrees downward, while your <em>fill</em> light should point 45 degrees upward. Your camera should sit between the two lights, facing your subject.</p><p> When viewed from the side, the two lights resemble an open clamshell (imagination may be required!):</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-133396 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133396" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:79.47%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="596" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting.jpg?resize=750%2C596&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell guide and tips lighting diagram" class="wp-image-133396" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting.jpg?resize=300%2C238&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting.jpg?resize=600%2C477&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting.jpg?resize=717%2C570&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> A clamshell setup provides beautiful, soft light with faint shadows and glorious catchlights. Clamshell lighting works well on pretty much everyone; I&#39;d say that it&#39;s flattering for men and women of all ages, so it&#39;s a great setup to have in your back pocket.</p><p> Note that clamshell lighting is just like <a aria-label="butterfly lighting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-perfect-butterfly-lighting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">butterfly lighting</a> , except that you add the fill light below the subject (which eliminates any heavy shadows caused by the key light). So if you&#39;re <em>already</em> doing a butterfly setup, you can always add in a clamshell look at the end for some variation!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133404" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:79.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="598" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-1893.jpg?resize=750%2C598&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133404" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-1893.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-1893.jpg?resize=300%2C239&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-1893.jpg?resize=600%2C478&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-1893.jpg?resize=717%2C572&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="how-to-create-a-clamshell-lighting-setup-step-by-step-process"> How to create a clamshell lighting setup: step-by-step process</h2><p><br /> Creating a clamshell lighting setup is simple, and as long as you have two working lights, you&#39;re practically guaranteed to pull it off. Here&#39;s what you do:</p><h3 data-section id="step-select-your-lights-and-modifiers"> Step 1: Select your lights and modifiers</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133403" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3698.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133403" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3698.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3698.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3698.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3698.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3698.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Clamshell lighting requires two light sources, and these can be strobes or continuous, modified or unmodified.</p><p> Personally, I&#39;d recommend you use <a aria-label="modifiers (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/a-beginners-guide-to-light-modifiers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">modifiers</a> – these will help soften the light for a more flattering effect – and grabbing a pair of similarly sized <a aria-label="softboxes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/softbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">softboxes</a> is a great starting point.</p><p> That said, if you don&#39;t have modifiers or you prefer a harder look, then work with an unmodified light! If you really embrace the effect and sculpt it as needed, you may get a great result. Plus, it&#39;s your photoshoot!</p><h3 data-section id="step-position-your-key-light"> Step 2: Position your key light</h3><p> Grab your key light (ie, your main light source). The goal is to place it in front of your subject and slightly above; angle it down so it points directly at the subject&#39;s nose.</p><p> If you want a softer effect that features fast light falloff, bring the light in close to the subject&#39;s face. If you want a harder effect that lights the subject more broadly, move the light farther away.</p><p> Next, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understand-camera-light-meter-desired-exposure/" target="_blank" aria-label="meter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">meter</a> for your desired <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> (we&#39;ll use a hypothetical f/11) and take a test shot.</p><p> If everything is set up correctly, you should produce a decently lit image with deep shadows under your subject&#39;s nose and chin. (If the image is too dim, feel free to brighten your light, and if the image is overexposed, do the reverse.)</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133402" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3242.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133402" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3242.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3242.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3242.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3242.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3242.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="step-add-your-fill-light"> Step 3: Add your fill light</h3><p> Now it&#39;s time to add in the second light; take your fill light and place it directly underneath your key light, pointed upward toward your subject at 45 degrees.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133414" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:75.07%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="563" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2578.jpg?resize=750%2C563&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips behind the scenes" class="wp-image-133414" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2578.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2578.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2578.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2578.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Adjust the light&#39;s brightness until it sits two stops <em>below</em> the key light. (If you wanted to shoot at f/11, you could meter your fill light for an f/5.6 result.) Then take a second test shot.</p><p> If the effect is too strong and your fill light is obliterating the shadows, turn down the light power. If the light isn&#39;t doing enough, turn it up. The main thing to look out for is the fill light overpowering the key light, as that would result in a <em>very</em> unflattering image that&#39;s lit from below.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133413" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:87.07%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="653" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2580.jpg?resize=750%2C653&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips behind the scenes" class="wp-image-133413" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2580.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2580.jpg?resize=300%2C261&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2580.jpg?resize=600%2C522&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2580.jpg?resize=717%2C624&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="step-capture-your-clamshell-image"> Step 4: Capture your clamshell image!</h3><p> At this point, you should have two lights sharing the same vertical space, and the light on top should be roughly two stops brighter than the light on the bottom.</p><p> Stand behind the lights and shoot through the gap. Note: If there isn&#39;t much of a gap to work with, raise and/or lower both of your lights until you have enough room to shoot in the middle. To be safe, you may want to take another meter reading.</p><p> Of course, once you&#39;ve grabbed a shot or two, check your camera&#39;s LCD for exposure issues and other concerns.

Since there&#39;s no fill light, the shadows on the nose and chin remain heavy, giving more dramatic and intense results. It&#39;s an effect that can be particularly well-suited for fashion photography.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255906" style="width:464px"><span class="space" style="width:464px; padding-top:129.31%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="464" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-101.jpg?resize=464%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Clamshell lighting photography" class="wp-image-255906" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-101.jpg?resize=464%2C600&amp;ssl=1 464w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-101.jpg?resize=232%2C300&amp;ssl=1 232w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-101.jpg?resize=768%2C994&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-101.jpg?resize=717%2C928&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-101.jpg?w=1159&amp;ssl=1 1159w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Notice the strong shadows under the subject&#39;s nose; that&#39;s a result of butterfly lighting.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Now, let&#39;s compare this to clamshell lighting. Clamshell lighting involves placing a second light below the subject, softening the shadows. This produces a gentler, more soothing effect, so it&#39;s often seen in conventional headshot photography or applications with far less drama.</p><p> Pro tip: If you&#39;re uncertain about the final look you want, you can always start with butterfly lighting. Experiment with the shadows and angles, then simply add a fill light to achieve the clamshell look if you desire something softer. This way, you can play around with two different lighting styles with very little effort. It&#39;s a convenient and creative approach to portrait lighting.</p><h2 data-section id="clamshell-vs-rembrandt-lighting"> Clamshell vs Rembrandt lighting</h2><p> Another classic lighting technique to consider?

The Rembrandt pattern involves placing a light off to the side of the subject – often around 45 degrees – to create a clear triangle of light on the subject&#39;s cheek.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255907" style="width:480px"><span class="space" style="width:480px; padding-top:125%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="480" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-100.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Clamshell lighting photography" class="wp-image-255907" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-100.jpg?resize=480%2C600&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-100.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-100.jpg?resize=768%2C961&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-100.jpg?resize=717%2C897&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-100.jpg?w=1199&amp;ssl=1 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Rembrandt lighting produces a triangle under the subject&#39;s eye.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Because it covers so much of the face in shadows, Rembrandt lighting is known for its dark and moody qualities. It&#39;s a favorite among those seeking a dramatic, theatrical style in their images.</p><p> So how does clamshell lighting stack up against Rembrandt? Clamshell lighting is the better choice if you want a more cheerful, detailed shot. By positioning lights both above and below your subject, you can illuminate the face more evenly and reduce harsh shadows. This brings out more of the facial details and gives the image a livelier, more approachable feeling.</p><p> In short, if drama and moodiness are your goals, Rembrandt lighting may be the way to go. But for a more uplifting and detailed portrait, clamshell lighting fits the bill. Understanding the nuances of these lighting techniques will allow you to choose the right style for each unique portrait session. Experiment with both, and see what you think!</p><h2 data-section id="clamshell-photography-setup-a-few-quick-tips"> Clamshell photography setup: a few quick tips</h2><p> You know how to capture a basic clamshell image. But how can you take your shots even further? Here are a few of my top tips to help you out:</p><h3 data-section id="experiment-with-different-modifiers"> 1. Experiment with different modifiers</h3><p> When you&#39;re first starting out with clamshell lighting, softboxes can be your best friends. They provide a gentle touch that&#39;s perfect for beginners. But as you get more comfortable, you might find yourself wanting to explore other options. <em>This is an excellent idea</em> .</p><p> Have a pair of strip boxes you want to use? Go for it. Want to use a beauty dish as your key light and an umbrella as fill? Sure. How about a <a aria-label="snoot (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/snoot-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">snoot</a> and a small softbox?绝对地。 Use what you have at hand. Pretty soon, you&#39;ll be able to improvise like a pro.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133397" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3257.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133397" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3257.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3257.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3257.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Beauty dishes, for instance, create a harder look that can add drama to a portrait. Their focused light can accentuate textures and details. On the other hand, umbrellas can really soften up the shadows. By throwing around a lot of light, they make everything feel more diffused and ethereal.</p><p> By testing out different modifiers, you&#39;ll learn how they affect your images. So don&#39;t be afraid to try something new. Just remember to keep the essence of clamshell lighting in mind: that beautiful, flattering glow that makes portraits shine.</p><h3 data-section id="try-repositioning-your-lights"> 2. Try repositioning your lights</h3><p> Light position matters in clamshell lighting, and even an adjustment of a few inches can dramatically change the final image.</p><p> Move the lights closer to your subject, and the shadows will soften and become more gradated for a gentle and delicate look.</p><p> Move the lights farther from your subject, and the shadows will harden and become sharper. This can add a sense of depth and drama to the image.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133410" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133410" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> But it&#39;s not just about distance. You can move your key light higher to create longer shadows or lower to create shorter shadows. You can do the same with the fill light.</p><p> Just be cautious not to go overboard. The 45-degree positions that I discussed in my initial step-by-step section are designed to look flattering. Playing with the positioning is great, but don&#39;t lose sight of your original goals!</p><h3 data-section id="add-more-lights"> 3. Add more lights</h3><p> Once you&#39;ve set up your clamshell lighting just right, you might think you&#39;re done. But there&#39;s more you can do to enhance the scene and create striking images.</p><p> For instance, you can add rim lights behind your subject, either on one side or both, to create a delicate sliver of light around the head. This effect will help your subject pop off the background and make the image more dynamic.</p><p> A hair light can add depth to your photograph. Positioned above and behind the subject, it shines subtly on the hair to separate it from the background.</p><p> Don&#39;t hesitate to experiment with background lights, as well. Placing a light behind the subject (that&#39;s pointed at the backdrop) can create a beautiful cone of light that adds extra depth. It&#39;s how many photographers combine a well-lit subject with a well-lit background!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133409" style="width:500px"><span class="space" style="width:500px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="500" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-8580.jpg?resize=500%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133409" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-8580.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-8580.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-8580.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Bottom line: By adding these additional lights, you give yourself more creative freedom and open up a world of possibilities in your clamshell lighting setups.</p><h3 data-section id="convert-to-black-and-white"> 4. Convert to black and white</h3><p> Clamshell lighting produces wonderful images that can look stunning in both color and black and white. Converting your shot to black and white will emphasize the interplay of shadows and highlights while potentially adding a layer of three-dimensionality to the photo.</p><p> If you shoot in RAW, and I highly recommend you do, you have the flexibility to photograph using your camera&#39;s Monochrome mode and still convert back to color if needed. Or you can start in color and convert to black and white later on.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133399" style="width:500px"><span class="space" style="width:500px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="500" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-7627-2.jpg?resize=500%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133399" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-7627-2.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-7627-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-7627-2.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The black-and-white conversion can make the features of the face stand out in a unique way. It might bring out textures, emphasize contrasts, or even create a mood that color doesn&#39;t capture. Experimenting with this conversion allows you to explore a range of visual expressions within a single lighting setup, which is always a good idea!</p><h3 data-section id="watch-the-catchlights"> 5. Watch the catchlights</h3><p> Catchlight is that magical spot of light in the subject&#39;s eyes, one that&#39;s created by a reflection from the light source. It brings life to the eyes; without a catchlight, the eyes – and the entire portrait – can appear flat and lifeless.</p><p> Therefore, it&#39;s important that you always make sure your clamshell photos include catchlights! If a catchlight isn&#39;t present, you may need to ask your subject to angle their head, or you may need to make slight adjustments to your lights. Make sure to review each test shot on your camera&#39;s LCD to ensure that the catchlight is just as you want it.</p><p> Note that with clamshell lighting, since it involves two lights rather than one, you might notice a double catchlight. This is a feature some photographers love, while others are less enthusiastic.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133400" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3713-crop.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3713-crop.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3713-crop.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3713-crop.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3713-crop.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3713-crop.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you&#39;re not a fan of the bottom catchlight, don&#39;t fret!

In fact, if you want to create gorgeous photos, you must master negative space; that way, you can take shots that feature balanced, harmonious, eye-catching arrangements. (You can also capture wonderfully <em>minimalistic</em> compositions, as I discuss down below.)</p><p> In this article, I&#39;ll explain everything you need to know about negative space, including:</p><ul><li> What negative space actually is</li><li> Why negative space is important</li><li> Simple tips and tricks to use negative space in your images, whether you shoot landscapes, portraits, street scenes, or architecture</li></ul><p> Ready to become a compositional master?

That&#39;s why <em>negative space</em> is also called <em>white space</em> ; it&#39;s where nothing is really happening.</p><p> Check out this next image, where the foggy sky and the empty water act as negative space:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174286" style="width:741px"><span class="space" style="width:741px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="741" height="494" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-03.jpg?resize=741%2C494&#038;ssl=1" alt="negative space in photography woman near tree" class="wp-image-174286" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-03.jpg?w=741&amp;ssl=1 741w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-03.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-03.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-03.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-03.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> In photography, negative space is often made up of certain elements:</p><ul><li> Water</li><li> Sky</li><li> Walls</li><li> Sand</li></ul><p> Note that all of these elements tend to fade easily into the background, and that&#39;s why they make such great negative space. An empty sky does <em>not</em> draw the eye, any more than a blank white wall, a stretch of empty sand, and so on.</p><p> Now, some photos are full of negative space. These compositions are often very abstract, such as a stretch of empty blue sky, or a sand dune stretching off in every direction. Such negative-space-centric compositions can also be <em>minimalistic</em> , with a single eye-catching element surrounded by emptiness.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255876" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Negative space photography" class="wp-image-255876" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Other photos, however, feature plenty of non-negative space, also known as <em>positive</em> space:</p><h2 data-section id="positive-space-versus-negative-space"> Positive space versus negative space</h2><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/positive-space-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Positive space</a> is the complete opposite of negative space. Negative space rejects the eye, while positive space steals the spotlight. You see, positive space is the area of a photo that includes elements of interest, the area that includes the main subject, the area where the viewer&#39;s eye goes <em>first</em> .</p><p> In the photo below, there is plenty of positive space but very little negative space. The flag, the buildings, and the trees all act as positive space. Even the clouds provide some positive space thanks to their interesting arrangement and texture. The biggest patch of negative space is the sky, which takes up a tiny portion of the shot.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174284" style="width:1080px"><span class="space" style="width:1080px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1080" height="720" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?resize=1080%2C720&#038;ssl=1" alt="flag above a city Negative space photography" class="wp-image-174284" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Now, positive space can be anything, but here are some common examples:</p><ul><li> Faces</li><li> People</li><li> Buildings</li><li> Birds</li><li> Wildlife</li><li> Mountains</li></ul><p> So which is better, positive or negative space?</p><p> Neither.</p><p> In photography, the goal is to combine <em>both</em> types of space to create a balanced composition. You want negative space, yes, but you also want positive space. That&#39;s how you can get consistently stunning photos!</p><h2 data-section id="negative-space-and-minimalism"> Negative space and minimalism</h2><p> Technically, negative space is present in nearly every image, even if the compositions are chaotic, messy, and otherwise overwhelming. But when you think of negative space, you might associate it with minimalism.为什么？</p><p> Minimalism in photography heavily emphasizes negative space to create a tranquil effect. This type of image uses lots of negative space to give the viewer plenty of room to breathe and focus on the subject.</p><p> Think of a lone tree or a solitary figure in a field, surrounded by emptiness. It makes for an eye-catching composition, and that&#39;s primarily due to the power of negative space!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255882" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:80%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1200" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-21.jpg?resize=1500%2C1200&#038;ssl=1" alt="Negative space photography" class="wp-image-255882" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-21.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-21.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-21.jpg?resize=600%2C480&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-21.jpg?resize=768%2C614&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-21.jpg?resize=717%2C574&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> But there&#39;s an essential point that I want to emphasize: Not all images with negative space are minimalistic. Minimalism uses negative space in a unique way, and you <em>can</em> go for striking results by taking a minimalistic approach, but you don&#39;t have to. You can always compose with a balanced combination of positive and negative space for a different effect.</p><h2 data-section id="the-best-genres-for-negative-space-photography"> The best genres for negative space photography</h2><p> Negative space isn&#39;t confined to a single genre. In fact, you can apply this concept across various types of photography.</p><p> Take landscape shooting, for instance. The wide expanses of sky, beach, mountains, and desert often lend themselves to heavy use of negative space. And this allows the main subject, such as a mountain or a tree, to truly stand out.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255883" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Negative space photography" class="wp-image-255883" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Travel photography also benefits from negative space. Imagine a road stretching through an empty landscape, or a person standing at the edge of a lake; the results are meaningful and striking at the same time.</p><p> Even certain forms of street photography can look great with lots of negative space. A lone figure crossing a wide-open plaza can speak volumes about urban life and isolation.</p><p> On the flip side, portrait photography, event photography, documentary photography, and sports photography often focus more on positive space. The aim here is to convey information about a person, setting, or story, and positive space generally communicates more details.</p><p> But don&#39;t let that limit you! If you feel inspired to shoot documentary images with lots of negative space, go for it. Creativity knows no boundaries, and it&#39;s always refreshing to try new approaches.</p><p> The genres and ideas I shared above are merely suggestions. The beauty of photography lies in personal interpretation and experimentation. Dive into different subjects and see how negative space can enhance your style.</p><h2 data-section id="negative-space-photography-tips-and-tricks"> Negative space photography tips and tricks</h2><p> Hopefully, you now feel ready to capture some negative space images of your own. To that end, here are my favorite tips and techniques for working with negative space:</p><h3 data-section id="let-the-scene-dictate-your-negative-space-and-positive-space-combination"> 1. Let the scene dictate your negative space and positive space combination</h3><p> Every scene has a different ratio of negative space to positive space.</p><p> And while you, as the photographer, can zoom in, change perspective, and crop to emphasize certain parts of the scene, you need to be flexible; you need to be able to embrace a scene that&#39;s full of negative space, just the same as you embrace a scene filled with positive space.</p><p> So don&#39;t try to force a scene in a certain direction. Instead, ask yourself: What is the scene <em>already</em> like?

It was early morning and some fog had rolled in, covering most of the impressive structure. The woman standing next to me turned to me and said, “It&#39;s so sad, we&#39;re driving by today, and I wanted to get a photo of the Percé Rock. But due to the fog, it seems it won&#39;t be possible.”</p><p> She left, disappointed that she didn&#39;t get her shot. But I stayed, and I stood for a long time, examining the fog and the way it draped the rock like a heavy blanket. I thought it was one of the most amazing things to happen that day. I felt so lucky to be there at that exact moment to capture the wonder unfolding. I embraced the negative space, and I captured a beautiful, minimalistic image.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174287" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="foggy rock on the water" class="wp-image-174287" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Bottom line:</p><p> Be adaptable. Be flexible. If negative space dominates a scene, let it, even if you generally prefer to avoid minimalistic compositions. Make sense?</p><h3 data-section id="use-negative-space-to-balance-out-positive-space"> 2. Use negative space to balance out positive space</h3><p> A key goal of photographic composition is to <em>achieve visual balance</em> . You want your images to feel whole, complete, <em>satisfying</em> .</p><p> And one way to achieve balance is by identifying your positive space, then countering it with negative space.</p><p> For instance, look at the image below. You can see the positive space – the clenched fist. It&#39;s a powerful, eye-catching subject, but it&#39;s countered by all the surrounding negative space. It creates an overall balance, as you can see:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-222171" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="negative space raised fist" class="wp-image-222171" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> By the way, it&#39;s important to recognize how <em>lots</em> of negative space can balance out just a little positive space. Positive space is aggressive and powerful. Negative space is much more subdued, even soothing. So unless you&#39;re specifically after a very in-your-face image, positive space should come in small doses.</p><p> Some photographers practice a “2:1” negative space rule, where you add two parts negative space for every one part positive space. I don&#39;t like to restrict myself in this way, but it&#39;s a good guideline to bear in mind.</p><h3 data-section id="experiment-with-minimalism"> 3.

They&#39;re all about negative space; they take lots of negative space, include a touch of positive space, and create an eye-catching result.</p><p> Here&#39;s an example of a minimalist image, where the shadow acts as positive space, while the bricks provide some empty negative space:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174289" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:67.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1011" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=1500%2C1011&#038;ssl=1" alt="cross on the bricks negative space" class="wp-image-174289" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=300%2C202&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=768%2C518&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=600%2C404&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=436%2C293&amp;ssl=1 436w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=717%2C483&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you like the minimalistic look, I highly recommend you try it out. It&#39;s pretty simple to pull off.</p><p> Here are my recommendations:</p><ol><li> Start by identifying a main subject, like a tree, a person, or a building. This will be your <em>positive</em> space.</li><li> Adjust your positive, focal length, and camera angle until your main subject is all alone, surrounded by nothing but negative space. (A low perspective is great for this; by dropping down to the ground, you can frame your subject against the sky.)</li><li> Eliminate as much color as possible. You want uniformity, if you can get it: just one or two colors in a highly harmonious scene.</li><li> Position your main subject toward the edge of the composition. You can try putting the subject at a rule of thirds power point or along a gridline, but you might also consider moving it closer to the edge of the frame.</li></ol><p> The tree photo below is highly minimalistic. It includes a small tree positioned in the corner as positive space, while the rest of the photo is (for the most part) negative space, for a nice overall balance.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174290" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:69.13%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1037" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-07.jpg?resize=1500%2C1037&#038;ssl=1" alt="tree and clouds" class="wp-image-174290" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-07.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-07.jpg?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-07.jpg?resize=768%2C531&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-07.jpg?resize=600%2C415&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-07.jpg?resize=717%2C496&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="use-negative-space-to-convey-emotion"> 4.

Look for anything that doesn&#39;t belong and adjust your composition to exclude it. This might mean changing your angle, repositioning your camera, or waiting for the right moment.

Note that infrared waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation that lies below the visible spectrum. Humans cannot see infrared light, but camera sensors can, and this IR sensitivity can be used to create images.</p><p> That said, cameras aren&#39;t well-equipped to capture infrared wavelengths – after all, they&#39;re designed to use <em>visible</em> light, not IR light! – so infrared imaging requires special filters or adjusted camera sensors.</p><p> When you capture an infrared photo, the result usually looks like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-140750" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><span class="responsive-image wp-image-140750" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="499" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=750%2C499&#038;ssl=1" alt="红外摄影" class="wp-image-140750" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></span></figure></div><p> It&#39;s interesting, but not what most photographers are after.

While it&#39;s suitable for various subjects, there are a few in particular that stand out.</p><p> Landscapes and nature scenes are popular choices among IR photographers. Foliage can produce a wide array of tones, resulting in shots that are haunting yet touched with a subtle sense of realism. Skies and water, with their vast and open spaces, also turn out beautifully in infrared.</p><p> Portraits of people might seem like an infrared no-no – people often look unsettling in infrared – but with the right approach, you might discover a unique way to capture human subjects. And buildings, especially under high-contrast light, can look fascinating in infrared.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255850" style="width:399px"><span class="space" style="width:399px; padding-top:150.38%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="399" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/infrared-photography-1.jpg?resize=399%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="红外摄影" class="wp-image-255850" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/infrared-photography-1.jpg?resize=399%2C600&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/infrared-photography-1.jpg?resize=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1 199w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/infrared-photography-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1155&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/infrared-photography-1.jpg?resize=717%2C1079&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/infrared-photography-1.jpg?w=997&amp;ssl=1 997w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> At the end of the day, don&#39;t restrict yourself to a few specific subjects.

You won&#39;t be capturing thousands of shots, so space shouldn&#39;t be an issue, and RAWs and JPEGs each offer valuable benefits.</p><p> On the one hand, RAW files give you the most scope when processing (and infrared photos do require significant edits). A RAW file will let you recover blown out highlights and clipped shadows, which is essential for infrared photography, as the right exposure settings can be tough to nail down (more on that later!).</p><p> On the other hand, JPEGs are easily viewable, so you can see the results of your infrared photos on your computer screen <em>without</em> any processing.</p><p> It&#39;s important to emphasize, though: Straight-out-of-camera infrared photos look <em>horrible</em> .

You can&#39;t trust your camera&#39;s meter, you can&#39;t trust handheld meters, and you&#39;ll simply need to take some test shots, preview the results on your LCD, and keep going until you get a good result.</p><p> (I&#39;d recommend you take careful notes; that way, as you progress, you&#39;ll start to figure out the right settings for the look you&#39;re after.)</p><p> Infrared filters require extremely long exposure times; they block out visible light but don&#39;t let any <em>extra</em> infrared light through, so on a bright sunny day, you&#39;ll often work with exposure times between 30 and 120 seconds (assuming you&#39;re shooting at f/8). Here, a tripod is essential.</p><p> If your camera is infrared converted, your settings will be much more standard. On sunny days, you might shoot at f/8 and 1/125s, though the settings will vary depending on the light.</p><p> Whether you use a filter or an IR-converted body, review your photos <em>constantly</em> , especially in the beginning. As soon as you&#39;ve taken a shot, check the LCD and view the image histogram. You might consider bracketing your photos to increase your chances of capturing a nice exposure.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-140747" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="499" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_OldFactory.jpg?resize=750%2C499&#038;ssl=1" alt="红外摄影" class="wp-image-140747" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_OldFactory.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_OldFactory.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_OldFactory.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_OldFactory.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_OldFactory.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="post-processing-your-infrared-photos"> Post-processing your infrared photos</h2><p> As previously mentioned, when you shoot RAW infrared images, you&#39;ll get a dull pinkish-red image, like this: </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-140750 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-140750" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><span class="responsive-image wp-image-140750" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="499" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=750%2C499&#038;ssl=1" alt="红外摄影" class="wp-image-140750" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IR_SOOC.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Infrared RAW image straight out of the camera.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Not such a great look, right?

This is true for flash, too; when using any mode other than Manual, the flash and camera together determine the flash output. The light emitted by the flash is set based on various calculations rather than user input.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255098" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rice.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Flash modes in photography" class="wp-image-255098" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rice.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rice.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rice.jpg?resize=768%2C1151&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rice.jpg?resize=717%2C1074&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rice.jpg?w=1001&amp;ssl=1 1001w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> When you have both your flash and camera in Manual mode, you get to manage the light from the flash <em>and</em> your camera&#39;s exposure. It&#39;s all in your hands. Working this way is more complex, but it opens up additional avenues for creativity.</p><p> Personally, I often lean toward using my flashes in Manual mode because the results are more consistent. But my flash mode choice does depend on what I&#39;m photographing.

Then it sets the flash to produce just the right amount of light to illuminate the composition nicely.</p><p> Here&#39;s how TTL works: First, the unit pops a very low-power burst of light; it&#39;s so fast you might miss it. The camera&#39;s <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understand-camera-light-meter-desired-exposure/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure meter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure meter</a> then “reads” the light reflecting back through the lens.

In on-camera and off-camera use, TTL mode may behave differently, however – for specifics, you&#39;ll need to look into your camera and flash manuals.</p><p> Keep in mind that not every flash unit has TTL capabilities <em>and</em> that the flash and camera need to be compatible. If you&#39;re in the market for a flash and want to use TTL mode, pick the right one. Going with a flash that&#39;s the same brand as your camera usually ensures the TTL mode will work, but if you&#39;re considering a third-party flash, double-check that it&#39;s compatible with your camera before buying.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255099" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/old-roses.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="Flash modes in photography" class="wp-image-255099" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/old-roses.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/old-roses.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/old-roses.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/old-roses.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/old-roses.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/old-roses.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="auto-flash-mode"> Auto flash mode</h3><p> In Auto flash mode, the flash decides the light output based on your camera&#39;s exposure settings. Some camera and flash combinations even consider the focus distance. In this mode, the flash will automatically emit the “right” amount of light depending on your exposure settings and how far the subject is from the camera.</p><p> Now, creativity can be a bit limited here. The flash will aim to produce an even light across a scene, but that&#39;s not always what you want. And as with your camera&#39;s Auto mode, the flash won&#39;t always get it right and you can end up with a subpar image. Success hinges on various factors, like the ambient light and the depth of the scene you&#39;re photographing.</p><p> Let&#39;s say you snap a picture of someone against a wall. In Auto mode, the flash will likely brighten the scene quite evenly. But if your subject is further from the wall, the flash might give off enough light to brighten the background too, resulting in an overexposed subject.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255094" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fill-flash-portrait.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="Flash modes in photography" class="wp-image-255094" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fill-flash-portrait.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fill-flash-portrait.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fill-flash-portrait.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fill-flash-portrait.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fill-flash-portrait.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fill-flash-portrait.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="manual-flash-mode"> Manual flash mode</h3><p> Like your camera, your flash likely features a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/using-manual-mode-on-your-external-flash/" target="_blank" aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> . Setting both your camera <em>and</em> your flash to Manual grants you the most control over your exposure. That means you have more room for creative lighting because you haven&#39;t left everything up to the camera and flash.</p><p> You know what your subject is and how you want to light and expose it. But your camera and flash don&#39;t know what you&#39;re thinking. Relying on automatic settings might be easier, but the easy route doesn&#39;t always lead to interesting and creative photos.</p><p> With your flash set to Manual, you&#39;re in charge of calculating the amount of light needed for a good exposure. Back when I used film cameras, I&#39;d crunch numbers to figure out the flash settings.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255096" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/low-angle-flash-on-grater.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="Flash modes in photography" class="wp-image-255096" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/low-angle-flash-on-grater.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/low-angle-flash-on-grater.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/low-angle-flash-on-grater.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/low-angle-flash-on-grater.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/low-angle-flash-on-grater.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/low-angle-flash-on-grater.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> In the digital age, I make educated guesses about flash output, take a shot, and then check the result.

The secret is to practice with each mode. See where they excel and where they might fall short. When you&#39;ve got that down, you&#39;ll be able to confidently pick the most suitable mode for any scenario.</p><p> I often switch to TTL mode during events or when there&#39;s a variety of variables to consider. TTL usually gauges the subject&#39;s distance well and supplies the right amount of light, and if I were to use Manual mode, I&#39;d need to make more adjustments and potentially miss critical shots in the process.</p><p> So make friends with your flash. It&#39;s tempting to crank up your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO setting (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO setting</a> when light is scarce, but that won&#39;t fix bad lighting. Even a little pop of flash can improve a composition, whether you&#39;re shooting in the day or at night. Having a solid grip on flash modes and knowing when to deploy them will let you capture more vibrant pictures in any lighting situation you come across!</p><p>现在交给你：</p><p> <em>Which flash mode do you plan to use, and why?在下面的评论中分享您的想法！</em></p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/flash-modes-photography/">Flash Modes in Photography: A Beginner&#39;s Guide</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com">Digital Photography School</a> .
