data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>黑白风景摄影可能看起来并不特定于设备，而且在很多方面也并非如此，但某些设备可以增强您的体验和图像质量。</p><p>首先，您选择的相机很重要。全画幅型号通常可提供卓越的图像质量，但 APS-C 或微型三分之四型号也可以很棒。如果您要徒步前往不同的地点，更紧凑的无反光镜相机可能会更合适。它更轻， <a aria-label="electronic viewfinder (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/electronic-viewfinders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">电子取景器</a>可以让您以黑白方式“查看”，从而提供最终结果的预览。</p><p>请注意，大多数<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-camera-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="cameras that work well for standard landscape photography (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">适用于标准风景摄影的相机</a><em>也</em>适用于黑白图像，因此如果您已经拍摄了彩色风景，则可能不需要购买另一台相机！</p><p>您对镜头的选择同样重要。您需要涵盖一系列焦距的<a aria-label="landscape photography lenses (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lens-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">风景摄影镜头</a>，例如用于一览风景的广角镜头和用于捕捉更紧密细节的长焦镜头。 <a aria-label="sturdy landscape tripod (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-tripods-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">坚固的风景三脚架</a>是另一个重要的设备，尤其是在长时间曝光或在低光照条件下拍摄时，稳定性是关键。</p><p>最后，投资一个<a aria-label="good neutral density filter (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-nd-filters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">好的中性密度滤光片</a>（参见提示＃8！）也可以派上用场。它可以让您控制进入镜头的光量，从而提供对曝光时间的创造性控制。</p><p>通过组合这些装备，您将能够使用帮助您实现愿景的工具制作美丽的黑白风景图像。请记住，这不是拥有最昂贵的设备，而是了解如何充分利用您所拥有的设备的潜力。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"

data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>当您准备拍摄黑白风景照片时，调整相机设置是关键。您要做的第一件事是将相机切换到<a aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">手动模式</a>。它使您可以完全控制图像的各个方面。不用担心;这比听起来容易！</p><p>窄<a aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">光圈</a>（例如 f/8 或更大）可确保从前景到背景的所有内容都保持清晰。如果您想捕捉场景中的所有细节，这一点至关重要。</p><p>保持<a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a>尽可能低也至关重要。较高的 ISO 级别可能会导致图像出现噪点。使用低 ISO 时，您的照片将保留大量细节并显得清晰。</p><p> <a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">快门速度</a>是另一个需要考虑的重要设置。这可能会根据您想要达到的效果而有所不同。如果您希望创建超长曝光效果（例如河流或瀑布中的丝滑水效果），您可能需要添加中性密度滤镜。该滤镜可让您延长快门速度，而不会过度曝光图像。</p><p> <a aria-label="Focusing manually (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dont-afraid-manual-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">手动对焦</a>可能听起来很吓人，但它可以提供更高的精度。自动对焦可能并不总是能准确地选择您想要清晰的位置。通过自行设置焦点（通常在<a aria-label="hyperfocal distance (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-find-and-use-hyperfocal-distance-for-sharp-backgrounds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">超焦距</a>处，大约进入场景的三分之一处），您可以确保整个镜头清晰。</p><p>最后，不要害怕尝试。尝试不同的设置，看看什么最适合您的特定场景。每个景观都是独一无二的，你练习得越多，这些设置就会变得越直观。</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading"

data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>天气在黑白风景摄影中起着至关重要的作用。与阳光可能提供金色色调的彩色摄影不同，黑白摄影更多的是关于对比度、纹理和形式。</p><p>例如，云可以是摄影师最好的朋友。天空中旋转的纹理云可以为风景提供戏剧性的背景。它们提供了自然的对比度，增强了场景的丰富度。</p><p>另一方面，纯白色的天空提供了一种不同的机会。这些条件更适合包含大量<a aria-label="negative space (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/negative-space-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">负空间的</a>镜头。晴朗的天空在彩色摄影中可能看起来空虚而暗淡，但在黑白摄影中，它可以创造出强大而简约的图像。阴天可以提供柔和均匀的光线，减少刺眼的阴影，给您带来不同的美感。</p><p>但你怎么知道天气会怎样呢？规划是关键。利用天气跟踪应用程序或网站为摄影师提供量身定制的天气预报。这些信息可以帮助您决定最佳的拍摄时间和地点，与您想要营造的情绪或氛围保持一致。</p><p>不要害怕尝试不同的天气条件；雨、雾和暴风雨可以为你的黑白风景增添意想不到的魔力。

href="https://digital-photography-school.com/colorful-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">彩色风景照片</a>，您通常需要找到一个戏剧性的场景并<a aria-label="photograph it in

class="ek-link">黄金时段</a>或日落后拍摄的。）</p><p>但黑白风景摄影非常<em>非常</em>不同。没有色彩，你就不能依赖纯色和光；你必须通过创作强有力的作品来吸引观众。是的，光线很重要，但构图也很重要。除非您能够真正掌握这项技术技能，否则您将很难制作出引人注目的图像。</p><p>换句话说，你需要学会寻找摄影构图的组成部分，而不是仅仅追逐强光：引导线、形状、图案、色调对比度和纹理。当您接近某个场景时，请尝试忽略有趣的颜色。尽你所能以黑白方式<em>查看</em>，以便快速识别引人注目的几何图形、令人印象深刻的纹理等。</p><p>例如，这张照片在黑白效果上效果很好，因为双瀑布和深色岩石之间的色调对比，更不用说平衡的几何形状（全黑背景上的两个双矩形光）：</p><div

您会发现它们都有独特的纹理。有些具有粗糙、沉重的表面，而另一些则非常光滑。</p><p>在下面的照片中，拱门、远处的悬崖和前景中的岩石都具有浓郁的纹理。大海和天空都平滑了很多。岩石的粗糙与海天的平滑形成了强烈的对比。由于这种纹理对比，照片更具冲击力！</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full">

ND 滤镜基本上是位于镜头前面的深色玻璃片，可防止光线照射到相机传感器。换句话说，ND 滤镜<em>可以阻挡光线</em>，让您可以延长快门速度，同时保持平衡的曝光。</p><p>您会发现，作为一名没有 ND 滤镜的风景摄影师，您经常会使用 1/2 秒到 1/125 秒之间的<a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)"

class="ek-link">光圈</a>进行拍摄，这通常是一个好主意）。</p><p>有时，您可能想要延长快门速度以获得创意效果 - 这样您就可以模糊水、拉伸云，并在照片中创造美丽空灵的外观。但在大多数情况下，将快门速度降低到 1/2 秒左右是不可能的。光线太强；如果你尝试这样做，你最终会得到曝光过度的图像。</p><p>除非您有可以阻挡光线的物品 - 例如中性密度滤光片！即使在光线充足的情况下，ND 滤镜也能防止相机对场景过度曝光。这样，您可以将快门速度提高到 5 秒、10 秒甚至更长，就可以获得您想要的有弹性的云朵和模糊的水景。</p><p>看看下面的照片。第一张是在黄昏时拍摄的，快门速度为1/5秒。这个曝光时间足够慢，足以在水中引入一些模糊（看看前景波浪），但还不足以真正使水变平，同时使云变成有趣的条纹。</p><div

例如灯光。</p><p>彩色风景摄影师喜欢在黄金时段拍摄，这种柔和而直射的光线在黑白照片中也看起来很棒。低太阳会产生长长的阴影，您可以将其用作强大的构图元素（例如<a aria-label="leading lines (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-leading-lines-for-better-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">引导线</a>）。</p><p>但作为一名黑白摄影师，您可以在其他时间出去拍摄同样引人注目的图像。例如，阴天会产生柔和、亲密的光线，揭示森林和山地场景的细节。即使是大多数彩色风景摄影师讨厌的正午烈日，也能拍出有趣的黑白照片。诀窍是利用对比光来发挥你的优势。让它创建阴影几何体，然后将阴影合并到您的作品中。</p><p> <a aria-label="Blue hour (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-quick-tips-for-better-blue-hour-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">蓝色时刻</a>是拍摄黑白风景的另一个好时机。光线非常柔和，如果您能找到移动的主体（例如海浪），您将能够捕捉到<em>看起来非常出色的</em>空灵长曝光。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-be-afraid-of-harsh-lighting"> 12.不要害怕刺眼的灯光</h2><p>在上一篇技巧中，我提到强光可以很好地拍摄黑白风景照片。但因为在中午拍摄风景实在是太不受欢迎了，所以我想分享一个个人例子来告诉你我的意思。</p><p>几年前，我在玻利维亚的高原拍摄。中午时分，我到达了壮观而怪异的科罗拉多拉古纳。光线异常明亮。天空万里无云，海拔很高，正值正午，距离赤道只有几度。照明条件再糟糕不过了。</p><p>虽然风景都笼罩在刺眼、丑陋的光线下，但沙漠的颜色却形成了鲜明的对比。偏光镜使天空变暗，消除了最严重的眩光。由此产生的黑白转换即使不是完美的，至少也是非常<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/life-is-too-short-to-be-taking-photos-of-great-subjects-in-bad-light/">糟糕的情况</a>下最好的。</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure

或 Facebook 动态中，更不用说网站组合了。</p><p>在这篇文章中，我分享了在这个假期<a aria-label="capturing beautiful food photos (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-tips-to-seriously-improve-your-food-photography-techniques/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">拍摄美丽食物照片</a>的 10 个关键技巧。我讨论所有的要点，包括设置、背景、灯光和构图；这样，您就可以拍摄所有那些看起来美味的蛋糕、馅饼、饼干、热巧克力和拿铁咖啡！</p><p>让我们开始吧。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="carefully-arrange-your-holiday-food-setup"> 1.精心安排你的节日食物</h2><p>有时，您无法控制食物的放置（例如，如果您在餐馆，或者您是朋友家的客人）。然而，如果您自己制作食物，或者您有机会调整食物的位置，请确保花一些时间来创造令人愉悦的构图。</p><p>毕竟，没有人愿意看到盘子里乱七八糟地散落着饼干。但是精心订购的饼干，巧妙地将小面包屑撒在托盘上？这看起来<em>棒极了</em>，美丽的布置将极大地增强最终的照片效果。</p><p>布置食物时，请特别注意每个食物的大致形状、颜色以及与其相邻食物（以及整个框架）的关系。旨在在整个场景中创造平衡，看看是否可以通过使用颜色对比来增强兴趣。 （如果您正在进行圣诞美食摄影，绿色和红色会是一个很棒的色彩组合！）不要让事情变得太混乱，但也不要让事情看起来静止；尝试创建一种自然的设置，引导视线围绕框架。</p><p>选择通用调色板但添加少量颜色强调也会很有帮助。例如，下一张照片中的红色飞溅打破了暖白色和棕色的单调：</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-159279 size-full"><figure

</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-soft-flattering-light"> 3.使用柔软的，讨人喜欢的光</h2><p>以我的经验，光可以制作或破坏您的食物照片。通过调整光的方向（头顶，前，背部或侧面），并通过修改光（硬或软）的质量，您可以捕获出色的镜头 - 或者您可以创建一个平淡无奇的，无聊的，笨拙的图像。</p><p>那么，哪种光线最适合节日美食照片？首先，请确保关闭相机的弹出式闪光灯。这只会产生刺耳的阴影和明亮的亮点，并且不会对食物有任何帮助。</p><p>取而代之的是，寻找柔和的光线 - 例如，透过半透明的窗帘或朝北或向南的窗户闪闪发光的光线。柔和的光线将有助于保存细节并使食物看起来美味，而且它将更容易捕获曝光良好的图像。</p><p>注意左侧的硬灯（由弹出闪光灯创建）与右侧的软灯（由窗口创建）之间的差异：</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-159267 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter">

target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">侧面照明</a>，这些侧面照明来自食物的<em>后面</em>。侧面照明有助于雕刻食物并增加质地，从而产生三维的感觉。</p><p>看看下一镜头，后者在背景中被大窗户点亮。光线从侧面掠过纸杯蛋糕，通过亮点和阴影伸出深度：</p><div class="wp-block-image

4.想想你的角度</h2><p>一旦确定了适合度假食品设置的正确布置和照明，您就需要考虑与食物有关的<em>位置</em>，即您的角度。</p><p>食品摄影师使用三种广泛的方法：</p><ol><li>从上方拍照</li><li>从45度拍照</li><li>用食物在水平上拍照</li></ol><p>尽管这些方法中的任何一种都可以起作用，但重要的是要考虑每个角度如何影响您的最终图像。直接从头顶拍摄将突出食物顶部的图案和颜色，但它也会使现场变平。相反，与食物一起拍摄的水平将强调其高度和可能的深度，但它不会让观众探索食物布置所产生的更广泛的模式。</p><p>注意这个假期场景之间的区别，从上方拍摄：</p><div

So how you can use this strategy for jaw-dropping results?</p><p> Firstly, many cities offer observation decks specifically designed for panoramic city views. These decks often have enough space for photographers to shoot, but here&#39;s the catch: they don&#39;t generally allow tripods. So before you head to the top of that towering skyscraper, make a quick call to check if tripods are allowed. (Don&#39;t make assumptions; it&#39;s better to ask and plan accordingly!)</p><p> Parking garages can also serve as fantastic makeshift observation decks. You can drive up, park your car, and walk to a good vantage point. But always remember to check whether you&#39;re permitted to photograph there. Laws and regulations differ from city to city, so an afternoon call to the parking garage owners can save you a lot of trouble.</p><p> Finally, you can capture high-angle shots with a drone – and if you&#39;ve got access to a high-quality camera drone and your city&#39;s laws allow drone flights, the sky&#39;s the limit! Drones offer unprecedented angles and perspectives, letting you capture shots that are nothing short of awe-inspiring.</p><p> Of course, if you pursue cityscape drone photography, be responsible.

Use patterns to improve your cityscape compositions</h3><p> If you&#39;re after more <em>subtle</em> cityscape photography, you don&#39;t need to capture stunning vistas of skyscrapers at night; instead, take a walk during the day, observe simple city scenes, and look for patterns.</p><p> You see, patterns can bring a sense of visual rhythm and harmony to an image. And when you incorporate them into the overall scene – here, a wide-angle lens is a big help! – you can create a calming, even <em>meditative</em> image.</p><p> Look at how the two patterns, made of the trees and the pedestrians, elevates this shot: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cityscapes7.jpg?ssl=1" alt="people walking through a park" title="cityscapes7.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> And by the way: Most scenes feature patterns of <em>some</em> kind, even if they&#39;re not immediately apparent. So if you&#39;re drawn to a scene but you can&#39;t find a pattern, stop, take a deep breath, and look around. I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ll be able to find some repeating graphic elements, such as shapes, lines, or even colors.</p><p> When you do, include them in your composition, and let them add interest to – or even unite – the overall scene. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="change-things-up-with-a-telephoto-lens"> 9. Change things up with a telephoto lens</h3><p> Wide-angle lenses are often the go-to for cityscape photography, but hear me out: a telephoto lens has its unique charm. When you&#39;re looking for an alternative to the grand sweeping vistas, a telephoto lens can be a game-changer.</p><p> A 70-200mm zoom lens is especially versatile. With it, you can zoom into specific elements of the city that you find captivating – think intricate architecture, patterned windows, or even far-off bridges. In other words, you can isolate subjects and make them the focus of your photograph.</p><p> Plus, a telephoto lens is particularly adept at showcasing the geometry of cities. The straight lines of the roads, the curves of the buildings, and the grid-like patterns formed by intersecting streets can be made into abstract compositions that celebrate the city&#39;s form.</p><p> Another great advantage of telephoto glass is the ability to compress distances. With a telephoto lens, elements that are far apart can appear closer together, creating a cool effect that wide-angle lenses simply can&#39;t offer.</p><p> So while wide-angle lenses give you the sweeping drama, telephoto lenses showcase the details. Each has its place in cityscape photography. It&#39;s all about choosing the right tool for the story you want to tell. And if you&#39;ve been shying away from telephoto lenses, it&#39;s time to give them a fair shake. You might be surprised at how they can enrich your cityscape photography portfolio. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-symmetry-for-bold-cityscape-images"> 10.

Symmetry can bring that feeling into your cityscape photography.</p><p> It&#39;s easy to shy away from symmetry, to think it clashes with other so-called “rules” of composition, like the rule of thirds. But when wielded with intention, symmetry can add intensity and visual appeal to your shots.</p><p> Take buildings, for example. These concrete structures are often innately symmetrical.

Try frame-within-a-frame compositional techniques</h3><p> The city environment is brimming with opportunities to experiment with composition, and one method that&#39;s always interesting to play around with is the frame-within-a-frame technique.</p><p> The idea is straightforward enough: You choose a primary subject and then frame it using another scene element, typically in the foreground. Archways, door frames, even gaps between buildings – these can all act as your “frame.”</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254901" style="width:480px"><span class="space" style="width:480px; padding-top:125%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="480" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-8.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-254901" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-8.jpg?resize=480%2C600&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-8.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-8.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-8.jpg?resize=717%2C896&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-8.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Now, there are a few things to keep in mind here. First, picking the right aperture – and hence controlling the depth of field in your image – is essential. This is because you want your foreground frame and your main subject to <em>both</em> be in sharp focus.</p><p> Finding the right frame can be challenging when you&#39;re starting out. You might look around and feel there&#39;s nothing that will work. But remember, the frame doesn&#39;t have to completely surround your subject. Even something that partially frames your subject can add depth and draw the viewer&#39;s eye.</p><p> You could also think about the nature of your frame. Is it something rigid and human-made, like a window or a bridge? Or is it something more natural and fluid, like tree branches or reflections? This contrast between the frame and the main subject can make your photo even more intriguing.</p><p> Sometimes, a well-placed frame can dramatically alter the narrative of your photo. A busy street, when viewed through a quiet café window, takes on a different tone. It can emphasize the dichotomy of public and private spaces, the calm amidst the chaos – plus it can just be very eye-catching!</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-use-long-shutter-speeds-to-blur-pedestrians"> 12. Use long shutter speeds to blur pedestrians</h3><p> Many beginner cityscape photographers struggle to deal with pedestrians. After all, if you like the surrounding scene, you may view pedestrians as a distraction.</p><p> And it&#39;s true: Pedestrians can be a distraction when rendered in sharp detail.</p><p> But if you lengthen your shutter speed to 1/5s and beyond, pedestrians will <em>blur</em> . They&#39;ll begin to lose detail, and they&#39;ll appear as an interesting ghostly presence: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cityscapes8.jpg?ssl=1" alt="cityscape photography night people walking through a square" title="cityscapes8.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Note that you can always experiment with different shutter speeds here, and your results will vary depending on the speed of the pedestrians.</p><p> Pro tip: If you want to blur pedestrians but you&#39;re shooting in bright light, I&#39;d recommend mounting a <a aria-label="neutral density filter (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/neutral-density-filters-landscape-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">neutral density filter</a> in front of your lens, which will block light from the sensor and prevent overexposure. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="capture-the-intimate-details"> 13. Capture the intimate details</h3><p> Now let&#39;s shift gears a bit. Cityscape photography isn&#39;t just about capturing wide, sweeping shots. Just as landscape photographers occasionally focus on tiny details within a larger vista, you can do the same in the city.</p><p> Turn your lens to details that strike you as moving or powerful. Get up close and capture them. A weathered door. A vibrant graffiti. A pigeon perched on a windowsill. They all have a story to tell.</p><p> Textures can be incredibly striking, too. The sleek glass of skyscrapers. The rough brickwork of older buildings. The faded flyers plastered on utility poles. The crushed soda can on the sidewalk. These details, though often overlooked, can provide an intimate view of city life.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254902" style="width:480px"><span class="space" style="width:480px; padding-top:125%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="480" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="城市景观摄影：令人惊叹的图像指南（+示例）" class="wp-image-254902" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=480%2C600&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-5.jpg?resize=717%2C896&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cityscape-photography-5.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> It&#39;s not just about what the items <em>are</em> , but how they contribute to your composition. The play of light and shadow. The interesting shapes and forms. The textures and colors. The contrasts and harmonies. Arrange all these elements as if you&#39;re creating an abstract shot out of shapes; that way, you can create a compelling composition that <em>also</em> speaks to the nature of the city.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-if-you-can-t-use-a-tripod-then-improvise"> 14. If you can&#39;t use a tripod, then improvise</h3><p> While tripods are allowed in most places, certain areas – such as city parks, business plazas, and city observation decks – may have a “no tripod” rule. (Alternatively, they may require you to pay to bring in a tripod; it&#39;s up to you to decide whether this is worth the money.)</p><p> Before heading to a new location, I recommend you call ahead to find out whether tripods are allowed. And if they <em>aren&#39;t</em> , don&#39;t give up; just be prepared to do your best with what you have.</p><p> For instance, you might bring a hard-shelled backpack, or look for tables, pillars, benches, and anything else on location that is flat and safe.</p><p> Then position your camera stably and safely, and use a remote release or self-timer to trigger the shutter.

Seek out compositions that include water and city structures. And return to the same location under varying conditions if you can. A sunny day will give you crisp, well-lit shots.

Here&#39;s how to mitigate risks and protect your gear and yourself.</p><p> Firstly, pay close attention to your surroundings. Urban environments are dynamic, and things can change quickly. A location that feels safe during the day may not be so nice when the night falls.永远相信你的直觉。 If something feels off, it probably is. Your shots aren&#39;t worth compromising your safety.</p><p> Now, let&#39;s talk about keeping your gear safe. The temptation to take your eyes off your bag is real, especially when you&#39;re focused on capturing the perfect frame. Don&#39;t give in. Make it a habit to use bags that you can sling across your body and ensure they remain in your field of vision at all times.</p><p> Also, don&#39;t flaunt your gear unnecessarily. Be discreet when changing lenses or memory cards. The less attention you draw to your equipment, the better.</p><p> If you want to shoot cities at night, I&#39;d really recommend you team up. Not only does this add an extra layer of safety, but it&#39;s also a great way to share tips and tricks, enhancing the overall experience. And if you do prefer to go out alone, informing someone about your whereabouts is never a bad idea.</p><p> Lastly, consider insuring your gear. Photography equipment is a significant investment, and in the unfortunate event of theft or damage, insurance will be your financial safety net.

If you can read a histogram, you can quickly and accurately check the exposure of your image while out in the field or when editing at home. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-read-a-histogram-step-by-step"> How to read a histogram: step by step</h2><p> As I explained, a histogram is a graph – which represents the pixels in an image, like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-95300" style="width:374px"><span class="space" style="width:374px; padding-top:66.84%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="374" height="250" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/histogram-info.jpg?resize=374%2C250&#038;ssl=1" alt="histogram-info" class="wp-image-95300" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/histogram-info.jpg?w=374&amp;ssl=1 374w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/histogram-info.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/histogram-info.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by Anne McKinnell</figcaption></figure></div><p> The left side of the graph represents the blacks or shadows, the right side of the graph represents the highlights or bright areas, and the middle section represents the midtones of the photo.</p><p> The graph peaks represent the number of pixels of a particular tone (with each peak corresponding to a different tonal value). So a peak at the right side of the histogram (such as in the example histogram above) indicates a large volume of bright pixels in the image. Whereas a peak at the left side of the histogram indicates a large volume of dark pixels in the image.</p><p> Here&#39;s how I recommend reading a new histogram: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="step-look-at-the-overall-curve-of-the-graph">步骤1：<strong> </strong>Look at the overall curve of the graph</h3><p> Is the histogram skewed to the right? Skewed to the left? Or just generally centered?</p><p> A left-skewed histogram often (but not always!) indicates underexposure, as the shot is full of dark pixels.</p><p> A right-skewed histogram often (but not always!) indicates overexposure, as the shot is full of light pixels.</p><p> And a balanced, generally centered histogram tends to indicate a beautifully detailed, well-exposed image, because the shot is full of midtones. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="step-look-at-the-ends-of-the-histogram"> Step 2: Look at the ends of the histogram</h3><p> A histogram with peaks pressed up against the graph “walls” indicates a loss of information, which is nearly always bad.</p><p> So check both the right and left ends of the histogram. Look for any clipping – highlight clipping along the right side, and shadow clipping along the left side. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-will-a-histogram-tell-you"> What will a histogram tell you?</h3><p> A careful analysis of a histogram will tell you two things:</p><ol><li> Whether an image is broadly well-exposed</li><li> Whether an image has clipped tones</li></ol><p> You can tell that an image is well-exposed if it&#39;s balanced toward the center of the frame, with no obvious skew. Ideally, the graph is spread across the entire histogram, from edge to edge – but without edge <em>peaks</em> , which indicate clipping.</p><p> Here&#39;s an example of a well-exposed histogram: </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-40436 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-40436" style="width:222px"><span class="space" style="width:222px; padding-top:63.96%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="222" height="142" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ideal.png?resize=222%2C142&#038;ssl=1" alt="an ideal histogram" class="wp-image-40436" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ideal.png?w=222&amp;ssl=1 222w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ideal.png?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 222px) 100vw, 222px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This is how an ideal histogram might look: evenly distributed and not up the sides, stretching across the entire graph.</figcaption></figure></div><p> If your histogram looks like the one displayed above, then your exposure is likely perfect and requires no adjustment.</p><p> However, if the graph is skewed to the right and/or includes peaking against the right end, it&#39;s a sign you should reduce your exposure (try boosting the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> ) and retake the image: </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-40439 is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-40439" style="width:208px"><span class="space" style="width:208px; padding-top:60.1%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="208" height="125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/over-exp.jpeg?resize=208%2C125&#038;ssl=1" alt="an overexposed histogram" class="wp-image-40439" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/over-exp.jpeg?w=208&amp;ssl=1 208w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/over-exp.jpeg?resize=206%2C125&amp;ssl=1 206w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/over-exp.jpeg?resize=207%2C125&amp;ssl=1 207w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> And if the graph is skewed to the left and/or includes peaking against the left end, it&#39;s a sign you should increase your exposure (try dropping the shutter speed or increasing the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> ) and retake the image: </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-40440 is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-40440" style="width:435px"><span class="space" style="width:435px; padding-top:42.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="435" height="185" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/histogram-underexposed.png?resize=435%2C185&#038;ssl=1" alt="an underexposed histogram" class="wp-image-40440" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/histogram-underexposed.png?w=435&amp;ssl=1 435w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/histogram-underexposed.png?resize=300%2C128&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="histogram-pitfalls-and-mistakes"> Histogram pitfalls and mistakes</h2><p> In the previous section, I talked all about ideal histograms and how you can use a histogram to determine the perfect exposure for a scene.</p><p> But while this is <em>generally</em> true, and the histogram guidelines I shared above are <em>generally</em> reliable, you may run into three issues: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="your-scene-may-be-naturally-darker-or-lighter-than-middle-gray"> 1. Your scene may be naturally darker or lighter than middle gray</h3><p> A well-balanced, unskewed histogram is ideal for images that include plenty of midtones and are generally centered around midtone detail.</p><p> But certain scenes just don&#39;t look like this. For instance, if you photograph a black rock against a night sky, you might end up with a significantly skewed histogram, even if you&#39;ve captured all the detail correctly: </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-40437 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-40437" style="width:219px"><span class="space" style="width:219px; padding-top:64.38%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="219" height="141" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dark-subject.png?resize=219%2C141&#038;ssl=1" alt="a darker histogram" class="wp-image-40437" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dark-subject.png?w=219&amp;ssl=1 219w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/dark-subject.png?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 219px) 100vw, 219px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This is a histogram for a dark subject.

You can also see the histogram afterward when you review the photo on your LCD screen.</p><p> Either way, you <em>must</em> use the histogram to check your exposure while you&#39;re in the field. That way, you have an opportunity to make another exposure while you are still out with your camera.</p><p> Another key point: Don&#39;t rely on your LCD to give you feedback about exposure. It&#39;s great for checking composition and focus, but not exposure. That&#39;s because the brightness of your LCD doesn&#39;t correspond perfectly with the brightness of your image since you can adjust the brightness of your LCD.</p><p> For example, you can brighten the LCD so you can see it more easily outside on a sunny day. But then if you <em>don&#39;t</em> reduce the brightness and you look at the LCD at night, your images are going to appear super bright when they are not.</p><p> The histogram is also available to you while post-processing your image. Use it to see where adjustments need to be made <em>and</em> to ensure you don&#39;t create areas that are too bright or too dark while processing your images. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="additional-resources-on-histograms"> Additional resources on histograms</h2><p> This video does a great job of explaining how the histogram on your camera works and how to read it: </p><p><iframe loading="lazy" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/CIbcS6Qkel8" width="601" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p><p> I do slightly disagree with his tip that having a mountain in the center is the best option, as it does depend on the subject and your artistic vision! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="histogram-myths-and-misconceptions"> Histogram myths and misconceptions</h2><p> There have been dozens of articles and videos published about the purpose and interpretation of the histogram in post-production. Unfortunately, many of them contain significant errors.</p><p> I&#39;ve been adjusting images for decades – long before the histogram graph was publicly introduced! – and I&#39;ve worked with it every day since it became popular, so I&#39;d like to weigh in on rumors and clarify some facts. Once you understand the histogram&#39;s primary function and limitations, you&#39;ll find it to be a solid feedback resource. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="myth-the-vertical-lines-reflect-image-contrast"> Myth 1: The vertical lines reflect image contrast</h3><p> <strong>FACT:</strong> The horizontal axis does reflect the image&#39;s tonal range (from the darkest tones to the lightest), though the vertical lines reveal little about its contrast. Actually, the horizontal distribution is what reveals the overall contrast. Tones located mostly on the right reveal very light (or high-key) images, while tones favoring the left side are darker (low-key) images.</p><p> The extreme right side wall represents white and the extreme left wall of the graph represents solid black. The highest (vertical) peak of the graph merely indicates the highest ratio of pixels containing that particular color tone as it relates to the others. The lowest vertical level on the graph indicates the tone color with the least number of pixels in the image. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="myth-there-is-one-best-histogram-shape"> Myth 2: There is one <em>best</em> histogram shape</h3><p> <strong>FACT:</strong> There are as many histogram shapes as there are images. There is no such thing as a good or bad histogram, and there is no such thing as an ideal histogram. Because these graphs reflect each image&#39;s distribution of tones, you&#39;ll be hard-pressed to find any two that are alike. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Histogram-Shapes.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Histogram Shapes" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Only images containing mostly midtones will actually display a true bell (mountain) shape on the histogram as in the top left.

In truth, however, there are only 256 vertical bars presented in the histogram. Each horizontal bar represents less than one-half of one percent (0.4%) of the total tonal range (100% / 256 = 0.390625%). Even if a photo contains a very gradual change in tones across a wide area (like an unclouded sky), your eyes will only perceive “banding” if the JPEG image has been degraded by repeated “Save” functions.</p><p> JPEG images contain a maximum of 256 levels (8 bits) of tone between black (solid color) and white (no color). Once JPEG files have been opened and saved several times, the number of tone levels can become significantly reduced and tone-banding may occur. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/News-Journal.jpg?ssl=1" alt="News Journal - Shedding Light on the Histogram - How to Use it in Post-Production" title="News Journal.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/News-Journal-Gappy.jpg?ssl=1" alt="News Journal Gappy - Shedding Light on the Histogram - How to Use it in Post-Production" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> These two histograms appear quite different, though the images are very similar.

Since editing software histograms are based on a horizontal graph only 256 pixels wide, each representation is a basic overview at best. If the full range of possible colors were truly represented by a single graph, the chart would occupy the wall of a good-sized room!</p><p> Let me break down the numbers. This 256 pixel-wide graph portrays each image&#39;s potential color range using an 8-bit (256 level) interpolation. This means that all 16.8 million possible colors are represented in a mere 256 horizontal point histogram. Tones change levels in 0.4% increments. The graph significantly exaggerates the difference between minor shifts in tonal value. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/256-Pixel-Histogram2.jpg?ssl=1" alt="256 Pixel Histogram 2" title="256 Pixel Histogram2.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image from Herb Paynter</figcaption></figure></div><p> Human eyes barely perceive a half-percent (0.5%) difference between tones, so 256 levels in a JPEG image provide the illusion of continuous tone. This means the histogram uses less than two vertical columns to represent a single percent change in value. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/57-58-percent.jpg?ssl=1" alt="57 58 percent" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The two patches on the bottom (marked “57%” and “58%”) are separated by only 1% in tone, though your eyes may have trouble seeing the difference.

There&#39;s something truly magical about witnessing a fireworks display, and as a photography enthusiast, you can&#39;t help but feel the burning desire to capture those fleeting moments forever.</p><p> However, shooting fireworks can be incredibly challenging and require some real technical finesse. That&#39;s where this article comes in handy; I explore a handful of effective approaches to help you master the art of fireworks photography and capture awe-inspiring shots.</p><p> Specifically, I share:</p><ul><li> The best settings for fireworks images</li><li> Essential fireworks photo gear</li><li> A simple way to prevent image blur</li><li>多得多！</li></ul><p> Just a quick note before we get started: Please remember that if you&#39;ve never tried fireworks before, it does depend heavily on trial and error. I&#39;ve made a lot of mistakes myself before I got any images that I was happy to show anyone.  Each time I photograph fireworks, there&#39;s always an element of unpredictability, so you have to learn to adapt, learn from your own mistakes, and do it again.</p><p> Ready to learn how to photograph fireworks? Then let&#39;s dive right in! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="bring-the-right-equipment"> 1. Bring the right equipment</h2><p> What will you need to make good fireworks photos? Let&#39;s break down the basic equipment needs: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-dslr-or-mirrorless-model-for-more-flexibility"> Use a DSLR or mirrorless model for more flexibility</h3><p> You can take fireworks photos with a smartphone camera if that&#39;s all you have. However, the results won&#39;t be quite as impressive, and I&#39;d therefore recommend you invest in (at least) an entry-level DSLR or mirrorless camera.</p><p> Also, be sure to have a good-sized storage card, as well as a spare battery or two, as you&#39;ll usually take lots of shots at a fireworks show. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-zoom-lens-for-compositional-variety"> Use a zoom lens for compositional variety</h3><p> Lens choice largely depends on how close you will be to the fireworks launch location.  If you are close, you may need a wide-angle lens to keep the larger bursts in the frame. If, however, you are a long distance from the show or want to compress the apparent distance between your foreground object and the sky bursts, a telephoto lens might be in order.</p><p> My go-to lens for firework photography is a <a href="https://geni.us/dPSCanonEF24-105F4ISII" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenersponsored nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="ek-link">Canon EF 24-105mm f/4L IS</a> , which covers a good range. Note that you don&#39;t need a particularly fast (ie, wide-aperture) lens as you will be working with mid to small apertures and longer shutter speeds. Of course, it&#39;s worth using a lens that offers consistently crisp results, so don&#39;t skimp on this piece of equipment! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-tripod-to-keep-your-camera-still"> Use a tripod to keep your camera still</h3><p> To capture sharp fireworks shots, it is crucial to keep your camera perfectly still, and this generally requires the use of a sturdy tripod.</p><p> Why is a tripod so important? Fireworks displays occur at night, when lighting conditions are challenging, and long shutter speeds are necessary (more on this later!). When you&#39;re capturing a lengthy exposure, even the slightest camera shake can result in blurry images – unless your camera is set up on a rock-solid tripod, that is.</p><p> Ensure that you set up your tripod on a stable surface and shield it from any potential wind. If you don&#39;t already own a tripod, there are affordable options available, including some <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-travel-tripods/" target="_blank" aria-label="portable travel tripods (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">portable travel tripods</a> . If you don&#39;t have the time or money to purchase a tripod, you can always improvise by placing your camera on the ground or a table.</p><p> Note that shooting with a tripod offers additional benefits: It enables you to try <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/getting-real-hdr/" target="_blank" aria-label="HDR bracketing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">HDR bracketing</a> , and it encourages you to compose more deliberately and thoughtfully by slowing down the process.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174491" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:56.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="844" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photograph-fireworks-tripod.jpg?resize=1500%2C844&#038;ssl=1" alt="photograph fireworks tripod" class="wp-image-174491" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photograph-fireworks-tripod.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photograph-fireworks-tripod.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photograph-fireworks-tripod.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photograph-fireworks-tripod.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photograph-fireworks-tripod.jpg?resize=717%2C403&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-remote-release-to-further-reduce-camera-shake"> Use a remote release to further reduce camera shake</h3><p> Even with your camera securely mounted on a sturdy tripod, there&#39;s a risk of camera shake when you press the shutter button, resulting in blurry shots. This is why a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/8-benefits-using-wireless-remote-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="remote release (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">remote release</a> is an essential firework photography accessory.</p><p> A remote release is a wireless device that connects to your camera, allowing you to trigger the shutter from a distance. By using the remote, you eliminate the need to physically touch the camera, ensuring maximum stability and sharpness in your images.</p><p> Happily, investing in a remote release won&#39;t break the bank (they&#39;re quite affordable)! However, if you don&#39;t have one or prefer not to purchase it, you can get a similar result by activating your camera&#39;s two-second self-timer. While this method isn&#39;t ideal – you&#39;ll need to anticipate the firework bursts and fire the shutter two seconds in advance – it can still get the job done. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="scout-the-location-in-advance"> 2. Scout the location in advance</h2><p> When it comes to capturing stunning fireworks photographs, preparation is key. Firework displays take place after sunset, and if you&#39;ve ever tried to compose in the dark, you&#39;ll know that it is <em>hard</em> . To ensure you make the most of the limited time you have to photograph the spectacle, it is crucial to scout the location in advance.</p><p> Visiting the location earlier in the day allows you to familiarize yourself with the surroundings and identify potential vantage points that will offer breathtaking perspectives. Seek out locations that allow for expansive and sweeping shots, where you can capture the full grandeur of the display. Consider the angles, sightlines, and potential obstacles that may hinder your view or introduce unwanted distractions. By doing so, you can position yourself to capture the magic as it unfolds.</p><p> Note, however, that while scouting the location in advance provides you with valuable insights, it doesn&#39;t mean you have to rigidly stick to predetermined compositions. Embrace the spontaneity of the moment and be open to improvisation. Fireworks are dynamic, and each explosion brings unique patterns and colors to the sky. Use your scouting knowledge as a foundation, but allow yourself to experiment and adapt on the spot! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-low-iso-for-the-cleanest-shots"> 3. Use a low ISO for the cleanest shots</h2><p> High <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISOs (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISOs</a> create brighter exposures, but they also create noise, which reduces image quality and looks plain <em>bad</em> .</p><p> So whenever possible, use your camera&#39;s lowest native ISO setting. And only raise the ISO if your exposures are turning out too dark.</p><p> I recommend using ISO 100 or 200, and this is for a couple of reasons. First, the higher the ISO you use, the more noise you&#39;ll introduce in your images. Noise also tends to live in blue areas of images, and nighttime has a <em>lot</em> of blue, so that compounds the issue. Plus, long exposures tend to increase noise.</p><p> Bottom line: You should work especially hard to minimize noise in your fireworks photos, and that involves using a low ISO. Fortunately, fireworks tend to be very bright, so as long as you use a tripod, you probably won&#39;t need to raise your ISO. Therefore, I&#39;d recommend setting it to ISO 100 and only raising it if you absolutely need a boost.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174493" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/low-iso-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="low iso for fireworks" class="wp-image-174493" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/low-iso-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/low-iso-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/low-iso-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/low-iso-for-fireworks.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/low-iso-for-fireworks.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shoot-in-raw">4. Shoot in RAW</h2><p> For fireworks photographers, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/raw-vs-jpeg/" target="_blank" aria-label="photographing in RAW (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">photographing in RAW</a> is a game-changer. While beginners may opt for JPEG files due to their simplicity and immediate usability, you won&#39;t be able to realize the true potential of your fireworks photographs without working in RAW.</p><p> JPEG files may seem appealing at first, with their smaller size and lack of post-processing requirements. However, they limit your creative freedom when it comes to refining your images. On the other hand, RAW files offer an abundance of possibilities during post-processing. These versatile files allow you to recover details hidden in shadows and highlights, ensuring that every element is faithfully preserved. With RAW, you also have the ability to fine-tune colors and tones, enhancing the overall impact of your firework photographs.</p><p> While it&#39;s true that RAW files require post-processing before sharing them on websites or social media platforms, the editing process can be remarkably quick. Software programs like Adobe Lightroom offer intuitive interfaces that allow you to quickly convert RAW shots into shareable files.</p><p> So don&#39;t let the additional workflow step deter you from shooting in RAW; it&#39;s an investment that <em>really</em> pays off.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="switch-off-your-flash"> 5. Switch off your flash</h2><p> It&#39;s simple, really:</p><p> An on-camera flash (or even an off-camera flash) can only illuminate the area a handful of meters in front of you. Therefore, <em>a flash cannot affect a firework</em> , and turning on your camera&#39;s flash will only serve to waste battery.</p><p> Plus, if your camera uses a flash metering system, an active flash will cause the fireworks to come out dark. And constant flashing may even frustrate other folks trying to watch the fireworks.</p><p> So switch your flash off. And use the long-exposure technique I discuss below! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="turn-off-long-exposure-noise-reduction"> 6. Turn off long exposure noise reduction</h2><p> Many modern cameras have a noise reduction feature, which after the first exposure, takes a second “black frame” exposure, detecting the noise and then subtracting that from the initial exposure. It can work well in some situations, but here&#39;s the thing:</p><p> The second exposure takes as long as the first, and if you&#39;re making multi-second exposures, your camera will be busy working, and you&#39;ll be missing subsequent firework bursts.</p><p> So turn it off. You&#39;ll generally be using a low ISO with minimal noise anyway, and the delay in being able to make more shots isn&#39;t worth the benefit.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="do-not-use-live-view"> 7. Do <em>not</em> use Live View</h2><p> Live View lets you preview your exposures on the camera LCD before you actually press the shutter button. It comes in handy in a lot of situations, but it&#39;ll eat up your battery fast.</p><p> My recommendation: Save your battery for actually shooting and set up your shot using the eyecup viewfinder.</p><p> (That said, if you use a mirrorless camera, Live View is actually <em>less</em> energy-intensive than work via the electronic viewfinder. Therefore, if you shoot mirrorless, using Live View is a good idea!) </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-smaller-apertures-for-the-best-fireworks-photography"> 8.

But what aperture is right for photographing fireworks?</p><p> If you&#39;re capturing fireworks that are far off in the distance and you have no foreground subjects, then you can get away with pretty much any aperture, from wide options like f/2.8 to narrow options like f/16.</p><p> However, if your composition features foreground elements or the fireworks are relatively close to your position, then you&#39;ll want to use a narrow aperture (anywhere between f/8 and f/16 is good).</p><p> Plus, those apertures are pretty optimal for fireworks as the light streaks are controlled by the size of the aperture.  Closing down more will make the light trails thinner, opening up more will make them wider and possible too over exposed.  Do some tests but all the times I&#39;ve done fireworks I keep coming back to f8 as my preference.</p><p> The narrower aperture will widen the depth of field, ensuring that the fireworks <em>and</em> the rest of the scene turn out sharp. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-longer-shutter-speed-but-dont-let-it-go-too-long"> 9.

So if you want to get great fireworks shots, you <em>must</em> choose the perfect shutter speed.</p><p> Now, fireworks leave beautiful light trails, and you can capture this with a longer shutter speed. However, you don&#39;t want to let the shutter go for <em>too</em> long. Fireworks are bright, and if you&#39;re not careful, you&#39;ll end up with lots of clipped highlights in your frames.</p><p> An easy method to handle this is by switching your camera over to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/using-bulb-mode-long-exposure-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="Bulb mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Bulb mode</a> . Once in Bulb mode, the shutter will remain open for as long as you hold down the shutter button (or the shutter release).</p><p> When a firework is about to explode, you can hit the shutter button.

As long as you&#39;re under 30 seconds (the longest shutter speed on most cameras), you can let the camera time the shots for you. Or you can switch to Bulb and just open and close manually when you feel you&#39;ve captured enough bursts in one image. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-manual-focusing-for-sharp-shots"> 10. Use manual focusing for sharp shots</h2><p> Mirrorless autofocus systems are better than ever before – yet focusing in low light still causes cameras to struggle. Plus, refocusing on each new burst of fireworks takes time, which may ultimately cause you to miss the shot.</p><p> Therefore, instead of trying to autofocus, switch your lens over to <a aria-label="manual focus (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dont-afraid-manual-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">manual focus</a> .</p><p> Then, when you see the first burst of fireworks, manually adjust the focus ring until the scene appears sharp.

The challenge is that you generally need to compose <em>before</em> the fireworks actually burst, so anticipation is key. Here are a few quick tips to help you select compositions in advance:</p><ul><li> <strong>Watch a few bursts before you shoot</strong> . In general, each new firework will come from (roughly) the same spot, so by observing the skies, you can get a sense of where to train your camera. You can also get a sense of how long you have between bursts; that way, you can be ready to fire the shutter before each new explosion.</li><li> <strong>Decide whether to shoot vertically</strong> <strong>or horizontally</strong> . You can capture fireworks vertically (portrait orientation) or horizontally (landscape orientation). Both can work for fireworks photography, but I personally prefer a vertical perspective – after all, there&#39;s a lot of vertical firework movement! Horizontal shots are nice if you&#39;re after an expansive shot using a wide-angle lens, however.</li><li> <strong>Refine your framing</strong> . Once you&#39;ve found a nice composition, don&#39;t take a single shot and then move on to the next frame. Instead, see if you can improve the result by moving to one side, getting down low, getting up high, etc. You might be surprised by what you can create when you really dedicate yourself to working the scene. </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="enhance-your-firework-compositions-with-foreground-interest"> 12. Enhance your firework compositions with foreground interest</h2><p> Beginner firework photographers often just point their camera at the sky and shoot away – but while this can produce nice results, if your goal is to create captivating images that leave a lasting impact, incorporating an interesting foreground is a great idea.</p><p> You see, by seamlessly blending a magnificent sky explosion with a compelling foreground, you offer viewers a visual journey. They can start by appreciating the foreground&#39;s charm before engaging with the mesmerizing backdrop.</p><p> Note that you can include all sorts of elements as your foreground interest: buildings, mountains, hills stretching into the distance, or even amusement park rides. The choice is yours, but I encourage you to think carefully about which foreground elements will complement the fireworks display.</p><p> By the way, if you can include foreground elements that offer <a aria-label="leading lines (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-leading-lines-for-better-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">leading lines</a> , the results will be especially spectacular. These lines can create a visual pathway that not only connects the foreground and the fireworks but also enhances the overall composition! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="include-reflections-in-your-firework-compositions"> 13. Include reflections in your firework compositions</h2><p> Looking to elevate your firework shots from ordinary to extraordinary? Incorporating reflections into your compositions can provide that extra touch of brilliance.</p><p> You&#39;ll need to strategically position yourself to include a reflective surface with the frame, but finding a suitable reflective object is easier than you might think. While lakes and ponds can always work, you can also unleash your creativity by utilizing puddles, glossy car surfaces, or even sunglass lenses.</p><p> I&#39;d also encourage you to experiment with different compositions. For instance, try placing the horizon line in different areas of the frame and see what you think of the results. A dead-center horizon will yield a symmetrical shot infused with tension, while a horizon positioned in the upper or lower third of the frame will infuse your image with a dynamic and captivating feel. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="include-people-in-your-images"> 14. Include people in your images</h2><p> While the magnificent bursts of fireworks alone can create awe-inspiring images, incorporating people into your compositions can elevate your fireworks photos to new heights.</p><p> For one, including human figures in your frames will introduce a sense of scale that emphasizes the grandeur of the dazzling light show unfolding in the night sky. Additionally, people can act as foreground interest, adding depth and narrative to your photographs.</p><p> Plus, you can use people to tell stories; a solitary figure gazing in awe at the fireworks can evoke a sense of wonder, while a group of friends or a couple holding hands can portray a shared moment of joy and celebration.</p><p> One fascinating element to explore when including people in firework photography is the interplay between focus points. Experiment with different approaches to create varied effects. You can choose to focus on the fireworks, allowing the people in the foreground to become slightly blurred – or you can focus on the people in the foreground, intentionally blurring the fireworks in the background, creating an ethereal and dreamlike atmosphere. Both techniques can yield compelling results, so don&#39;t hesitate to try different focal points and see which resonates with your artistic vision! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="experiment-with-different-focal-lengths"> 15.

As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, I&#39;d recommend working primarily with a wide-angle zoom.

Far fewer brands make ND 1.8 filters, and the brands that do are usually more expensive, <em>but</em> the filter is very versatile and offers a couple of advantages over the ND 0.9 filter.</p><p> First, since it reduces the exposure by six stops of light as opposed to the three stops of light, you&#39;ll be able to get decent shutter speeds even with a slightly wider aperture. And a wider aperture – in the f/5.6-f/8 range – minimizes diffraction and maximizes sharpness. Plus, an ND 1.8 filter can come in handy when shooting other subjects in the daytime or at twilight, whereas an ND 0.9 filter won&#39;t have a huge effect. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shoot-most-of-your-shots-at-the-start-of-the-show"> 17.

How is that done?</p><p> Here&#39;s the technique, which you can vary for different results.</p><p> Know this takes practice, and luck plays a big part. So decide if you have already got enough necessary shots before you try it and whether the show will last long enough for some experimentation.</p><p> If you&#39;re game, here&#39;s how you do it:</p><ul><li> You will need your hands free for this, and you&#39;ll want to look through the viewfinder or perhaps use Live View, so using the remote release probably isn&#39;t going to work. Instead, set your shutter speed for about 8-10 seconds, leaving all the other camera settings where they were.</li><li> Set your lens to manual focus, then focus on the spot where the fireworks will burst. Turn the ring so things are out of focus.</li><li> Just as a firework explodes, fire the shutter and smoothly turn the focus right back to the focus point. You must get the fireworks in focus before the exposure is complete, but if you finish early, that&#39;s okay. </li></ul><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-173368 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/make-better-fireworks-photos-bloom-technique-02.jpg?ssl=1" alt="better fireworks photos" class="wp-image-173368" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Two images using the defocus-to-focus technique.

Go from focused to unfocused, zoom in or out during the exposure, or maybe take the camera off the tripod and move it during the exposure to make light trails. Play and see what you like.</p><p> Just remember that the duration of the show is limited, so try some experiments but also be sure you have some solid keepers.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-the-black-hat-trick">22. Use the black hat trick</h2><p> Here&#39;s a handy trick that can produce very artistic results:</p><ul><li> Have a hat, preferably one that&#39;s dark and opaque.</li><li> Put the hat over the front of the lens.</li><li> Have the camera in Bulb mode, and just before the firework launches, click open the shutter.</li><li> Quickly but gently – so as not to bump the camera – remove the hat while the firework explodes.</li><li> Leave the shutter open and carefully replace the hat. Repeat, removing and replacing the hat for multiple fireworks bursts. (You may need to have a smaller aperture or lower ISO to do this as you will be building up exposure brightness with each additional firework added).</li><li> Unlock the remote and close the shutter when you&#39;ve done all you want.</li></ul><p> What you&#39;re doing is making a multiple-exposure image in-camera. Of course, you can always capture several images and blend them during post-processing instead! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="experiment-and-evaluate-your-results"> 23.

Review them on your LCD. If they look good, then keep going (and if they look bad, make the necessary adjustments!). Be sure to view your shots throughout the shoot to make sure you haven&#39;t messed up in some significant way. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-photograph-fireworks-final-words"> How to photograph fireworks: final words</h2><p>现在你就得到了它！ Armed with these tips and techniques, you&#39;re ready to capture the dazzling magic of fireworks like a seasoned pro.</p><p> Remember, it&#39;s not just about pointing your camera to the sky and hoping for the best.

Happily, this list features plenty of options worth considering.</p><p> I&#39;ve included some top-notch professional models, but you should bear in mind that the best cameras for portraiture aren&#39;t necessarily the most expensive; hence, you&#39;ll also find some entry-level cameras and budget-conscious recommendations.</p><p> So without further ado, let&#39;s get started!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="canon-eos-r"> 1.

For those who like to make action portraits, you get up to 12 fps continuous shooting via the mechanical shutter, and this jumps to 20 fps continuous shooting when using the electronic shutter. The autofocus has Eye/Face/Head recognition, and its 1053 AF zones use 100% of the AF area to ensure the sharpest images.</p><p> For maximum flexibility, the EOS R5 has up to 8 stops of shake correction; that way you can shoot handheld portraits even in low light. It also has dual memory card slots, an optional battery grip, the ability to voice-tag photos and videos, and many other features that make it the perfect companion for your photoshoots. And – for those who like to work outdoors – it&#39;s weather, drip, and dust sealed.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="nikon-z-ii"> 2.

While its 24 MP sensor can&#39;t compete with the R5&#39;s high-megapixel capabilities, the Z6 II is packed full of features, including a beautiful 3.69M-dot electronic viewfinder that offers a top-notch shooting experience.</p><p> Portrait shooters will appreciate the solid subject-tracking autofocus, which is especially handy when working in faster-paced shooting scenarios (though it&#39;s also highly convenient for more conventional portrait sessions, too). The Z6 II also boasts outstanding image quality, and its low-light performance is spectacular, making it perfect for nighttime and indoor photoshoots. The in-body image stabilization is also a major benefit if you like to shoot handheld in darker scenarios.</p><p> While the Z6 II doesn&#39;t come cheap, it&#39;s not obscenely expensive, either, making it a good pick for serious hobbyists and up-and-coming professionals.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="nikon-z"> 3.

Priced under $1000, it&#39;s an attractive option for those wanting to make the jump from APS-C to full-frame. The 24 MP sensor delivers high-quality images across various portrait scenarios, and I&#39;m a fan of the Z5&#39;s viewfinder, which boasts a 3.6M-dot resolution that outshines the Canon EOS RP&#39;s EVF (on this list below!) for a more immersive and realistic shooting experience.</p><p> What&#39;s more, the Z5 comes with in-body image stabilization and dual card slots – features often found in higher-end models. For photographers who frequently shoot in low-light conditions, the IBIS will be particularly helpful, while the dual-card slots are essential for redundancy when working with clients.</p><p> While the Z5&#39;s 4.5 FPS continuous shooting speed isn&#39;t the fastest, it&#39;s more than sufficient for most portrait sessions. And its compact design is a huge plus for those who prefer a lighter kit and also makes it ideal for on-the-go as well as candid portraits. The Nikon Z5 is a well-rounded camera, offering the benefits of full-frame photography without the hefty price tag; ultimately, it&#39;s a smart choice for portrait hobbyists looking to step up their game.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="canon-eos-rp"> 4.

Priced around $900, body only, it&#39;s an excellent entry point into the world of full-frame photography, even if it struggles to go toe-to-toe with the Nikon Z5 (above).</p><p> Despite its age, the EOS RP&#39;s image quality remains impressive; with its 26 MP sensor, you can expect your portraits to be rich in detail, giving you the flexibility to print your work in large formats without losing any of the fine texture that makes a portrait come alive.</p><p> The EOS RP is relatively compact for a full-frame camera, a trait that is highly valued by portrait photographers who often find themselves in cramped shooting environments. This camera also opens up a world of possibilities with Canons&#39; extensive lens lineup; plenty of EF and RF lenses offer sharpness as well as ultra-wide maximum apertures – a key ingredient for that dreamy, blurred background effect in portraits. When I first got my hands on the EOS RP, its ergonomics were a pleasant surprise; it just feels right in your hands. The viewfinder isn&#39;t as high resolution as I&#39;d like, but it does a decent job, and for casual portrait enthusiasts looking to delve deeper into the craft, the EOS RP strikes a perfect balance between price, performance, and portability.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="canon-eos-d-mark-iv"> 5.

The 5D Mark IV is a professional full-frame camera packing a well-designed 30-megapixel sensor, and as a result, images feature great color depth and <a aria-label="dynamic range (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-dynamic-range-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">dynamic range</a> , even at high <a aria-label="ISOs (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISOs</a> .</p><p> Its AF tracking and AF face detection ensure that you get the sharpest images for both still portraits and action shots, and even if you miss focus by a few millimeters, the Dual Pixel RAW technology allows you to shift the focus in post-processing. For example, if you get the eyelashes sharp instead of the eye, you can make a few adjustments, and – voila! – the eye appears sharp. Another perk of the Dual Pixel RAW tech is the ability to adjust the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" aria-label="bokeh (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">bokeh</a> in the background for a more pleasing effect.</p><p> The camera has a robust build <em>and</em> environmental sealing, which makes it perfect for outdoor portrait sessions. Just remember that it&#39;s not water, dust, or freeze-proof.</p><p> The battery life is around four hours, so you won&#39;t need to worry about interrupting your creative flow. And the 5D Mark IV also features two memory card slots, essential for professionals who need on-the-spot backups of their work.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="nikon-z"> 6.

And its speed and performance make it ideal for those looking to capture more than just posed portraits, so it&#39;s a great choice for photographers looking to delve into more dynamic people photography.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="canon-eos-r"> 13.

The cropped sensor keeps this model in the prosumer or enthusiast category, but that doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t an excellent camera. For some types of portraits – for example, couples or family sessions – you can absolutely do professional work.</p><p> The R10 is still on the newer side, which means it takes advantage of Canon&#39;s more recent technology, including a fantastic 24 MP sensor that captures beautiful images. Autofocus is also impressive; you get 651 focus points plus a host of AF modes, including a powerful face-detection option that&#39;s perfect for keeping subjects in sharp focus even when shooting in tough conditions.</p><p> And dance portrait photographers will love the 15 FPS continuous shooting speeds, which will ensure you can capture even the most fleeting moment. Ergonomics are great, too, thanks to a fully articulating LCD (great for low-angle shots) and a solid-quality electronic viewfinder.</p><p> One of the biggest benefits of the EOS R10 is the access it affords to Canon&#39;s amazing RF-mount lens lineup, which includes plenty of amazing portrait glass. Bonus: Since the camera is so cheap, you&#39;ll have some extra money to splurge on wide-aperture lenses!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="sony-ac"> 14.

It also has a minimum focusing distance of 0.99 feet (0.3 meters) to 1.48 feet (0.45 meters) for detail shots of eyes, hands, and more.</p><p> The autofocus uses Real-Time Tracking, Eye AF, and features a whopping 693 phase-detection points, which cover 93% of the image area, along with 425 contrast-detection points for extreme accuracy even when capturing portraits with busy backgrounds. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="olympus-om-d-e-m-mark-iii"> 15.

However, for long hours of use, you might want to get an external grip; the body is relatively thin and not especially comfortable to hold.</p><p> The E-M5 Mark III is the first model in this series to have on-sensor phase-detect autofocus with face and eye detection, which makes it a great choice for enthusiasts or beginner photographers interested in portrait shooting. And while the camera only offers 20 megapixels, you can use the High-Resolution mode to capture 50 MP JPEGs or 80 MP RAW files.</p><p> And you get plenty more features and creative options, including Pro Capture, which registers up to 14 high-resolution shots with a half-press of the shutter button. That way, when you press the button all the way down, you get a handful of shots taken <em>before</em> your finger fully hammers the shutter (you can choose the best shot later on!).</p><p> While designed for sports photography, Pro Capture is great for working with non-professional models, in case they close their eyes or tense up at the sound of the shutter. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-choose-the-right-portrait-photography-camera"> How to choose the right portrait photography camera</h2><p> Selecting a camera for portrait photography doesn&#39;t have to be an overwhelming task, but it&#39;s essential to keep in mind several key factors that will influence your purchase decision, such as:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="image-quality">画面质量</h3><p>At the core of portrait photography is image quality. Ideally, a camera for this genre should offer a minimum of 20 megapixels, which ensures ample detail for enlargements and prints. More significant than the megapixel count, however, is the sensor size. Full-frame sensors excel in low-light conditions and provide a shallower depth of field effect, crucial for achieving that dreamy background blur prized in portraiture. That said, while full-frame cameras are often regarded as the gold standard for portraits, APS-C cameras are also capable performers, especially when paired with a lens that has a wide maximum aperture.</p><p> In addition to sensor size and resolution, in-body image stabilization (IBIS) is a feature worth considering. IBIS allows you to handhold your camera at slower shutter speeds without sacrificing sharpness and is an invaluable asset when working with natural light. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="autofocusing-performance"> Autofocusing performance</h3><p> The importance of a reliable and accurate autofocus system in portrait photography cannot be overstated. When working with a shallow depth of field – common in portrait work – the margin for error is minimal; a slight mistake can lead to the eyes being out of focus, turning a potentially stunning portrait into a missed opportunity. Hence, it&#39;s crucial to select a camera with a capable autofocusing system.</p><p> Features like Eye AF are especially helpful here. Eye AF technology identifies and locks focus on the subject&#39;s eyes, ensuring critical sharpness where it matters most. This feature becomes even more vital when photographing moving subjects or working in dynamic environments where focusing can be challenging.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="ergonomics">人体工学</h3><p>Ergonomics often get neglected, but comfort in handling can significantly impact your shooting experience, and by extension, the quality of your images. Key ergonomic factors include the design of the camera grip, which should feel secure and comfortable in your hands, and the LCD screen design. A fully articulating or tilting LCD screen offers greater compositional freedom, particularly in challenging shooting angles.</p><p> Another aspect to consider is the viewfinder. A high-resolution electronic viewfinder (EVF) or a nice optical viewfinder can greatly enhance your shooting experience, providing a more accurate and immersive view of your subject. While shooting with the LCD screen is always an option, a quality viewfinder offers a more direct connection with your subject, which is often essential for portrait work.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="lens-compatibility"> Lens compatibility</h3><p> In portrait photography, the choice of lenses is as critical as the camera body. <a aria-label="The best portrait lenses (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lens-for-portrait-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">The best portrait lenses</a> typically feature ultra-wide maximum apertures, such as f/2.8, f/1.8, or even wider. These apertures allow for a shallower depth of field so you can highlight your subject against a smoothly blurred background. Therefore, it&#39;s important to ensure that the camera system you choose supports a wide range of high-quality portrait lenses.</p><p> Fortunately, most major camera brands offer an extensive selection of lenses suitable for portrait work. However, it&#39;s still important to verify that your chosen camera is compatible with the lenses you intend to use, especially if you&#39;re looking for specific focal lengths or apertures.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="price">价格</h3><p>Last, price is an inevitable consideration in the camera selection process. While higher-priced cameras often come with advanced features, it&#39;s important to balance your budget with your actual photography needs. Cameras under $1000, like the Canon EOS R50, are capable of producing stunning portraits and shouldn&#39;t be overlooked!</p><p> Additionally, the most expensive camera isn&#39;t always the best choice for every photographer. Assess your specific needs, such as the kind of portraits you intend to shoot and whether you plan to make large prints. In many cases, a camera with a moderately high-resolution sensor will suffice, and investing in a high-resolution model may only result in unnecessarily large files without a useful gain in image quality. Remember, a significant portion of your budget should also be allocated to lenses and other essential accessories, which are equally important in the art of portrait photography. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-best-camera-for-portrait-photography-final-words"> The best camera for portrait photography: final words</h2><p> As you can see, there are many wonderful portrait cameras – but you need to pick the one that&#39;s right for your needs.</p><p> So ask yourself: Do I want a mirrorless camera or a DSLR? What type of sensor do I want? From there, you can start to narrow down your choices depending on your style, the type of portraiture you like, and personal preference.</p><p>现在交给你：</p><p> <em>Which portrait photography camera is your favorite?

It even boasts a little breast pocket, which you can use to store memory cards or batteries. And the jacket is pretty stylish, too; the outer material looks sleek, plus you can choose from quite a few different colors.</p><p> I&#39;ve seen this Moerdeng ski jacket go for $90, but it&#39;s currently available for just $55.

The benefit is that you can set up your camera on a tripod, and then take photos without actually touching the shutter button, which allows for sharp long-exposure photos, not to mention a convenient way to capture selfies from a distance.</p><p> This particular model also includes several other functions, including the option to capture shots at intervals for beautiful time-lapse sequences.

The course consists of 13 videos, which cover topics such as removing unwanted objects, working with layers, mastering the Photoshop workspace, and using masks. And while Phil doesn&#39;t tackle Photoshop&#39;s super-advanced features (eg, high-level compositing), he discusses pretty much every tool and concept used by serious photographers on a daily basis.</p><p> Photoshop Basics for Photographers is an online course, which means that it can be downloaded instantly.

You can capture environmental wildlife portraits at 100mm, larger mammals in the 200-300mm range, and birds at 400mm, plus you get a serious focal length boost if you shoot with an APS-C camera.</p><p> Then there&#39;s the image quality: The Tamron 100-400mm is pretty darn sharp, which is impressive for a sub-$1000 telephoto zoom. Your wildlife photos will feature gorgeous detail, especially with Vibration Compensation active (this allows you to handhold at impressively slow shutter speeds).</p><p> So for hobbyist wildlife photographers, bird photographers, and even sports photographers, the Tamron 100-400mm is a great choice.

Specifically, I discuss:</p><ul><li> The best time of day for winter landscape photography (this one might surprise you!)</li><li> How to work with the weather</li><li> The right winter camera settings</li><li> How to enhance your winter <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/4-rules-of-composition-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="landscape compositions (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">landscape compositions</a></li><li>很多很多！</li></ul><p> So if you&#39;re ready to take your winter images to the next level, then let&#39;s dive right in, starting with my first tip: </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="pay-attention-to-the-weather"> 1. Pay attention to the weather</h2><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/time-for-landscape-weather-and-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="Weather (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Weather</a> can be the difference between an exhilarating photoshoot and a wasted handful of hours – so it&#39;s always important to check the weather in advance, follow the weather on your phone, and constantly observe the conditions while you&#39;re out shooting.</p><p> There&#39;s not one <em>best</em> type of weather for winter landscape photography, of course. Instead, you need to think about the type of images you want to create, then make plans that coincide with your weather requirements.例如：</p><ul><li> If you want to photograph a pristine snowfall at sunrise, make sure you choose a morning just after the snow has ended so that the blanket of white is completely undisturbed.</li><li> If you want to photograph mountains or trees in a snowstorm, make sure you head out in the thick of the snow (or just before the snow starts). It can help to observe the snowflakes before setting off to make sure they&#39;re reasonably large and are falling sufficiently fast; otherwise, you may struggle to capture the kind of moody winter landscape you&#39;re pursuing.</li></ul><p> You should also watch the weather for safety reasons. If you plan to photograph a snowy mountain scene from a high altitude, you&#39;ll want to avoid driving in during a blizzard. Instead, you should wait until the snow stops or head out in advance. That way, you can capture the photos you want, but you don&#39;t risk yourself or your gear in the process. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="make-the-most-of-winters-longer-dusks-and-dawns"> 2. Make the most of winter&#39;s longer dusks and dawns</h2><p> In spite of the colder temperatures, one of the joys of winter is that the sun tends to linger longer at dusk and dawn. It also remains lower in the sky throughout the day, providing great light.</p><p> If you can brave the elements and venture outside to capture these magical moments during the winter, you are more likely to have a productive shoot and be rewarded for your efforts. One advantage of photographing at dusk and dawn in the winter is that sunrise is much later than in the summer, and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-tips-take-better-sunset-photos-not-photograph-sunset-directly/">sunset</a> is earlier. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-182571 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-182571" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8G6A9807.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="photographing-winter-scenes-01" class="wp-image-182571" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8G6A9807.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8G6A9807.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8G6A9807.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8G6A9807.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8G6A9807.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8G6A9807.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by Jeremy Flint </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="set-the-alarm-for-earlier-than-necessary"> 3. Set the alarm for earlier than necessary</h2><p> You&#39;ve calculated that the sun rises at 6:00 am, you want to get there by 5:30 to set up, it takes you 10 minutes to get there, so you set the alarm for 5:10. But be honest, it never works like this does it?</p><p> The alarm goes off at 5:10, it&#39;s cold, you&#39;re snug in bed, it&#39;s dark outside, you were in the midst of a dream, and you roll back over. Missed sunrise.</p><p> How often do you ever jump straight out of bed at 5:10 to take photos, in the midst of winter? By learning this mistake, I set the alarm for 4:40 then give myself three hits on the snooze button to take me to 5:10.

And when everything is white, it&#39;s quite challenging to find a compositional focal point as nothing really catches the eye.</p><p>所以你会怎么做？</p><p> You look for contrast – either <em>color contrast</em> , where you find a splash of red, blue, or green against the white – or <em>tonal contrast</em> , such as a splash of darkness against the bright snow.</p><p> Here&#39;s an example of color contrast, where I found a red house against a white and gray background:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-138385" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Knutehytta-winter-e1511455748116.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="red house in winter landscape scene" class="wp-image-138385" data-recalc-dims="1"/></span></figure></div><p> The red color is what makes this picture interesting. Without it, the scene would lack a focal point and the viewer&#39;s eyes would have no place to rest, which would make for a bad shot.</p><p> Happily, contrast is easy to find on snowy days because it&#39;ll catch <em>your</em> eye just the same as it&#39;ll catch a photo <em>viewer’s</em> eye. So you can just go around with your camera, searching for an eye-catching element or two.合理？</p><p> By the way, I find red color contrast to be particularly pleasing in winter landscape scenes, but you can really search for any dominant color or tonal variation. Maybe there&#39;s an autumn leaf laying on top of a thin layer of snow, or maybe you can see a few skiers wearing red jackets, or maybe you&#39;re standing before a dark mountain surrounded by white. Just find a dominant color or tone in the otherwise white landscape, then use careful composition techniques to make it a standout focal point. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photograph-colorful-scenes-when-the-sun-is-out"> 5.

Don&#39;t be afraid to use manual focus</h2><p> As I mentioned above, winter landscapes can be intensely <em>white</em> – and when you&#39;re dealing with monochromatic scenes, your camera will often struggle to lock focus.</p><p> When that happens, you have two options, both of which are generally effective. First, you can try using the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-focus-recompose-technique/" target="_blank" aria-label="focus-and-recompose technique (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">focus-and-recompose technique</a> . Simply set your camera to its AF-S (or One-Shot AF) setting, set the AF point to the center of the frame, half-press your shutter button to lock focus on an area of clear contrast in the scene, then recompose the shot. As long as you can find <em>some</em> part of your shot that&#39;s contrasty – a few rocks, a lone tree, or a river – you&#39;ll manage to capture a photo that&#39;s both in-focus <em>and</em> well-composed.</p><p> Occasionally, however, you&#39;ll run into a situation where your scene features very little contrast or the only clear contrast exists far behind your main subject. In the latter situations, I&#39;d recommend switching your lens over to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dont-afraid-manual-focus/" target="_blank" aria-label="manual focus (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">manual focus</a> .

Batteries drain much quicker in winter, and if you shoot mirrorless or you use Live View for most compositions, you&#39;ll soon find yourself without a drop of charge – unless you remember to bring plenty of extra batteries. Original-manufacturer batteries can be pretty pricey, so you might want to consider purchasing third-party batteries.

That way, the batteries stay warm, which prevents the charge from draining fast. And once you&#39;ve finished with a battery, put it back in your coat; you can sometimes “resurrect” dead batteries with a bit of coat warmth!</p><p> (Make sure, however, you don&#39;t put your <em>camera</em> in your coat.

They work well, but make sure that you put them on over waterproof boots if you want to avoid getting your feet cold and wet. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-forget-to-edit-your-winter-landscape-shots"> 16.

A bit of editing can dramatically improve nearly every winter landscape you capture, so I encourage you to review each image, then test out a few presets or play around with a few sliders (at the very least).</p><p> In particular, I&#39;d recommend tweaking the white balance (as I mentioned above, I favor a cooler color cast, but you can push the Temperature slider until you get an effect you like), adding a bit of contrast, subtly boosting the exposure, fine-tuning the tones (especially the highlights and shadows), and experimenting with different hues and saturations.</p><p> Your editing skills will develop over time, but even a few minor adjustments can go a long way! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="winter-landscape-photography-final-words"> Winter landscape photography: final words</h2><p> Hopefully, you can now confidently photograph winter landscapes – so the next time you get a nice snowfall, head outside!

Full body with crossed arms</h3><p> Crossed arms work in full-height shots, as well.</p><p> So use the same posing guidelines as above, then ask your subject to cross one leg in front of the other. But make sure the body weight is not supported equally on both legs; that will look awkward!</p><p> This pose is especially nice for informal photoshoots, such as a family portrait session. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/posing-men-subjects02.png?ssl=1" alt="man standing with legs and arms crossed male pose" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="one-hand-on-a-hip"> 3. One hand on a hip</h3><p> A recurring question from your subject might be, “Where should I put my hands?”</p><p> But while <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/handiwork-pose-hands/" target="_blank" aria-label="hands (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">hands</a> are often a point of confusion and awkwardness, the solution is actually quite simple. There are four places a subject can position their hands, and they can be mixed and matched in any combination:</p><ol><li> Loosely by the side</li><li> On the hips</li><li> In the pockets</li><li> Crossed on the chest</li></ol><p> Note that hands should always be relaxed, which means no muscle pressure (unless you&#39;re photographing a bodybuilder!)</p><p> For this pose, the man should put one hand on his hip, stand square to the camera, and let the other hand dangle loosely – though feel free to experiment with different hand positions, too! </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/posing-men-subjects03.png?ssl=1" alt="man with one hand on hip" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="full-body-with-hands-in-the-pockets"> 4.

In general, I recommend that the hands go in the pants pockets, thumbs out; this is a surefire way to achieve a natural and relaxed pose. However, you can use jacket pockets, too! </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/posing-men-subjects04.png?ssl=1" alt="man posing with hands in pockets" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="clothes-over-the-shoulder"> 5.

It can work for corporate or fashion shots but should be avoided during family and senior portraits.</p><p> Ask your subject to cross one leg over the other, look at the camera, hook a thumb in their pocket, and throw an item of clothing – such as a suit jacket – over their shoulder. The more casual and relaxed they look, the better! </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/posing-men-subjects05.png?ssl=1" alt="man with jacket thrown over the shoulder" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="sitting-with-one-ankle-on-the-knee"> 6. Sitting with one ankle on the knee</h3><p> Sitting poses tend to be pretty casual, and this one is no exception.

Leaning back against the wall</h3><p> This is one of my favorite upright poses, simply because it&#39;s ultra-easy and looks really great.</p><p> Just have your model put their back to a wall and casually recline. Their hands can go in their pockets, and – for a bit of additional flair – ask them to put one foot against the wall (while the other stays flat against the floor). </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/posing-men-subjects07.png?ssl=1" alt="man leaning back against a wall" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="leaning-sideways-against-the-wall"> 8.

Simply ask your model to turn so one shoulder presses against the wall, then encourage them to cross their legs.</p><p> While you can certainly use a hands-in-the-pockets look, try asking your subject to cross their arms instead.

They turn up to the family shoot looking like it&#39;s the last place on earth they want to be, and their crankiness is infectious. Pretty soon, everyone is annoyed, and it makes your job of capturing all those joyful family connections close to impossible.</p><p> I confess that this was also one of my bugbears – until I realized a problem. You see, I was often leaving male partners out of the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/portrait-consultations-two-questions-make-big-difference/" target="_blank" aria-label="consultation process (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">consultation process</a> . And in every grumpy dad case I encountered, I mistakenly assumed that the woman I spoke with during the consultation would communicate everything to their partner and communicate any concerns their partner might have.</p><p> Following a major light-bulb moment, I started to include men in the consultations, and it made a world of difference. As it turned out, my male clients just wanted to be heard! The more you engage with men before the shoot, the more comfortable they will be when you&#39;re wielding a camera, and the better the photos will turn out. (This applies whether you&#39;re photographing a paying client, the guy next door, or your brother.)</p><p> So before you conduct a photoshoot that involves a man, talk with him. Ask him if he has any features he&#39;s sensitive about (a prominent nose, a double chin, acne scarring, and a bit of a tummy are common sensitive areas). Allow him to express his insecurities without feeling silly, and reassure him that you can work around these via posing, camera angles, lighting, and post-processing.</p><p> Ask him what kind of clothes he feels good in, and make sure he understands how these may work for or against him in photographs. Tread gently; if it&#39;s a family session, there&#39;s a good chance his partner is already on his case. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-100283 size-post-large-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-100283" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Photographing-men-.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to photograph men" class="wp-image-100283" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Photographing-men-.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Photographing-men-.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Photographing-men-.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Photographing-men-.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Photographing-men-.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Finally, if a man makes the effort to dress well for your photoshoot, show him the same respect by paying attention to detail in the editing process. Zoom in close and check for stray hairs his razor may have missed, loose threads, and even smudges left by a child&#39;s fingers. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="find-purpose-and-meaning"> 2. Find purpose and meaning</h3><p> Before conducting your session, ask the man why he wants the photos taken. If it&#39;s an individual portrait, what is he using it for? If it&#39;s for <a aria-label="professional purposes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-corporate-style-portrait-techniques/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">professional purposes</a> , what kind of work does he do? What kind of look does he want?

On the other hand, a budding author may love the black-and-white look!</p><p> If you&#39;re doing a family shoot, ask him questions about the family. It sounds like a no-brainer, but you&#39;d be surprised at how often this important step is missed. What does the family like to do together? What is special about his partner? What does he love most about his child or grandchild? Dig deep, and listen to his answers. You&#39;ll appreciate what he reveals, and you can incorporate the insights into your photos.</p><p> The image below shows dad with my eldest daughter, and it&#39;s one of my personal favorites.

Give him something to lean against or sit on</h3><p> Regardless of the amount of time you spend preparing, many men are profoundly uncomfortable in front of a camera, especially at the start of a shoot. And if your subject feels uncomfortable, that will come through in the photos, resulting in stiff, awkward, less-than-optimal shots.</p><p> So start by asking your subject how they feel in front of the camera. Observe their body language, too, as you take your first few shots. If your subject does seem awkward just standing, ask them to lean against a vertical surface such as a wall, fence, lamppost, or car. It will help them feel anchored and will allow them to angle their body without looking unnatural.</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-99799 size-large"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-99799" style="width:567px"><span class="space" style="width:567px; padding-top:149.91%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="567" height="850" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Photographing-men-1-1.jpg?resize=567%2C850&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to photograph men" class="wp-image-99799" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Photographing-men-1-1.jpg?w=567&amp;ssl=1 567w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Photographing-men-1-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Photographing-men-1-1.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Another option is to find something for them to sit on, like a chair, a bench, or even a rock.

Minimize a double chin, a prominent nose, or heavy jowls</h3><p> Men often have certain features they prefer to deemphasize. It&#39;s important to ask them about this in the consultation process; encourage them to be honest, and ensure that they feel safe sharing these insecurities with you. Often, the list will include double chins, prominent noses, and heavy jowls, so you should take steps to minimize these in your photos.</p><p> One way to hide a double chin is to shoot from above eye level with your subject leaning slightly forward. If he&#39;s seated, ask him to rest his forearms on his thighs and angle his knees 45° away from you.</p><p> You can also <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-portrait-lighting-patterns-every-photographer-should-know/" target="_blank" aria-label="use lighting to your advantage (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">use lighting to your advantage</a> . Strong, directional light can visually slim a face or a torso – it&#39;s a trick that often comes in handy!</p><p> The photo on the left was shot from below eye level (the subject was taller than me and was standing) with light falling on both sides of his face. But the photo on the right, where my subject was seated and leaning forward with their head angled away from the camera, is more flattering. Note how strong light reflected off a wall in the late afternoon casts his neck and the left side of his face into shadow. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-post-large-image wp-image-99793"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-99793" style="width:850px"><span class="space" style="width:850px; padding-top:66.35%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="564" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160307-Photographing-men-.jpg?resize=850%2C564&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to photograph men" class="wp-image-99793" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160307-Photographing-men-.jpg?w=850&amp;ssl=1 850w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160307-Photographing-men-.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160307-Photographing-men-.jpg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160307-Photographing-men-.jpg?resize=600%2C398&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160307-Photographing-men-.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160307-Photographing-men-.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160307-Photographing-men-.jpg?resize=717%2C476&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="give-him-something-to-do-with-his-hands"> 5.

Don&#39;t forget about retouching</h3><p> Let&#39;s face it: Cameras can be brutal. They do a great job of capturing all those little imperfections the naked eye generally doesn&#39;t see, and they hold it in a static image for the eye to contemplate.</p><p> In some styles of male portraiture, this is actually useful. Elderly men with craggy faces are popular subjects for travel photographers and photojournalists. However, wrinkles and blemishes are not something you want to highlight in family photos or corporate headshots, so it&#39;s important that you spend some time removing or minimizing these items in the editing room.</p><p> Men will give you hints during the consultation and the shoot. If he cracks jokes such as, “Can you Photoshop me to make me look 10 years younger?” or “Can you make me look like George Clooney?” he&#39;s probably only half-kidding. Just because he&#39;s a man doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s okay with acne or out-of-place nose hairs.</p><p> Now, when it comes to editing, much will depend on your personal style.
