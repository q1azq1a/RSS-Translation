A wide-angle lens is a good place to start. The beauty of a wide-angle lens is that it captures much more of the scene in front of you. If you can afford only one lens initially, I usually suggest a wide-to-standard zoom lens. Something like a 24-70mm f/4 lens is a solid choice for those just beginning their photography journey.</p><p> Over time, you&#39;ll likely want to diversify. A 70-200mm f/4 lens, for example, allows you to capture more intimate landscape scenes without sacrificing quality. And if you&#39;re looking for something to capture sprawling vistas, an ultra-wide 12-24mm f/4 lens is perfect, though it can be a bit pricey.</p><h3 data-section id="a-tripod"> A tripod</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-205178" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-13.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="clouds below the mountains" class="wp-image-205178" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-13.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-13.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-13.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-13.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-13.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-13.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> While I discuss camera settings in detail later on, it&#39;s important to recognize that most landscape photography takes place at narrow apertures and when the light is low. It&#39;s certainly possible to achieve well-exposed shots, but often only if you lengthen your shutter speed to 1/30s and beyond.</p><p> If you&#39;ve ever tried to handhold your camera at 1/30s, you&#39;ll know that it&#39;s <em>really</em> hard; unless your hands are incredibly steady and your technique is outstanding, you&#39;ll end up with unusably blurry images. (Also, even the steadiest photographers regularly fail to handhold images at one-second shutter speeds and beyond!)</p><p> That&#39;s where a <a aria-label="good landscape tripod (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-tripods-for-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">good landscape tripod</a> comes in handy. You can use it to stabilize your camera and keep your photos sharp for 1-second, 5-second, and even 30-second <a aria-label="long exposures (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/step-by-step-guide-to-long-exposure-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">long exposures</a> . Yes, tripods can be expensive, but the best ones work great for years. Think of it as an investment in the sharpness of your photos!</p><p> By the way: Even if the light is strong enough to give you a fast shutter speed, a tripod can still be beneficial. It&#39;ll force you to slow down and consider your composition more carefully.</p><h3 data-section id="a-few-filters"> A few filters</h3><p> Beginners often overlook the importance of filters. In the excitement of capturing that perfect shot, it&#39;s easy to forget that sometimes you need a bit of help from additional gear. A circular polarizer is one such filter that can be a game-changer. It reduces unwanted reflections when you&#39;re photographing water bodies and makes the colors pop in those autumnal forest shots. So it&#39;s a must-have in your kit.</p><p> Neutral density (ND) filters are another set of tools you&#39;ll find invaluable. These filters cut down the amount of light entering your lens, allowing you to play with longer shutter speeds. The result? Breathtaking long-exposure shots, whether it&#39;s silky-smooth water or wispy clouds.</p><p> Then there are graduated neutral density filters to consider. They can be useful but are not essential; you can achieve similar effects using high dynamic range (HDR) techniques.</p><h3 data-section id="key-accessories"> Key accessories</h3><p> Gear doesn&#39;t stop at just the camera and lenses. If you&#39;re trekking through nature to find that one-of-a-kind shot, you&#39;ll need a few extras to make your life easier. A comfortable, roomy backpack is your first essential item. Trust me, it makes all the difference when you&#39;re hiking for hours to find that perfect spot.</p><p> Don&#39;t forget extra batteries. Imagine the sky transforming into those magical twilight colors and your camera dying on you—heartbreaking. Always pack more batteries than you think you&#39;ll need. The same goes for memory cards; you don&#39;t want to run out of storage space just when the lighting gets perfect.</p><p> And while we&#39;re talking about storage, an external hard drive can give you peace of mind. You&#39;ve worked hard to capture those beautiful landscapes; backing them up ensures they&#39;re safe, come what may.</p><h2 data-section id="the-best-camera-settings-for-landscape-photography"> The best camera settings for landscape photography</h2><p> When you&#39;re out in the field, camera settings can make or break your landscape photos.

In other words, you should try to keep as much of your scene in focus as possible.</p><p>为什么？ A landscape that&#39;s sharp from front to back offers all sorts of beautiful details for the eye to explore – and it also feels more <em>real</em> , like the viewer could step forward and fall right into the scene.</p><p> Now, the simplest way to maximize depth of field is to choose a small aperture setting (ie, a large f-number, such as f/11 or f/16). The smaller your aperture, the greater the depth of field, and the more the landscape will be in focus.</p><p> An image like this, which features tack-sharp detail from foreground to background, requires an aperture of at <em>least</em> f/11:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-205186" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-3.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="landscape photography tips winding mountain road" class="wp-image-205186" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-3.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-3.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-3.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-3.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="choose-a-slow-shutter-speed-and-a-low-iso"> Choose a slow shutter speed and a low ISO</h3><p> If you&#39;ve ever been frustrated by underexposed landscapes, you&#39;re not alone.

Slow shutter speeds, particularly around 1/60s or slower, allow more light to hit the sensor.

Unless you want your landscape to resemble an abstract painting, keeping your camera stationary is non-negotiable!</p><p> Now let&#39;s talk ISO. Raising the ISO brightens the image, but it&#39;s a double-edged sword. High ISOs introduce noise, that grainy texture that&#39;s a mortal enemy to image quality.

Scouting is the prep work you do before the actual cooking begins. Trust me, the key to capturing that once-in-a-lifetime shot often involves a lot of prep work, just like in the kitchen. The importance of scouting can&#39;t be overstated. Sometimes, you get that lucky shot just by showing up, but most times, the magic happens because you knew where to be and when.</p><p> Start by researching potential locations online or even through old-fashioned topographical maps. Whenever possible, visit your selected spots beforehand. This might be days, weeks, or even just hours before the actual shoot. Look at the landscape&#39;s geometry, and visualize how different elements will fit into the frame. Lighting is another crucial aspect to consider. Apps that show the sun&#39;s trajectory can be invaluable tools for this. Knowing where the light will fall helps you predict how your subject will look under different lighting conditions. So whether it&#39;s a well-known tourist spot or an unexplored corner of a national park, give yourself plenty of time to scout. Your portfolio will thank you for it.</p><h3 data-section id="look-for-a-focal-point"> 2.

Try to go beyond a conventional “centered” composition (with the main subject sitting statically in the middle of the shot). Instead, try using the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/" target="_blank" aria-label="rule of thirds (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">rule of thirds</a> , or go for a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/photographic-minimalism/" target="_blank" aria-label="minimalist composition (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">minimalist composition</a> by placing the focal point off to the side.</p><h3 data-section id="include-a-stunning-foreground"> 3.

Color management can make or break a photo, influencing the viewer&#39;s emotions and directing their eyes through the composition.</p><p> So, how can you leverage color to elevate your landscape shots? One effective approach is to use complementary colors. These are colors that sit opposite each other on the color wheel. Think of the classic duo of blue and orange. When you frame a sunlit canyon against a clear blue sky, these complementary colors can create a striking contrast that adds depth and excitement to your shot.</p><p> Another approach involves analogous colors, those that are adjacent on the color wheel. These can imbue your photos with a sense of harmony. Consider a woodland scene dappled with the golden light of the setting sun. The warm hues of yellow, orange, and red can create an inviting, peaceful atmosphere that draws viewers in.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256062" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-610.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Landscape Photography: A Comprehensive Guide (+ 23 Expert Tips)" class="wp-image-256062" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-610.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-610.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-610.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-610.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-610.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-610.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> And don&#39;t overlook the power of color to convey mood. Colors are more than just eye candy; they can serve as an emotional language. Imagine capturing a misty morning in the mountains. The cooler shades of blue and gray might evoke feelings of solitude or introspection.</p><p> You also have the option of limiting color to make a specific element stand out. For example, a field of green grass against a blue sky is visually appealing. But include a single, bright-red tulip, and suddenly you have a focal point that commands attention.</p><p> The most experienced landscape photographers are selective about the colors they include or exclude from a shot. A splash of unexpected color can captivate viewers, but remember that poorly managed colors can also distract. So, next time you&#39;re framing a shot, take a moment to think about the color composition. You might be surprised at how much of an impact it can make.</p><h3 data-section id="capture-movement-with-long-exposure-techniques"> 9. Capture movement with long-exposure techniques</h3><p> When most people think about landscapes, they think of calm, serene, and passive environments. However, landscapes are rarely completely still – and if you can convey this movement, you&#39;ll add extra drama and moodiness to your images.</p><p> (Plus, you can use movement to create leading lines <em>or</em> to produce an eye-catching focal point.)</p><p> Here&#39;s what you do:</p><p> First, look for motion, even if it&#39;s subtle. Search for wind in the trees, waves on the beach, water flowing through a stream or over a waterfall, birds flying, or clouds moving overhead. Mount your camera on a tripod and compose your shot.</p><p> Second, lengthen your shutter speed to 1/30s and beyond, then set your exposure. Note that different shutter speeds will give you dramatically different results, so it&#39;s a good idea to take several shots while making adjustments. If you&#39;re working in bright conditions, consider using an ND filter or a polarizer to reduce the light hitting the sensor; that way, you can drop your shutter speed further without worrying about overexposure.</p><p> Note that landscape photographers achieve all kinds of different effects simply by experimenting with various shutter speeds. A 1/15s shot, for instance, will blur moving water but retain plenty of detail in the sky, like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-205183" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:60%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="900" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=1500%2C900&#038;ssl=1" alt="water rushing in on beach" class="wp-image-205183" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-6.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=300%2C180&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=600%2C360&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=768%2C461&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-6.jpg?resize=717%2C430&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Whereas a 30s shot will heavily blur the water and start to stretch the clouds.</p><p> At the end of the day, working with movement is a lot of fun.

Look at how the golden light falls perfectly on these snow-covered trees:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-205185" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:62.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="938" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-12.jpg?resize=1500%2C938&#038;ssl=1" alt="landscape photography tips snow at golden hour" class="wp-image-205185" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-12.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-12.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-12.jpg?resize=600%2C375&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-12.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-12.jpg?resize=717%2C448&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The golden hour also offers lots of cotton-candy-colored skies, and the angle of the low sun creates interesting shadows while enhancing textures.</p><p> But the golden hour isn&#39;t the only time of day that&#39;s great for landscape photography.

And there&#39;s a good reason for it: wide-angle lenses capture sweeping vistas effectively. But sometimes, the real beauty lies in the details. Don&#39;t be afraid to get up close and personal with your landscape. This doesn&#39;t mean you should only use macro lenses to highlight the intricacies of leaves on a forest floor, though that&#39;s a valid approach.</p><p> Telephoto lenses can also be your best friends. These lenses let you zero in on specific elements, like interesting rock formations or a cluster of vibrant autumn trees. The result can be an image that feels more intimate, offering the viewer a unique point of view. The landscape is filled with overlooked treasures, from patterns in the mountains to the way light hits a bunch of leaves. By breaking away from the convention of wide-angle shooting, you can find beauty in unexpected places.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256069" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.2%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="993" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-623.jpg?resize=1500%2C993&#038;ssl=1" alt="Landscape Photography: A Comprehensive Guide (+ 23 Expert Tips)" class="wp-image-256069" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-623.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-623.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-623.jpg?resize=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-623.jpg?resize=768%2C508&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-623.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-623.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-623.jpg?resize=717%2C475&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="test-out-creative-landscape-photo-ideas"> 12. Test out creative landscape photo ideas</h3><p> Landscape photography is immensely popular, and because of this, it can sometimes feel like every shot has been taken, every angle explored. But the creative possibilities are endless if you&#39;re willing to step out of the traditional box. Intentional camera movement, for instance, can produce a pleasing blur effect that&#39;s both dreamy and artistic. It&#39;s not the crystal-clear, hyper-detailed shot that&#39;s often prized in landscape photography, but the abstract results can be stunning in their own right.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256061" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-69.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="Landscape Photography: A Comprehensive Guide (+ 23 Expert Tips)" class="wp-image-256061" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-69.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-69.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-69.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-69.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-69.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-69.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Want more? Consider freelensing. This technique involves detaching the lens and holding it in front of the camera body, tilting it slightly to create a unique focus plane. This can add unexpected blurs and light leaks, offering a fresh take on a familiar landscape.</p><p> Don&#39;t let yourself be confined to conventional lenses, either. Specialty lenses like a fisheye can bring a whole new perspective to your shots, distorting reality in a visually interesting way. The key is to let go of preconceptions. Let your creativity lead the way.</p><h3 data-section id="dont-be-afraid-of-bad-weather"> 13.

But other types of weather are great for landscape photography, including:</p><ul><li> Fog</li><li> Rain</li><li> Dark, heavy clouds</li><li> Snow</li><li> Rainbows</li></ul><p> Unfortunately, many of these weather events don&#39;t last very long, so it&#39;s important that you always keep one eye on the forecast. And if you <em>do</em> expect fog, snow, or storms, choose your location in advance. Fog and snow look great in forest scenes, while rain and stormy clouds can dramatically enhance beach and ocean shots.</p><p> Pro tip: Bad weather, while highly photogenic, can be dangerous! Always tell a friend or family member where you plan to go, always wear proper protective gear, and bring proper protective gear for your equipment, too. I recommend a waterproof camera cover, though you can always get away with a modified trash bag plus some rubber bands (to secure it around the lens).</p><h3 data-section id="photograph-the-landscape-at-night"> 14.

Scouting becomes even more vital when you can only use a flashlight to illuminate potential compositions.</p><p> A sturdy tripod is your best friend for night photography. Long exposures are essential to capture the low light, and any camera shake will ruin the shot. You&#39;re likely to use shutter speeds of 20 seconds or more, so make sure your tripod can handle the job.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256057" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-66.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="Landscape Photography: A Comprehensive Guide (+ 23 Expert Tips)" class="wp-image-256057" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-66.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-66.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-66.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-66.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-66.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-66.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Interested in astrophotography? A wide-angle lens with a fast aperture, like f/2.8, can be a valuable addition to your kit. This setup allows you to capture the night sky while keeping star movement to a minimum.

The world seems to pause, wrapped in a soft white blanket. However, capturing these winter wonderlands comes with its own set of challenges. For starters, your camera will need some extra care. If the snow is still falling while you&#39;re shooting, consider using a rain cover for your gear. Keeping a cloth handy to wipe any snow off your lens can also be a lifesaver.</p><p> Once you&#39;ve safeguarded your equipment, it&#39;s time to get creative. A snow-covered backdrop can bring out dramatic contrasts. Picture the dark outline of a barren tree against a white sky. The key here is embracing simplicity. A snow-covered scene already feels minimalistic.

But here&#39;s a twist: using a shallow depth of field can give your images an entirely different, magical quality. Opening up your aperture to f/2.8 or f/4 lets in a lot of light and significantly blurs out the background.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256053" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-61.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="Landscape Photography: A Comprehensive Guide (+ 23 Expert Tips)" class="wp-image-256053" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-61.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-61.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-61.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-61.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-61.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-61.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The key is to focus attentively on your subject.

The pop of orange in a sunset or the vibrancy of a field of wildflowers can be stunning. Yet, there&#39;s something captivating about black-and-white landscape photography. With a focus on contrast, texture, and form, black-and-white photos strip away distractions. They direct your attention to the core of the scene.</p><p> In the old days, photographers started with black-and-white because that&#39;s all they had. So when you&#39;re shooting in monochrome, you&#39;re kind of paying homage to the roots of landscape photography. Plus, you don&#39;t have to decide right away whether you&#39;ll keep the photo in black-and-white. If you&#39;re shooting in RAW, which I highly recommend, you can make that choice later during post-processing.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256052" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-628.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Landscape Photography: A Comprehensive Guide (+ 23 Expert Tips)" class="wp-image-256052" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-628.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-628.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-628.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-628.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-628.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-628.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> That said, it&#39;s useful to consider black-and-white conversion while shooting.

Here, viewfinder gridlines can be helpful. Most cameras have these activated by default, but if you don&#39;t see them, head into the settings menu and switch them on.</p><p> And if you use the gridlines but you still struggle to keep things straight, you might consider purchasing a bubble level. You can attach one of these to your camera&#39;s hot shoe, and you can use it as a reference when setting up new compositions.</p><h3 data-section id="combine-light-and-shadow"> 19. Combine light and shadow</h3><p> You might have heard the saying that photography is the art of painting with light. Well, it&#39;s not just about the light; it&#39;s also about the shadows. Combining light and shadow in your landscape shots can result in some truly stunning images. The contrast between illuminated areas and dark shadows adds depth, creates mood, and draws the eye to key parts of the frame.</p><p> Waiting for the perfect interplay of light and shadow often requires patience. One of the best times to capture this is when the sky is overcast, and the sun is peeking through the clouds. When that ray of sunshine breaks through and lights up a portion of the landscape while leaving the rest in shadow, you&#39;ve got yourself a golden opportunity.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256049" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-63.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="Landscape Photography: A Comprehensive Guide (+ 23 Expert Tips)" class="wp-image-256049" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-63.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-63.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-63.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-63.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-63.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-63.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Another scenario is during sunrise or sunset.

Stick around. Watch the light and shadow dance across the landscape. You might just find that the most captivating shots come when you blend both elements harmoniously.</p><h3 data-section id="try-hdr-techniques"> 20. Try HDR techniques</h3><p> HDR photography sometimes gets a bad rap, largely because of overdone, unrealistic results. But this doesn&#39;t mean you should shy away from it. When you&#39;re faced with a challenging scene, such as a sunset over the ocean, your camera might not capture the full range of light. That&#39;s where HDR comes in handy. The idea is to take multiple shots at different exposure levels. One for the shadows, one for the midtones, and one for the highlights.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256071" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:65.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="983" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-614.jpg?resize=1500%2C983&#038;ssl=1" alt="Landscape Photography: A Comprehensive Guide (+ 23 Expert Tips)" class="wp-image-256071" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-614.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-614.jpg?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-614.jpg?resize=600%2C393&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-614.jpg?resize=768%2C503&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-614.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-614.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-614.jpg?resize=717%2C470&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Once you&#39;ve got your series of photos, the next step is blending them together.

A photo with details in both the darkest and brightest areas, much like how our eyes perceive the world.</p><p> But remember, subtlety is your friend. It&#39;s easy to go overboard with contrast and saturation sliders. Less is often more when it comes to HDR in landscape photography.

It&#39;s an art form that has its own rules and challenges. Your composition skills are more important than ever.

Look for elements that make their shots effective. Is it the angle? The lighting? The way they&#39;ve framed a particular landscape feature? As you dissect these factors, you&#39;ll find it easier to replicate them in your own work.</p><p> Of course, safety and legality are paramount. Always abide by the rules governing drone use in your area. Most countries have regulations about where you can and can&#39;t fly, and some require a license.

Don&#39;t think of editing as cheating or as something that sullies the “purity” of your photos. Trust me, even the best photos can benefit from a little post-processing.</p><p> Imagine editing as the final brushstroke in your creative process. Sure, you can get great shots straight out of the camera, but they&#39;ll almost always look better with a bit of tweaking. Simple things like adjusting exposure, white balance, and contrast can make a world of difference. These basic tweaks aim to make the photo match what your eyes saw. That&#39;s what we call “getting it right in camera.”</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256073" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-618.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Landscape Photography: A Comprehensive Guide (+ 23 Expert Tips)" class="wp-image-256073" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-618.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-618.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-618.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-618.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-618.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/landscape-photography-618.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> But the fun doesn&#39;t stop there. Editing software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop offers tons of creative possibilities. Want to emphasize the golden hue of a sunset? You can do that. Fancy adding a vignette to make your subject pop? It&#39;s all possible. And as you grow more confident, you can start playing with advanced techniques like dodging and burning. This helps to add a sense of depth and dimension to your landscapes.</p><p> In essence, editing allows you to achieve the photo you envisioned – or even to put your personal stamp on a photo. So don&#39;t skip this step. Even a few small adjustments can transform a good photo into a masterpiece.</p><h2 data-section id="landscape-photography-tips-conclusion"> Landscape photography tips: conclusion</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-205175" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:60.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="908" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C908&#038;ssl=1" alt="landscape photography tips waterfall in Iceland" class="wp-image-205175" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=300%2C182&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=600%2C363&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=768%2C465&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/landscape-photography-tips-4.jpg?resize=717%2C434&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Now that you&#39;ve finished this article, you&#39;re ready to capture some stunning landscape photography!

Accidents and thefts can – and will – happen. Be prepared!)</p><p> So if you&#39;re ready to put together a top-notch travel photography kit, then let&#39;s dive right in, starting with the most important gear item of all:</p><h2 id="1-a-camera"> 1.

Honestly, there are so many different choices, plenty of which are capable of great images, so the only way to <em>really</em> know what&#39;s right is for you to think about your shooting preferences, then do some serious research.</p><p> But I do have a few pieces of advice.</p><p> For one, make sure that your camera is portable enough to carry all around the world, yet offers strong enough image quality to create stunning prints. It might sound like a tall order, but you can find entry-level mirrorless cameras, DSLRs, and even point-and-shoot models that are small, lightweight, and take great pictures (they won&#39;t break the bank, either).</p><p> Of course, there are also pro-level cameras that fit the bill, but they&#39;re far pricier. Professional travel photographers tend to use high-end mirrorless and DSLR cameras, which range from around $1,500 to $5,000 USD. One advantage of these cameras, in addition to the insane low-light capabilities and high megapixel counts, is the (often) robust weather sealing. If you plan to shoot in rain, snow, blowing sand, or sea spray, weather sealing is hugely beneficial. It might even be a must-have feature.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256017" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-6.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="Essential Travel Photography Gear: 11 Must-Have Items" class="wp-image-256017" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-6.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-6.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-6.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-6.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-6.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-6.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you&#39;re not sure whether a specific camera is right for you, I highly recommend renting before you buy. There are plenty of great online rental companies (and you can find in-person rental companies locally, too). Grab the camera for a day or three, go out and take some photos, and see what you think. You may end up frustrated or you may fall in love – but after a few hours, you&#39;ll know whether it&#39;s a camera worth buying.</p><p> By the way, when you&#39;re ready to purchase, shop around. Don&#39;t forget that you can always buy secondhand cameras; these cost half as much but are often in outstanding condition.</p><h2 id="2-lenses"> 2.

Wide-angle lenses, for instance, will get you completely different results from telephoto lenses. And wide-aperture lenses will let you shoot in very low light, though you&#39;ll pay for it in money, size, and weight.</p><p> To start, you&#39;ll need a workhorse lens, which you can use for most of your travel photography. It should offer a good range of focal lengths, should be relatively lightweight, and should offer decent optical quality. I&#39;d recommend looking into 24-70mm lenses, which are great for everything from landscapes to <a aria-label="travel portraits (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-ways-improve-travel-photography-portraits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">travel portraits</a> .

In fact, ask any travel photographer to name their favorite accessory, and they&#39;ll most likely say a tripod.</p><p> What makes tripods so special?</p><p> For one, without a tripod, you cannot take photos that require slow <a aria-label="shutter speeds (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speeds</a> . Image stabilization technology is great, but you can&#39;t use IS to capture ultra-long exposures at night; try it, and you&#39;ll likely end up with a series of blurry photos.</p><p> And yes, tripods do slow you down, but that&#39;s often a good thing. Tripods mean that you spend a bit more time <em>thinking</em> and <em>composing</em> rather than just snapping away.</p><p> There are plenty of amazing tripods, and the one that you choose will come down to personal preference, budget, and weight tolerance. Most travel photographers go with carbon fiber tripods, as they are stable and lightweight, and I recommend that you do the same.</p><p> Now, when you&#39;re looking at tripods, you&#39;ll probably notice plenty of cheap options – in the $50 to $150 range – and you&#39;ll wonder: <em>Why can&#39;t I get one of those?</em></p><p> Well, you <em>can</em> , but they&#39;ll often weigh a ton. You might not think that 7 lb sounds like a lot, but try carrying a 7 lb tripod for an entire day (along with your camera, lenses, and accessories) and you&#39;ll wish you had paid more money for a lighter model.</p><p> And if you find a cheap tripod that doesn&#39;t weigh a ton, it&#39;s likely very unstable. Do you really want to rely on something cheap and flimsy to hold up your expensive camera? In my view, you should always choose the best tripod that you can afford. It&#39;ll last you a long time, anyway, and will be well worth the initial investment.</p><h2 id="4-a-camera-bag"> 4.

Your camera&#39;s at the ready. But wait—your camera displays a warning that you&#39;re almost out of memory. The beauty of the moment fades as you frantically sift through your photos, deciding which ones to delete to make room. Frustrating, isn&#39;t it? To avoid this scenario, stock up on memory cards. Lots of them.</p><p> How many should you bring? Well, that depends. It&#39;s a balancing act between the length of your trip, your shooting style, the megapixels your camera has, and the capacity of the cards you&#39;re considering. If you&#39;re someone who loves shooting for long stretches, or if you&#39;re a fan of burst mode, then you&#39;ll need hefty storage—say, around 500 GB or even more for extended trips.</p><p> Don&#39;t just think about quantity; consider the safety of your digital treasures. I&#39;ll talk about external hard drives later, but even before that, invest in a quality memory card case. These nifty little containers shield your cards from elements like rain, dirt, and dust.

Maybe you&#39;re in a remote village or trekking through the wilderness; it&#39;s not like you can just plug your charger into a tree.</p><p> While original batteries can be pricey, third-party options usually offer a more budget-friendly alternative without sacrificing much in terms of performance. In warm climates and where you know you&#39;ll have frequent access to power, one spare should suffice. But if you&#39;re headed to a colder climate, or places where charging might be a challenge, 3-5 spare batteries would be more appropriate, especially if you&#39;re using modern mirrorless cameras, which tend to be power-hungry.</p><h2 data-section id="an-external-hard-drive"> 7.

Yet, that moment of joy can turn to panic if something happens to your memory cards. This is where an external hard drive steps in as your safety net.

We&#39;re talking about crisp, clear shots when the sun&#39;s gone down or when you&#39;re indoors. Sure, you could use your camera&#39;s built-in timer or even your smartphone to snap a photo. But a remote release eliminates any risk of camera shake, which can ruin an otherwise perfect shot.</p><p> Especially useful for low-light photography, this tiny device allows you to trigger the camera without touching it. This is crucial when you&#39;re working with slow shutter speeds to get that perfect exposure. What&#39;s more, these gadgets aren&#39;t a major investment. Basic models often cost less than $20. So if you&#39;re planning to capture the serene twilight or the dynamic city lights, do consider adding a remote release to your kit.</p><h2 data-section id="a-raincover"> 9.

You&#39;re in a beautiful location, the light is perfect, and then—bam! Raindrops start falling. If you don&#39;t want your camera to be a casualty of unexpected weather, a rain cover is a smart addition to your gear. Think of it as an insurance policy for your camera, safeguarding your investment from water damage.</p><p> A basic rain cover should do the trick for most situations. These are generally affordable and easy to slip over your camera and lens. They&#39;re made of water-resistant materials like nylon or polyethylene and usually have a clear panel so you can still see your camera&#39;s settings. But if you find yourself in a situation where you have to improvise, a trash bag secured with rubber bands can also be a makeshift solution.</p><p> This gear isn&#39;t glamorous, but it&#39;s effective. And when you&#39;re far from home, capturing scenes you&#39;ve only dreamt of, practicality trumps glamour every time.</p><h2 data-section id="a-cleaning-kit"> 10.

Whether you&#39;re trekking through the Amazon or wandering through the streets of Paris, your camera is at risk. Elements like rain, dust, and even snow can turn from scenic details into gear-ruining nightmares. So, just as you wouldn&#39;t venture out without your personal toiletries, don&#39;t forget your camera&#39;s cleaning kit.</p><p> A basic kit doesn&#39;t have to be bulky. A small pouch can hold all the essentials: microfiber cloths for your lens, a rocket blower to force out the pesky dust, and a small brush to reach into the crevices of your camera body. These simple tools can be lifesavers, ensuring that your camera remains functional and your photos remain clear.</p><h2 data-section id="filters"> 11.

Filters can be game-changers, particularly for travel photographers capturing diverse scenes. Say you&#39;re photographing a lake surrounded by lush trees. A polarizing filter will minimize glare on the water and make those green leaves pop. The difference it makes is like night and day.</p><p> Neutral density filters are another key accessory. These are useful when you want to experiment with long-exposure shots. Maybe you&#39;re near a flowing river and you want to capture that silky-smooth water effect. A neutral density filter will let you shoot at slower shutter speeds without overexposing your image.</p><p> Last but not least, let&#39;s talk about protective filters like UV or clear filters. These may not dramatically alter your images, but they safeguard your valuable lens from scratches, smudges, and even minor falls. I say it&#39;s a lot easier—and cheaper—to replace a filter than a lens.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256016" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-8.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Essential Travel Photography Gear: 11 Must-Have Items" class="wp-image-256016" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-8.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-8.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-8.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-8.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-8.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/travel-photography-gear-8.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 id="essential-travel-photography-gear-final-words"> Essential travel photography gear: final words</h2><p> Buying your first camera, lenses, and accessories can be a daunting prospect.</p><p> But if you pay careful attention to this list, do your research, and get the absolute essentials, then your kit will turn out great.

Once you know how to use shutter speed, you&#39;ll be able to capture sharp photos at will. You&#39;ll also be prepared to capture interesting artistic effects (such as <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-capture-motion-blur-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">slow shutter speed blur</a> ).</p><p> In this article, I&#39;m going to take you through all the shutter speed basics, including:</p><ul><li> A simple definition of shutter speed</li><li> The effects that shutter speed has on your images</li><li> The different (and importance) of slow versus fast shutter speeds</li><li> How to use different shutter speeds for outstanding results</li></ul><p> So if you&#39;re ready to become a shutter speed photography expert, then let&#39;s dive right in!</p><h2 data-section id="what-is-shutter-speed"> What is shutter speed?</h2><p> Shutter speed is the length of time the camera shutter is open while the camera takes a photo.</p><p> You press the shutter button, the shutter opens for a predetermined time period (ie, the shutter speed), then the shutter closes and the image is complete.</p><p> When the shutter is open, light hits the camera sensor; therefore, the longer the shutter speed, the more light the sensor receives. This has various effects, as discussed in the next section.</p><p> Note that shutter speed is measured in seconds (or fractions of a second). Here are a few common shutter speeds:</p><ul><li> 10s</li><li> 1s</li><li> 1/10s</li><li> 1/30s</li><li> 1/60s</li><li> 1/125s</li><li> 1/250s</li><li> 1/500s</li><li> 1/1000s</li><li> 1/1600s</li><li> 1/2000s</li></ul><p> The list begins with a long, 10-second shutter speed, but the shutter speeds get shorter and shorter, ending with a lightning-fast 1/2000s shutter speed.</p><p> Note that the shutter speed measurements listed above certainly aren&#39;t comprehensive. Most DSLRs and mirrorless cameras let you select from 30-second shutter speeds all the way down to 1/4000s or 1/8000s, though you may also have access to a special mode – called Bulb mode – that lets you keep the shutter button open for your desired length of time.</p><p> Therefore, while most cameras offer several dozen basic shutter speed options (shutter speed <em>presets</em> , if you will), there are literally thousands of possible shutter speeds you can use, all of which expose the camera sensor to slightly different quantities of light. Make sense?</p><h2 data-section id="how-shutter-speed-affects-your-photos"> How shutter speed affects your photos</h2><p> Shutter speed impacts your images in two key ways:</p><ol><li> It increases and decreases <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure</a> (ie, image brightness)</li><li> It increases and decreases sharpness (ie, image detail)</li></ol><p> Let&#39;s take a look at each item in turn.</p><h3 data-section id="shutter-speed-increases-and-decreases-exposure"> Shutter speed increases and decreases exposure</h3><p> The longer the shutter speed, the more light that hits your camera sensor – and the <em>brighter the image becomes</em> .</p><p> So if you photograph a tree at 1/1000s, then you lower the shutter speed to 1s, your second image – with its slower shutter speed – will be noticeably brighter.</p><p> This has major consequences. Much of photography is about achieving the proper brightness, or <em>exposure</em> , for a scene, and by adjusting the shutter speed, you can get different results. For this reason, shutter speed is one of the three camera exposure variables (along with <a aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> and <a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> ).</p><p> So when you&#39;re out with your camera, you&#39;ll need to adjust the shutter speed to achieve a nice, balanced exposure. The specifics will depend on the scene, but watch for blown-out highlights and clipped shadows. In other words, make sure you don&#39;t over or underexpose so heavily that you lose information in the lightest or darkest parts of the photo.</p><h3 data-section id="shutter-speed-increases-and-decreases-sharpness"> Shutter speed increases and decreases sharpness</h3><p> Faster shutter speeds <em>freeze</em> motion. Slower shutter speeds <em>blur</em> motion.</p><p> So if you&#39;re photographing a bird in flight at 1/4000s, every feather will be crisp, even the flapping wings. But if you photograph that same bird at 1/15s, it will be an indecipherable blur.</p><p> Now, the shutter speed needed to freeze motion will change depending on the speed of the moving object.

Ask yourself: Are any subjects <em>moving</em> ? And if so, what shutter speed do I need to <em>freeze</em> them?</p><p> You&#39;ll get better at determining the lowest-possible shutter speed over time, but at first, it will take a lot of trial and error. Here&#39;s a list of minimum sharp shutter speeds to get you started:</p><ul><li> Water flowing: 1/125s</li><li> People walking: 1/250s</li><li> People/animals running: 1/500s</li><li> Cars driving: 1/1000s</li><li> Birds flying: 1/2000s</li></ul><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-147934" style="width:2600px"><span class="space" style="width:2600px; padding-top:56.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2600" height="1463" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/introduction-to-shutter-speed.jpg?resize=2600%2C1463&#038;ssl=1" alt="fast shutter speed hummingbird with splashing water" class="wp-image-147934" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/introduction-to-shutter-speed.jpg?w=2600&amp;ssl=1 2600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/introduction-to-shutter-speed.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/introduction-to-shutter-speed.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/introduction-to-shutter-speed.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/introduction-to-shutter-speed.jpg?resize=717%2C403&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/introduction-to-shutter-speed.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Also note that, if your scene has zero movement, you cannot simply select whatever shutter speed you like. If you&#39;re handholding your camera, then your hands will shake, and this will create blur – unless your shutter speed is fast enough.</p><p> The lowest-possible handheld shutter speed varies from person to person, plus it depends on your lens (longer lenses increase camera shake). And thanks to image stabilization technology, some cameras and lenses allow for slower handheld shooting. But I&#39;d recommend keeping the shutter speed above 1/60s or so for short lenses, and 1/160s or so for long lenses, at least until you&#39;ve done some tests.</p><p> Of course, if you&#39;re shooting a scene with no movement, you do have another option: you can shoot with a tripod. Assuming your tripod is sturdy, it will let you drop your shutter speed as low as you like (which is how you can create beautiful moving water effects, as I discuss later in this article!). </p><h3 data-section id="step-boost-your-shutter-speed-or-adjust-other-variables-for-the-proper-exposure"> Step 2: Boost your shutter speed (or adjust other variables) for the proper exposure</h3><p> At this point, you should know your <em>minimum</em> shutter speed for a sharp shot. You shouldn&#39;t drop below this speed – but you can always go above it, depending on your exposure needs.</p><p> If you&#39;re in Manual mode, check your camera&#39;s exposure bar (in the viewfinder). If the scene is overexposed, go ahead and boost the shutter speed.</p><p> If you&#39;re in Shutter Priority mode, your camera will automatically select an aperture for a good exposure. But feel free to raise the shutter speed as long as your camera continues to choose an aperture you like.</p><p> On the other hand, if the scene is <em>underexposed</em> according to your camera&#39;s exposure bar, you&#39;ll need to change other camera settings to get the right exposure. Consider widening the aperture – but if this isn&#39;t possible, you&#39;ll need to raise the ISO.</p><p> Do <em>not</em> drop the shutter speed, however. Better to increase the ISO for a noisy image than to end up with unwanted blur.</p><p> And that&#39;s it! To recap: Start by identifying your lowest-possible shutter speed for a sharp shot, then simply make tweaks for the optimal exposure.</p><p> That way, you get a crisp photo – with a balanced exposure, too.</p><h2 data-section id="slow-shutter-speed-photography"> Slow shutter speed photography</h2><p> The advice I&#39;ve given above is perfect for situations where you want to freeze a moving subject.</p><p> But what if a sharp shot isn&#39;t your goal? What if, instead, you want to creatively <em>blur</em> your photo for a beautiful effect?</p><p> You see, blur isn&#39;t always bad; it can communicate motion, plus it can look truly breathtaking, as in this waterfall shot:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-198368" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-26.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="waterfalls slow shutter speed" class="wp-image-198368" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-26.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-26.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-26.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-26.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-26.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutter-speed-26.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> In deliberate motion-blur situations, you should set your camera to Manual mode, then dial in the exact shutter speed you&#39;re after.</p><p> At this point, you should check your camera&#39;s exposure bar and adjust the aperture and/or ISO for a good exposure.</p><p> Note that you definitely need a tripod for this type of long-exposure photography. Otherwise, the entire shot will blur!</p><p> Pro tip: If you&#39;re struggling to get a slow enough shutter speed without overexposing the image, consider using a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-nd-filters/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">neutral density filter</a> , which blocks out light and is perfect for <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/step-by-step-guide-to-long-exposure-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="long exposure shooting (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">long exposure shooting</a> .

Basic recommendations</h2><p> Now that you&#39;re familiar with the ins and outs of selecting a shutter speed, I&#39;d like to share a few basic recommendations for selecting the right shutter speed. These recommendations won&#39;t <em>always</em> work, but they should certainly offer you a good starting point when adjusting your camera settings.</p><h3 data-section id="the-best-shutter-speeds-for-landscape-photography"> The best shutter speeds for landscape photography</h3><p> Landscape photographers generally have two shutter-related goals:</p><ol><li> Get the image sharp from foreground to background</li><li> Create artistic motion blur in moving water and clouds</li></ol><p> Now, foreground-to-background sharpness refers to a <em>deep depth of field</em> . And while this isn&#39;t directly related to shutter speed, the longer the shutter speed, the easier it becomes to achieve a deep depth of field.</p><p> (Why? The depth of field is controlled by the aperture – and lengthier shutter speeds allow you to adjust the aperture without underexposing the scene.)</p><p> Plus, as I explained in a previous section, if you want artistic motion blur, you need to lengthen the shutter speed.</p><p> Bottom line: Landscape photography thrives on long exposures. Most landscape photographers shoot at 1s to 1/200s in bright daylight, and as the light falls, the shutter speeds slow. Many landscape shooters work at 1/30s to 30s (or more) around sunrise, sunset, and at night.</p><p> Such lengthy shutter speeds are only possible with a tripod. If you <em>don&#39;t</em> have a tripod, then it&#39;s often best to drop your shutter speed as low as you can go without creating camera shake (often around 1/60s or so).</p><h3 data-section id="the-best-shutter-speeds-for-portrait-photography"> The best shutter speeds for portrait photography</h3><p> Portrait photographers can be pretty flexible when choosing shutter speeds. The key goal is to keep your shots sharp – by avoiding camera shake as well as motion blur – but because you can generally instruct your subject and work from a stable position, this shouldn&#39;t be too tough.</p><p> If you&#39;re shooting a stationary subject, feel free to drop your shutter speed to around 1/80s or so (though 1/200s is safer).</p><p> And if you&#39;re shooting a moving subject, such as a person dancing, I&#39;d recommend working at 1/500s and beyond.</p><h3 data-section id="the-best-shutter-speeds-for-wildlife-and-bird-photography"> The best shutter speeds for wildlife and bird photography</h3><p> Bird and wildlife photography generally involves capturing fast-moving subjects with long lenses.</p><p> Therefore, you should generally use the fastest shutter speed you can get away with. For slower-moving animals, 1/500s is a reasonable starting point (and you <em>can</em> go lower if the animal is completely stationary – just make sure you keep your lens on a tripod or handheld as stably as possible).</p><p> For fast-moving animals and birds, 1/1000s is the place to start. And when action is occurring, I&#39;d really recommend pushing your shutter speed to 1/2000s and beyond.</p><h3 data-section id="the-best-shutter-speeds-for-street-photography"> The best shutter speeds for street photography</h3><p> Street photographers tend to be less concerned with sharpness than other shooters, so your choice of shutter speed isn&#39;t nearly as important.</p><p> That said, if you&#39;re walking while shooting and/or photographing walking people, 1/250s is a safe starting point. If both you and your subject are stationary, then you can often shoot at 1/100s or slower (assuming you&#39;re using good handholding techniques and relatively short lenses).</p><h2 data-section id="shutter-speed-in-photography-final-words"> Shutter speed in photography: final words</h2><p> Now that you&#39;ve finished this article, you&#39;re well-equipped to create some gorgeous photos.</p><p> So head out with your camera and test out different shutter speeds.

I offer step-by-step instructions on how to get great results, plus I explain when you definitely want to consider using manual focus (as well as when you should <em>avoid</em> manual focus, because it&#39;s not always such a good thing!).</p><p> Let&#39;s dive right in, starting with the basics:</p><h2 data-section id="what-is-manual-focus"> What is manual focus?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255971" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Manual focus in photography" class="wp-image-255971" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-5-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-5-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Every image requires focusing, where the lens shifts its elements until you get sharpness in a particular spot.

If you know how to manual focus, you can switch away from autofocus when required, and <em>you can still get the shot</em> .

It can be, though it&#39;s sometimes difficult to perceive focus through the camera viewfinder, so I do have a few tips for you:</p><ol><li> Switch over to your camera&#39;s <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/live-view-dslr-sharper-creative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live View function</a> , where you preview a live feed of your camera&#39;s sensor on the LCD.

If you shoot at f/2.8, you <em>must</em> get the focus right. If you shoot at f/8, however, you can stray slightly behind or in front of your subject without worry.</li><li> After taking a manually focused image, check the result on the LCD.

The quick movements, the unexpected moments – they&#39;re practically begging to be captured. You might think autofocus is the best approach, given the speed of the scene. And sure, autofocus can work well for street photography, and many experienced photographers do rely on it!</p><p> But don&#39;t be too quick to dismiss manual focusing for street photography. Some of the best street shooters in the world use a technique called <em>zone focusing</em> , where you dial in a relatively narrow aperture – this gives you a good depth-of-field window to work with – and then focus manually in advance.</p><p> What&#39;s great about this approach is that over time, you&#39;ll learn precisely where the window of focus exists. Then, when you spot that perfect subject or scene, you won&#39;t have to wrestle with focusing at all. You can simply get in position and snap the shot.</p><p> So rather than slowing you down, manual focus actually <em>eliminates</em> delays and can lead to some extraordinary captures. Remember, trusting manual focus in street photography isn&#39;t a limitation; it&#39;s an opportunity to master your craft in a new and rewarding way.</p><h3 data-section id="creative-effects"> Creative effects</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255976" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Manual focus in photography" class="wp-image-255976" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> There&#39;s something truly wonderful about capturing a photograph that stands out in a crowd. One of the best ways to create breathtaking <em>and</em> original images is by experimenting with creative effects, such as intentional camera movement, deliberate misfocusing, and shoot-through techniques. But to get the best results, you invariably need to focus manually.</p><p>为什么？ Imagine you want to photograph a person seen through a veil of leaves and branches (that is, you want to use the shoot-through technique!). You want the person to be in focus while the foliage creates a natural frame with a blur effect. If you use autofocus, I can almost guarantee that your camera won&#39;t cooperate. Your lens will hunt back and forth until it sets focus on one of the branches, or it&#39;ll keep hunting and <em>never</em> lock onto a subject.</p><p> That&#39;s where manual focus comes to the rescue. With a careful adjustment of the focus ring, you can pinpoint exactly where you want the focus to lie, and you can nail your shot!</p><p> Or perhaps you want to experiment with abstract bokeh shots, where the entire image features nothing but out-of-focus blur. How do you tell your camera&#39;s autofocus to focus on, well, <em>nothing</em> ? You can&#39;t, but manual focus will allow you to take control and ensure that your point of focus goes exactly where you want it.</p><p> Bottom line: Whether you&#39;re playing with back-focus to create a unique blur effect or crafting abstract imagery, manual focus will give you the control you need to make your visions come to life.</p><h3 data-section id="wide-angle-photography"> Wide-angle photography</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255977" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-11.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Manual focus in photography" class="wp-image-255977" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-11.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-11.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-11.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-11.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-11.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-11.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> When shooting with a wide-angle lens, your subjects are often large objects shown on a small scale, such as trees, buildings, and other inanimate objects.</p><p> In such situations, because these objects occupy a small area of the frame, it can be hard to control your lens&#39;s autofocus; it might lock focus on an unwanted area of the image.</p><p> I tend to switch over to manual focus, though on certain cameras, you do have the option of magnifying the preview on the LCD and using the touchscreen to carefully select the right focus point.</p><h3 data-section id="panorama-photography"> Panorama photography</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255978" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:36.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="548" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C548&#038;ssl=1" alt="Manual focus in photography" class="wp-image-255978" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-2.jpg?resize=300%2C110&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-2.jpg?resize=600%2C219&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-2.jpg?resize=768%2C281&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-2.jpg?resize=717%2C262&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> When shooting <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-stitch-panorama-photo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panoramas</a> – which are created by stitching a set of photos together in post-production – consistency throughout the shots is <em>key</em> .</p><p> And that includes <em>focusing consistency</em> , where you focus on the exact same distance for each image.

Your first step is to choose a narrow aperture, like f/11, which helps keep more of the scene in focus, but that&#39;s just part of the equation. Without a perfectly placed point of focus, even a narrow aperture won&#39;t keep the entire scene sharp, especially if your composition includes elements in the foreground.</p><p> That&#39;s where the hyperfocal distance comes into play. It&#39;s the specific point of focus that&#39;ll maximize the depth of field in your shot. (Note: Your camera doesn&#39;t come with a built-in hyperfocal distance calculator. When out in the field, you can use a rule of thumb, or you can find a tool that does the calculation for you.)</p><p> Once you&#39;ve figured out where the hyperfocal distance lies, manually focus on that exact spot. Autofocus often won&#39;t cut it here, as it lacks the precision required for this technique. Once again, manual focus puts you in control, letting you set the lens exactly where it needs to be to capture a breathtaking landscape or cityscape in all its glory.</p><h3 data-section id="low-contrast-situations"> Low-contrast situations</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255980" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1002" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-8.jpg?resize=1500%2C1002&#038;ssl=1" alt="Manual focus in photography" class="wp-image-255980" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-8.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-8.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-8.jpg?resize=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-8.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-8.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-8.jpg?resize=717%2C479&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Autofocus relies on contrast between the dark and light tones in an image. Contrast is what allows the autofocus to say, “Hey, here&#39;s a subject I should focus on.”</p><p> In low-contrast situations, such as a dark tree against a dark background or a white car against a snowy landscape, autofocus might just fail you. The lack of contrast can lead to continuous hunting by the AF system, which is not only annoying but also ineffective.</p><p> That&#39;s when you might want to switch to manual focus. By taking control of the focusing ring, you can achieve the sharpness you desire <em>without</em> the hunting. Just remember to switch back to autofocus when you move on to a different subject so that you&#39;re ready to quickly react to the next photographic opportunity!</p><h2 data-section id="manual-focus-vs-autofocus-when-is-manual-focus-bad"> Manual focus vs autofocus: When is manual focus bad?</h2><p> Manual focus can be a powerful tool in your photography toolkit, but it&#39;s not always the best option.</p><p> If you&#39;re dealing with moving subjects or fast-paced scenarios, focusing manually may be completely fruitless. You might try working with your lens, but without the time to move the focus ring back and forth, check your focus on the LCD, and/or retake shots, you&#39;ll likely miss the moment.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255981" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-9.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Manual focus in photography" class="wp-image-255981" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-9.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-9.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-9.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-9.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-9.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/manual-focus-photography-9.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Therefore, in genres such as sports photography, wildlife photography, bird photography, event photography, and car photography, autofocus is generally your friend. Your camera&#39;s autofocus system is designed to quickly lock onto subjects and keep them sharp, so in action scenarios, it&#39;s often the better choice.</p><p> Of course, there are always exceptions to the rule. If you&#39;re photographing an animal at night and autofocus won&#39;t lock onto your subject, you can consider manual focus. But as a rule of thumb, stick to autofocus when dealing with action. It&#39;s more reliable in those instances and can save you the frustration of missed shots!</p><h2 data-section id="manual-focus-in-photography-final-words"> Manual focus in photography: final words</h2><p> Manual focus may have seemed daunting, but now that you&#39;ve finished this article, you know it&#39;s easy – and that it can be super useful in the right scenario.</p><p> So practice focusing manually.

Here&#39;s what I recommend:</p><h3 data-section id="a-full-frame-camera"> A full-frame camera</h3><p> The best low-light landscape cameras contain a larger sensor. (Why? On average, larger sensors can take in more light per pixel, which results in cleaner images at higher ISOs as well as more expansive dynamic range capabilities.) Therefore, if you can, go full-frame.</p><p> That said, if you don&#39;t have a full-frame model, don&#39;t worry too much. Good shots are still possible with an APS-C or Four-Thirds camera; you just need to be more careful when raising your ISO or dealing with HDR scenes.</p><h3 data-section id="a-fast-wide-angle-lens"> A fast wide-angle lens</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255953" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:56.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="844" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/low-light-landscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=1500%2C844&#038;ssl=1" alt="Low-light landscape photography" class="wp-image-255953" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/low-light-landscape-photography-202.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/low-light-landscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/low-light-landscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/low-light-landscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/low-light-landscape-photography-202.jpg?resize=717%2C403&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Naturally, most landscape photographers shoot with wide-angle lenses; that way, they can incorporate the whole <em>gorgeous</em> scene into the shot.</p><p> And for low-light photography, I recommend you embrace that approach. A wide-angle prime will offer great image quality, will come cheap, and can offer exciting results. A wide-angle zoom, such as a 24-70mm, a 17-40mm, or a 16-35mm is also helpful, though more expensive, so think carefully before you buy.</p><p> Also make sure to check the lens&#39;s maximum aperture. For standard low-light landscape photography, an f/4 or even f/5.6 maximum aperture should be absolutely fine – but if you want to shoot stars at night, f/2.8 is a must-have.</p><h3 data-section id="a-sturdy-tripod"> A sturdy tripod</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255951" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/low-light-landscape-photography-203.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Low-light landscape photography" class="wp-image-255951" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/low-light-landscape-photography-203.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/low-light-landscape-photography-203.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/low-light-landscape-photography-203.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/low-light-landscape-photography-203.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/low-light-landscape-photography-203.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Low-light photography offers (unsurprisingly!) very little light to work with, so shutter speeds are long. If you&#39;re not careful, your images will end up ruined by camera shake. That&#39;s why a tripod is absolutely, one-hundred percent essential.</p><p> I&#39;d recommend a relatively lightweight carbon fiber tripod if you can afford it, though make sure not to skimp on quality. There&#39;s nothing worse than buying a wobbly tripod, capturing hundreds of soft images, and only <em>then</em> realizing that you should&#39;ve grabbed a good product all along.</p><h3 data-section id="a-remote-release"> A remote release</h3><p> Even when shooting long exposure landscape photos with a tripod, you can still cause camera shake by hitting the shutter button.</p><p> That&#39;s where remote shutter releases come in handy; they let you trigger the shutter <em>without</em> ever touching the actual button. They&#39;re also pretty cheap, especially if you&#39;re willing to settle on a simple release.</p><p> You also have the option to use your camera&#39;s self-timer, but if you&#39;re capturing time-sensitive long exposures (such as a wave lapping at the shore), the self-timer becomes a major hindrance. Plus, using a remote release is far more convenient!</p><h2 data-section id="tips-to-improve-your-low-light-landscape-shots"> Tips to improve your low-light landscape shots</h2><p> Now let&#39;s delve into some techniques to really level up your low-light images, starting with:</p><h2 data-section id="spend-some-time-scouting-your-location"> 1.

During these times, visibility can be quite limited, and the last thing you want is to be stumbling around in the dark. Therefore, it&#39;s essential to do some scouting in advance.</p><p> Visit the location during daylight hours, and walk around to get a feel for the terrain. Look for interesting compositions and visualize how the light might affect the scene. Think about the sun&#39;s position and how – if it&#39;ll be above the horizon during your planned photoshoot – its rays will create shadows and highlights across the landscape.</p><p> Consider taking some test shots during the day to help you visualize the final result. Also, familiarize yourself with the paths and surroundings so you can navigate safely when it&#39;s dark. If you plan to shoot around dusk, plot a clear and safe route back to your car or base location. You definitely don&#39;t want to get stranded alone with a bunch of heavy (and expensive) equipment!</p><p> Remember to consider seasonal and weather changes that might affect the accessibility of your chosen spot. Safety is paramount, so always ensure you have a well-planned scouting trip before your actual shoot.</p><h2 data-section id="shoot-during-the-golden-hour-and-the-blue-hour"> 2.

That way, you can prevent the stars from blurring across the sky and produce a pin-sharp Milky Way image.</p><p> A high ISO is also helpful if you need to nail a certain shutter speed – for a creative blur effect, for instance – and you&#39;re struggling to get the right exposure.</p><p> Never go higher than necessary, though. The higher the ISO, the noisier the image will get. And while modern full-frame cameras can handle a lot of noise, keep it low when possible.</p><h2 data-section id="watch-for-unwanted-motion-blur"> 6.

But there&#39;s another type of blur that can creep into your images and detract from the final result.</p><p> I&#39;m talking about the movement of elements <em>within</em> your frame, such as blowing grasses or trembling flowers. If your shutter speed is more than a fraction of a second, these elements will start to lose detail.</p><p> Now, motion blur isn&#39;t always bad. Sometimes, it can lend an ethereal effect in your image. But intense blur from wildly moving vegetation can take away from the overall scene. Instead of a serene or dramatic landscape, you end up with a chaotic mishmash that loses its details.</p><p> So what do you do if you&#39;re faced with moving elements that you&#39;d prefer not to blur? Sometimes, it&#39;s a matter of patiently waiting for the wind to calm down. Other times, it may be best to revisit the location on a more favorable day. You can also try boosting the ISO or widening the aperture to allow for a faster shutter speed, though each settings adjustment will also negatively affect your image in other ways.</p><h2 data-section id="incorporate-a-foreground-element-for-added-scale"> 7.

Then let it catch the viewer&#39;s eye and lead them into the frame.</p><p> In fact, landscape photographers <em>love</em> <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/use-foreground-create-depth-images/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">foreground elements</a> , especially when they&#39;re combined with wide-angle lenses.

You might notice the occasional tones pressing up against the bottom end of the graph, and that&#39;s okay. After all, low-light scenes are <em>supposed</em> to look dark sometimes. And you might notice the occasional tones pressing up against the <em>top</em> end of the graph, which is also okay; city lights will blow out, for instance, which often looks very cool, especially when featuring a starburst effect.</p><p> So pay careful attention to your histogram, and use it to ensure you&#39;ve nailed your low-light shots. But don&#39;t obsess if the histogram doesn&#39;t show you a “perfect” curve.</p><h2 data-section id="capture-beautiful-long-exposure-images"> 9.

But now let&#39;s delve a little deeper into how you can use this technique to your advantage.</p><p> A long-exposure technique can truly elevate your images. Think of moving water turned silky or fast-moving clouds stretched across the sky like cotton candy. These effects are achieved by extending your shutter speed, and they can add a breathtaking quality to your shots.</p><p> The key is to experiment and find the perfect shutter speed. Different speeds can add or remove texture from moving elements. Perhaps a 2s exposure renders a river too smooth, while a 1/10s exposure gives it just the right amount of motion. Don&#39;t be afraid to try different settings until you achieve the look you&#39;re after.</p><p> Also, consider the specific elements that will be affected by the long exposure and adjust your composition accordingly. Incorporating elements like streaking clouds can add dynamism and visual interest.</p><p> Taking the time to master long exposures in low light can open up a world of creative possibilities. With patience, practice, and a willingness to experiment, you&#39;ll find yourself capturing images that stand out from the crowd.</p><h2 data-section id="bracket-your-exposures-for-maximum-detail"> 10.

A histogram is ultra-helpful, as I mentioned in the last section – but what if you&#39;re not sure whether you got the result you wanted, even with the histogram? And even more concerning: What if a good result is impossible, simply because the difference because the brightest brights and the darkest darks in your photos are too significant?</p><p> That&#39;s where <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/bracketing-what-is-it-and-what-to-do-with-the-images/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure bracketing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure bracketing</a> comes in. It&#39;s a simple technique, but it&#39;s a <em>huge</em> deal for the committed landscape photographer. Here&#39;s how it works:</p><ol><li> Take a shot with a middle exposure value.</li><li> Adjust your settings (generally the shutter speed) to slightly underexpose the scene, then take a shot.</li><li> Adjust your settings (again, generally the shutter speed) to slightly overexpose the scene, then take a shot.</li></ol><p> To some extent, you&#39;re creating backups, so that if you get the exposure slightly wrong, you still have a well-exposed image to fall back on. However, exposure bracketing can do more than that; you can actually blend several bracketed images together in Lightroom or Photoshop, taking the most detail from different parts of the images, so that the underexposed image contributes a beautiful sky, while the overexposed image contributes rich shadows. That way, you get the best of both worlds (and a stunning final result). Make sense?</p><p> And by the way: You can bracket as broadly as you like. Three bracketed images are pretty common (often with a margin of two stops), but you can also capture five, seven, nine, or more bracketed shots!</p><h2 data-section id="low-light-landscape-photography-tips-final-words"> Low-light landscape photography tips: final words</h2><p> Hopefully, you now feel much more confident – and you know exactly how to capture low-light landscape shots like a pro.</p><p> So head out into the field and practice (though make sure you bring a trusty tripod and a remote release along!).</p><p> Now over to you:</p><p> <em>Do you have any low-light landscape tips of your own?

In my experience, it&#39;s often what turns an ordinary snapshot into a professional-looking image. Clamshell lighting is a technique that&#39;s simple yet powerful, and it can take your photography to the next level.</p><p> But what is clamshell lighting? And how can you master clamshell <a aria-label="lighting setups (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-portrait-lighting-patterns-every-photographer-should-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">lighting setups</a> for stunning results?</p><p> In this article, I explain the ins and outs of this simple – yet incredibly powerful – two-light portrait setup. From experimenting with different modifiers to playing with light positions and beyond, I&#39;ll explore all the details to help you master this wonderful lighting technique. By the time you&#39;re finished reading, you&#39;ll know how to create clamshell-lit <a aria-label="portraits (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-ways-to-take-stunning-portraits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">portraits</a> like a pro (no matter your lighting gear!).</p><p> So if you&#39;re ready to become a clamshell portrait master, then let&#39;s dive right in, starting with the basics:</p><h2 data-section id="what-is-clamshell-lighting"> What is clamshell lighting?</h2><p> Clamshell lighting is a simple, two-light configuration: You place both lights facing your subject at a 45-degree angle, one angled up, one angled down. Note that your <em>key</em> light (ie, your primary, brighter light) should point 45 degrees downward, while your <em>fill</em> light should point 45 degrees upward. Your camera should sit between the two lights, facing your subject.</p><p> When viewed from the side, the two lights resemble an open clamshell (imagination may be required!):</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-133396 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133396" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:79.47%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="596" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting.jpg?resize=750%2C596&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell guide and tips lighting diagram" class="wp-image-133396" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting.jpg?resize=300%2C238&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting.jpg?resize=600%2C477&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting.jpg?resize=717%2C570&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> A clamshell setup provides beautiful, soft light with faint shadows and glorious catchlights. Clamshell lighting works well on pretty much everyone; I&#39;d say that it&#39;s flattering for men and women of all ages, so it&#39;s a great setup to have in your back pocket.</p><p> Note that clamshell lighting is just like <a aria-label="butterfly lighting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-perfect-butterfly-lighting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">butterfly lighting</a> , except that you add the fill light below the subject (which eliminates any heavy shadows caused by the key light). So if you&#39;re <em>already</em> doing a butterfly setup, you can always add in a clamshell look at the end for some variation!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133404" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:79.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="598" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-1893.jpg?resize=750%2C598&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133404" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-1893.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-1893.jpg?resize=300%2C239&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-1893.jpg?resize=600%2C478&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-1893.jpg?resize=717%2C572&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="how-to-create-a-clamshell-lighting-setup-step-by-step-process"> How to create a clamshell lighting setup: step-by-step process</h2><p><br /> Creating a clamshell lighting setup is simple, and as long as you have two working lights, you&#39;re practically guaranteed to pull it off. Here&#39;s what you do:</p><h3 data-section id="step-select-your-lights-and-modifiers"> Step 1: Select your lights and modifiers</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133403" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3698.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133403" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3698.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3698.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3698.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3698.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3698.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Clamshell lighting requires two light sources, and these can be strobes or continuous, modified or unmodified.</p><p> Personally, I&#39;d recommend you use <a aria-label="modifiers (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/a-beginners-guide-to-light-modifiers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">modifiers</a> – these will help soften the light for a more flattering effect – and grabbing a pair of similarly sized <a aria-label="softboxes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/softbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">softboxes</a> is a great starting point.</p><p> That said, if you don&#39;t have modifiers or you prefer a harder look, then work with an unmodified light! If you really embrace the effect and sculpt it as needed, you may get a great result. Plus, it&#39;s your photoshoot!</p><h3 data-section id="step-position-your-key-light"> Step 2: Position your key light</h3><p> Grab your key light (ie, your main light source). The goal is to place it in front of your subject and slightly above; angle it down so it points directly at the subject&#39;s nose.</p><p> If you want a softer effect that features fast light falloff, bring the light in close to the subject&#39;s face. If you want a harder effect that lights the subject more broadly, move the light farther away.</p><p> Next, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understand-camera-light-meter-desired-exposure/" target="_blank" aria-label="meter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">meter</a> for your desired <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> (we&#39;ll use a hypothetical f/11) and take a test shot.</p><p> If everything is set up correctly, you should produce a decently lit image with deep shadows under your subject&#39;s nose and chin. (If the image is too dim, feel free to brighten your light, and if the image is overexposed, do the reverse.)</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133402" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3242.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133402" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3242.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3242.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3242.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3242.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3242.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="step-add-your-fill-light"> Step 3: Add your fill light</h3><p> Now it&#39;s time to add in the second light; take your fill light and place it directly underneath your key light, pointed upward toward your subject at 45 degrees.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133414" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:75.07%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="563" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2578.jpg?resize=750%2C563&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips behind the scenes" class="wp-image-133414" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2578.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2578.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2578.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2578.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Adjust the light&#39;s brightness until it sits two stops <em>below</em> the key light. (If you wanted to shoot at f/11, you could meter your fill light for an f/5.6 result.) Then take a second test shot.</p><p> If the effect is too strong and your fill light is obliterating the shadows, turn down the light power. If the light isn&#39;t doing enough, turn it up. The main thing to look out for is the fill light overpowering the key light, as that would result in a <em>very</em> unflattering image that&#39;s lit from below.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133413" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:87.07%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="653" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2580.jpg?resize=750%2C653&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips behind the scenes" class="wp-image-133413" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2580.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2580.jpg?resize=300%2C261&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2580.jpg?resize=600%2C522&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting_2580.jpg?resize=717%2C624&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="step-capture-your-clamshell-image"> Step 4: Capture your clamshell image!</h3><p> At this point, you should have two lights sharing the same vertical space, and the light on top should be roughly two stops brighter than the light on the bottom.</p><p> Stand behind the lights and shoot through the gap. Note: If there isn&#39;t much of a gap to work with, raise and/or lower both of your lights until you have enough room to shoot in the middle. To be safe, you may want to take another meter reading.</p><p> Of course, once you&#39;ve grabbed a shot or two, check your camera&#39;s LCD for exposure issues and other concerns. And if you have the capability, I recommend <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tutorial-shoot-tethered/" target="_blank" aria-label="tethering your camera (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">tethering your camera</a> to your laptop; that way, you can review your images <em>instantly</em> on the big screen.</p><p> And that&#39;s all there is to it!

Since there&#39;s no fill light, the shadows on the nose and chin remain heavy, giving more dramatic and intense results. It&#39;s an effect that can be particularly well-suited for fashion photography.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255906" style="width:464px"><span class="space" style="width:464px; padding-top:129.31%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="464" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-101.jpg?resize=464%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Clamshell lighting photography" class="wp-image-255906" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-101.jpg?resize=464%2C600&amp;ssl=1 464w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-101.jpg?resize=232%2C300&amp;ssl=1 232w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-101.jpg?resize=768%2C994&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-101.jpg?resize=717%2C928&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-101.jpg?w=1159&amp;ssl=1 1159w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Notice the strong shadows under the subject&#39;s nose; that&#39;s a result of butterfly lighting.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Now, let&#39;s compare this to clamshell lighting. Clamshell lighting involves placing a second light below the subject, softening the shadows. This produces a gentler, more soothing effect, so it&#39;s often seen in conventional headshot photography or applications with far less drama.</p><p> Pro tip: If you&#39;re uncertain about the final look you want, you can always start with butterfly lighting. Experiment with the shadows and angles, then simply add a fill light to achieve the clamshell look if you desire something softer. This way, you can play around with two different lighting styles with very little effort. It&#39;s a convenient and creative approach to portrait lighting.</p><h2 data-section id="clamshell-vs-rembrandt-lighting"> Clamshell vs Rembrandt lighting</h2><p> Another classic lighting technique to consider?

The Rembrandt pattern involves placing a light off to the side of the subject – often around 45 degrees – to create a clear triangle of light on the subject&#39;s cheek.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255907" style="width:480px"><span class="space" style="width:480px; padding-top:125%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="480" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-100.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Clamshell lighting photography" class="wp-image-255907" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-100.jpg?resize=480%2C600&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-100.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-100.jpg?resize=768%2C961&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-100.jpg?resize=717%2C897&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/clamshell-lighting-photography-100.jpg?w=1199&amp;ssl=1 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Rembrandt lighting produces a triangle under the subject&#39;s eye.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Because it covers so much of the face in shadows, Rembrandt lighting is known for its dark and moody qualities. It&#39;s a favorite among those seeking a dramatic, theatrical style in their images.</p><p> So how does clamshell lighting stack up against Rembrandt? Clamshell lighting is the better choice if you want a more cheerful, detailed shot. By positioning lights both above and below your subject, you can illuminate the face more evenly and reduce harsh shadows. This brings out more of the facial details and gives the image a livelier, more approachable feeling.</p><p> In short, if drama and moodiness are your goals, Rembrandt lighting may be the way to go. But for a more uplifting and detailed portrait, clamshell lighting fits the bill. Understanding the nuances of these lighting techniques will allow you to choose the right style for each unique portrait session. Experiment with both, and see what you think!</p><h2 data-section id="clamshell-photography-setup-a-few-quick-tips"> Clamshell photography setup: a few quick tips</h2><p> You know how to capture a basic clamshell image. But how can you take your shots even further? Here are a few of my top tips to help you out:</p><h3 data-section id="experiment-with-different-modifiers"> 1. Experiment with different modifiers</h3><p> When you&#39;re first starting out with clamshell lighting, softboxes can be your best friends. They provide a gentle touch that&#39;s perfect for beginners. But as you get more comfortable, you might find yourself wanting to explore other options. <em>This is an excellent idea</em> .</p><p> Have a pair of strip boxes you want to use? Go for it. Want to use a beauty dish as your key light and an umbrella as fill? Sure. How about a <a aria-label="snoot (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/snoot-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">snoot</a> and a small softbox? Absolutely. Use what you have at hand. Pretty soon, you&#39;ll be able to improvise like a pro.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133397" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3257.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133397" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3257.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3257.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3257.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Beauty dishes, for instance, create a harder look that can add drama to a portrait. Their focused light can accentuate textures and details. On the other hand, umbrellas can really soften up the shadows. By throwing around a lot of light, they make everything feel more diffused and ethereal.</p><p> By testing out different modifiers, you&#39;ll learn how they affect your images. So don&#39;t be afraid to try something new. Just remember to keep the essence of clamshell lighting in mind: that beautiful, flattering glow that makes portraits shine.</p><h3 data-section id="try-repositioning-your-lights"> 2. Try repositioning your lights</h3><p> Light position matters in clamshell lighting, and even an adjustment of a few inches can dramatically change the final image.</p><p> Move the lights closer to your subject, and the shadows will soften and become more gradated for a gentle and delicate look.</p><p> Move the lights farther from your subject, and the shadows will harden and become sharper. This can add a sense of depth and drama to the image.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133410" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133410" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> But it&#39;s not just about distance. You can move your key light higher to create longer shadows or lower to create shorter shadows. You can do the same with the fill light.</p><p> Just be cautious not to go overboard. The 45-degree positions that I discussed in my initial step-by-step section are designed to look flattering. Playing with the positioning is great, but don&#39;t lose sight of your original goals!</p><h3 data-section id="add-more-lights"> 3. Add more lights</h3><p> Once you&#39;ve set up your clamshell lighting just right, you might think you&#39;re done. But there&#39;s more you can do to enhance the scene and create striking images.</p><p> For instance, you can add rim lights behind your subject, either on one side or both, to create a delicate sliver of light around the head. This effect will help your subject pop off the background and make the image more dynamic.</p><p> A hair light can add depth to your photograph. Positioned above and behind the subject, it shines subtly on the hair to separate it from the background.</p><p> Don&#39;t hesitate to experiment with background lights, as well. Placing a light behind the subject (that&#39;s pointed at the backdrop) can create a beautiful cone of light that adds extra depth. It&#39;s how many photographers combine a well-lit subject with a well-lit background!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133409" style="width:500px"><span class="space" style="width:500px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="500" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-8580.jpg?resize=500%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133409" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-8580.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-8580.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-8580.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Bottom line: By adding these additional lights, you give yourself more creative freedom and open up a world of possibilities in your clamshell lighting setups.</p><h3 data-section id="convert-to-black-and-white"> 4. Convert to black and white</h3><p> Clamshell lighting produces wonderful images that can look stunning in both color and black and white. Converting your shot to black and white will emphasize the interplay of shadows and highlights while potentially adding a layer of three-dimensionality to the photo.</p><p> If you shoot in RAW, and I highly recommend you do, you have the flexibility to photograph using your camera&#39;s Monochrome mode and still convert back to color if needed. Or you can start in color and convert to black and white later on.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133399" style="width:500px"><span class="space" style="width:500px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="500" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-7627-2.jpg?resize=500%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133399" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-7627-2.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-7627-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-7627-2.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The black-and-white conversion can make the features of the face stand out in a unique way. It might bring out textures, emphasize contrasts, or even create a mood that color doesn&#39;t capture. Experimenting with this conversion allows you to explore a range of visual expressions within a single lighting setup, which is always a good idea!</p><h3 data-section id="watch-the-catchlights"> 5. Watch the catchlights</h3><p> Catchlight is that magical spot of light in the subject&#39;s eyes, one that&#39;s created by a reflection from the light source. It brings life to the eyes; without a catchlight, the eyes – and the entire portrait – can appear flat and lifeless.</p><p> Therefore, it&#39;s important that you always make sure your clamshell photos include catchlights! If a catchlight isn&#39;t present, you may need to ask your subject to angle their head, or you may need to make slight adjustments to your lights. Make sure to review each test shot on your camera&#39;s LCD to ensure that the catchlight is just as you want it.</p><p> Note that with clamshell lighting, since it involves two lights rather than one, you might notice a double catchlight. This is a feature some photographers love, while others are less enthusiastic.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133400" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3713-crop.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="clamshell lighting guide and tips" class="wp-image-133400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3713-crop.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3713-crop.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3713-crop.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3713-crop.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clamshell-lighting-3713-crop.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you&#39;re not a fan of the bottom catchlight, don&#39;t fret!

In fact, if you want to create gorgeous photos, you must master negative space; that way, you can take shots that feature balanced, harmonious, eye-catching arrangements. (You can also capture wonderfully <em>minimalistic</em> compositions, as I discuss down below.)</p><p> In this article, I&#39;ll explain everything you need to know about negative space, including:</p><ul><li> What negative space actually is</li><li> Why negative space is important</li><li> Simple tips and tricks to use negative space in your images, whether you shoot landscapes, portraits, street scenes, or architecture</li></ul><p> Ready to become a compositional master?

That&#39;s why <em>negative space</em> is also called <em>white space</em> ; it&#39;s where nothing is really happening.</p><p> Check out this next image, where the foggy sky and the empty water act as negative space:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174286" style="width:741px"><span class="space" style="width:741px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="741" height="494" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-03.jpg?resize=741%2C494&#038;ssl=1" alt="negative space in photography woman near tree" class="wp-image-174286" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-03.jpg?w=741&amp;ssl=1 741w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-03.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-03.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-03.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-03.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> In photography, negative space is often made up of certain elements:</p><ul><li> Water</li><li> Sky</li><li> Walls</li><li> Sand</li></ul><p> Note that all of these elements tend to fade easily into the background, and that&#39;s why they make such great negative space. An empty sky does <em>not</em> draw the eye, any more than a blank white wall, a stretch of empty sand, and so on.</p><p> Now, some photos are full of negative space. These compositions are often very abstract, such as a stretch of empty blue sky, or a sand dune stretching off in every direction. Such negative-space-centric compositions can also be <em>minimalistic</em> , with a single eye-catching element surrounded by emptiness.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255876" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="负空间摄影" class="wp-image-255876" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-24.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Other photos, however, feature plenty of non-negative space, also known as <em>positive</em> space:</p><h2 data-section id="positive-space-versus-negative-space"> Positive space versus negative space</h2><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/positive-space-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Positive space</a> is the complete opposite of negative space. Negative space rejects the eye, while positive space steals the spotlight. You see, positive space is the area of a photo that includes elements of interest, the area that includes the main subject, the area where the viewer&#39;s eye goes <em>first</em> .</p><p> In the photo below, there is plenty of positive space but very little negative space. The flag, the buildings, and the trees all act as positive space. Even the clouds provide some positive space thanks to their interesting arrangement and texture. The biggest patch of negative space is the sky, which takes up a tiny portion of the shot.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174284" style="width:1080px"><span class="space" style="width:1080px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1080" height="720" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?resize=1080%2C720&#038;ssl=1" alt="flag above a city Negative space photography" class="wp-image-174284" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-01.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Now, positive space can be anything, but here are some common examples:</p><ul><li> Faces</li><li> People</li><li> Buildings</li><li> Birds</li><li> Wildlife</li><li> Mountains</li></ul><p> So which is better, positive or negative space?</p><p> Neither.</p><p> In photography, the goal is to combine <em>both</em> types of space to create a balanced composition. You want negative space, yes, but you also want positive space. That&#39;s how you can get consistently stunning photos!</p><h2 data-section id="negative-space-and-minimalism"> Negative space and minimalism</h2><p> Technically, negative space is present in nearly every image, even if the compositions are chaotic, messy, and otherwise overwhelming. But when you think of negative space, you might associate it with minimalism.为什么？</p><p> Minimalism in photography heavily emphasizes negative space to create a tranquil effect. This type of image uses lots of negative space to give the viewer plenty of room to breathe and focus on the subject.</p><p> Think of a lone tree or a solitary figure in a field, surrounded by emptiness. It makes for an eye-catching composition, and that&#39;s primarily due to the power of negative space!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255882" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:80%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1200" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-21.jpg?resize=1500%2C1200&#038;ssl=1" alt="负空间摄影" class="wp-image-255882" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-21.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-21.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-21.jpg?resize=600%2C480&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-21.jpg?resize=768%2C614&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-21.jpg?resize=717%2C574&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> But there&#39;s an essential point that I want to emphasize: Not all images with negative space are minimalistic. Minimalism uses negative space in a unique way, and you <em>can</em> go for striking results by taking a minimalistic approach, but you don&#39;t have to. You can always compose with a balanced combination of positive and negative space for a different effect.</p><h2 data-section id="the-best-genres-for-negative-space-photography"> The best genres for negative space photography</h2><p> Negative space isn&#39;t confined to a single genre. In fact, you can apply this concept across various types of photography.</p><p> Take landscape shooting, for instance. The wide expanses of sky, beach, mountains, and desert often lend themselves to heavy use of negative space. And this allows the main subject, such as a mountain or a tree, to truly stand out.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-255883" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="负空间摄影" class="wp-image-255883" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/negative-space-photography-29.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Travel photography also benefits from negative space. Imagine a road stretching through an empty landscape, or a person standing at the edge of a lake; the results are meaningful and striking at the same time.</p><p> Even certain forms of street photography can look great with lots of negative space. A lone figure crossing a wide-open plaza can speak volumes about urban life and isolation.</p><p> On the flip side, portrait photography, event photography, documentary photography, and sports photography often focus more on positive space. The aim here is to convey information about a person, setting, or story, and positive space generally communicates more details.</p><p> But don&#39;t let that limit you! If you feel inspired to shoot documentary images with lots of negative space, go for it. Creativity knows no boundaries, and it&#39;s always refreshing to try new approaches.</p><p> The genres and ideas I shared above are merely suggestions. The beauty of photography lies in personal interpretation and experimentation. Dive into different subjects and see how negative space can enhance your style.</p><h2 data-section id="negative-space-photography-tips-and-tricks"> Negative space photography tips and tricks</h2><p> Hopefully, you now feel ready to capture some negative space images of your own. To that end, here are my favorite tips and techniques for working with negative space:</p><h3 data-section id="let-the-scene-dictate-your-negative-space-and-positive-space-combination"> 1. Let the scene dictate your negative space and positive space combination</h3><p> Every scene has a different ratio of negative space to positive space.</p><p> And while you, as the photographer, can zoom in, change perspective, and crop to emphasize certain parts of the scene, you need to be flexible; you need to be able to embrace a scene that&#39;s full of negative space, just the same as you embrace a scene filled with positive space.</p><p> So don&#39;t try to force a scene in a certain direction. Instead, ask yourself: What is the scene <em>already</em> like?

It was early morning and some fog had rolled in, covering most of the impressive structure. The woman standing next to me turned to me and said, “It&#39;s so sad, we&#39;re driving by today, and I wanted to get a photo of the Percé Rock. But due to the fog, it seems it won&#39;t be possible.”</p><p> She left, disappointed that she didn&#39;t get her shot. But I stayed, and I stood for a long time, examining the fog and the way it draped the rock like a heavy blanket. I thought it was one of the most amazing things to happen that day. I felt so lucky to be there at that exact moment to capture the wonder unfolding. I embraced the negative space, and I captured a beautiful, minimalistic image.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174287" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="foggy rock on the water" class="wp-image-174287" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-04.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Bottom line:</p><p> Be adaptable. Be flexible. If negative space dominates a scene, let it, even if you generally prefer to avoid minimalistic compositions. Make sense?</p><h3 data-section id="use-negative-space-to-balance-out-positive-space"> 2. Use negative space to balance out positive space</h3><p> A key goal of photographic composition is to <em>achieve visual balance</em> . You want your images to feel whole, complete, <em>satisfying</em> .</p><p> And one way to achieve balance is by identifying your positive space, then countering it with negative space.</p><p> For instance, look at the image below. You can see the positive space – the clenched fist. It&#39;s a powerful, eye-catching subject, but it&#39;s countered by all the surrounding negative space. It creates an overall balance, as you can see:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-222171" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="negative space raised fist" class="wp-image-222171" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-photography-1006.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> By the way, it&#39;s important to recognize how <em>lots</em> of negative space can balance out just a little positive space. Positive space is aggressive and powerful. Negative space is much more subdued, even soothing. So unless you&#39;re specifically after a very in-your-face image, positive space should come in small doses.</p><p> Some photographers practice a “2:1” negative space rule, where you add two parts negative space for every one part positive space. I don&#39;t like to restrict myself in this way, but it&#39;s a good guideline to bear in mind.</p><h3 data-section id="experiment-with-minimalism"> 3.

They&#39;re all about negative space; they take lots of negative space, include a touch of positive space, and create an eye-catching result.</p><p> Here&#39;s an example of a minimalist image, where the shadow acts as positive space, while the bricks provide some empty negative space:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174289" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:67.4%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1011" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=1500%2C1011&#038;ssl=1" alt="cross on the bricks negative space" class="wp-image-174289" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=300%2C202&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=768%2C518&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=600%2C404&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=436%2C293&amp;ssl=1 436w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-06.jpg?resize=717%2C483&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you like the minimalistic look, I highly recommend you try it out. It&#39;s pretty simple to pull off.</p><p> Here are my recommendations:</p><ol><li> Start by identifying a main subject, like a tree, a person, or a building. This will be your <em>positive</em> space.</li><li> Adjust your positive, focal length, and camera angle until your main subject is all alone, surrounded by nothing but negative space. (A low perspective is great for this; by dropping down to the ground, you can frame your subject against the sky.)</li><li> Eliminate as much color as possible. You want uniformity, if you can get it: just one or two colors in a highly harmonious scene.</li><li> Position your main subject toward the edge of the composition. You can try putting the subject at a rule of thirds power point or along a gridline, but you might also consider moving it closer to the edge of the frame.</li></ol><p> The tree photo below is highly minimalistic. It includes a small tree positioned in the corner as positive space, while the rest of the photo is (for the most part) negative space, for a nice overall balance.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-174290" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:69.13%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1037" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-07.jpg?resize=1500%2C1037&#038;ssl=1" alt="tree and clouds" class="wp-image-174290" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-07.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-07.jpg?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-07.jpg?resize=768%2C531&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-07.jpg?resize=600%2C415&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/negative-space-sandra-roussy-07.jpg?resize=717%2C496&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h3 data-section id="use-negative-space-to-convey-emotion"> 4.
