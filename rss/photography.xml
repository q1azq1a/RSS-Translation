id="1-use-window-light-for-a-flattering-effect"> 1.利用窗光打造迷人效果</h2><p>出色的狗狗摄影始于出色的照明，对我来说，那就是<em>窗户光</em>。</p><p>窗户光很漂亮，（通常）柔和，非常适合照亮拍摄对象，同时让背景陷入阴影。</p><p>要了解窗户光的力量，请看这两张图片： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/with-without-window-light.jpg?ssl=1" alt="With without window light - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="有-无-窗光.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>窗户光不仅照亮了狗的关键部位——同时让其他部位陷入阴影以获得更加三维的效果——它还可以让你使用<a aria-label="low ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">低ISO</a>和更快的<a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">快门速度</a>，这会给你带来更清晰、更高的拍摄效果。 - 优质图像。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/photo-with-window-light.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Photo with window light - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="窗光照片.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>顺便说一句，如果您更喜欢使用闪光灯或影室闪光灯，也没关系！只要确保用<a aria-label="modifier (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/a-beginners-guide-to-light-modifiers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">修饰剂</a>遮盖它们即可获得柔和、讨人喜欢的效果。</p><h2 id="2-in-a-pinch-use-your-phone-light"> 2. 紧要关头，使用手机灯</h2><p>虽然窗户光（或精心修改的人造光）是狗狗摄影的理想选择，但在窗户附近拍摄并不总是可行。</p><p>毕竟，您可能在房子周围闲逛，注意到您的狗在做一些可爱的事情，并想用相机捕捉到它。在这种情况下，您根本无法将狗移到窗户附近以获得完美的照明！您也没有时间设置一些闪光灯或闪光灯。</p><p>所以你会怎么做？下次当您遇到困难的照明场景时，请尝试拿出智能手机，打开手电筒，然后将其指向您的狗。测试不同的角度（45 度照明和其他形式的侧光往往效果很好！）。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/photography-camera-light.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Photography camera light - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="摄影相机灯.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 id="3-create-a-stunning-tinfoil-background"> 3.创建令人惊叹的锡纸背景</h2><p>您是美丽的圆形<a aria-label="bokeh (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">散景</a>的粉丝吗？根据我的经验，可爱的散景效果可以拍摄一张平庸的狗照片，并赋予其引人注目的专业外观 - 但令人惊叹的散景并不总是那么容易创建。</p><p>输入一个令人惊叹的 DIY 狗肖像工具：</p><p>锡纸！</p><p>只需取一些锡纸，将其揉成一团，然后展开即可。将锡纸放在狗后面，用灯照射它，然后 - 瞧！ – 你会得到令人瞠目结舌的散景效果： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/tin-foil-bokeh.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Tin foil bokeh " title="锡箔散景.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>这项技术确实需要一些练习，但要开始，请尝试使用大<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">光圈</a>（f/2.8 是一个很好的起点），并确保将您的狗移到箔片前面（箔片之间的距离越大）狗和箔片，背景模糊效果越好）。</p><p>我还建议您使用短焦距或变焦镜头，最好是 50 毫米以上，并确保箔片完全<em>填充</em>背景。最后，如果您很难获得足够明亮的散景，请尝试将背景与狗分开照明（在这里，您的智能手机可以提供很大帮助！）。</p><h2 id="4-shoot-dog-reflection-photos"> 4.拍摄狗狗倒影照片</h2><p>这个狗狗摄影技巧可能有点不传统，但它很简单，而且是捕捉创意狗狗照片的好方法。</p><p>下次当您靠近水（例如水坑或池塘）时，请让您的狗坐下。然后小心地调整自己的角度，以便<em>只有</em>狗的倒影和脚出现在照片中（您可能需要低下）。</p><p>然后，在后期处理中，您可以翻转图像以创建奇妙的幻觉： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dog-reflected-puddle.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Dog reflected puddle - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="狗反射水坑.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>很酷，对吧？当然，您始终可以尝试放大反射头像，包括照片中更多的狗，等等。</p><h2 id="5-use-a-mirror-to-create-negative-space"> 5.使用镜子创造负空间</h2><p>极简主义的狗狗照片很漂亮；狗通常占据画面的一小部分，而镜头的其余部分则被空白区域覆盖（例如，白墙或失焦的前景元素）。</p><p>现在，您始终可以通过在大型、空旷的环境中工作来拍摄<a aria-label="minimalist shots (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/photographic-minimalism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">极简主义的照片</a>，但是如果您在家里拍摄，该怎么办？如何在杂乱的环境中拍摄出简约的照片？</p><p>很简单：带一面镜子。</p><p>然后扩大光圈以创建狭窄<a aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">的景深</a>，缩小以将小狗包含在画面中，然后将镜子靠近相机镜头。确保镜子<em>没有</em>遮住狗，但<em>遮住</em>了框架的其余部分。</p><p>这样，如果你的光圈足够宽并且镜子距离你的相机镜头足够近，镜面就会被遮挡，给你一个美丽的<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/negative-space-in-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="negative space (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">负空间</a>： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/white-space-dog.jpg?ssl=1" alt="White space dog - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="空白狗.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 id="6-use-fairy-lights-to-spice-up-your-dog-photography"> 6.使用童话般的灯光为你的狗狗摄影增添趣味</h2><p>仙女灯价格便宜，使用起来很简单，而且如果小心使用，它们可以创造出令人惊叹的散景效果： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dog-on-fairy-lights.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Dog on fairy lights - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="仙女灯上的狗.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>因此，拿一些童话灯（圣诞灯也可以！），然后将它们放置在照片背景中。你也可以让你的狗坐在它们上面，然后从上面射击。</p><p>为了获得最佳效果，请确保使用大光圈。如果仙女灯不够模糊，请尝试将它们移至背景更远的位置和/或将狗带到前面。</p><h2 id="7-use-perspex-to-create-beautiful-foreground-reflections"> 7. 使用有机玻璃创造美丽的前景反射</h2><p>倒影是增强狗狗照片效果的好方法。通过将反光物体放置在相机镜头附近，然后倾斜该物体直到产生狗的反射，您可以获得特别酷的效果。</p><p>这就是我拍摄这张图像的方式，该图像的特点是构图左侧有有趣的反射： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dog-reflection-hack.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Dog reflection hack - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="狗反射黑客.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>我喜欢使用有机玻璃来实现这个技巧——无论我走到哪里，我都会随身携带一块有机玻璃——但你也可以使用智能手机获得类似的效果！</p><h2 id="8-use-a-prism-to-create-stunning-effects"> 8.使用棱镜创造令人惊叹的效果</h2><p>手持式棱镜将产生类似于有机玻璃的效果，但结果往往看起来更加迷幻并且具有有趣的颜色： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/camera-hack-prism.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Camera hack prism" title="相机黑客棱镜.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>因此，如果您想要特别<em>狂野的</em>效果，请拿起手持棱镜，然后尝试将其放置在狗和相机镜头之间。随意尝试不同的角度和不同的距离 - 根据棱镜的位置，您会得到各种有趣的结果。</p><h2 id="9-shoot-into-the-light-for-a-flare-effect"> 9. 对着光线拍摄以获得耀斑效果</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-256207" style="width:450px"><span class="space" style="width:450px;

/></span></figure></div><p>大多数摄影师都试图避免照片中出现眩光 - 但您是否知道，通过拥抱眩光，您可以拍摄出精彩的创意成果？</p><p>当然，您不想让耀斑主导您的作品。但是，如果您可以将耀斑保持在画面的一侧，同时将狗放置在其他地方，您的主要拍摄对象就会脱颖而出<em>，并且</em>您将获得可爱的效果： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/phone-flare-hack.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Phone flare hack" title="电话耀斑黑客.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>如何创造耀斑？一种方法是在明亮的窗户外面或附近拍摄；您需要调整狗的位置，以便光线从后面射入并直接射入镜头。</p><p>但另一种更简单的方法是简单地拿出您值得信赖的智能手机，打开手电筒，然后将其直接照射到相机上！</p><h2 id="10-shoot-from-a-low-angle"> 10.低角度拍摄</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-256208" style="width:1500px"><span class="space"

/></span></figure></div><p>如果您追求精美的狗肖像摄影，那么我强烈建议您仔细注意相机的角度。</p><p>你看，许多初学者摄影师从站立的高度拍摄狗，但这些图像往往变得非常超然，甚至是静态的。</p><p>相反，我建议您趴在地上，这将为观看者提供完全不同的视角<em>，并</em>创建美丽的前景和背景模糊： </p><div

That&#39;s where a <a aria-label="remote shutter release (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/8-benefits-using-wireless-remote-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">remote shutter release</a> comes in handy; it&#39;ll let you trigger the camera shutter from a distance. Simply set your camera up on the tripod, hit the remote release button, and you&#39;ll capture a cave photo – without ever needing to touch the shutter button.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256168" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-144.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="13 Tips for Gorgeous Cave Photography" class="wp-image-256168" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-144.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-144.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-144.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-144.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-144.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-144.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you don&#39;t own a remote release and don&#39;t plan on buying one, you can always use your camera&#39;s <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/remote-shutter-vs-delayed-shutter/" target="_blank" aria-label="self-timer function (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">self-timer function</a> , which will delay the moment of capture until a few seconds <em>after</em> you hit the shutter button. This works just fine, but it can be annoying to wait for several seconds after each shot, so I encourage you to grab a remote release if you can!</p><h2 data-section id="use-an-off-camera-flash"> 4. Use an off-camera flash</h2><p> As I mentioned in a previous tip, flashes can be hugely useful, especially if tripods are off-limits. They&#39;ll illuminate the cave so you can grab a well-exposed image <em>without</em> a long shutter speed.</p><p> But make sure to bring an off-camera flash. On-camera flash photos tend to look flat and two-dimensional. With an off-camera flash, however, you can hold the flash off to the side, giving more depth to your images. (And more than one flash can be used to light up the cave!)</p><h2 data-section id="wear-a-headlamp"> 5. Wear a headlamp</h2><p> When doing cave photography, you <em>always</em> want two light sources:</p><p> A flash (discussed above).</p><p> And a headlamp.</p><p> The headlamp will light your way and prevent you from having any nasty accidents. A flashlight can work, too, but it&#39;s helpful to have two free hands when setting up your tripod and camera.</p><h2 data-section id="set-the-white-balance-to-flash"> 6. Set the white balance to Flash</h2><p> I encourage you to always use a flash when doing cave photography (assuming the cave isn&#39;t commercially lit).</p><p> So before heading underground, set your camera&#39;s <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/introduction-to-white-balance/" target="_blank" aria-label="white balance setting (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">white balance setting</a> to its Flash option.</p><p> This is one of those life-simplifying steps that will help you good shots with minimal editing. That said, if you forget to set the white balance, it&#39;s not the end of the world as long as you follow my next tip:</p><h2 data-section id="shoot-in-raw"> 7. Shoot in RAW</h2><p> Want to capture cave photos that look gorgeous and professional? Then you must <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/raw-vs-jpeg/" target="_blank" aria-label="shoot in RAW (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shoot in RAW</a> .</p><p> RAW files will give you the most latitude when you adjust the exposure and white balance in the digital darkroom.</p><p> And if you shoot in RAW, you can recover details that would otherwise be lost in a JPEG.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-208748" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="998" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cave-photography-3.jpg?resize=1500%2C998&#038;ssl=1" alt="cave photography" class="wp-image-208748" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cave-photography-3.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cave-photography-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cave-photography-3.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cave-photography-3.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cave-photography-3.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cave-photography-3.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="lower-your-iso"> 8.

Instead, rely on your tripod to keep your camera steady, and keep the ISO as low as possible. I&#39;d recommend working at ISO 100 or 200 if possible, and only push it higher if absolutely necessary!</p><h2 data-section id="dont-be-afraid-to-lengthen-your-shutter-speed"> 9. Don&#39;t be afraid to lengthen your shutter speed</h2><p> As long as you&#39;re using a sturdy tripod, you can drop your shutter speed to 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, and more.</p><p> I&#39;d encourage you to experiment with different shutter speed options (especially when combining the longer shutter speed with flash). You want to get images with plenty of shadow detail, but at the same time, it&#39;s important to avoid blowing out areas of the cave that are illuminated by your flash.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256171" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:71.47%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1072" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-143.jpg?resize=1500%2C1072&#038;ssl=1" alt="13 Tips for Gorgeous Cave Photography" class="wp-image-256171" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-143.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-143.jpg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-143.jpg?resize=600%2C429&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-143.jpg?resize=768%2C549&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-143.jpg?resize=717%2C512&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> It can be helpful to take several test shots while keeping all your settings constant – including flash brightness – but varying the shutter speed.

First, turn the focus ring all the way to infinity. Then back off a little. After you take your shot, review on the LCD – try zooming in to check for perfect sharpness! – and adjust as needed.</p><h2 data-section id="make-adjustments-when-working-in-commercial-caves"> 11. Make adjustments when working in commercial caves</h2><p> Commercial caves are designed for exploration, so they tend to feature plenty of lights. (Caves in national parks, for instance, tend to be beautifully lit!)</p><p> These caves are often a lot of fun as they&#39;re already well-lit and won&#39;t require a flash. A tripod will still be useful, though, so check to see if the cave rules allow you to bring one.</p><p> If you&#39;re on a tour, things may move along quickly, you may not find much time to take photos, and you may have to deal with crowds. Check with the tour operator in advance to see if you can go during a slow part of the day. You might also ask if it&#39;d be okay if you hang back a bit while the tour moves on. The answer may often be “No,” but asking can open doors to possibilities you wouldn&#39;t have otherwise considered, so give the guide a chance to help you out!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-208747" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cave-photography-4-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="cave photography" class="wp-image-208747" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cave-photography-4-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cave-photography-4-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cave-photography-4-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cave-photography-4-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cave-photography-4-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cave-photography-4-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="bring-a-wide-angle-lens"> 12.

I&#39;d suggest starting around 18mm for an APS-C sensor or 28mm if your camera is full frame. That way, you can capture plenty of expansive images showing the entire scene.</p><p> That said, caves do offer the opportunity for close-up compositions that benefit from a longer lens. So if you have the space, bring a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-tips-for-great-telephoto-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="telephoto lens (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">telephoto lens</a> and switch over as needed. But remember: Caves are filled with moisture, so be careful when swapping lenses and keep the changes to a minimum.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256178" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1002" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-141.jpg?resize=1500%2C1002&#038;ssl=1" alt="13 Tips for Gorgeous Cave Photography" class="wp-image-256178" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-141.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-141.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-141.jpg?resize=600%2C401&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-141.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-141.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cave-photography-141.jpg?resize=717%2C479&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="put-a-person-in-the-picture"> 13.

(Of course, you can mix several of these elements together, but it&#39;s important to understand them individually first.)</p><p> And I recommend you <em>start</em> by photographing fire as your subject, simply because it looks really, really cool.</p><p> With such fire shots, the main focus is on the flame (or the effects of it) and the detail that is shown within it. I&#39;m talking about shots like this, which feature clear flame detail:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-39812" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="399" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-13.jpg?resize=600%2C399&#038;ssl=1" alt="football on fire" class="wp-image-39812" title="DPS_Fire-13" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-13.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-13.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-13.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-13.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> So how do you capture such well-exposed, crisp flames? First, you&#39;ll need to use a fast-enough <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shutter speed</a> to freeze the flame&#39;s motion. What counts as “fast enough” is relative to what you&#39;re shooting, but start around 1/250s, then take some test shots and boost the shutter speed as necessary.</p><p> (Note: As your shutter speed increases, you&#39;ll need to use wider <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apertures</a> and higher <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISOs</a> .)</p><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exposure</a> can be difficult, as your camera will often want to underexpose the flames to compensate for their incredible brightness. So don&#39;t be afraid to overexpose by a stop or two for perfect flame detail.</p><p> I&#39;d also recommend you take a handful of test shots at the beginning of your fire photoshoot. Don&#39;t think about <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-elements-of-composition-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">composition</a> , not at the start; instead, focus on nailing the exposure for the flames.</p><p> Then, once you&#39;ve determined the perfect flame exposure, you can bring in helpful composition techniques, like the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rule of thirds</a> , to position the most prominent flames and to position any subjects <em>in</em> the flames, like this:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-39811" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="399" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-5.jpg?resize=600%2C399&#038;ssl=1" alt="flaming camera" class="wp-image-39811" title="DPS_Fire-5" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-5.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-5.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-5.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-5.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> While a fast shutter speed is good for freezing flame motion, you may notice that the fire emits interesting sparks (especially if you&#39;re photographing a sparkler!).

Use fire as a light source</h2><p> Fire offers soft shadows and warm color, so it makes for a wonderful light source – especially in campfire situations like this one:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-39820" style="width:399px"><span class="space" style="width:399px; padding-top:150.38%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="399" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-4.jpg?resize=399%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="campfire photography at night" class="wp-image-39820" title="DPS_Fire-4" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-4.jpg?w=399&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-4.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Notice how the fire beautifully illuminates the surrounding trees.</p><p> But how do you photograph fire with such a magical result? Here are a few quick tips:</p><ol><li> Use a long shutter speed. While fire looks gorgeous, it&#39;s not very bright. To compensate, you&#39;ll often need to work at 1 second, 5 seconds, or even 30 seconds.</li><li> Widen your aperture. Again, the goal here is to compensate for the lack of light. If needed, push your aperture to its maximum setting.</li><li> Boost your ISO. It&#39;s generally a good idea to start with a low ISO – but if you&#39;ve taken some test shots and they&#39;re just not bright, then push your ISO (and <em>keep</em> pushing your ISO until you get the result that you&#39;re after).</li><li> Pay careful attention to where the light falls. If you&#39;re shooting around a campfire, you can get interesting lighting on subjects a dozen feet from the flames – so don&#39;t feel compelled to crop tight. Instead, get creative with your surroundings.</li></ol><p> Also, when working with a wide aperture and therefore a narrow <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depth of field</a> , try setting your focus on objects with high-contrast edges (like the silhouettes of stationary subjects) instead of the main subject. You&#39;ll technically miss focus, but that&#39;s okay; the shifting fire light will blur edges and soften the shadows of the objects it illuminates, so you should do what you can to nail the hard edges.</p><p> Oh, and take advantage of the interesting colors that fire offers…</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-39822" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="399" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-6.jpg?resize=600%2C399&#038;ssl=1" alt="blue flame in a bottle on snow" class="wp-image-39822" title="DPS_Fire-6" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-6.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-6.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-6.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-6.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> …and consider emphasizing them in post-processing!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-39823" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="399" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-7.jpg?resize=600%2C399&#038;ssl=1" alt="orange flame from a lighter" class="wp-image-39823" title="DPS_Fire-7" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-7.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-7.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-7.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-7.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Speaking of which:</p><h2 data-section id="learn-to-control-the-color-of-your-flame"> 5.

Fuels that burn efficiently (like some gas torches and alcohols) may not emit much smoke at all. Use inefficient fuels like wood or paper to maximize your smoke output.</li><li> Light the smoke. A light source shining into the smoke can solidify those lines and help them stand out. Use backlight to create the most powerful effect, while sidelight is better for a mysterious look.</li><li> Use a fast shutter speed to freeze the smoke trails (start at 1/100s, but increase this if necessary). Slower shutter speeds will make the smoke appear like haze, not well-defined wisps.</li></ol><p> Also, be sure to take <em>plenty</em> of images. Smoke is constantly changing shape and direction, so it&#39;s generally not enough to capture one shot and call it a day; instead, take dozens of shots, delete the mediocre ones, and keep your best.</p><h2 data-section id="start-with-a-candle"> 7.

And as you go along, make sure to write down your settings. In particular, determine the shutter speed you need to freeze the flame, as well as the shutter speed you need to illuminate a subject on a table. Finally, use an artificial light source to photograph both the flame and the surrounding environment in a single frame.</p><h2 data-section id="how-to-photograph-fire-final-words"> How to photograph fire: final words</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-39806" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="399" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-3.jpg?resize=600%2C399&#038;ssl=1" alt="person with gas mask and fire" class="wp-image-39806" title="DPS_Fire-3" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-3.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-3.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-3.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Well, there you have it:</p><p> My favorite tips and techniques for fire photoshoots.

Cameras are rated for shutter durability, with enthusiast models often rated around the 150,000-shot mark, and professional models rated at 300,000 shots or higher.</p><p> When browsing, low shutter counts often indicate less heavily-used items. Fewer than 10,000 shots on a camera that is 2-5 years old is very low, with the normal amount being around 30,000-50,000.</p><p> If a camera has a very high count of 100,000 or more, it&#39;s probably best avoided, especially because this number will also give you a little insight into the owner&#39;s use of the camera. Higher-count cameras may have seen professional use (and a harder life), while lower counts indicate casual consumer use.</p><p> So how do you find out a camera&#39;s shutter count?</p><p> The number is often provided when cameras are being sold secondhand. But if you&#39;re not sure, you can find it out a few ways, depending on the model.

Look for any signs of damage, oil, or gunk that has collected in these areas. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/inspect-inside-body-used-camera-gear.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Inspect inside of body used camera gear" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Inspect inside the camera, paying special attention to the mirror and focusing screen; look for any sign of oil or residue.</figcaption></figure></div><p> Oil can indicate that the mechanisms of the internal parts are not functioning correctly, sometimes due to the camera being bumped or dropped. Look for any oil around the sides of the internal section. A small flashlight can be a big help here.</p><p> Remember to hold the camera face-down as much as possible to reduce the risk of contamination from dust and dirt. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/hold-downward-used-camera-gear.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Hold downward used camera gear" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> When inspecting a camera, try to hold it face down.</figcaption></figure></div><p> If you have a lens on hand, it&#39;s worth taking a test shot to look for any issues with the sensor.</p><p> Set the camera to f/16 to f/22, point it at a bright subject (a white wall or the sky), and shoot a frame. Play the image back and zoom in on the LCD screen to look for any marks and scratches.</p><p> <a aria-label="Dust spots (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/sensor-dust-heres-check/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Dust spots</a> are not a huge problem, as a simple sensor clean can take care of them.

So unscrew the filter and check the true front element to be sure. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lens-wear-tear-used-camera-gear.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Lens wear tear used camera gear" title="lens-wear-tear-used-camera-gear.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Often, lenses will show signs of wear on their focus or zoom ring and the external barrel. Simple rubbing is normal and isn&#39;t usually a concern.</p><p> Moving on, inspect internally for dust and mold. Shine a small light inside the lens and look for any particles. Most lenses will have small dust spots, but look for any large patches or seemingly smeared areas, as these will indicate whether the lens has any fogging or other internal issues. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/check-lens-optics-used-camera-gear.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Check lens optics when buying used camera gear" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Look through the optics to ensure they are clear of dust and mold. </figcaption></figure></div><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/dust-lens-used-camera-gear.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Dust lens used" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Heavy dust and mold in a lens are to be avoided.

These patterned charts are easy to find online, and they can be stuck on a wall and used to quickly evaluate a lens.</p><p> Here&#39;s how it works:</p><p> Mount the lens on a camera, then put the camera on a tripod. Focus on the test chart, then fire the camera using a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/remote-shutter-vs-delayed-shutter/" target="_blank" aria-label="remote release or the self-timer (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">remote release or the self-timer</a> (to make sure you don&#39;t create any camera shake).</p><p> Check the shots on your camera LCD (or, if you can, on the computer). Zoom into 100% to be sure of focus. Of course, some cameras and lenses will need fine in-camera adjustments for perfection, but any wildly unsharp tests may indicate a lens has been dropped or is out of alignment.</p><p> It&#39;s also a good idea to test the full aperture range and look for sharpness from edge to edge. Even at f/2.8, the center of your test image should be relatively sharp.</p><p> Additionally, it&#39;s a good idea to look for any external marks or blemishes when performing these tests, turning the focus and zoom rings to check for any stickiness or grating sounds.</p><p> With those checks done, you&#39;ll have a good indication of whether the lens is up to scratch (and worth purchasing!). </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-126430 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-126430" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sharpness-Target.jpeg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="lens test target" class="wp-image-126430" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sharpness-Target.jpeg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sharpness-Target.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sharpness-Target.jpeg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sharpness-Target.jpeg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sharpness-Target.jpeg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Here&#39;s a lens sharpness target.

Buying from a dealer has its advantages, because items are often checked before being added to the inventory, plus they&#39;re often serviced before they&#39;re sold.</p><p> Also, most dealers will have a return policy, so if you find any faults, you can exchange the used gear for a full refund. Many of the better dealers offer warranties on used gear that range from three months to a year, which will give you excellent peace of mind when purchasing.</p><p> Of course, one of the downsides of buying from a dealer is the increased price. Used kit bought from outlets often costs more than gear bought from private sellers – so you must decide if it&#39;s worth that added peace of mind!</p><h3 data-section id="ebay-and-private-sellers"> Ebay and private sellers</h3><p> Purchasing from private sellers directly offers the best chance to find a bargain. Some people sell their gear at far below the market value. If you know what to look for, and are confident about the quality and genuine nature of the sale, you can often get an excellent deal.</p><p> It pays to be wary when shopping for used camera gear, though. Be suspicious of any deal that looks too good to be true, or of buyers who will only accept cash in person. Using PayPal or PayPal alternatives offers an additional layer of protection (one that&#39;s very important in online sales).</p><p> Of course, private sellers generally won&#39;t offer a warranty, but that is a risk you take to get a bargain.</p><h2 data-section id="buying-used-camera-gear-conclusion"> Buying used camera gear: Conclusion</h2><p> Buying used camera gear is all about taking your time to search out a bargain. Carefully study the used gear you&#39;re considering, whether it&#39;s from a dealer or a private seller, and look out for the telltale signs of damage.</p><p> Assuming you use careful consideration and do a thorough inspection before buying, the used market is a fantastic way to trade up your gear at a fraction of the cost of buying new.</p><p> And this, in turn, gives you money to buy additional kit – or even better, a trip or two on which you can use it!</p><p> Now over to you:</p><p> <em>Have you ever bought used camera gear?

Negative space, on the other hand, is less visually demanding and provides a frame for the main event in an image.</p><p> For example, in the image below, the clouds represent positive space, whereas the sky and dark shadows create the negative space that frames the main subject: </p><div class="wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-202477" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_clouds_kennedy.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="rule of space in photography clouds" class="wp-image-202477" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_clouds_kennedy.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_clouds_kennedy.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_clouds_kennedy.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_clouds_kennedy.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_clouds_kennedy.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_clouds_kennedy.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> <a href="https://geni.us/CanonEOS5DMarkIV" target="_blank" aria-label="Canon 5D Mark IV (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenersponsored noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">Canon 5D Mark IV</a> | <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/writers-favorite-lens-the-canon-24-105mm-f4/" target="_blank" aria-label="Canon EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Canon EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM</a> | f/10 | 1/500s | ISO 100</figcaption></figure></div><p> So where does the rule of space in photography fit in?</p><p> In general terms, the rule of space governs the use of negative space within an image. By understanding the nature of the rule of space, a photographer can harness the intent of a subject, as well as add depth and perspective to the image.</p><p> The rule of space is important because it aids a photographer in articulating the energy of a photograph – and it guides the viewer&#39;s eye by sculpting key visual events and affording the subject more room to move.</p><h2 data-section id="working-with-the-rule-of-space-the-basics"> Working with the rule of space: the basics</h2><p> To work with the rule of space in photography, first consider the behavior of your subject.</p><p> Ask yourself: What is the subject doing? Is it moving or stationary? How does it occupy space?</p><p> At the same time, visualize what you want to convey in the photograph. Is it movement? Perspective? Depth? Narrative?</p><p> The nature and behavior of your subject plus your intent should together determine how you apply the rule of space.</p><h3 data-section id="perspective"> Perspective</h3><p> One of the main ways the rule of space can impact a photograph is through <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/perspective-photography-dont-just-stand-move-feet/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">perspective</a> .

A subject&#39;s gaze naturally directs our attention – we want to see what the subject sees.</p><p> But when a gaze is met by negative space, the viewer&#39;s eye will often naturally return to the original source of the gaze. The rule of space provides an organic way of adding depth and directing viewer attention.</p><p> You can also use the rule of space with non-human/animal subject matter – based on their movement, perceived gesticulations, and extensions. By following the momentum, composition, or behavior of a non-human subject, you&#39;ll find ideal placements for negative space.</p><p> In the example below, I surrounded several blossoms with negative space; this additional room suggests growth and depth. It also highlights the detail in the individual florets. </p><div class="wp-block-image caption-align-left is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-202536" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_pink_flowers_kennedy.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="pink flowers rule of space in photography" class="wp-image-202536" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_pink_flowers_kennedy.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_pink_flowers_kennedy.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_pink_flowers_kennedy.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_pink_flowers_kennedy.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_pink_flowers_kennedy.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rule_of_space_in_photography_pink_flowers_kennedy.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Leaving extra room around specific flower heads to articulate their elemental composition is one way to emphasize non-human subjects through the rule of space.<br /> Canon 5D Mark II | <a aria-label="Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II (opens in a new tab)" href="https://geni.us/dPSCanonEF50f1-8IILens" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenersponsored noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II</a> with extension tubes | f/2.5 | 1/1250s | ISO 200</figcaption></figure></div><h2 data-section id="rule-of-space-challenges"> Rule of space challenges</h2><p> The process of applying the rule of space to photographs is not that difficult in itself.

Look for tree tunnels</h2><p> This is another classic tree photo: The tree tunnel, which features two rows of trees leading off into the distance:</p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-170327"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-170327" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-03.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="tree photography tips tree tunnel with people walking in the distance" class="wp-image-170327" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-03.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-03.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-03.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-03.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-03.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-03.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Here, it&#39;s important that you find two unbroken, symmetrical rows of trees. You need a strong <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-leading-lines-for-better-compositions/" target="_blank" aria-label="leading line (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">leading line</a> in the center, and the tighter the tree lines, the better.</p><p> You can experiment with different <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> approaches for creative images. A deep depth of field will show lots of detail, while a narrow depth of field has the potential to create highly artistic images.</p><p> If you can, include a person or two in the background; that way, the viewer has an obvious place to rest their eyes.</p><p> The tough part is actually <em>finding</em> the tree tunnel. I&#39;d recommend doing some Googling for “tree tunnels,” “fall foliage walks,” and the like. You might also check out Instagram; see if you come across any great tree tunnel images taken in nearby areas.</p><p> Speaking of which: If you can shoot during the fall – when the colors are looking <em>amazing</em> – or even in the winter when the snow is falling, your results will be truly legendary.</p><h2 data-section id="photograph-the-same-tree-for-a-year"> 3. Photograph the same tree for a year</h2><p> Trees change over the course of the year, which gives you a fantastic tree time-lapse opportunity. This works best away from the equator, but you can try it pretty much anywhere (if you&#39;re working in the tropics, the changes will be more subtle).</p><p> First, find a tree and carefully determine your composition. I recommend using a tripod to maintain consistency; take photos of the <em>exact</em> position of the tripod and its height, then store them on your phone so you can easily reference them when you come back.</p><p> (If you can&#39;t pick a single composition, feel free to come up with three or four. But you&#39;ll need to carefully document each setup so you can return later on.)</p><p> Next, determine your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/beginners-guide-to-camera-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="settings (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">settings</a> . Make sure to record the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> so you can keep the depth of field consistent. And if you&#39;re using a zoom lens, record the focal length.</p><p> Finally, take the same shot several times over the next twelve months! You can come back once during each season, or – if you want to create a more intensive time-lapse series – come back every month or even every week.</p><p> Once the cycle is complete, you&#39;ll have a beautiful set of images documenting the changing seasons.</p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-170332"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-170332" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-08.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="trees in fall seen from above" class="wp-image-170332" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-08.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-08.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-08.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-08.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-08.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-08.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="try-some-creative-techniques"> 4. Try some creative techniques</h2><p> If your tree images are looking a bit <em>bland</em> , then why not try out a fun creative technique?</p><p> For instance, you might capture a:</p><ul><li> <strong>Tree silhouette.</strong> This works great with trees featuring beautifully shaped branches! Head out around sunset, make sure your tree is framed against the bright sky, and expose for the brightest part of the scene.</li><li> <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/4-refraction-ideas-your-creativity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Refraction shot</a> .</strong> Bring along a <a aria-label="lensball (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/7-steps-refraction-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">lensball</a> , hold it up in front of the tree, and shoot through the glass.

Focus on the details</h2><p> Compositions that include the entire tree are nice…</p><p> …but tree <em>detail</em> images can be beautiful, too!

Here are some items to consider:</p><ul><li> <strong>Leaves.</strong> You can focus on a single leaf and widen the aperture for a <a aria-label="beautiful bokeh background (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">beautiful bokeh background</a> .

For maximum texture, position yourself so the bark is sidelit.</li><li> <strong>The trunk.</strong> Observe the root system around the trunk. See what patterns you can photograph at the foot of the tree.</li><li> <strong>Branches.</strong> Take a minute to look <em>up</em> . Interlocking branches can create beautiful patterns, especially when they&#39;re silhouetted against a bright sky.</li></ul><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-170330"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-170330" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-06.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="the roots of trees in the jungle" class="wp-image-170330" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-06.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-06.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-06.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-06.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-06.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-06.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="use-trees-as-portrait-backgrounds"> 6. Use trees as portrait backgrounds</h2><p> Not every tree image needs to use the tree as the main subject; you can also use trees as stunning backgrounds.</p><p> Portrait photos, in particular, benefit from tree backdrops. You can use tree tunnels to frame your subject, or you can position a lone subject near a lone tree for a minimalistic effect.</p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-170326"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-170326" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-02.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="woman standing in a tunnel of trees with an umbrella" class="wp-image-170326" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-02.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-02.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-02.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-02.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-02.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/photograph-trees-02.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Plus, in summer and fall, tree leaves make gorgeous background bokeh. Just put your subject in front of a leafy tree, widen the aperture, and watch as you create jaw-dropping portraits! This approach works especially well if you shoot during the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-photograph-golden-hour/" target="_blank" aria-label="golden hours (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">golden hours</a> and the background leaves are lit by the setting sun.</p><h2 data-section id="try-different-vantage-points"> 7. Try different vantage points</h2><p> Most photographers shoot trees from the most obvious angle: Standing and looking straight ahead.</p><p> But if you want unique tree photos, why not mix it up a little? Here are a few fun perspectives you can use for more original tree images:</p><ul><li> <strong>Low angle.</strong> Get down low and shoot from the perspective of a four-legged creature. This will create an intimate image that emphasizes the height of the surrounding trees. You might consider adding in a foreground subject; try placing flowers in the foreground while keeping the tree in the background.</li><li> <strong>Worm&#39;s-eye view.</strong> Get down low on the forest floor, but instead of pointing the lens straight ahead, point it up at the treetops. See if you can shoot from the middle of a clearing with a wide-angle lens; that way, the trees will seem to be reaching for the sky.</li><li> <strong>Bird&#39;s-eye view.</strong> For this angle – looking down from above – you&#39;ll need a drone, a helicopter, or some other way of getting high above the trees. It might take some work (and money), but the results can be spectacular!</li></ul><h2 data-section id="include-wildlife-in-your-tree-photos"> 8. Include wildlife in your tree photos</h2><p> Do you like to photograph mammals, birds, or insects? Try combining the wildlife with the trees for spectacular forest images.</p><p> You can start small. Grab a close-focusing lens, then see if you can find some ants, beetles, caterpillars, or butterflies to capture.</p><p> And if you have a telephoto lens, try creating some portraits of the local wildlife.

Your images will look blurry, unpleasant, and just all-around bad.</p><p> That&#39;s why, in this article, I&#39;m going to share 12 settings for concert photography. These are the <em>exact</em> camera settings I use in my own concert shooting, so you know they work. (And I promise: They&#39;ll help you boost your images <em>and</em> your career!)</p><p> Let&#39;s dive right in.</p><h2 data-section id="the-best-concert-photography-settings-in-brief"> The best concert photography settings, in brief</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256107" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/concert-photography-settings-106.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Concert photography settings" class="wp-image-256107" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/concert-photography-settings-106.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/concert-photography-settings-106.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/concert-photography-settings-106.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/concert-photography-settings-106.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/concert-photography-settings-106.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/concert-photography-settings-106.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Before we dive into the nitty-gritty, let&#39;s take a moment to review my go-to settings for concert photography. If you&#39;re eager to grab your camera and head to a gig tonight, these settings will net you solid results:</p><ul><li> RAW format</li><li> Manual mode</li><li> A wide aperture</li><li> A reasonably fast shutter speed</li><li> A high ISO</li><li> Image stabilization</li><li> Auto White Balance</li><li> Spot metering</li><li> Back-button AF</li><li> Burst mode</li></ul><p> Think of this list as your concert photography cheat sheet. It&#39;ll get you about 80% of the way – but to truly shine in this challenging field, you need to understand when to fine-tune your settings, you&#39;ll need to understand why these settings are so crucial and what they actually <em>do</em> , and you&#39;ll also need to learn a few additional camera settings to consider.</p><p> Also, always remember that every concert is unique. Lighting conditions can change from one moment to the next, and what works for a high-energy rock concert may not be ideal for a subdued jazz performance. Still, by dialing in these key settings, you&#39;ll be well on your way to capturing stellar images that bring the stage to life.</p><h2 data-section id="the-concert-photography-settings-everyone-should-know"> The 12 concert photography settings everyone should know</h2><p> Looking to level up your photos of rock concerts, symphonies, and everything in between?

That way, you can change parameters such as exposure, white balance, saturation, contrast, and clarity <em>long</em> after you hit the shutter button.</p><p> (In other words: If you&#39;re careful and deliberate with your editing, you can make your photos look a lot better!)</p><h3 data-section id="use-manual-or-aperture-priority-mode"> 2.

That way, the most possible light hits your sensor.</p><p> A wide aperture is especially important in low-light concert photography. If possible, shoot with an f/2.8, f/1.8, f/1.4, or f/1.2 lens.</p><p> If you&#39;re a beginner on a budget, I&#39;d recommend grabbing a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/writers-favorite-lens-50mm-f1-8/" target="_blank" aria-label="50mm f/1.8 lens (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">50mm f/1.8 lens</a> , which is cheap, features a wide maximum aperture, and offers surprisingly nice image quality.</p><h3 data-section id="use-a-fast-shutter-speed"> 4. Use a fast shutter speed </h3><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Miley-Cyrus.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Miley Cyrus Concert photography settings" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Miley Cyrus<br /> Nikon D800 | 340mm | f/4.8 | 1/320s | ISO 1600</figcaption></figure></div><p> Have you ever been to a concert where the artist was running and jumping from one side of the stage to the other?</p><p> This type of action makes for some great photography – but to freeze such movement, you must use a fast shutter speed.</p><p> In general, I set my shutter speed to 1/200s or faster (and depending on the level of action, you may want to push this even higher.) Certain concerts will allow you to get away with a slower speed, such as 1/160s, but it&#39;s often better to err on the side of caution and go higher rather than lower, even if you&#39;re forced to increase your ISO as a result. Speaking of which:</p><h3 data-section id="boost-your-iso"> 5.

But if you&#39;re shooting a low-light concert, I&#39;d recommend kicking this up to 1600, 3200, or even 6400. Otherwise, your shots will end up far too dark (or you&#39;ll be forced to drop your shutter speed, which will introduce blur).</p><p> Unfortunately, a high ISO does come with a significant tradeoff: image noise.</p><p> In other words, as you push your ISO from 400 to 800 to 1600, you start to get little flecks of color and light that look pretty bad. The specifics will depend on your camera (modern sensors do a very good job of minimizing high-ISO noise!), but you should always be cautious when boosting the ISO. Only raise it when absolutely necessary, and be mindful of your particular camera&#39;s high-ISO capabilities.</p><p> It can help to spend some time capturing test shots at various ISOs, then magnifying the images on your computer and evaluating the noise levels in your images. Also note that you can sometimes salvage noise-heavy images with noise reduction during post-processing, or you can convert your files to black and white for a grittier, noir-type look.</p><h3 data-section id="turn-on-image-stabilization"> 6.

Available in many of today&#39;s lenses and some (mostly high-end) mirrorless cameras, image stabilization helps to counteract the effects of camera shake so you can keep your files looking tack-sharp.</p><p> Imagine you&#39;re at a concert and trying to shoot in low-light conditions. If your hands shake, you shoot while panning, or you get bumped by an audience member or another photographer, you risk introducing blur into your images, even if you&#39;re working at a reasonably fast shutter speed.</p><p> Turn on your camera or lens&#39;s image stabilization, however, and it&#39;ll compensate for minor camera movements. In fact, it can make a noticeable difference in the sharpness of your photos, and it&#39;ll certainly improve your consistency.</p><p> Not sure whether your camera or lens offers image stabilization? This feature can be labeled differently depending on your gear. For instance, camera-based image stabilization is often referred to as IBIS (in-body image stabilization), while lens-based image stabilization goes by a host of acronyms like IS, VR, OS, OSS, or VC. When in doubt, do a bit of Googling!</p><p> Pro tip: It&#39;s important to remember that while image stabilization can help with camera shake, it won&#39;t freeze the motion of a performer jumping around the stage. For that, you&#39;ll still need a fast shutter speed!</p><h3 data-section id="use-spot-metering"> 7. Use spot metering </h3><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Atari-Teenage-Riot.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Atari Teenage Riot Concert photography settings" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Atari Teenage Riot<br /> Nikon D700 | 50mm | f/1.8 | 1/2500s | ISO 1600</figcaption></figure></div><p> <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/beginners-guide-metering-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Spot metering</a> limits your camera&#39;s exposure readings to the center of the scene – which allows you to determine the exposure based on a small subject (eg, a face). It works especially well when your subject and background are differently lit.</p><p> When shooting concerts, the artist will often be lit by a spotlight while the rest of the stage remains dark. So here&#39;s what you do:</p><p> First, switch your camera to spot metering mode.</p><p> Then place the artist&#39;s face in the middle of your viewfinder and memorize the recommended exposure settings.</p><p> If you&#39;re using Manual mode, you can dial in the settings, then compose without worrying about fluctuating meter readings. If you&#39;re using Aperture Priority, you&#39;ll need to lock the exposure; that way, you don&#39;t end up with varied exposures as the performers jump around the frame.</p><p> If you don&#39;t like spot metering and it&#39;s giving you bad results, you can try your camera&#39;s matrix/evaluative metering mode. The camera will take a light reading at several points in the scene, and this can work – but you&#39;ll want to be on the lookout for overexposed faces, especially when the background is dark.</p><h3 data-section id="use-the-middle-autofocus-point"> 8.

Peripheral autofocus points tend to work fine in good light, but the performance weakens as the light drops. Whereas the <em>center</em> autofocus point remains effective in <em>both</em> good light and bad.</p><p> That&#39;s why I recommend you use the central focus point in low-light situations. It&#39;ll be the most accurate, and it&#39;ll ensure you get the sharpest results, no matter what the artist is doing on stage.</p><p> If you don&#39;t want the artist to sit smack-dab in the center of the frame, you&#39;ll need to use a focus-and-recompose technique; simply push your shutter button halfway down to focus on the artist&#39;s face – this will lock focus – then adjust your composition until you get the desired framing. Once you&#39;ve nailed both focus and composition, press the shutter button the rest of the way.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256113" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/concert-photography-settings-107.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="Concert photography settings" class="wp-image-256113" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/concert-photography-settings-107.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/concert-photography-settings-107.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/concert-photography-settings-107.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/concert-photography-settings-107.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/concert-photography-settings-107.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/concert-photography-settings-107.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Note: To use this focus-and-recompose technique, you&#39;ll need to set your camera to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/one-shot-vs-ai-servo-when-to-use-each/" target="_blank" aria-label="One-Shot AF (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">One-Shot AF</a> , also known as AF-S.

Of course, be sure to stock up on memory cards, and be prepared to spend some extra time going through your files when you get home.

But while you&#39;re absorbed in capturing the event, the noise of your camera&#39;s shutter can be a distraction for those around you – and you might not even realize it!</p><p> This is where your camera&#39;s silent mode can come in handy. You see, many mirrorless cameras, and even some DSLRs, offer silent-shooting options; these are designed for quieter events like weddings and award ceremonies, where it&#39;s essential that the photographer remains as inconspicuous as possible. Turn on silent shooting, and the chatter of your camera will instantly disappear.</p><p> Not all concerts require a quiet camera, of course. A heavy-metal band, for instance, will drown out the sound of your camera shutter – but in settings like low-key acoustic concerts or classical performances, the quiet or silent mode can make a huge difference. That way, you can click away without drawing attention, and both the audience <em>and</em> the performers will thank you.</p><p> Plus, some cameras offer increased continuous shooting speeds when set to their silent-shooting mode, which allows you to capture more frames in quick succession!</p><h2 data-section id="must-know-concert-photography-settings-final-words"> Must-know concert photography settings: final words</h2><p> Now that you&#39;ve finished this article, you&#39;re well-equipped to capture some stunning concert photos!

But why is this the case? For starters, bright sunlight is a form of hard light. It creates deep shadows and stark contrast, making it difficult to capture flattering images—whether it&#39;s of people, landscapes, or even flowers. Think about portrait photography at midday. You&#39;ll end up with strong shadows, often in awkward places like under your subject&#39;s chin, thanks to the overhead angle of the sun.</p><p> Then there&#39;s the issue of exposure. Hard light makes it challenging to find that sweet spot between too bright and too dark. You&#39;ll often find areas of your shot that are overexposed, washed out, or underexposed and too dark. You won&#39;t just struggle with exposure; even colors can appear less vibrant in bright sunlight. A vivid red rose, for instance, can look surprisingly dull when photographed in harsh sunlight.</p><p> Ever seen those circles of light that show up unexpectedly in your photos, like in the shot of the plane below? That&#39;s lens flare. While it can be used intentionally for artistic effect, more often than not, it&#39;s an unwelcome distraction that reduces the overall contrast of your image.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256082" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photography-bright-sunlight-12.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Photography in Bright Sunlight: 14 Easy Tips for Beautiful Results" class="wp-image-256082" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photography-bright-sunlight-12.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photography-bright-sunlight-12.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photography-bright-sunlight-12.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photography-bright-sunlight-12.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photography-bright-sunlight-12.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photography-bright-sunlight-12.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p>但不要害怕！ As I explained above, taking good pictures in bright sunlight is very attainable.

A diffuser is essentially a piece of translucent material that scatters light, softening those harsh shadows and reducing contrast. When working with a flash, you can use diffusers in various forms, from white umbrellas to softboxes – but when working outdoors, a standard sheet or a rounded pop-up diffuser will do the trick.</p><p> You or an assistant can simply hold the diffuser between the light and your subject, and the result will often feature a natural lighting effect. This technique is particularly useful for portrait and close-up photography, but remember that diffusers do have their limitations; you can&#39;t exactly hold one over a building or a wide landscape!</p><h3 data-section id="move-into-the-shade"> 2.

For instance, portrait subjects will get unwanted shadows under the chin, flowers will get heavy shadows underneath the petals, and pets will get dark shadows under their head and body.</p><p> In general, these harsh shadows look bad, but there&#39;s an easy solution:</p><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/on-camera-speedlight-fill-flash-portraits/" target="_blank" aria-label="Fill flash (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Fill flash</a> .</p><p> Simply point a flash toward the dark shadows and fire away! Make sure the flash is on a low power setting – after all, you don&#39;t want to make the underside of your subject brighter than its top! – and experiment with different flash angles for the best results.</p><p> You also might try putting the sun <em>behind</em> your subject, then using the fill flash to brighten up your subject&#39;s front. It can look really good, though watch out for lens flare.</p><h3 data-section id="use-a-reflector"> 5.

Simply point the reflector at the area you want to brighten up, then adjust it until you get some nice fill (by angling the reflector back and forth, you&#39;ll see the reflected light change position, and you can use this “preview” to fine-tune the effect).</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-210564" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/how-to-take-good-pictures-in-bright-sunlight-3.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="portrait with backlight" class="wp-image-210564" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/how-to-take-good-pictures-in-bright-sunlight-3.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/how-to-take-good-pictures-in-bright-sunlight-3.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/how-to-take-good-pictures-in-bright-sunlight-3.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/how-to-take-good-pictures-in-bright-sunlight-3.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/how-to-take-good-pictures-in-bright-sunlight-3.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Note that you can also try the same tactic I mentioned in the previous section, where you position your subject in front of the sun and bounce light back onto their front.

This will force your camera to expose based on a targeted portion of your scene; you can aim at your main subject, then dial in the recommended exposure settings.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-210568" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/how-to-take-good-pictures-in-bright-sunlight-2-2.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="woman in the bright sun" class="wp-image-210568" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/how-to-take-good-pictures-in-bright-sunlight-2-2.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/how-to-take-good-pictures-in-bright-sunlight-2-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/how-to-take-good-pictures-in-bright-sunlight-2-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/how-to-take-good-pictures-in-bright-sunlight-2-2.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/how-to-take-good-pictures-in-bright-sunlight-2-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Alternatively, you can spot meter off a midtone in your shot – this will ensure the entire scene is exposed relatively well (as opposed to the former technique, which will ensure you expose for your subject).</p><p> After taking an image, check the back of your camera for a preview; you may need to adjust your technique depending on the result. Here, your histogram can be <em>very</em> handy, especially because it&#39;s tough to accurately evaluate an LCD preview in bright sunlight.</p><p> Also, if you have the luxury of time, try metering off different parts of the scene while taking multiple shots – that way, you can choose the best option later on.</p><h3 data-section id="carefully-choose-the-time-of-day-you-shoot"> 11.
