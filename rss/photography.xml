href="https://digital-photography-school.com/11-surefire-tips-for-improving-your-landscape-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="photograph landscapes (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">拍摄风景</a>。您还可以在谷歌上搜索该地区的野生动物列表，并进行更多<em>的</em>谷歌搜索以了解不同野生动物主题的特点。</p><p>另外，专业提示：检查一下在您的目的地拍摄了哪些<em>其他</em>照片。在这里，Instagram 和 Google Places 非常有用。使用其他摄影师的图像来寻找灵感并确定要关注的特定主题和领域。</p><p>当然，你永远不可能为自然摄影做好充分的准备，但这没关系。准备过程并不是将您的旅行精心设计成单独的照片；而是将您的旅行安排得井井有条。相反，它是关于确定<em>广义</em>上的期望并优化您在该领域花费的时间。</p><h2 id="2-pack-the-right-nature-photography-gear"> 2. 带上合适的自然摄影装备</h2><p>虽然专业的自然摄影师确实倾向于携带装备，但您不需要最好的相机和镜头来捕捉令人惊叹的照片。</p><p>相反，只要您愿意付出足够的耐心和毅力，您就可以使用基本相机和一两个镜头拍摄出美丽的图像。</p><p>同时，出发前要<em>仔细</em>选择装备；这样，您就可以最大限度地提高成功的机会。</p><p>您完成研究了吗（请参阅前面的提示）？那么你应该知道会发生哪些科目。因此，如果您的目标是拍摄野生动物特写，请务必带上最好的变焦镜头，这样您就可以拍摄鸟类和动物的全身照片，甚至是爆头照片。我建议在拍摄大型动物时至少使用 300 毫米镜头，如果您拍摄易受惊吓的动物和小鸟，400 毫米或 500 毫米镜头是必不可少的。</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-230988" style="width:1500px"><span

(opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">最广角的镜头</a>。广角变焦（例如 16-35 毫米镜头）将非常有效，不过您也可以使用 24-70 毫米镜头甚至 24 毫米定焦镜头。</p><p>最后，如果您希望捕捉花朵、树木细节、水面上的冰等更紧凑的场景，那么请带上<a aria-label="macro lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lenses-for-macro-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">微距镜头</a>以获得令人惊叹的特写视角。</p><p>至于相机，任何可互换镜头型号都可以，但如果您打算拍摄移动的物体，例如飞行中的鸟类，那么自动对焦系统越快越好。如果您需要裁剪或创建大型照片，更高分辨率的传感器也可以派上用场，而耐用、防风雨的机身非常适合在恶劣天气下进行拍摄。</p><p>但无论你做什么，都不要过度包装。如果您携带太多装备，您会感到沉重，并且很难找到继续拍摄的动力。相反，虽然这可能很困难，但带太少的装备总比带太多好。</p><h2 id="3-be-sure-to-take-a-good-bag"> 3.一定要带好包</h2><p>自然摄影师常常痴迷于相机和镜头。虽然这些装备确实很重要，但记住一些小事情也很重要——例如，一个好包。</p><p>因为世界上所有的装备都不值钱，除非你能舒适地随身携带。</p><p>有许多袋子太小，非常不舒服，并且在一点压力后很容易破裂。<em> </em>包包的价格和质量差别很大，但根据我的经验，一分钱一分货。</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-230989" style="width:1500px"><span class="space"

/></span></figure></div><p>在开始拍摄自然照片之前，请创建一个心理清单（或者，如果您愿意的话，可以创建一个物理清单）。您不想到达主要拍摄地点却发现忘记了一些重要的东西！</p><p>所以问自己以下问题：</p><ul><li><strong>是否需要任何特殊许可或许可？</strong>一些国家公园、州立公园和野生动物保护区需要特殊许可证才能进入某些区域，尤其是偏远地区。</li><li><strong>我将把车停在哪里？</strong>这个非常重要。如果您将车辆停放在未经授权的区域，那么您将被处以巨额罚款 - 相信我。 （或者更糟糕的是，您回来时会发现您的车辆已被拖走。）</li><li><strong>有任何形式的时间限制吗？</strong>大多数自然区域和公园都像企业一样有营业时间。您可能希望拍摄美丽的日出，却发现您选择的位置要到黎明后才能到达。另请记住，野生动物和小动物通常在清晨和傍晚最活跃，因此请选择一个可以让您充分利用时间的地点。</li><li><strong>预计天气状况如何？</strong>这是一个大人物。检查出发当天的天气预报，如果可能的话，全天密切关注天气预报。切勿在没有做好恶劣天气准备的情况下冒险外出，从而危及自己或设备。 （即使天气应该晴朗，我也建议您为相机和背包带上防雨罩。安全总比后悔好，对吧？）</li><li><strong>日出和日落的时间是什么时候？</strong>再次强调，要确保您想要拍摄日出或日落的地方交通方便。您还需要了解日出-日落时间表，以便您有足够的时间到达您的位置并在奇迹发生之前设置好您的装备。</li><li><strong>有没有常见的动物、地标或结构？</strong>我在之前的提示中提到过这一点，但值得重复一遍。研究一下您计划参观的区域周围通常会拍摄什么。找到公园管理员或工作人员，询问鲜为人知的景点。如果你能发现什么是流行的以及以前做过什么，你就可以避免以同样的方式拍摄场景。考虑一下如何发挥创意！</li></ul><h2

To get the best results – the kind that you can print large and hang on your wall – you need the right gear.</p><p> One way to determine essential gear for nighttime landscapes is through trial and error, but it&#39;ll take a <em>long</em> time (and a lot of money) to arrive at the best setup. That&#39;s where I can help; as an experienced landscape shooter, I can offer plenty of advice for selecting the perfect gear. And below, I share my favorite night landscape photography equipment, including the best cameras and lenses as well as key accessories such as tripods and filters.</p><p> Let&#39;s dive right in.</p><h2 data-section id="a-full-frame-camera"> 1.

These models excel at high <a aria-label="ISO settings (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO settings</a> , which are crucial for capturing the night sky above dimly lit terrain. And while you can get by with entry-level APS-C models, you&#39;ll quickly notice limitations. Noise will start to creep in, and your starry sky will look more like a grainy mess.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133645" style="width:501px"><span class="space" style="width:501px; padding-top:149.7%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="501" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Alto-Campoo-Milky-Way-1-e1504626918202.jpg?resize=501%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="Night landscape photography equipment" class="wp-image-133645" data-recalc-dims="1"/></span></figure></div><p> Now, the DSLR versus mirrorless debate does come into play here. Mirrorless models are feature-rich, and features like manual focusing guides and electronic viewfinders come in handy in certain scenarios. But don&#39;t discount DSLRs; their optical viewfinders are very effective when working in near-total darkness. Ultimately, both have their merits, and it comes down to what you&#39;re most comfortable using. Just remember that it&#39;s crucial to go full-frame for the best high-ISO performance.</p><h2 data-section id="a-wide-angle-lens"> 2.

This is especially true if you want to photograph at night – shooting at night usually means using slower <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speeds (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speeds</a> to let in more light, and without a tripod, you risk capturing blurry photos.</p><p> In other words, a good tripod will make a <em>world</em> of difference in your night landscapes.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133830" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="501" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Mt-Rainier-NP-Moon-e1504800247768.jpg?resize=750%2C501&#038;ssl=1" alt="Night landscape photography equipment" class="wp-image-133830" data-recalc-dims="1"/></span></figure></div><p> Carbon fiber tripods are generally the way to go. They&#39;re lightweight and tend to be extremely sturdy, though they can be pricey. Don&#39;t feel you need to purchase the best of the best, as a middle-of-the-road, solid tripod won&#39;t break the bank and can still deliver dependable results.</p><p> On the other hand, resist the urge to snag a budget tripod. They may seem cost-effective, but they often break and won&#39;t always net you sharp images, which will cost more in the long run.</p><h2 data-section id="a-remote-shutter-release"> 4.

You press the shutter button, expecting to capture a great image – but when you review the shot, it looks blurry.为什么？ Because your camera moved when you touched it.</p><p> That&#39;s where a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/8-benefits-using-wireless-remote-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="remote shutter release (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">remote shutter release</a> comes into play. This nifty gadget allows you to take photos without touching your camera, eliminating any chance of camera shake so you can capture tack-sharp shots time and time again.</p><p> If you&#39;re keen on star trails or <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/step-by-step-guide-to-long-exposure-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="long exposures (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">long exposures</a> beyond 30 seconds, it&#39;s important to recognize that some advanced remotes display the exposure time; that way, you can carefully determine the length of the exposure as you work.</p><p> But what if you don&#39;t plan to use extra-long shutter speeds? Using your camera&#39;s <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/remote-shutter-vs-delayed-shutter/" target="_blank" aria-label="built-in two-second timer (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">built-in two-second timer</a> can also prevent vibrations from pressing the shutter, but it&#39;s not the most convenient way to shoot, and you might find a remote release to be a valuable addition to your gear bag.</p><h2 data-section id="a-natural-night-filter"> 4. A natural night filter</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-133683" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="501" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Natural-Night-e1504644929145.jpg?resize=750%2C501&#038;ssl=1" alt="Night landscape photography equipment" class="wp-image-133683" data-recalc-dims="1"/></span></figure></div><p> Photographers don&#39;t talk much about using a natural night filter, but let me tell you, this tool can be a game-changer. Especially when shooting near cities or populated areas where light pollution is a big issue, a natural night filter becomes a go-to item in my kit. It slots easily into a filter holder on the front of your lens, and once in place, it acts as a barrier, filtering out the wavelengths of light pollution that mess up your photos.</p><p> Sure, you can try to fix light pollution issues in post-production. But in my experience, the right filter can save you a lot of hassle – your images will come out crisper and more balanced right off the bat. NiSi and LEE are great brands for night filters, and they both offer robust and effective options. The filters aren&#39;t exactly budget-friendly, but if you&#39;re serious about capturing the night sky in all its glory, investing in one can be worth every penny.</p><h2 data-section id="plenty-of-batteries"> 5.

Long exposures and cold nighttime temperatures can deplete your batteries faster than you think, and that&#39;s why having extra batteries is non-negotiable when you&#39;re out in the field at night.</p><p> In a perfect world, we&#39;d all carry a handful of brand-name batteries from Canon, Nikon, or Sony. But let&#39;s face it, extra batteries are expensive – so if you&#39;re looking to save a bit, there are third-party batteries that cost less. Just read the reviews, and understand that they might not have the same longevity or reliability as the name-brand ones.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256238" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:63.27%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="949" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/night-landscape-photography-equipment-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C949&#038;ssl=1" alt="Night landscape photography equipment" class="wp-image-256238" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/night-landscape-photography-equipment-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/night-landscape-photography-equipment-2.jpg?resize=300%2C190&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/night-landscape-photography-equipment-2.jpg?resize=600%2C380&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/night-landscape-photography-equipment-2.jpg?resize=768%2C486&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/night-landscape-photography-equipment-2.jpg?resize=717%2C454&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> You can also adopt a few tricks to save battery life. Turn on your camera&#39;s power-saving mode, avoid using the electronic viewfinder, and only power up your camera when you&#39;re ready to shoot.</p><p> But my basic advice? Keep two or three fully charged batteries in an inner pocket of your jacket, especially if it&#39;s cold. That way, you&#39;re always prepared, and you won&#39;t have to cut your photography session short because of a dead battery.</p><h2 data-section id="a-powerful-headlamp"> 6.

You&#39;re out in the field with a bag full of equipment, but none of it will be useful if you can&#39;t see what you&#39;re doing.</p><p> A handheld flashlight might come to mind as a solution. However, using one can be limiting. If you&#39;re maneuvering over uneven ground, your hands are better off free, and that&#39;s where a headlamp becomes invaluable. Strap it on, and suddenly you have light exactly where you&#39;re looking, no juggling act required.</p><p> Plus, with a headlamp, you can see clearly as you mount your camera, select focus, adjust composition, or change settings. But don&#39;t forget to turn off the headlamp before you hit the shutter. Otherwise, you&#39;ll end up unintentionally painting your scene with light.</p><h2 data-section id="a-smartphone"> 7.

But while these shots are a huge part of street photography, the genre is actually far more expansive.</p><p> You see, street photography is about candidly photographing life and human nature. It is a way for us to show our surroundings and how we as photographers relate to it.</p><p> People don&#39;t need to be present in a street photograph, nor does a street photo need to be taken in a city. It can be taken anywhere, and it can portray nearly anything – as long as it isn&#39;t posed or manipulated. A street photo can be shot at a family barbecue or in the middle of 5th Avenue in New York City. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2_prince_and_broadway.jpg?ssl=1" alt="people walking street photography" title="2_prince_and_broadway.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Note that, while technical quality is always important, it is not celebrated in street photography the way it is in, say, landscape photography. A landscape image needs to be sharp. It needs to have perfect colors and plenty of tonal detail. But street photography is different; it can be grainy, poorly focused, or slightly off-kilter.</p><p> Can these issues ruin a street photo? Yes, sometimes, so it&#39;s important to aim for technical mastery. But if an image is technically imperfect, it may still be great (or, thanks to these deficiencies, it might actually become <em>better</em> ). </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cobblestone.jpg?ssl=1" alt="shadows on the cobblestones" title="cobblestone.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 id="ethics-in-street-photography"> Ethics in street photography</h2><p> I&#39;m not going to sugarcoat it: Street photography is intrusive. Photographing people candidly usually means that you do not have their permission beforehand. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/3_smiley_face_soho.jpg?ssl=1" alt="smiley face hat man walking" title="3_smiley_face_soho.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> To do street photography, you will need to come to terms with this. Every time you hit the shutter, there is a chance that your subject will be bothered. Some won&#39;t mind, but some will.</p><p> That is the <a aria-label="moral cost of street photography (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/street-photography-exploitative-vs-respect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">moral cost of street photography</a> . Most of us do it because we like people, and we like exploring, and we like capturing culture. The camera is just a way to bring back moments that we see and enjoy. The images we take have value – both current and historical. When you look at images from the 1920s, 1950s, 1970s, or even from 15 years ago, which are the most interesting? Usually, it&#39;s the ones that include people and culture. Those are the photographs that so many viewers find fascinating, because they offer lots of cultural value.</p><p> However, it&#39;s up to you to decide whether street photography is worth it. Yes, it offers benefits – but the cost is real, too.</p><h2 id="how-to-get-over-your-fear-of-photographing-people"> How to get over your fear of photographing people</h2><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/7-steps-to-get-over-your-fear-of-street-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="Fear (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Fear</a> is one of the toughest obstacles to overcome for street photographers. Beginners often think, “What if my subject sees me? How will they feel? Will they be mad? How will they react?”</p><p> But an important fact to keep in mind is that getting caught doesn&#39;t have to be that bad.</p><p> Think about the first time that a comedian bombs on stage. Once it happens, it&#39;s over, and they no longer need to worry. Similarly, someone <em>will</em> see you take their picture, and it&#39;s important that you speak to them. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/4_shades_of_red.jpg?ssl=1" alt="woman's arm" title="4_shades_of_red.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> (Keep in mind that, when you do street photography right, most people won&#39;t notice. But occasionally, they will.)</p><p> When someone asks you what you are doing, be confident and comfortable. I say that I am a photographer carrying out a project capturing the culture and people of New York, and I thought they looked fabulous (flattery is key!). If they continue to question me, I will explain more; I&#39;ll tell them that I did not mean to make them uncomfortable and that I&#39;m happy to delete the image if they prefer. Only twice have I ever had to delete a photograph. Those are pretty good odds. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/joe_soho.jpg?ssl=1" alt="man with coffee walking" title="joe_soho.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> By the way, if someone catches you, own up to it, but don&#39;t be combative. Even if it is in your legal right to photograph on the street, don&#39;t use that as your argument. You don&#39;t need to argue at all. And no matter what, keep a smile on your face.</p><p> Keep in mind that the stealthier you try to act, the weirder you can actually look. Sometimes, being obvious and taking photos in a direct way can be the least confrontational strategy. The more obvious you look, the less people will think that you could possibly be doing something wrong. If you were, why would you be so obvious?</p><p> Finally, consider starting somewhere busy, such as a fair or a market. It&#39;s a great way to get over the initial hump because you&#39;ll be less noticeable – and as you improve, you can move on to different places.</p><h2 id="is-street-photography-legal-street-shooting-and-the-law"> Is street photography legal? Street shooting and the law </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/5_police_manhattan_and_brooklyn_bridges.jpg?ssl=1" alt="New York City bridges" title="5_police_manhattan_and_brooklyn_bridges.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> <em>Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. Do not hold me (or Digital Photography School) accountable for what I have written below. These are my own beliefs based on my research. Do your own research and familiarize yourself with the laws in your area.</em></p><p> In certain locations, street photography without permission is illegal. Some places make it completely impossible to do street photography, while in other places photographers may be able to ignore the laws. In some countries, street photographers continue to take candid images, but only where the person&#39;s face is unrecognizable.</p><p> In the US and the UK, there is no right to privacy in public. This means that you can legally take photographs of anyone in a public place. Note that the definition of “public place” may vary from one country to the next, but it does generally include parks, sidewalks, roads, and outdoor common areas of office buildings. Most indoor locations, on the other hand, would be considered private places, such as shops, churches, schools, and office buildings. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/graffiti_selfie.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Graffiti selfie" title="graffiti_selfie.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> In the US and the UK, you can use photographs taken in public places for artistic purposes <em>without</em> the need for a model release. This means you can sell street shots as fine art prints or as illustrations for books or cards. However, you cannot use these images for commercial or advertising purposes without a model release from every person in the scene. You cannot use the images to promote a product, and you cannot use them in a way that may insinuate something false about the subject.</p><p> Legal rights aside, it can also be smart to research the locals&#39; friendliness toward street photographers. In some locations, it is much easier to photograph people, while in other locations, people may be much more confrontational. One of the reasons New York is such a great place for street photography is because the people are used to seeing cameras. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/6_canal_street.jpg?ssl=1" alt="woman walking through the crowd" title="6_canal_street.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> You should also assess each person before you snap their photo. It&#39;s usually not worth it to photograph anyone who looks very angry or who might have some mental disability. Use your judgment, and if your gut says no, then wait for the next shot. There are a lot of opportunities out there.</p><h2 id="getting-started-with-street-photography-3-simple-tips"> Getting started with street photography: 3 simple tips</h2><p> Later on, I&#39;ll discuss more technical street photography concepts, but I want to start you off with a few of the most helpful tips.</p><h3 id="1-find-a-good-spot-and-wait"> 1. Find a good spot and wait</h3><p> This is the best <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-tips-for-the-aspiring-street-photographer/" target="_blank" aria-label="street photography tip (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">street photography tip</a> I can give you:</p><p> Look for a good location. And when you find one, just wait.</p><p> If you only shoot while walking, you will come across many wonderful locations – but you&#39;ll only give yourself a brief moment to capture the right image. Instead, find a nice location…and then wait for the perfect moment. By hanging out in one area, you&#39;ll be able to focus your attention on the scene, plus you&#39;ll be ready with your camera.</p><p> Also, if you lie in wait, people will enter your personal space, not the other way around. That way, you can feel more comfortable shooting (and your subjects will feel more comfortable, too). </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/7_pushups_rucker_park.jpg?ssl=1" alt="boy doing push ups" title="7_pushups_rucker_park.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 id="2-after-shooting-keep-the-camera-up"> 2. After shooting, keep the camera up</h3><p> Grab your camera, then take a photo.</p><p> What did you do with your hand? Most photographers, the moment they&#39;ve captured an image, will drop their arm down and let their camera dangle. And <em>this</em> is what tips people off; it clearly indicates that <em>you have taken their photo</em> .</p><p> So make a conscious effort to adjust your behavior. After you capture an image, don&#39;t drop your arm. Instead, hold the camera in place until the subject leaves the scene. That way, your subject will think you were just photographing the background and that they were in the way.</p><h3 id="3-photograph-where-you-live"> 3. Photograph where you live</h3><p> What are the best locations for street photography? Most beginners believe that, to get great shots, they need an “interesting” area to shoot, like New York City or London.</p><p> But here&#39;s the truth: You don&#39;t need a highly populated area to take interesting street images. The best photographers can take good images anywhere.</p><p> If you&#39;re struggling to photograph where you live, try a little exercise: List the <em>least</em> interesting areas within 20 miles of your home. Then go there and force yourself to figure out how to take good photographs. You&#39;ll find it tough at first – but pretty soon, you&#39;ll be capturing some great pictures!</p><h2 id="the-best-street-photography-equipment"> The best street photography equipment </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/8_yosemite_soho.jpg?ssl=1" alt="person carrying an iMac box" title="8_yosemite_soho.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> You can do street photography with <em>any</em> type of <a aria-label="camera (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-camera-for-street-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">camera</a> . You can do it with a DSLR, a mirrorless camera, a point and shoot camera, and even a smartphone. You can do it with any type of <a aria-label="lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lens-for-street-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">lens</a> , too: a heavy zoom, a tiny prime, or something in between.</p><p> That said, different equipment does offer specific advantages. A zoom lens will let you capture the more obvious opportunities at different distances but will be heavier, more noticeable, and more cumbersome. A prime lens will restrict you to a single focal length but will also be light, freeing, and fun to use.</p><p> In fact, prime lenses actually offer a big advantage: you will begin to see the world more intuitively with one focal length. While the limitation will stop you from capturing certain shots, you will become even better at capturing images within the constraints of that focal length. Ultimately, you&#39;ll become quicker and more spontaneous with your camera.</p><p> Also, traveling light and compact will give you a lot more flexibility, especially in places where a large camera stands out. In my experience, lighter cameras and lenses are more fun to shoot with, and they let you enjoy photography in situations you normally wouldn&#39;t take a bulky DSLR setup.</p><h2 id="the-best-street-photography-camera-settings"> The best street photography camera settings </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/9_sample_sale.jpg?ssl=1" alt="people waiting in line street photography" title="9_sample_sale.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> There is no one correct way to do street photography, and many of the best shooters use completely different methods. However, you&#39;ll want to consider a handful of factors (and if you&#39;ve been photographing in a specific way for a long time, I&#39;d advise testing out other methods, if only to push you out of your comfort zone).</p><p> Below, I share my favorite <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-street-photography-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="street photography camera settings (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">street photography camera settings</a> , starting with:</p><h3 id="aperture"> Aperture</h3><p> In street photography, you usually want a narrow <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> for increased <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> . A deep depth of field will let you capture a variety of situations on the fly, plus it will prevent you from missing focus on fast-moving candid subjects. And it can provide beneficial context and storytelling, too.</p><p> While I won&#39;t recommend one single aperture, consider stopping down to around f/8 or f/11. Assuming your subject is a few feet away and you&#39;re shooting with a wide-to-standard focal length, this will give you plenty of depth of field to keep your subject sharp, even if you don&#39;t have time to focus properly (see the zone focusing method, explained below). </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/10_bike_messenger.jpg?ssl=1" alt="man riding a bike through a street" title="10_bike_messenger.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 id="shutter-speed"> Shutter speed</h3><p> Most street photos feature moving people. You&#39;ll need a fast <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> to keep them sharp.</p><p> I prefer to shoot at 1/250s in the shade and 1/400s or 1/500s in direct sunlight. But if I need to, I&#39;ll drop to 1/160s and sometimes 1/125s.</p><p> Note that your minimum shutter speed should depend on your own stability (eg, if you&#39;re standing still, you&#39;ll be able to shoot much better than if you&#39;re moving). It should also depend on the speed of your subject; a bicyclist or jogger needs a faster shutter speed versus a walker.</p><p> Also, <em>always</em> peek at your photos afterward to check the sharpness. That way, you can learn as you go along.</p><h3 id="iso"> ISO</h3><p> You&#39;re trying to squeeze as much depth of field as possible out of your camera. You&#39;re trying to keep the shutter speed fast.</p><p> To do this, you&#39;ll need to boost your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> .</p><p> I will typically set my camera to ISO 400 in sunlight, 800 in light shade, 1600 in dark shade, 3200 at dusk, and 6400 at night. With entry-level digital cameras, I would probably drop by a stop (to 3200 at night, 1600 at dusk, and so on).</p><p> Fortunately, in street photography, noise often looks good, though test your camera to see how the images appear at high ISOs (and do some prints to see how the noise appears on paper, too). With newer cameras, you can easily go to ISO 1600, 3200, and higher. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/11_canal_street.jpg?ssl=1" alt="man working outside market" title="11_canal_street.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 id="camera-mode"> Camera mode</h3><p> What&#39;s the best camera mode for street photography? You can shoot in <a aria-label="Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority</a> , or even <a aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> – but I personally prefer Shutter Priority.</p><p> You see, you&#39;ll often be shooting into the sun one moment and away from it the next, and if you&#39;re shooting in Manual mode, you&#39;ll need to change your settings every time you turn your camera. It&#39;s much more efficient to set your camera to Shutter Priority, dial in your preferred shutter speed, and start shooting.</p><p> That said, in consistent lighting situations, when shooting indoors, or when <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/in-the-dark-10-tips-for-street-night-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="shooting at night (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shooting at night</a> , I will switch to Manual mode. And when I want a very shallow depth of field, I&#39;ll switch to Aperture Priority, choose a low ISO, and set my aperture to f/2.8 or so.</p><h2 id="composition-in-street-photography"> Composition in street photography </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/12_blonde_soho.jpg?ssl=1" alt="woman in bright sunlight" title="12_blonde_soho.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Capturing perfect street photography compositions is difficult – but it&#39;s also essential, because a good composition is <em>key</em> to a great street photo.</p><p> That&#39;s why I&#39;d urge you to compose your street photographs the same way you&#39;d compose a landscape image. Assess the scene and arrange all of the elements together. Every element counts, no matter what it is; the best street photographers have a way of bringing everything together in just the right way.</p><p> Sometimes the subject is all that&#39;s important, and you&#39;ll want to frame it or blur the background away while forgetting about everything else. A lot of photographers will shoot this way 100% of the time, especially when first starting out, but that&#39;s a mistake. The subject matters, but the environment matters, too.</p><p> Try to combine the main subject with other elements to create a more complex composition. Can you create relationships between subjects to add new meaning to a scene? Whether or not you decide to make the surroundings prominent, you always need to be aware of them. It&#39;s better to intentionally discard background elements than to not notice them at all. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/construction_workers.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Construction workers through a screen" title="construction_workers.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 id="lighting-in-street-photography"> Lighting in street photography</h2><p> In street photography, you should <em>always</em> keep an eye out for your main light sources. How is the light hitting your subject, and where is it located in relation to that subject? How is it hitting the background? What color is the light, and are there multiple light sources?</p><p> However, it is important to understand that there is no <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/bad-light-street-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="best light for street photography (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link"><em>best</em> light for street photography</a> . The harsh midday light will be just as beautiful and interesting as the warm dawn or dusk light. What&#39;s important is that you make the most out of the light in any location.</p><p> Some photographers will use a portable flash to illuminate their subjects and separate them from the background. This can create a great look, but keep in mind that flashing a stranger in the face can be very confrontational.</p><p> Also, when the flash is too strong, it can take away from the feeling of reality; this is a look that some photographers dislike and some photographers desire, so it&#39;s a decision you&#39;ll have to make. If you&#39;re going for a surreal look, then a flash could be a big asset.</p><h2 id="advanced-street-photography-tips"> Advanced street photography tips </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13_youth_soho.jpg?ssl=1" alt="person smoking in Soho" title="13_youth_soho.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> In this section, I&#39;ll share some high-level street photography advice. If you&#39;re looking to take your street shooting beyond the basics, then pay close attention.</p><h3 id="1-look-for-facial-expressions-and-gestures"> 1. Look for facial expressions and gestures</h3><p> Scenes with people just walking down the street or standing in place are <em>not enough</em> . To take your images to the next level, you must photograph people with <a aria-label="strong facial expressions or gestures in their body (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/importance-capturing-gesture-emotion-street-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">strong facial expressions or gestures</a> .</p><p> As humans, we recognize what others are feeling through their facial expressions. So when you&#39;re out shooting, one of the first things you should be doing is paying attention to people&#39;s expressions. You can also get subtle cues from a person&#39;s body, so keep an eye out for how a person gestures through their body, hands, legs, and feet.</p><p> Then, when the expression or gesture is at its peak, take a photo!</p><h3 id="2-seek-out-imperfection"> 2. Seek out imperfection</h3><p> The beauty of street photography is often in its imperfections. I discussed this at the start of the article, but it bears repeating: you do not need to make your photos perfect in every way. Strong grain (or digital noise), an image that is slightly askew, an element that is slightly in the way, and poor lighting can all make an image imperfect – but they can also make it more real.</p><p> While each of the latter items have the ability to ruin a photo, they&#39;ll sometimes do just enough to make your image feel like a natural moment. So while you should always aim for technical mastery, realize that imperfections can be beneficial and even necessary. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/14_selfie_soho.jpg?ssl=1" alt="kids taking a selfie" title="14_selfie_soho.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 id="3-try-zone-focusing"> 3. Try zone focusing</h3><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/ultimate-guide-to-zone-focusing-for-candid-street-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="Zone focusing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Zone focusing</a> is simple to learn, fairly difficult to master, and painful to explain in writing (it&#39;s much easier to just show someone how to do it). Basically, zone focusing is a strategy where you manually focus a set distance into the scene, then take photos without adjusting your focus point at all.</p><p> You start by prefocusing your camera to a certain distance. I typically choose between 8 and 10 feet away, which is where I like to capture my subjects. Then, when subjects enter the prefocused area, you can click the shutter <em>without</em> fiddling with your autofocus. The fraction of a second that zone focusing saves, and the added freedom this allows, will take you a <em>long</em> way.</p><p> I usually only zone focus at 35mm and wider.为什么？ The farther you zoom in, the more accurate you have to be with your focus to get your subject sharp; it becomes very difficult to zone focus over 50mm. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/jerry_delakas_astor_newsman.jpg?ssl=1" alt="man at a newsstand " title="jerry_delakas_astor_newsman.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> When starting out, zone focusing is very easy to screw up. If you do not gauge the distances correctly, you can miss focus entirely. It is much easier to zone focus in bright sunlight, because with a 35mm or wider focal length and an aperture of f/11 to f/16, you&#39;ll have a <em>huge</em> depth of field. Even if you miss the focus by a bit, your important subjects will be sharp.</p><p> Eventually, you can learn to zone focus in darker situations and at apertures up to f/2. It&#39;s much more difficult, so take your time getting there, but it&#39;s very possible. When zone focusing at shallower apertures, you can even learn to move the focus ring without looking, so if you are focused at 10 feet and a subject appears 5 feet away, you can adjust the focus instinctively to that distance without even looking (that&#39;s how sports shooters did it before autofocus existed!). It takes a lot of practice, but it&#39;s very possible to learn!</p><h3 id="4-develop-your-ideas"> 4. Develop your ideas </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/15_cellphones.jpg?ssl=1" alt="people in chairs with smartphones" title="15_cellphones.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> The hardest part of street photography is figuring out what you actually want to capture and create. What do you want your photographs to show? How do you want them to look?</p><p> These questions may seem difficult – or impossible – to answer, and that&#39;s okay. The more you shoot, the more you&#39;ll understand what you are drawn to. You&#39;ll see subjects that you are attracted to, and you&#39;ll begin to seek them out when you are photographing. Occasionally, you will have big ideas right away, but it will often take a lot of time for these ideas to grow and develop naturally.</p><p> In other words:</p><p> It&#39;s okay to shoot first and ask questions later.</p><h3 id="5-spend-a-lot-of-time-editing-your-street-photography"> 5. Spend a lot of time editing your street photography </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/16_soaring_eagle_grand_central.jpg?ssl=1" alt="soaring eagle grand central" title="16_soaring_eagle_grand_central.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Want to become a good street photographer? <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/13-steps-for-editing-street-photography-in-lightroom-from-start-to-finish/" target="_blank" aria-label="Editing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Editing</a> is half the battle.</p><p> When you&#39;re out photographing, it is best to be spontaneous and to get lost in the moment. Editing is where you should really think about your work in a larger setting. It&#39;s where you can explore themes and ideas as they start to pop up in your photography. It&#39;s when you can combine similar images to create a larger story. It&#39;s where you can develop a style in both look and content.</p><p> Therefore, the time that you spend editing will help you when you are out shooting.</p><p> Consider using Lightroom&#39;s star rating and collection system to organize your best work and to group photos with similar themes. Find patterns in your work and images that play well off each other, then create collections. Constantly add photos, remove photos, and change their order.</p><p> When editing your work, it is important to consider the value of realism. An image that is so over-edited that it looks fake will kill the spirit of street photography. Remember, your images don&#39;t have to be perfect. You do not need every detail in the shadows and highlights. While you should certainly do post-production, always take a step back and consider whether or not you&#39;ve overcooked your shot.</p><h3 id="6-learn-from-the-street-photography-masters"> 6.

View the work of photographers who shoot in a variety of locations, including big cities, rural areas, and the suburbs. Read street photography books on a consistent basis. There are many affordable street photography books (and many expensive ones, too). Your local library can be a big help!</p><p> Pay special attention to the street photographers whose work you don&#39;t like. Street photos are often different and weird, and it can be impossible to truly get a sense of what a photographer is trying to portray by seeing just a few photographs. Read about the history and location of the photographer, look through as much of their portfolio as you can, and then try to figure out what they&#39;re all about. You may find yourself with a completely new appreciation for the photographer, and you&#39;ll see things in their work that initially went right over your head. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/18_mona_5th.jpg?ssl=1" alt="person walking through the crowd street photography" title="18_mona_5th.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Here is a list of photographers to research when starting out.

And I&#39;m <em>also</em> going to explain how those mistakes can be fixed, so that the next time you&#39;re out shooting, you know exactly what to do (and what to avoid).</p><p> Make sense? Let&#39;s dive right in, starting with the most common landscape photography mistake of all:</p><h2 data-section id="a-lack-of-stability"> 1. A lack of stability</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256214" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.33%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="995" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-10.jpg?resize=1500%2C995&#038;ssl=1" alt="8 Common Landscape Photography Mistakes (+ How to Fix Them)" class="wp-image-256214" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-10.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-10.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-10.jpg?resize=600%2C398&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-10.jpg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-10.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-10.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-10.jpg?resize=717%2C476&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> In landscape photography, you usually want your images to be sharp all the way through, from front to back. To achieve this effect, you must use a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="narrow aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">narrow aperture</a> , which in turn will reduce your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> and make your images <em>very</em> prone to blur.</p><p> Hence, many landscape photographers return home after shooting, only to find their photos plagued by consistent blurriness.</p><p> There&#39;s a simple way to deal with this problem, however: Use a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-buying-a-tripod/" target="_blank" aria-label="tripod (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">tripod</a> ! This is especially important if you&#39;re shooting in low light, but in all honesty, I recommend you take your tripod with you <em>everywhere</em> .</p><p> Now, there are tripods and there are <em>tripods</em> . For landscape photography, you might want to invest in a more heavy-duty option; while small, lightweight tripods might do the trick for a while, if you are shooting in the wind, you risk tripod shake (plus, your tripod might get blown over). A good tripod will also last a long time and can take a beating, so buy the best tripod you can afford and keep your camera as still as possible when shooting.</p><p> Another good piece of equipment to buy is a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/remote-shutter-vs-delayed-shutter/" target="_blank" aria-label="remote release (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">remote release</a> . You don&#39;t need one of the expensive ones with a built-in intervalometer; just a simple remote shutter is fine. Once you are set up and ready to take your shot, step back from the camera and press the shutter button. There will be no vibration from you hitting the camera shutter button, and your image will be nice and sharp.</p><p> (If you don&#39;t want to purchase a remote release, you could use the self-timer, instead.)</p><h2 data-section id="not-getting-the-horizon-straight"> 2. Not getting the horizon straight</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256215" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1001" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1" alt="8 Common Landscape Photography Mistakes (+ How to Fix Them)" class="wp-image-256215" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-4.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-4.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-4.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-4.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Many a good landscape image has been ruined by a skewed horizon. And while this can be fixed in Photoshop or Lightroom, you might lose some details along the way – which is why I highly recommend you deal with the horizon <em>in</em> camera, not in post-processing.</p><p> You can use a few different tools to make sure your horizon is straight. You might try switching on the grid in your camera viewfinder, then always taking the time to line up the horizon with a horizontal gridline. Some tripod heads even have a built-in spirit level, so ensure this is level and your horizon should be fine.</p><p> Alternatively, you can purchase a level that mounts to your camera hot shoe. Just connect the level, then do a quick check before taking your photo.</p><h2 data-section id="shooting-only-in-landscape-format"> 3. Shooting only in landscape format</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256216" style="width:480px"><span class="space" style="width:480px; padding-top:125%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="480" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-9.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="8 Common Landscape Photography Mistakes (+ How to Fix Them)" class="wp-image-256216" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-9.jpg?resize=480%2C600&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-9.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-9.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-9.jpg?resize=717%2C896&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/landscape-photography-mistakes-9.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Landscape photography is, well, <em>landscape</em> photography – so photographers assume they should shoot in landscape (horizontal) format.</p><p> And generally speaking, this is a good idea. The <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/portrait-or-landscape-orientation/" target="_blank" aria-label="horizontal orientation (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">horizontal orientation</a> emphasizes the sweep of a scene, and it can lend a sense of vastness to the shot.</p><p> Except, in some cases, a portrait orientation (vertical) can work well, too – sometimes better than a horizontal orientation. Think of a forest scene. The trees stretch into the sky, so a horizontal format will limit their height rather than show it off, and create a less interesting photo in the process.</p><p> Bottom line: If the subject&#39;s shape is more vertical than horizontal, you should try it in the portrait format, as it may give the composition a dynamic presence. And if you&#39;re not sure whether to shoot vertical or horizontal, just do both and sort out the issues later!</p><h2 data-section id="forgetting-about-the-aperture"> 4.

And many landscape photographers forget this.</p><p> You see, aperture helps determine your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> (ie, the amount of the scene that appears sharp). And by carefully considering the depth of field, you can create different compositional effects.</p><p> The moment you start setting up a composition, you should be thinking about your depth of field. Ask yourself: Do I want everything from the foreground to the background to be in focus? Generally, in landscape photography, this will be the case, but if you&#39;d prefer to keep certain areas soft, you should decide early on.</p><p> If you <em>do</em> want foreground-to-background sharpness, make sure your aperture is f/8, f/11, or higher. If you shoot at f/2.8 or f/4 and you focus on the foreground, the background will be out of focus, and the middle of your scene will be soft. And once you&#39;ve taken a shallow depth of field photo, it cannot be fixed in Photoshop.</p><h2 data-section id="shooting-using-the-cameras-landscape-mode"> 5.

Rather, I&#39;d like to emphasize the importance of originality. Do you want to go home with a shot just like everyone else&#39;s? Or do you want a shot that&#39;s uniquely <em>yours</em> ?</p><p> Of course, in certain situations, the best composition or vantage point is at one particular spot, and all the photographers will congregate in that area. That&#39;s fine; take a shot from there to start. But then look for other places to get a great shot, too.</p><p> (Pro tip: It&#39;s a good idea to scout a scene before you shoot it. Go and take a walk around the area the day before, look at where the sun will be setting, and decide on your position. Don&#39;t simply follow the crowd.)</p><h2 data-section id="including-unnecessary-negative-space"> 7.

And if you&#39;re photographing an ocean but you just point your camera at the water and shoot, you&#39;ll end up with some boring water and sky, not a coherent, striking photo.</p><p> Instead, identify what <em>matters</em> to you in a scene – and then emphasize it in your shot.</p><p> Of course, you don&#39;t need to fill the frame with your subject; it&#39;s perfectly acceptable to show both your subject and the beauty that surrounds it. But if you&#39;re struggling to highlight the subject, do try moving closer or using a longer lens. And check your composition afterward, asking yourself: What stands out? What will the viewer notice? And what do I <em>want</em> the viewer to notice?</p><p> If <em>what</em> the viewer will notice and what you <em>want</em> the viewer to notice differ, then you&#39;ve probably made a mistake.</p><h2 data-section id="landscape-photography-mistakes-final-words"> Landscape photography mistakes: final words</h2><p> Well, there you have it:</p><p> The eight landscape photography mistakes to avoid the next time you&#39;re out shooting.</p><p> When you&#39;re in the field with your camera, run through these mistakes.

Then let&#39;s dive right in, starting with:</p><h2 id="1-use-window-light-for-a-flattering-effect"> 1. Use window light for a flattering effect</h2><p> Great dog photography starts with great lighting, and for me, that&#39;s <em>window light</em> .</p><p> Window light is beautiful, it&#39;s (generally) soft, and it&#39;s great for brightening your subject while letting the background fall into shadow.</p><p> To see the power of window light, take a look at these two images: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/with-without-window-light.jpg?ssl=1" alt="With without window light - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="with-without-window-light.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Not only does the window light brighten up key parts of the dog – while letting other parts fall into shadow for a more three-dimensional effect – it also lets you use a <a aria-label="low ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">low ISO</a> and a faster <a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> , which will give you sharper, higher-quality images. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/photo-with-window-light.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Photo with window light - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="photo-with-window-light.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> By the way, if you prefer to use flashes or studio strobes, that&#39;s okay, too! Just make sure to cover them up with a <a aria-label="modifier (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/a-beginners-guide-to-light-modifiers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">modifier</a> for that soft, flattering effect.</p><h2 id="2-in-a-pinch-use-your-phone-light"> 2. In a pinch, use your phone light</h2><p> While window light (or carefully modified artificial light) is ideal for dog photography, it&#39;s not always feasible to shoot near a window.</p><p> After all, you might be lounging around the house, notice your dog doing something cute, and want to capture it on camera. In such a situation, you simply cannot move the dog near a window for that perfect lighting! Nor will you have time to set up some flashes or strobes.</p><p> So what do you do? The next time you&#39;re faced by a difficult lighting scenario, try whipping out your smartphone, turning on the flashlight, and pointing it at your dog. Test out different angles (45-degree lighting and other forms of sidelight tend to work great!). </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/photography-camera-light.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Photography camera light - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="photography-camera-light.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 id="3-create-a-stunning-tinfoil-background"> 3. Create a stunning tinfoil background</h2><p> Are you a fan of beautiful round <a aria-label="bokeh (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">bokeh</a> ? In my experience, a lovely bokeh effect can take a mediocre dog photo and give it an eye-catching, professional look – but stunning bokeh isn&#39;t always so easy to create.</p><p> Enter an amazing DIY dog portrait tool:</p><p> Tinfoil!</p><p> Simply take some tinfoil, scrunch it up, and unfold it. Position the tinfoil behind the dog, shine a light on it, and – voila! – you&#39;ll get a jaw-dropping bokeh effect: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/tin-foil-bokeh.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Tin foil bokeh " title="tin-foil-bokeh.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> This technique does require a bit of practice, but to get started, experiment with a wide <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> (f/2.8 is a good starting point), and be sure to move your dog out in front of the foil (the greater the separation between the dog and the foil, the better the background blur).</p><p> I&#39;d also recommend you use a short telephoto or zoom lens, preferably above 50mm, and make sure that your foil completely <em>fills</em> the background. Finally, if you&#39;re struggling to get bright-enough bokeh, try lighting the background separately from the dog (here, your smartphone can be a big help!).</p><h2 id="4-shoot-dog-reflection-photos"> 4. Shoot dog reflection photos</h2><p> This dog photography tip may be a bit unconventional, but it&#39;s about as simple as they come, and it&#39;s a great way to capture creative dog shots.</p><p> The next time you&#39;re near some water, such as a puddle or a pond, ask your dog to sit. Then carefully angle yourself so that <em>only</em> the dog&#39;s reflection and feet appear in the photo (you may need to get down low).</p><p> Then, in post-processing, you can flip the image to create a fantastic illusion: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dog-reflected-puddle.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Dog reflected puddle - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="dog-reflected-puddle.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Cool, right? Of course, you can always experiment with zooming in for reflection headshots, including more of the dog in the photo, and so on.</p><h2 id="5-use-a-mirror-to-create-negative-space"> 5. Use a mirror to create negative space</h2><p> Minimalist dog photos are beautiful; the dog generally takes up a small portion of the frame while the rest of the shot is covered with empty space (eg, a white wall or an out-of-focus foreground element).</p><p> Now, you can always create <a aria-label="minimalist shots (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/photographic-minimalism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">minimalist shots</a> by working in a large, empty environment, but what do you do if you&#39;re photographing in your house? How can you capture minimalist shots with cluttered surroundings?</p><p> It&#39;s simple: Bring in a mirror.</p><p> Then widen your aperture to create a narrow <a aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> , zoom out to include the dog small in the frame, then put the mirror close to your camera lens. Make sure that the mirror <em>doesn&#39;t</em> cover the dog but <em>does</em> cover the rest of the frame.</p><p> That way, if your aperture is wide enough and the mirror is close enough to your camera lens, the mirror surface will be obscured, giving you a beautiful stretch of <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/negative-space-in-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="negative space (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">negative space</a> : </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/white-space-dog.jpg?ssl=1" alt="White space dog - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="white-space-dog.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 id="6-use-fairy-lights-to-spice-up-your-dog-photography"> 6. Use fairy lights to spice up your dog photography</h2><p> Fairy lights are cheap, they&#39;re simple to work with, and – when used carefully – they can create stunning bokeh effects: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dog-on-fairy-lights.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Dog on fairy lights - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="dog-on-fairy-lights.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> So grab some fairy lights (Christmas lights can work, too!), then position them in your photo background. You can also have your dog sit on top of them, then shoot down from above.</p><p> For the best results, make sure you use a wide aperture. And if the fairy lights aren&#39;t sufficiently blurred, try moving them farther into the background and/or bringing the dog forward.</p><h2 id="7-use-perspex-to-create-beautiful-foreground-reflections"> 7. Use perspex to create beautiful foreground reflections</h2><p> Reflections are a great way to enhance your dog photos. And you can get especially cool effects by positioning a reflective object close to your camera lens, then tilting the object until it creates a reflection of the dog.</p><p> That&#39;s how I captured this image, which features interesting reflections along the left-hand side of the composition: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dog-reflection-hack.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Dog reflection hack - 10 Amazing Camera Hacks for Dog Photography" title="dog-reflection-hack.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> I like to use perspex for this trick – I carry a square of it wherever I go – but you can get a similar effect using a smartphone!</p><h2 id="8-use-a-prism-to-create-stunning-effects"> 8. Use a prism to create stunning effects</h2><p> Handheld prisms will create an effect similar to perspex, except the result tends to look far more psychedelic and feature interesting colors: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/camera-hack-prism.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Camera hack prism" title="camera-hack-prism.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> So if you&#39;re after an especially <em>wild</em> effect, grab a handheld prism, then try placing it between the dog and the camera lens. Feel free to experiment with different angles and different distances – depending on the position of the prism, you&#39;ll get all sorts of interesting results.</p><h2 id="9-shoot-into-the-light-for-a-flare-effect"> 9.

In this article, I share my top tips for stunning fall photography. I explain:</p><ul><li> How you can use a simple filter to bring out lovely autumn colors</li><li> How you can adjust your white balance setting for gorgeous warm images</li><li> How you can create amazing shots by chasing the right light</li><li> Much more!</li></ul><p> Ready to become an autumn photography master? Then let&#39;s dive right in!</p><h2 data-section id="use-a-polarizing-filter-to-enhance-colors"> 1. Use a polarizing filter to enhance colors</h2><p> First things first:</p><p> If you want to capture rich, <em>bold</em> fall colors, then you should start by purchasing a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-and-buy-polarizing-filters/" target="_blank" aria-label="polarizing filter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">polarizing filter</a> .</p><p> Polarizers go on the front of the lens and cut down on reflected light. Reflections on wet and/or waxy leaves reduce color intensity, so by blocking this unwanted light from reaching your camera sensor, your fall photos will get a saturation boost.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-240789" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.47%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="997" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-9.jpg?resize=1500%2C997&#038;ssl=1" alt="fall photography red leaves on a green background" class="wp-image-240789" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-9.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-9.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-9.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-9.jpg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-9.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-9.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-9.jpg?resize=717%2C477&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Make sure you purchase a high-quality filter, though; a cheap polarizer won&#39;t do its job effectively and can introduce annoying color casts. So pay for a well-made option, such as a <a aria-label="circular polarizer offered by Hoya (opens in a new tab)" href="https://geni.us/dPSHoyaCircPolaFltr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">circular polarizer offered by Hoya</a> .</p><p> Note: The polarizer&#39;s diameter must match the diameter of your lens. Pick the lens you plan to use most in the fall, figure out its diameter, then buy a corresponding polarizer.</p><p> Also, bear in mind that polarizers do reduce the total amount of light hitting the camera sensor. To compensate, your camera will be forced to lengthen its <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> , which can introduce <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-avoid-camera-shake/" target="_blank" aria-label="camera shake (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">camera shake</a> . To prevent this, I recommend shooting with a good tripod!</p><h2 data-section id="shoot-during-the-golden-hours"> 2. Shoot during the golden hours</h2><p> The hour or so after sunrise and the hour or so just before sunset are known as the <em><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-photograph-golden-hour/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">golden hours</a></em> . If you&#39;ve ever spent time observing the evening light, you&#39;ll know why: When the sun is low in the sky, it casts beautiful, soft, golden light across the land – light that looks amazing when illuminating fall subjects.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-240791" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="fall photography sunrise scene with mist" class="wp-image-240791" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-2.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Golden-hour light offers several major benefits. It&#39;s soft, so it helps you capture photos with lots of beautiful details. And it&#39;s warm, so your images will have a stunning golden color cast.</p><p> Personally, I&#39;m a huge fan of how the low sun accentuates red and gold colors. You can capture breathtaking fall landscapes, close-up details, fall portraits, and so much more.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-240793" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-6.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="fall photography misty forest scene" class="wp-image-240793" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-6.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-6.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-6.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-6.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-6.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-6.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you can get up early enough, morning can actually be a bit better than evening.

Some light sources – such as the low sun – produce very warm, orangish light, while other light sources – such as artificial flash – produce very cold, bluish light. But when you dial in the correct white balance, you <em>neutralize</em> (ie, remove) this warm or cold result. Successful neutralization helps the underlying colors shine through and ensures the photo more accurately represents its subject.</p><p> Generally speaking, it&#39;s a good idea to neutralize color casts, so it can be helpful to work with your camera&#39;s white balance presets or even to <a aria-label="set the white balance using a gray card (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-a-gray-card-to-get-more-accurate-exposures-and-color/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">set the white balance using a gray card</a> .

Aim to portray the chaos</h2><p> Fall scenes tend to be pretty chaotic. They often feature waving branches, fallen leaves, colorful shrubs…the list goes on.</p><p> And in photography, chaos is generally a bad thing. Many photographers spend long minutes working each scene so they can <em>reduce</em> the chaos. After all, chaos distracts the viewer and prevents them from looking toward the main subject, right?</p><p> Not always! If you can <em>embrace</em> the chaos, you can capture unique images that go beyond the standard fall shots. Try to carefully compose your shots so that all the elements fit together like a puzzle. And see if you can intersperse different colors throughout the frame – some reds here, some greens there.</p><p> In “chaos” shots, the goal is to think in terms of abstract geometry.

It doesn&#39;t require specialized knowledge, either; you can handle all your fall photo editing in an intuitive program such as Lightroom.</p><p> I&#39;d recommend first adjusting the exposure to make sure you capture the level of detail you&#39;re after. If you notice any detailless shadows or highlights, use the tonal sliders (ie, the highlights, shadows, blacks, and whites sliders) to recover the missing data.</p><p> Then make some contrast changes. This will often look nice and add plenty of punch, but don&#39;t go overboard. Too much contrast will start to create unrealistic effects, which is absolutely <em>not</em> what you want.</p><p> Finally, experiment with different color intensity sliders. The Saturation slider, for instance, can boost the overall color intensity. The Vibrance slider, on the other hand, enhances cooler colors. And if you&#39;re feeling especially adventurous, you might even try tweaking individual colors (using <a aria-label="Lightroom's HSL panel (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-the-hsl-panel-in-lightroom-for-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Lightroom&#39;s HSL panel</a> or <a aria-label="Photoshop's Hue/Saturation adjustment layer (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-the-hue-saturation-adjustment-in-photoshop-a-video-tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Photoshop&#39;s Hue/Saturation adjustment layer</a> ).</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-240805" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:68.87%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1033" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-8.jpg?resize=1500%2C1033&#038;ssl=1" alt="hand holding up a fall leaf" class="wp-image-240805" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-8.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-8.jpg?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-8.jpg?resize=600%2C413&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-8.jpg?resize=768%2C529&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/fall-photography-8.jpg?resize=717%2C494&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><h2 data-section id="go-out-when-the-weather-is-bad"> 9.

Rain is a great way to add a melancholy mood, while snow can create uplifting vibes or a sadder, lonelier look (depending on how you approach and edit your photos). And fog pretty much always looks great, though if you want <em>really</em> powerful images, try to combine fog with repetition (such as lines of trees in a forest).</p><p> You do have to be careful, though. It&#39;s easy to get lost in heavy fog or snow, so always carry a phone and tell someone where you&#39;re going in advance. And bad weather can damage your camera, so make sure you carry a rain cover at all times. (I&#39;d also encourage you to carry a second cover that wraps around your camera bag and keeps it dry).</p><h2 data-section id="fall-photography-tips-final-words"> Fall photography tips: final words</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-256188" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:60.13%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="902" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fall-photography-109.jpg?resize=1500%2C902&#038;ssl=1" alt="9 Tips for Gorgeous Fall Photography" class="wp-image-256188" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fall-photography-109.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fall-photography-109.jpg?resize=300%2C180&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fall-photography-109.jpg?resize=600%2C361&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fall-photography-109.jpg?resize=768%2C462&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/fall-photography-109.jpg?resize=717%2C431&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Now that you&#39;ve finished this article, you&#39;re ready to capture some beautiful autumn images.</p><p> So have plenty of fun photographing the fall colors.

And in my experience, cameras don&#39;t like to come in contact with rocks. (Nor do lenses or <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-tripods-for-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="tripods (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">tripods</a> .)</p><p> So it&#39;s important when exploring a cave to keep your camera and lens well-covered and your tripod legs tucked in. I&#39;d encourage you to keep your gear packed away until you absolutely need it; you&#39;ll be in unfamiliar territory and walking on uneven surfaces. Sometimes, you&#39;ll be <em>crawling</em> . Bring a padded bag or backpack, and make sure your camera remains inside until you&#39;re ready to take a photo.</p><p> Caves also tend to be wet, and moisture often falls from the ceiling. So bring a hand towel or cloth to wipe down your camera. You might also consider draping it over your camera and lens when you&#39;re shooting. (If you&#39;re deeply worried about water damage, you could even use a rain cover.) Often, the water droplets will be carrying a number of minerals that are best cleaned off sooner rather than later.</p><h2 data-section id="bring-a-tripod"> 2. Bring a tripod</h2><p> Caves are extremely dark, which means that you need a longer <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> to capture a detailed <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure</a> .

On-camera flash photos tend to look flat and two-dimensional. With an off-camera flash, however, you can hold the flash off to the side, giving more depth to your images.

(Of course, you can mix several of these elements together, but it&#39;s important to understand them individually first.)</p><p> And I recommend you <em>start</em> by photographing fire as your subject, simply because it looks really, really cool.</p><p> With such fire shots, the main focus is on the flame (or the effects of it) and the detail that is shown within it. I&#39;m talking about shots like this, which feature clear flame detail:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-39812" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="399" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-13.jpg?resize=600%2C399&#038;ssl=1" alt="football on fire" class="wp-image-39812" title="DPS_Fire-13" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-13.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-13.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-13.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-13.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> So how do you capture such well-exposed, crisp flames? First, you&#39;ll need to use a fast-enough <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shutter speed</a> to freeze the flame&#39;s motion. What counts as “fast enough” is relative to what you&#39;re shooting, but start around 1/250s, then take some test shots and boost the shutter speed as necessary.</p><p> (Note: As your shutter speed increases, you&#39;ll need to use wider <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apertures</a> and higher <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ISOs</a> .)</p><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exposure</a> can be difficult, as your camera will often want to underexpose the flames to compensate for their incredible brightness.

Use fire as a light source</h2><p> Fire offers soft shadows and warm color, so it makes for a wonderful light source – especially in campfire situations like this one:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-39820" style="width:399px"><span class="space" style="width:399px; padding-top:150.38%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="399" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-4.jpg?resize=399%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="campfire photography at night" class="wp-image-39820" title="DPS_Fire-4" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-4.jpg?w=399&amp;ssl=1 399w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-4.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Notice how the fire beautifully illuminates the surrounding trees.</p><p> But how do you photograph fire with such a magical result? Here are a few quick tips:</p><ol><li> Use a long shutter speed. While fire looks gorgeous, it&#39;s not very bright. To compensate, you&#39;ll often need to work at 1 second, 5 seconds, or even 30 seconds.</li><li> Widen your aperture. Again, the goal here is to compensate for the lack of light. If needed, push your aperture to its maximum setting.</li><li> Boost your ISO. It&#39;s generally a good idea to start with a low ISO – but if you&#39;ve taken some test shots and they&#39;re just not bright, then push your ISO (and <em>keep</em> pushing your ISO until you get the result that you&#39;re after).</li><li> Pay careful attention to where the light falls. If you&#39;re shooting around a campfire, you can get interesting lighting on subjects a dozen feet from the flames – so don&#39;t feel compelled to crop tight. Instead, get creative with your surroundings.</li></ol><p> Also, when working with a wide aperture and therefore a narrow <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">depth of field</a> , try setting your focus on objects with high-contrast edges (like the silhouettes of stationary subjects) instead of the main subject. You&#39;ll technically miss focus, but that&#39;s okay; the shifting fire light will blur edges and soften the shadows of the objects it illuminates, so you should do what you can to nail the hard edges.</p><p> Oh, and take advantage of the interesting colors that fire offers…</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-39822" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="399" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-6.jpg?resize=600%2C399&#038;ssl=1" alt="blue flame in a bottle on snow" class="wp-image-39822" title="DPS_Fire-6" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-6.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-6.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-6.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-6.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> …and consider emphasizing them in post-processing!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-39823" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="399" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-7.jpg?resize=600%2C399&#038;ssl=1" alt="orange flame from a lighter" class="wp-image-39823" title="DPS_Fire-7" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-7.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-7.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-7.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-7.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Speaking of which:</p><h2 data-section id="learn-to-control-the-color-of-your-flame"> 5.

Fuels that burn efficiently (like some gas torches and alcohols) may not emit much smoke at all. Use inefficient fuels like wood or paper to maximize your smoke output.</li><li> Light the smoke. A light source shining into the smoke can solidify those lines and help them stand out. Use backlight to create the most powerful effect, while sidelight is better for a mysterious look.</li><li> Use a fast shutter speed to freeze the smoke trails (start at 1/100s, but increase this if necessary). Slower shutter speeds will make the smoke appear like haze, not well-defined wisps.</li></ol><p> Also, be sure to take <em>plenty</em> of images. Smoke is constantly changing shape and direction, so it&#39;s generally not enough to capture one shot and call it a day; instead, take dozens of shots, delete the mediocre ones, and keep your best.</p><h2 data-section id="start-with-a-candle"> 7.

And as you go along, make sure to write down your settings. In particular, determine the shutter speed you need to freeze the flame, as well as the shutter speed you need to illuminate a subject on a table. Finally, use an artificial light source to photograph both the flame and the surrounding environment in a single frame.</p><h2 data-section id="how-to-photograph-fire-final-words"> How to photograph fire: final words</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-39806" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="399" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-3.jpg?resize=600%2C399&#038;ssl=1" alt="person with gas mask and fire" class="wp-image-39806" title="DPS_Fire-3" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-3.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-3.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DPS_Fire-3.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Well, there you have it:</p><p> My favorite tips and techniques for fire photoshoots.
