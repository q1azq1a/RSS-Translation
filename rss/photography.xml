The photos may be taken in far-flung locations, but I promise you: the tips I offer can be applied anywhere on Earth.</p><h2 data-section id="what-is-storytelling-photography"> What is storytelling photography?</h2><p> Storytelling photography is all about capturing images that tell a compelling narrative. It&#39;s not limited to a specific genre; it can be documentary, candid, posed, or even abstract. The beauty of storytelling photography lies in its ability to engage viewers and make them connect with the story being portrayed.</p><p> When you come across a powerful storytelling photo, it can hold your attention for minutes as you explore its intricate details. These images have the remarkable ability to spark your imagination, allowing you to ponder what might happen next or reflect on the emotions conveyed.</p><p> It&#39;s important to note that storytelling photography can be achieved through a single image or a series of images. Some photographers excel at encapsulating an entire story within a single frame, while others choose to create a collection of images that, when combined, create a comprehensive narrative.</p><p> For street photographers, wildlife photographers, and bird photographers, capturing a single photo that tells a story is often the norm. On the other hand, fine-art photographers and photojournalists often lean towards creating a series of images that, when sequenced, convey a larger and more intricate story.</p><p> No matter the approach, storytelling photography allows you to engage viewers on a deeper level, making them active participants in the narrative you present. It&#39;s a powerful tool that enables you to evoke emotions, provoke thought, and transport your audience into a whole new world.</p><h2 data-section id="storytelling-photography-tips"> Storytelling photography tips</h2><p> Including stories in your shots is a great way to interest – and engage – viewers. But how do you do it? How can you capture the kind of shots that are full of narrative? Here are plenty of tips to help you out:</p><h3 data-section id="try-to-understand-the-story-from-all-angles"> 1.

Get to know all the key players, be aware of scheduled activities, and understand the event&#39;s objective.</p><p> Once you&#39;re there, take the time to engage with a variety of people involved in the event. Have conversations, listen to their thoughts, and gain different perspectives. Armed with this valuable information, direct your photography to tell the story from all angles. Ensure it&#39;s not one-sided, capture essential elements, and strive to create a series of images that presents a neutral account.</p><p> Bottom line: Understanding the story from multiple angles enables you to create a comprehensive visual narrative that resonates with viewers.</p><h3 data-section id="decide-if-you-want-to-capture-a-single-image-or-multiple-shots"> 2. Decide if you want to capture a single image or multiple shots </h3><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tell-stories-images-07.jpg?ssl=1" alt="do storytelling images riverfront barges" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> I tried to tell the whole story of this chaotic riverfront by zooming out and including multiple subjects (Dhaka, Bangladesh).</figcaption></figure></div><p> Now comes the fun part – deciding how you want to tell your story through photography. You have two options: capturing a single image that encapsulates the entire narrative or creating a series of shots that collectively weave the story together.</p><p> If you opt for a single image approach, you&#39;ll need to focus on capturing that one perfect shot that conveys your entire story. It&#39;s like hitting the bullseye in one shot – impactful and direct. This method works well when your story has a clear and straightforward message, and you want to make a strong statement that leaves a lasting impression.</p><p> On the other hand, creating a series of shots allows you to unfold the story gradually, piece by piece. Each photo adds a layer of depth and reveals a different aspect of the narrative. It&#39;s like assembling a puzzle where each piece matters. This approach is ideal for more complex stories with multiple angles, subjects, and nuances that require a broader context to be fully understood.</p><p> Both approaches have their strengths, and the choice depends on the story you want to tell and the impact you want to make. Just decide which style suits your vision best and get ready to capture that story through your lens!</p><h3 data-section id="include-small-details-to-tell-a-story-in-a-single-frame"> 3. Include small details to tell a story in a single frame</h3><p> Imagine your task is to tell the story of a person. A parent, or even yourself.</p><p> How would you do it?</p><p> A standard portrait wouldn&#39;t tell the full story. A person&#39;s full story is often in the details: a picture of their desk, travel books strewn across a bedroom floor, a close-up of their hands dirty from working in the garden, a wide-angle portrait of them surrounded by a few of their favorite things.</p><p> So the next time you&#39;re photographing a person, try to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shooting-details-tell-visual-story/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">include small details</a> that add to their story. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tell-stories-images-01.jpg?ssl=1" alt="How to do storytelling With Your Images" title="tell-stories-images-01.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> I didn&#39;t visit India to focus my lens on poverty alone. However, when trying to tell the story of Mumbai, it would have been dishonest of me <em>not</em> to include it. Confronted with the scene above, I saw the gap between the rich and poor. The small details here are my subject&#39;s plastic bag, the skin condition on his arm, and his frail body. A big (and still important) detail is his juxtaposition with a backdrop of expensive high-rise buildings.</p><h3 data-section id="give-yourself-plenty-of-time"> 4. Give yourself plenty of time </h3><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tell-stories-images-11.jpg?ssl=1" alt="How to do Storytelling With Your Images" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Sometimes, you know exactly what story you want to capture, but turning it into a stunning photograph takes time – it&#39;s not an instant process! So here&#39;s the deal: don&#39;t rush yourself. Take the time to research your subject beforehand, and then give yourself an ample amount of time to actually capture your images.</p><p> Look, let&#39;s be real here: storytelling photography isn&#39;t something you can rush through. It requires patience and dedication. And guess what? Sometimes, you might spend days or even weeks on a project without completing it. That&#39;s totally okay! Rome wasn&#39;t built in a day, right?</p><p> Here&#39;s a little tip: try estimating how long you think your storytelling project will take, and then double it. That way, you won&#39;t be caught off guard and get frustrated if things take longer than expected.</p><h3 data-section id="aim-for-variety-in-a-series-of-shots"> 5. Aim for variety in a series of shots</h3><p> This storytelling tip is related to the last point:</p><p> You must take a <em>variety</em> of different images of a single situation. Whether you want to photograph a camel market in India, a farmers&#39; market in a Chicago suburb, or your niece&#39;s birthday party, just creating one type of photo won&#39;t tell the whole story.</p><p> Instead, you need portraits, wide-angle shots, shots from up high, shots from down low, action shots, zoomed-in details, and more. All of these <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/perspective-photography-dont-just-stand-move-feet/" target="_blank" aria-label="perspectives (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">perspectives</a> <em>combined</em> tell the whole story.</p><p> In the image series below, I tried to tell the story of a sunrise hot air balloon flight over the ancient, temple-strewn plain of Bagan, Myanmar. Capturing a variety of images was key to my success. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tell-stories-images-03.jpg?ssl=1" alt="do storytelling images" title="tell-stories-images-03.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tell-stories-images-02.jpg?ssl=1" alt="do storytelling images" title="tell-stories-images-02.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tell-stories-images-04-5.jpg?ssl=1" alt="do storytelling images" title="tell-stories-images-04-5.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 data-section id="take-control-of-the-entire-frame"> 6. Take control of the entire frame</h3><p> Now that you&#39;re thinking about telling stories, you&#39;re not just a photographer; you&#39;re a storyteller, too. And that role involves taking control of the whole frame.</p><p> In other words:</p><p> Don&#39;t just think about your subject, their lighting, their positioning. Be aware of the whole scene in front of you, including surrounding details, backdrops, shadows, bright areas, etc.</p><p> Sometimes, I lie <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/get-down-low-for-a-unique-perspective/" target="_blank" aria-label="flat on the ground with my camera (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">flat on the ground with my camera</a> .为什么？ I want to include environmental details in the frame that improve the shot through storytelling. I get strange looks, but I don&#39;t care; it&#39;s the price of telling the real story. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tell-stories-images-06.jpg?ssl=1" alt="do storytelling images" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The Holy Man of Umananda Island (Assam, India).<br /> Here, I wasn&#39;t just thinking about the position of this gentleman&#39;s face. I was also aware of his three-headed Hindu spear – a key detail in his story – and the flowers on its tips.</figcaption></figure></div><h3 data-section id="plan-ahead-with-a-shot-list"> 7. Plan ahead with a shot list</h3><p> Whether you&#39;re heading out into your hometown for some street photography or to the Eiffel Tower for some vacation photography, why not create a shot list? I&#39;m talking about ideas for specific shots, angles you want to try, and people you might include in the frame.</p><p> Research the kind of shots that other photographers have taken at your destination. Seek out new angles that&#39;ll produce fresh storytelling even at well-known locations. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tell-stories-images-08.jpg?ssl=1" alt="do storytelling images taj mahal" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> A traditional Taj Mahal composition that I just had to include on my shot list.

I&#39;d like to think even animals can appreciate how awesome this building is.</figcaption></figure></div><h3 data-section id="dont-be-afraid-to-start-without-a-plan"> 8. Don&#39;t be afraid to start without a plan</h3><p> I know, I know; I just explained all about the value of using a shot list – but while a shot list can be extremely helpful, you don&#39;t always need a meticulous plan to get started. Sometimes, it&#39;s liberating to let go of the reins and follow your instincts.</p><p> Instead of overthinking every shot, embrace spontaneity. Head out with your camera, keep your senses open, and let your curiosity guide you. Capture whatever catches your eye, and trust that the story will unfold naturally.</p><p> Sure, having a subject or a location in mind can help focus your efforts, but don&#39;t be bound by rigid expectations. Give yourself the freedom to explore, experiment, and see where the journey takes you. Often, the most unexpected moments and connections lead to the most captivating stories.</p><p> So, pack your gear, follow your intuition, and let the adventure begin. Remember, great storytelling photography often starts with an open mind and a willingness to embrace the unknown.</p><h3 data-section id="learn-to-narrow-down-trim-and-exclude"> 9. Learn to narrow down, trim, and exclude</h3><p> Uploading a hundred photos to Facebook, all of a similar setting and taken from the same few angles, is a surefire way to lose people&#39;s attention. Those 100 photos could easily be narrowed down to the 10 essential storytelling shots.</p><p> So learn to be selective! Start sharing only your best images.</p><p> Loktak Lake (pictured below) was so spectacular that I wandered around a single hilltop taking hundreds of images. It was bliss. A lot of the results were great, but would I really want to dump them all online for friends, family, and followers to sift through? No, I would not!</p><p> Instead, it&#39;s important to find a favorite or two that tells your subject&#39;s story: </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tell-stories-images-10.jpg?ssl=1" alt="How to do Storytelling With Your Images" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Manipur, India</figcaption></figure></div><h3 data-section id="show-emotions"> 10. Show emotions</h3><p> Emotions are a central part of storytelling photography, and to <a aria-label="capture emotions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/adding-emotion-and-feeling-to-photographs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">capture emotions</a> , you&#39;ll primarily need people and faces. Emotion can also be communicated through body language, so capturing whole bodies works sometimes, too. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tell-stories-images-12.jpg?ssl=1" alt="How to do Storytelling With Your Images" title="tell-stories-images-12.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> At the marvelous Mother&#39;s Market in Manipur, India, I met these lovely ladies (above) animatedly playing a board game. I broke the ice by asking if I could join in. They said “No,” but it made them laugh and I got permission to shoot away. The best photos came after they&#39;d forgotten about me; their natural expressions returned and I was able to capture their emotions.</p><h3 data-section id="show-human-interaction"> 11. Show human interaction </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Lead-image.jpg?ssl=1" alt="How to do storytelling With Your Images" title="Lead image.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> People are the heart and soul of storytelling photography. They bring life and emotion to our images. So let&#39;s focus on capturing those genuine moments of interaction that make stories come alive.</p><p> When you have the opportunity to include human interaction in your shots, go for it! Look for those moments when people embrace, hold hands, or even touch each other gently. These gestures create a connection that resonates with viewers and sparks their imagination.</p><p> Stay alert and aware of your surroundings, even if the interaction is happening just outside the frame. Be ready to turn and click the shutter when you sense a captivating moment unfolding.</p><p> Remember, timing is key in capturing these interactions. Trust your instincts, be quick on the draw, and don&#39;t hesitate to take multiple shots. Not all of them will be perfect, but the few that truly capture the essence of the story will make it all worthwhile.</p><h3 data-section id="dont-forget-about-the-basics"> 12. Don&#39;t forget about the basics</h3><p> In your bid to learn storytelling, don&#39;t forget about settings, composition, and lighting. <span class="s1">It&#39;s all too easy to fall out of touch with photography basics, especially when you&#39;re first learning to tell a story with pictures.</span></p><p> After all, when you&#39;re thinking about storytelling, you might start to drift away from photographic fundamentals.</p><p> So instead of replacing composition, settings, and lighting with storytelling, make sure everything works together. A shot with beautiful light, excellent composition, perfect exposure, <em>and</em> a great story? That&#39;s how you capture people&#39;s attention! </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tell-stories-images-13.jpg?ssl=1" alt="How to do Storytelling With Your Images" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> A lady on a train in Shan State, Myanmar.</figcaption></figure></div><h3 data-section id="use-narrative-structure"> 13. Use narrative structure</h3><p> How does a traditional novel or movie work? Novels and movies are stories, so they contain beginnings, middles, and ends.</p><p> You can do the same with your photos!</p><p> If you&#39;re just starting out taking a series of storytelling pictures, try creating a chronological narrative. It&#39;s by no means the only or even recommended narrative structure to follow, but it&#39;s a fun and easy way to practice.</p><p> You might tell the story of a single day in a place you know well. Start with sunrise, then take photos throughout the day as the light changes. Conclude the series with sunset and night shots.</p><p> Here, I attempted to tell the story of day and night on the rivers running through the cities of Chittagong and Dhaka: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tell-stories-images-14.jpg?ssl=1" alt="How to do Storytelling With Your Images" title="tell-stories-images-14.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tell-stories-images-15.jpg?ssl=1" alt="How to do Storytelling With Your Images" title="tell-stories-images-15.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tell-stories-images-16.jpg?ssl=1" alt="How to do Storytelling With Your Images" title="tell-stories-images-16.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tell-stories-images-17.jpg?ssl=1" alt="How to do Storytelling With Your Images" title="tell-stories-images-17.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 data-section id="do-some-but-not-too-much-editing"> 14. Do some (but not too much!) editing</h3><p> Editing is a crucial part of photography, and it&#39;s no different when it comes to storytelling. Post-processing allows you to enhance your images and convey your story more effectively. However, it&#39;s important to strike a balance and avoid going overboard.</p><p> Make adjustments that bring out the best in your photos without losing their authenticity. You can fine-tune elements like white balance and tones to accurately represent the scene. Experiment with techniques like vignettes and color grading to enhance the mood and atmosphere of your storytelling shots.</p><p> But remember, less is often more. Don&#39;t get carried away and lose sight of the authenticity. Stay true to the story you captured through your lens. Let your editing enhance the mood, intensify emotions, and make your viewers connect with the narrative. Just strike the right balance and let your storytelling photos shine!</p><h2 data-section id="telling-a-story-with-pictures-final-words"> Telling a story with pictures: final words</h2><p> Now that you&#39;ve finished this article, you&#39;re ready to begin telling stories with your photos!</p><p> So remember these tips, get out there with your camera, and have fun.</p><p> Now over to you:</p><p> <em>Have you tried doing storytelling photography?

It&#39;s about intentionally incorporating blur caused by fast-moving subjects to create a sense of action and movement in your photos.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-208308" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-7.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="motorcyclist motion blur photography" class="wp-image-208308" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-7.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-7.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-7.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-7.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-7.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-7.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Imagine freezing a moment in time where the subject is a streak of motion, but everything around it is in sharp focus. That&#39;s the essence of motion blur photography. It allows you to convey the speed at which a subject was moving while highlighting the stillness of the background; it also allows you to capture the dynamic energy of scenes teeming with movement, whether it&#39;s cars speeding by, people walking briskly, or sports players in action.</p><p> Motion blur photography may not work in every situation or with every subject, but when you find the right moment and context, it can result in captivating and visually striking photographs.</p><h2 data-section id="the-best-settings-for-motion-blur-shots"> The best settings for motion blur shots</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-208307" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:74.87%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1123" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-10.jpg?resize=1500%2C1123&#038;ssl=1" alt="train moving fast with platform" class="wp-image-208307" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-10.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-10.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-10.jpg?resize=600%2C449&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-10.jpg?resize=768%2C575&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-10.jpg?resize=717%2C537&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Creating stunning motion blur shots requires careful control over your camera settings. Remember, we&#39;re aiming to capture that beautiful blur caused by a fast-moving subject. So here&#39;s what you need to know:</p><p> First things first, set your camera to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/" target="_blank" aria-label="Shutter Priority mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Shutter Priority mode</a> . This mode gives you control over the most important setting for motion blur: the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> . You want to be able to adjust it according to your creative vision.</p><p> Now, let&#39;s talk about the shutter speed. It&#39;s all about finding the right balance between freezing the subject and creating that desired blur. A fast shutter speed like 1/1000s will freeze the action, leaving no trace of motion. But if you want that sense of movement, go for a slower shutter speed, such as 1/2s or even longer.</p><p> Finding the perfect shutter speed will depend on the specific subject and the effect you want to achieve. In general, aim for shutter speeds below 1/60s to capture a pleasing motion blur. Anything faster tends to result in sharper images that may lack the artistic touch.</p><p> After adjusting the shutter speed, pick an <a aria-label="ISO setting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO setting</a> . Using the camera&#39;s base ISO (usually 100) allows you to have a slower shutter speed without overexposing the image.</p><p> As for the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> , your camera will select this automatically, but keep an eye out and make sure it doesn&#39;t start narrowing too much. An aperture in the range of f/16-f/22 can introduce blur due to diffraction, so if you do notice the aperture creeping upward, increase the shutter speed or consider using a neutral density filter (discussed below).</p><p> By setting the right combination of shutter speed, ISO, and aperture, you&#39;ll be well on your way to capturing mesmerizing motion blur photographs. Don&#39;t be afraid to experiment and adjust these settings until you achieve the desired effect.</p><h2 data-section id="how-to-take-motion-blur-photos-the-basics"> How to take motion blur photos: the basics</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-208311" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:58.13%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="872" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-8-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C872&#038;ssl=1" alt="boats in the water" class="wp-image-208311" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-8-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-8-1.jpg?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-8-1.jpg?resize=600%2C349&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-8-1.jpg?resize=768%2C446&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-8-1.jpg?resize=717%2C417&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> To start, you&#39;ll need to find a subject in motion. Consider scenes with cars whizzing by or people bustling through a crowded street; these scenarios provide excellent opportunities to experiment with motion blur. When you&#39;re just beginning, it&#39;s helpful to choose subjects that move predictably, making it easier to anticipate their path.</p><p> Note: While motion blur photography can be practiced at any time of day, working during the early morning or late evening can be advantageous. These times offer softer lighting conditions, allowing you to slow down your shutter speed and avoid overexposing your images.</p><p> Though not always necessary, using a tripod can be invaluable when aiming to capture a sharp background with a blurry subject. Mount your camera securely to the tripod and thoughtfully compose your shot.</p><p> Now it&#39;s time to adjust your camera settings. Recall the previous discussion on shutter speed (the key to the whole technique!). Select a shutter speed that will render your subject as a blur, taking into account the subject&#39;s speed and your artistic vision. As a starting point, around 1/30s for fast-moving subjects and 1s for slower subjects often yield pleasing results.</p><p> Then, when your subject moves through the frame, take the shot! To prevent blur caused by camera shake, consider using a remote release or activating the two-second timer. After capturing an image, review it on your camera&#39;s LCD screen. Identify any areas for improvement, make necessary adjustments, and continue shooting. Remember, motion blur photography is an experimental process, so don&#39;t hesitate to test different shutter speeds until you achieve the desired effect.</p><p> Creating outstanding motion blur shots requires practice and exploration. Predicting precisely how a blurred subject will appear is challenging, so be prepared to capture a multitude of images and select the best ones later. Embrace the joy of experimentation and trust your creative instincts as you refine your motion blur photography skills.</p><h2 data-section id="tips-and-tricks-for-outstanding-motion-blur-shots"> Tips and tricks for outstanding motion blur shots</h2><p> Now that you know how to capture motion blur, you&#39;re ready to head out and start creating some beautiful shots.

Fortunately, there&#39;s a nifty tool that can come to your rescue: the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/neutral-density-filters-landscape-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="neutral density filter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">neutral density filter</a> .</p><p> Think of a neutral density filter as a pair of sunglasses for your lens. It works by reducing the amount of light that enters your camera, allowing you to extend your shutter speed and achieve a well-exposed image with a beautiful sense of motion while keeping your aperture at a reasonable setting.</p><p> Neutral density filters come in different strengths, giving you flexibility in adjusting the amount of light reduction. For instance, a 3-stop neutral density filter is handy when you only need a slight extension of your shutter speed. On the other hand, a more powerful 10-stop neutral density filter can be a game-changer when you want to really stretch that shutter or shoot in extremely bright conditions.</p><p> Having a couple of neutral density filters in your kit can give you the versatility to adapt to various lighting situations, opening up new possibilities for creating stunning motion blur shots.

This technique allows you to create stunning shots that showcase a sharp subject against a beautifully blurred background.</p><p> Panning involves capturing the movement of your subject by following it with your camera as it moves across your frame. By using a slower shutter speed and smoothly tracking the subject, you can create a sense of dynamism and speed while keeping the subject relatively sharp.</p><p> To start, choose a moving subject such as a cyclist, a car, or a runner. Set your camera to a shutter speed that allows for a longer exposure, around 1/30s or even slower depending on the speed of the subject. Keep in mind that practice and experimentation will help you find the perfect shutter speed for different situations.</p><p> Now, with your camera in hand, follow the subject&#39;s movement while pressing the shutter button. The key is to keep the subject in the same position in your viewfinder as it moves across the frame. Maintain a smooth and steady movement, almost as if you&#39;re dancing with the subject.</p><p> As you pan, the background will blur due to the slower shutter speed, creating a sense of motion and energy. If done correctly, your subject will stand out sharply against the blurred surroundings, making for an eye-catching and dynamic photograph.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-208310" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="capture motion blur photography racecar" class="wp-image-208310" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/motion-blur-photography-2.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Panning takes practice to master, so don&#39;t get discouraged if your first attempts don&#39;t turn out as expected.

The magic happens when you have both elements coexisting in your image. Imagine a scenario where your subject is in motion, streaking across the frame with a mesmerizing blur, while the background remains crisp and sharp.</p><p> By juxtaposing the blurred subject against a static backdrop, you engage the viewer&#39;s attention and create a visually dynamic effect. This technique allows the viewer to anchor their gaze on the sharp areas while also appreciating the mesmerizing motion conveyed by the blurs.</p><p> To achieve this, it&#39;s essential to use a tripod. Without a stable base, your entire image will suffer from unwanted blurriness. So, set up your camera on a tripod and compose your shot thoughtfully. Consider the path your subject will traverse and frame your image accordingly.</p><p> Remember, a successful motion blur shot combines the graceful movement of your subject with the solidity of the background. It&#39;s a delicate dance between capturing fleeting moments and preserving stillness. So, take your time, experiment, and let your creative vision guide you.</p><h3 data-section id="try-adding-a-flash"> 4.

In this article, we&#39;ll delve into the realm of chromatic aberration. I&#39;ll explore its causes, and I&#39;ll equip you with practical strategies to avoid it like a pro.</p><p> Specifically, I explain:</p><ul><li> What chromatic aberration is</li><li> Why CA happens</li><li> Seven powerful strategies to minimize its effects and keep your photos fring-free!</li></ul><p> So without further ado, let&#39;s discuss how to deal with that pesky chromatic aberration once and for all.</p><h2 data-section id="what-is-chromatic-aberration"> What is chromatic aberration?</h2><p> Chromatic aberration is when a lens doesn&#39;t focus all light wavelengths at the same point, resulting in unnatural colors in your photos. Because these colors are often visible along high-contrast edges, this problem is known as <em>fringing</em> . </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_Cheetah_Chromatic_Aberration.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Chromatic Aberration example" title="OziRig_Cheetah_Chromatic_Aberration.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The left-hand side of this cheetah shows chromatic aberration along the sharp edges of the subject.</figcaption></figure></div><p> To help you understand chromatic aberration a bit better, remember that the focal plane is your sensor&#39;s point of focus, where all the light from your lens should join together to be correctly captured and recorded. But depending on the construction of your lens and your chosen focal length, certain wavelengths (colors) may converge at points <em>in front of</em> or <em>behind</em> the focal plane; wavelengths can also converge at a point that&#39;s <em>off-center</em> .</p><p> When different wavelengths converge at different points, the individual colors become visible, resulting in unpleasant chromatic aberration effects. Take a look at the diagram below. Do you see how the red, green, and blue light hits the sensor in different spots? That&#39;s chromatic aberration at work. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ozirig_ca_dlsr_illustration.jpg?ssl=1" alt="What is chromatic aberration and why it happens. " title="ozirig_ca_dlsr_illustration.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> CA doesn&#39;t look so great, and it can also reduce image sharpness. Therefore, photographers often funnel significant time and money into avoiding or removing chromatic aberration in their images. Fortunately, as I discuss below, there are a handful of ways of dealing with CA – though they&#39;re not all equally effective, so it&#39;s important to make careful choices both in the field and in the editing room for the best results.</p><h2 data-section id="longitudinal-vs-lateral-chromatic-aberration"> Longitudinal vs lateral chromatic aberration</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254487" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-121.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="A guide to chromatic aberration in photography" class="wp-image-254487" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-121.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-121.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-121.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-121.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-121.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> While many photographers are familiar with chromatic aberration as color fringing, it&#39;s important to understand that there are actually two types: longitudinal (axial) chromatic aberration and lateral (transverse) chromatic aberration. Both types involve the focusing of different wavelengths at different points, but their key distinction lies in the direction of the differential focusing.</p><p> Longitudinal chromatic aberration occurs when different colors focus in front of and behind one another. This type is commonly observed in <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-tips-for-great-telephoto-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="telephoto lenses (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">telephoto lenses</a> and less common when using <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/7-ways-to-get-more-out-of-a-wide-angle-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="wide-angle glass (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">wide-angle glass</a> . The manifestation of longitudinal chromatic aberration is seen as unnatural colors across the entire image, rather than just at the edges.</p><p> On the other hand, lateral chromatic aberration occurs when different colors focus at different points along the same plane, next to one another. This type is commonly observed in wide-angle lenses. Lateral chromatic aberration manifests as unnatural colors along high-contrast edges in the image.</p><p> The difference between these two types of chromatic aberration might seem trivial, but identifying which type is causing the issue can be helpful in finding the most effective solution.</p><h2 data-section id="what-causes-chromatic-aberration"> What causes chromatic aberration?</h2><p> Chromatic aberration happens because your lens acts as a prism. It bends light, and the colors passing through the lens are split at different angles. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ozirig_ca_prism_diagram.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Why does chromatic aberration occur prisms splitting the light" title="ozirig_ca_prism_diagram.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Here, it&#39;s important to remember that light is actually made up of several different wavelengths (colors). So for your camera&#39;s sensor to capture the combined color of light, your lens needs to make all wavelengths of that particular ray hit the exact same point on your sensor.</p><p> It may sound simple, but various wavelengths (and thus various colors) strike your lens all at once, and <em>each</em> of these wavelengths will behave slightly differently depending on the lens glass that it is passing through.</p><p> The feat of engineering required to correctly align all of these different light rays is generally achieved by the manufacturer&#39;s use of a lens array (rather than a single lens element). In fact, if you were to pull your favorite camera lens apart, you&#39;d probably find upward of 16 lens elements – all designed to correct for various things along the light&#39;s journey between your lens and your sensor. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_Lens_Elements.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Lens elements A guide to chromatic aberration in photography" title="OziRig_Lens_Elements.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Unfortunately, this is also where chromatic aberration tends to rear its ugly head. Hidden within the design of these lens elements are defects – either in the glass or the design of the lens itself – which, under specific conditions, may cause your photos to exhibit CA.</p><p> Now, I&#39;m not saying you need a pro-level lens. In fact, a key point is that <em>all</em> lenses suffer from chromatic aberration in one form or another, no matter the cost. What matters is whether or not your lens exhibits <em>visible</em> chromatic aberration, and whether the amount of visible CA is a dealbreaker for your particular needs.</p><h2 data-section id="is-chromatic-aberration-a-major-problem"> Is chromatic aberration a major problem?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254486" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-120.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="A guide to chromatic aberration in photography" class="wp-image-254486" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-120.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-120.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-120.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-120.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chromatic-aberration-120.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Chromatic aberration can have a significant impact on the quality of your photographs if you don&#39;t take steps to avoid it. This optical phenomenon can make your images look imperfect and even amateurish. While a small amount of chromatic aberration may go unnoticed, once it becomes noticeable, it will distract the viewer and diminish the overall unity of the photo.</p><p> Unfortunately, chromatic aberration is sometimes unavoidable, especially when using certain lenses. In such cases, you&#39;ll need to employ post-processing techniques to minimize or eliminate its effects. Many photo-editing programs offer tools to address chromatic aberration, although they may not always provide a perfect solution.</p><h2 data-section id="how-to-avoid-chromatic-aberration-defects-powerful-strategies"> How to avoid chromatic aberration defects: 7 powerful strategies</h2><p> Chromatic aberration is a major problem, especially on cheap lenses. But the good news is that, if you <em>are</em> stuck working with a lens that exhibits some form of visible chromatic aberration, there are several easy-to-understand strategies to remove or minimize its effect on your photos.</p><h3 data-section id="avoid-high-contrast-scenes"> 1. Avoid high-contrast scenes </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_CA_Cheetah_High_Contrast.jpg?ssl=1" alt="CA Cheetah High Contrast" title="OziRig_CA_Cheetah_High_Contrast.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Chromatic aberration tends to flare up when shooting high-contrast scenes. Particularly problematic are darker subjects surrounded by white backdrops, landscapes against a bright sunrise, or – as in the example of the cheetah above – heavily backlit subjects.</p><p> There&#39;s no easy in-camera method of avoiding contrast. So there&#39;s often nothing you can do here except adjust your <a aria-label="composition (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-elements-of-composition-in-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">composition</a> . Swap your backdrop out to something that more closely matches your subject&#39;s tones, or simply wait for more favorable lighting conditions.</p><p> If you absolutely must capture an image as-is, then shoot in <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/raw-vs-jpeg/" target="_blank" aria-label="RAW (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">RAW</a> and prepare for a touch-up in post-production.</p><h3 data-section id="adjust-your-focal-length"> 2. Adjust your focal length </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_Chromatic_Aberration_Focal_Length.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Chromatic Aberration Focal Length" title="OziRig_Chromatic_Aberration_Focal_Length.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Although it&#39;s nice to have access to a wide range of focal lengths, the fact is that most <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/primes-versus-zoom-lenses/" target="_blank" aria-label="zoom lenses (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">zoom lenses</a> exhibit chromatic aberration at their focal length extremes. So setting the focal length toward the middle of your lens&#39;s range will usually help remove the offending CA.</p><p> Note that using a zoom lens at its widest will usually introduce various other defects in your image. So if you&#39;re set on a wide-angle perspective, choose a <a aria-label="prime (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/prime-lenses-an-introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">prime</a> wide-angle lens to handle the job, or make a panorama at a longer focal length, then join the photos in post-processing.</p><h3 data-section id="stop-down-your-aperture"> 3. Stop down your aperture </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_CA_Aperture.jpg?ssl=1" alt="CA Aperture" title="OziRig_CA_Aperture.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Although the result will depend on the type of lens you are using, stopping down your aperture helps minimize most lens defects, including chromatic aberration.</p><p> So instead of using an f/2.8 or f/4 aperture, try going to f/8 or f/11 – then take a few test shots to see if the chromatic aberration has disappeared. Of course, you&#39;ll need to consider reducing the <a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> or boosting the <a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> to compensate for the light loss.</p><p> (Note: A narrower aperture will specifically reduce longitudinal chromatic aberration but won&#39;t affect lateral chromatic aberration, so if you&#39;re not seeing the results you want, try one of the other options on this list.)</p><h3 data-section id="reframe-with-your-subject-at-the-center-of-the-image"> 4. Reframe with your subject at the center of the image </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_Rhino_CA_Recrop.jpg?ssl=1" alt="chromatic aberration rhino reframe" title="OziRig_Rhino_CA_Recrop.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Chromatic aberration is often more noticeable toward the edges of the frame, <em>not</em> the center. (This is generally due to the curvature of the lens elements.)</p><p> Therefore, if you reframe your shot but put your main subject closer to the <em>middle</em> , you&#39;ll often end up with little-to-no chromatic aberration on your subject.</p><p> Of course, you may still have noticeable CA around the edges of the frame, but you do have the option to crop this away. It&#39;s not ideal if you need to retain every pixel in your photo (eg, for large prints), in which case you should consider one of the other preventative measures discussed above. But if you&#39;re creating small prints or you plan to distribute your photo online, cropping shouldn&#39;t be a big issue.</p><h3 data-section id="remove-the-chromatic-aberration-in-post-processing"> 5. Remove the chromatic aberration in post-processing </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OziRig_Cheetah_Chromatic_Aberration_Comparison.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Cheetah Chromatic Aberration Comparison" title="OziRig_Cheetah_Chromatic_Aberration_Comparison.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> If you come across a photo with noticeable chromatic aberration or find yourself in a situation where it can&#39;t be avoided, post-processing can be a game-changer. Fortunately, popular editing software like Lightroom, Luminar, and Capture One offer straightforward tools for chromatic aberration removal. The process is usually as simple as clicking a button or selecting a checkbox, although you may have the option to fine-tune the results manually.</p><p> To begin, import the problematic image into your preferred editing software and locate the chromatic aberration removal tool. Typically, you can find it under the lens correction panel. Activate the tool and let the software do its thing; then take a look at the Before and After views, if available. Assess whether the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/fix-chromatic-aberration-lightroom-5/" target="_blank" aria-label="chromatic aberration is completely eliminated (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">chromatic aberration is completely eliminated</a> or at least significantly reduced.</p><p> If the results are satisfactory, you can proceed with your usual editing process. However, if the chromatic aberration persists, you might consider trying manual adjustments within the software or experimenting with a different editing program.</p><h3 data-section id="convert-to-black-and-white"> 6. Convert to black and white</h3><p> If you&#39;re finding it challenging to effectively remove chromatic aberration using the dedicated tools in your photo editing software, there&#39;s another straightforward option at your disposal: converting the image to black and white. While not every photo looks as striking in black and white as it does in color, this quick conversion can be a powerful technique for dealing with those unsightly color fringes.</p><p> It&#39;s important to note that converting an image to black and white won&#39;t magically eliminate the blur caused by chromatic aberration. So, even if you plan to shoot in black and white, it&#39;s still worth mastering the art of avoiding chromatic aberration in the field. However, when faced with persistent fringing that&#39;s difficult to remove through other means, this method can provide an effective solution.</p><h3 data-section id="purchase-a-better-lens"> 7. Purchase a better lens</h3><p> When aiming to minimize chromatic aberration, it&#39;s essential to consider the quality of your lens. Different lenses exhibit varying levels of fringing, which can be attributed to factors like focal length and lens design. By investing in a lens with limited chromatic aberration, you can significantly reduce the occurrence of color fringing in your images.</p><p> Higher-quality lenses, although often pricier, offer a range of benefits beyond minimizing chromatic aberration. These lenses boast superior optics for better image quality overall as well as fast focusing, a robust build, and smooth handling.</p><p> To find low-CA lenses, seek out models with low-dispersion elements; they&#39;re specifically designed to handle chromatic aberration!</p><h2 data-section id="chromatic-aberration-final-words"> Chromatic aberration: final words</h2><p> Well, that&#39;s it: All the chromatic aberration essentials, including what it is and how to avoid it. Now armed with knowledge and strategies, you&#39;re ready to conquer this pesky foe and unlock the full potential of your images.</p><p> That said, don&#39;t be disheartened if you encounter a hint of color fringing in your shots. With the right techniques, you can minimize or even eliminate the problem.</p><p> Now you know how to keep your images free of CA, and you know how to capture stunning photos – even with cheaper lenses.</p><p> Over to you:</p><p> <em>Are you struggling with chromatic aberration in your photos?

You might find yourself doing street photography in a dingy indoor market, at twilight, or at night – and in all of those situations, a lens with a large aperture provides a major advantage. Yes, modern cameras perform well at high ISOs, which negates the need for a high aperture to <em>some</em> extent. However, a large aperture is still required if you want beautiful bokeh lights in the background of your low-light photos.</p><h3 id="size-and-weight"> Size and weight</h3><div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-207329" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-best-lens-for-street-photography-01.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="the best street photography lens" class="wp-image-207329" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-best-lens-for-street-photography-01.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-best-lens-for-street-photography-01.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-best-lens-for-street-photography-01.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-best-lens-for-street-photography-01.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-best-lens-for-street-photography-01.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-best-lens-for-street-photography-01.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> To get great street photos, you&#39;ll need to be out walking for much of the day.

We&#39;ve explored some fantastic options that are capable of producing breathtaking shots (and most of them won&#39;t break the bank, either!).</p><p> Remember, when it comes to street photography, it&#39;s all about finding the right focal length that speaks to your artistic preferences. Whether you&#39;re a fan of the natural perspective of a 50mm lens or you crave the wide-angle excitement of a 35mm lens, there&#39;s something for everyone out there. And hey, if you&#39;re feeling daring, why not give the 28mm lens a whirl and capture the world from a whole new perspective?</p><p> Now over to you:</p><p> <em>Which of these lenses is your favorite? Is there one in particular that appeals to you for street shooting? Share your thoughts in the comments below!</em></p><h2 data-section id="street-photography-lens-faq"> Street photography lens FAQ </h2><div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1688592639259"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">What focal length is good for street photography?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> For a natural perspective, go with a 50mm lens. If you want to capture the energy and chaos of urban life or need a wider field of view, opt for a 35mm lens. And if you&#39;re feeling adventurous, try a 28mm lens for a unique and expansive perspective.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1688592702153"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">What type of lens is best for street photography?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> Primes are the go-to choice for street photography. They are compact, allowing you to carry them easily, and they push you to become intimately familiar with a single focal length, enabling you to shoot without hesitation.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1688592714493"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Is 50mm or 85mm better for street photography?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> While 50mm lenses are highly popular among street photographers for their versatility, the use of an 85mm lens is less common in this genre. It can be challenging to capture wider scenes with an 85mm lens, but if you prefer the telephoto field of view, don&#39;t hesitate to give it a try!</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1688592733085"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Is 35mm or 50mm better for street photography?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> Both focal lengths have their merits, and the choice ultimately depends on personal preference. A 50mm lens allows you to get slightly closer to your subject, isolating them from complex surroundings. On the other hand, a 35mm lens captures a broader view, allowing you to encompass more action in a single shot.</p></div></div><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lens-for-street-photography/">The Best Lens for Street Photography: Top 12 Picks (in 2023)</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com">Digital Photography School</a> .

It&#39;s about preserving genuine expressions, emotions, and interactions without any forced poses or awareness of the camera. Instead of arranging the scene or instructing subjects to pose, candid photography aims to document life as it unfolds organically.</p><p> In this style of photography, images are often taken while subjects are often engrossed in their activities or simply being themselves. The photographer&#39;s role is to observe and seize those fleeting, authentic moments that reveal the true essence of the subject.</p><p> That said, some candid photos <em>are</em> taken with the subject&#39;s awareness. During a wedding, for instance, guests often know that the camera is pointed in their direction, but they still act naturally, resulting in beautiful candid shots. The key here is the <em>authenticity</em> of the photo; whether or not the subject knows they&#39;re being photographed, if the image is authentic, then it&#39;s a candid shot.</p><h2 data-section id="when-is-candid-photography-useful"> When is candid photography useful?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254413" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:67.13%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1007" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-8.jpg?resize=1500%2C1007&#038;ssl=1" alt="Candid photography" class="wp-image-254413" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-8.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-8.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-8.jpg?resize=600%2C403&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-8.jpg?resize=768%2C516&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-8.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-8.jpg?resize=436%2C293&amp;ssl=1 436w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/candid-photography-8.jpg?resize=717%2C481&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Candid photography is incredibly useful in various situations and genres, allowing you to capture spontaneous and natural moments.

Always have a camera! That way, when the moment presents itself, you can quickly flick the <em>On</em> button, snag a few shots, and (if all goes well!) get a great result.</p><p> When I&#39;m on a shoot, I&#39;ll use my DSLR – but when I&#39;m <em>between</em> shoots, I carry a point-and-shoot camera. If I see a good opportunity, I&#39;ll whip it out and capture the scene. Of course, you don&#39;t need to head out and buy an expensive second body – these days, smartphone cameras are very high quality and more than adequate for most candid photography.</p><p> Also, taking a camera everywhere helps people become more comfortable with you taking their photo. I find that my friends and family just expect me to have my camera out, so when I do fire it up, it&#39;s not a signal to pose, it&#39;s just a normal part of our interaction. And when I do take an image or two, the subjects are relaxed and the photos look natural.</p><h3 data-section id="use-a-long-focal-length"> 2. Use a long focal length</h3><p> To capture candid photography without being noticed, try shooting with a long lens – a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/review-sigma-135mm-art-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="135mm prime (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">135mm prime</a> , an <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tamron-18-200mm-zoom-f3-5-6-3-lll-vc-review/" target="_blank" aria-label="18-200mm zoom (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">18-200mm zoom</a> , or a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/every-photographer-needs-70-200mm-lens/" target="_blank" aria-label="70-200mm zoom (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">70-200mm zoom</a> , for instance. As you&#39;ve probably already guessed, the farther you are from your subject, the less likely they are to know that you&#39;re taking pictures, and the more natural and relaxed they&#39;ll act.</p><p> Depending on the environment, though, a long lens can be pretty noticeable, and it may actually make people feel uncomfortable (like they&#39;re being spied on). So choose your lens widely, and if you are concerned about people&#39;s reactions, consider picking your most compact zoom.</p><p> That way, you can get your candid shots from outside people&#39;s personal space, you can go unnoticed, and you can maintain a feeling of intimacy in your compositions.</p><h3 data-section id="kill-the-flash"> 3.

Where should you stand to capture each moment? Which way will people be facing? What will they be doing? What will the light be like?</p><p> If you ask these questions in advance, you won&#39;t waste time running around and repositioning yourself when the action happens. And you&#39;ll be in the perfect spot to capture candid moments when they do occur.</p><h3 data-section id="shoot-through-store-and-restaurant-windows"> 7.

It&#39;s a fantastic way to photograph without disturbing the natural flow of the scene.</p><p> Take a stroll through a bustling area in a nearby city, keeping an eye out for interesting subjects. As you walk, glance through the windows of establishments you pass by. Often, people inside are absorbed in their activities and don&#39;t notice what&#39;s happening outside, which gives you the perfect opportunity to discreetly capture candid moments.</p><p> Make sure your camera settings are adjusted to handle the lower lighting conditions indoors. When you spot a captivating subject worth photographing, swiftly raise your camera, seize the candid shot, and continue on your way!</p><h3 data-section id="photograph-people-doing-things"> 8.

And they tend to feature more natural compositions, too.</p><p> For one, your subject will be focused on something that adds energy to a photo. It also adds context and an element of storytelling (plus, it&#39;ll take the focus off of you!).</p><p> Timing is everything in candid photography, so wait until your subject is fully focused on their activity. This will inject a feeling of authenticity into your shots, where your subject is unaware and the viewer can look on unseen.</p><p> Note that your subject doesn&#39;t need to be doing something especially involved or complex – they might be dancing, talking, playing a game, etc.</p><h3 data-section id="get-your-subject-to-interact-with-the-environment"> 9. Get your subject to interact with the environment</h3><p> If you&#39;re doing a portrait photoshoot and you want to capture some candid images, it can be a challenge to make your subject feel relaxed and act natural, especially if you&#39;ve spent the first half of the session taking posed shots. Fortunately, you can often speed the process along by encouraging your subject to look away from the camera and engage with their surroundings.</p><p> Imagine you&#39;re in a picturesque park. Instead of simply instructing your subject to stand and smile, invite them to have some fun with the environment around them. Encourage them to scramble up a gentle slope, lean down to catch the scent of a blooming flower, or take a joyful run down a winding forest path.</p><p> If you&#39;re shooting in an urban setting, suggest climbing a flight of steps, gazing up at stunning architectural wonders, or even waving to people passing by. The key is to inspire your subject to interact with their surroundings naturally.</p><p> By redirecting their focus from the camera to the environment, you&#39;ll create a relaxed atmosphere where your subject can genuinely express themselves. As they engage with the surroundings, their gestures, expressions, and body language will become more authentic, resulting in captivating candid shots that truly reflect their personality.</p><p> Remember, the more your subject immerses themselves in the environment, the less self-conscious they&#39;ll feel about being photographed!</p><h3 data-section id="photograph-people-with-people"> 10.

You can climb stairs, walk over bridges, crouch on the ground – whatever you need to do to get the photo (while staying unnoticed).</p><p> Also, if you do like the low-angle shot but feel uncomfortable crouching while doing candid photography (it is somewhat attention-grabbing, after all!), try shooting from the hip (as discussed above). While your shots may turn out crooked, it&#39;s an interesting effect that some photographers like and can lend a sense of randomness and realness to a scene.</p><h3 data-section id="watch-your-backgrounds"> 14.

However, it&#39;s important to remember that while candid shots are all about the subject, the background plays a crucial role, too. A distracting or cluttered background can draw the viewer&#39;s attention away from the subject and diminish the impact of the photo.</p><p> So before pressing the shutter, take a moment to assess the background. Ensure the backdrop features non-distracting elements, such as a stand of trees or a clean brick wall. And if your subject happens to be positioned in front of a problematic backdrop, don&#39;t fret. Simply adjust your angle and position to find a better perspective!</p><p> Alternatively, you can also use a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="wide aperture (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">wide aperture</a> to create a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-get-shallow-depth-of-field-in-your-digital-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="shallow depth of field (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shallow depth of field</a> , which will naturally blur out any distracting elements in the background. However, keep in mind that this technique works best when you are relatively close to your subject.</p><h3 data-section id="frame-images-with-foreground-elements"> 15.

Take posed shots into candid territory</h3><p> It may sound strange, but one of my favorite times to shoot candid images is when other photographers are taking formal ones.</p><p>为什么？ Well, during posed images, everyone is focused on the directing photographer, <em>not</em> you. So if, for instance, a wedding photographer is shooting a series of posed images, you can capture some wonderful candid moments simply by standing off to the side and taking a few images of your own.</p><p> I&#39;d also recommend zooming in with a telephoto lens to capture more intimate scenes, and you might also try zooming right out to get shots of the subject <em>plus</em> the photographer.</p><p> By the way, if you&#39;re the only photographer at an event or photoshoot, and you&#39;re the one taking the posed shots, I&#39;d recommend continuing to shoot <em>after</em> everyone thinks you&#39;ve finished. It&#39;s often these shots – captured moments after the posed images end – that look the best, because people relax, smile naturally, laugh, and look at each other.</p><h2 data-section id="a-guide-to-candid-photography-final-words"> A guide to candid photography: final words</h2><p> Hopefully, you now feel much more confident as a candid photographer, and you&#39;re ready to start taking some beautiful shots of your own!

Dive into the world of ICM photography.</em></strong></p><p> If you&#39;re tired of capturing the same old static images and crave a dash of creativity, then intentional camera movement photography is about to become your new best friend.</p><p> This technique is all about breaking the rules and embracing the beauty of blur. By intentionally moving your camera while the shutter is open, you can create mesmerizing, dreamlike images that defy convention. The results are reminiscent of an Impressionist painting, except instead of a paintbrush, you use a camera!</p><p> Note that ICM photography isn&#39;t just about waving your camera around and hoping for the best; it&#39;s a delicate dance between control and experimentation. By mastering the right techniques and settings, you can capture breathtaking shots that leave you (and your viewers!) in awe. So if you&#39;re ready to start capturing abstract masterpieces, let&#39;s dive right in!</p><h2 data-section id="what-is-icm-photography"> What is ICM photography?</h2><p> Intentional camera movement photography (ICM) is a technique that lets you create stunning, abstract images by moving your camera while capturing the shot. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bluebellwoodsblur750.jpg?ssl=1" alt="bluebell woods intentional camera movement" title="bluebellwoodsblur750.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> It&#39;s not a difficult technique; in fact, the beauty of ICM photography lies in its simplicity. All you need to do is adjust your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/beginners-guide-to-camera-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="camera settings (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">camera settings</a> to keep the shutter open for longer than usual. Then, as you intentionally move your camera from one point to another, the magic happens. Your camera captures the moving scene and transforms it into dreamy, blurry subjects while the world rushes past.</p><h2 data-section id="when-is-the-intentional-camera-movement-technique-useful"> When is the intentional camera movement technique useful? </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ICMburtonbshorejul15750.jpg?ssl=1" alt="intentional camera movement on a beach" title="ICMburtonbshorejul15750.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> You can use the ICM technique to photograph a wide array of subjects. Let&#39;s explore the various scenarios where ICM can truly shine:</p><ul><li> <strong>Landscapes:</strong> One of the best uses of ICM is in capturing breathtaking landscapes. By intentionally blurring the details, you can emphasize the lines, forms, and vibrant colors present in nature. Whether you&#39;re photographing a dense forest, a vast ocean, or an expansive prairie, ICM can help you create mesmerizing images that focus on the essence of the scene.</li><li> <strong>Moving subjects:</strong> Don&#39;t let the name fool you; ICM isn&#39;t just for stationary subjects. In fact, it can be particularly compelling when applied to moving subjects such as cars, sports players, or wildlife. By deliberately following the movement with your camera, you can create a captivating effect where the subject remains relatively sharp against a beautifully smooth and dynamic background. (This technique is also known as <em><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-tips-master-panning-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">panning</a></em> .)</li><li> <strong>Flower photography:</strong> If you&#39;re passionate about capturing the delicate beauty of flowers, ICM can add a touch of abstraction to your images. By intentionally blurring the scene, you can highlight the vibrant colors and elegant shapes of the flowers, creating a dreamy and artistic interpretation of nature.</li><li> <strong>Street photography:</strong> Surprisingly, ICM can even be incorporated into street photography. It offers a unique way to accentuate the architectural lines of buildings and convey the fast-paced energy of urban life. By intentionally moving your camera while capturing the scene, you can infuse your street photographs with a sense of motion and dynamism.</li></ul><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254364" style="width:480px"><span class="space" style="width:480px; padding-top:125%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="480" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-22.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Intentional camera movement (ICM) photography" class="wp-image-254364" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-22.jpg?resize=480%2C600&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-22.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-22.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-22.jpg?resize=717%2C896&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-22.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Bottom line: ICM photography opens up a world of creative possibilities, allowing you to transcend traditional photography and explore new dimensions of artistry. With the right subjects and a dash of experimentation, you can achieve remarkable results that transform ordinary scenes into extraordinary works of art.</p><h2 data-section id="essential-equipment-for-icm-photography"> Essential equipment for ICM photography </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/rockpoolsportlandICM750.jpg?ssl=1" alt="intentional camera movement abstract" title="rockpoolsportlandICM750.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> The intentional camera movement approach is incredibly accessible. You don&#39;t need fancy or expensive gear to get started. Here&#39;s what I recommend:</p><ul><li> <strong>Camera:</strong> Any camera that allows you to manually adjust the shutter speed will work. This includes DSLR and interchangeable-lens mirrorless cameras.</li><li> <strong>Lens:</strong> While you can use any lens for ICM photography, a slightly longer lens, like an 85mm or a 70-200mm, can make it easier to achieve strong blur effects. Longer lenses also help you focus on interesting patterns and colors. If possible, use a lens with manual focusing capabilities.</li><li> <strong>Filters:</strong> ICM photography requires long shutter speeds, which means you&#39;ll need to control the amount of light hitting the camera sensor. If you shoot during the early morning or evening, you&#39;re good to go. But if you want to try ICM during the day, consider using a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/neutral-density-filters-landscape-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="neutral density (ND) filter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">neutral density (ND) filter</a> . It acts like sunglasses for your lens, reducing the light and preventing overexposure. Another option is a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-and-buy-polarizing-filters/" target="_blank" aria-label="polarizing filter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">polarizing filter</a> , which cuts down on light and enhances colors. I personally prefer starting with a polarizing filter and adding a 2-stop or 4-stop ND filter if needed.</li><li> <strong>Tripod (optional):</strong> If you want ultra-smooth ICM images with flat horizons or vertical lines, a tripod can be helpful. Use a pan-and-tilt head for the best results. However, in most cases, a tripod isn&#39;t necessary. You can achieve great ICM images with just your camera, lens, and creative movements.</li></ul><p> Remember, the gear doesn&#39;t make the photographer. It&#39;s your creativity and vision that truly matter in ICM photography. So don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t have the latest equipment. Focus on exploring the technique and capturing unique images with what you have.</p><h2 data-section id="the-best-icm-photography-settings"> The best ICM photography settings</h2><p> If you&#39;re ready to dive into the exciting world of intentional camera movement photography, it&#39;s crucial to set your camera up properly to achieve those captivating and dreamy effects. Here are the essential ICM settings I recommend:</p><ul><li> Shutter Priority mode</li><li> 1/2s shutter speed</li><li> ISO 100</li><li> Manual focus</li><li> Image stabilization off</li></ul><p> Now let&#39;s delve into these settings in greater detail. Doing intentional camera movement photography is all about controlling the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> . Longer shutter speeds allow you to move your camera for more time, hence increasing the blur effect – whereas shorter shutter speeds only let you move your camera for fractions of a second, decreasing the blur effect. Therefore, by manually changing the shutter speed value, you can change the intensity of the effect!</p><p> <a aria-label="Shutter Priority mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Shutter Priority mode</a> , unlike Aperture Priority, Program, or Auto mode, offers complete control over your camera&#39;s shutter speed, making it an ideal choice for the ICM technique. You can set the desired shutter speed and ISO, while the camera automatically selects an appropriate aperture for a well-exposed image.</p><p> When it comes to selecting a specific shutter speed for ICM photography, there is no universal best choice. The desired effect depends on the look you want to achieve. For an ultra-abstract shot, you might opt for a longer exposure, such as 10 seconds. On the other hand, if you prefer a subtly blurry image, a faster shutter speed, like 1/30s, might be suitable.</p><p> Additionally, consider that the length of your lens can affect the level of blur, with longer lenses producing greater blur than wider lenses. However, as a starting point, I recommend trying out a shutter speed of 1/2s. If you&#39;re uncertain, experiment with different shutter speeds, review the results on your camera&#39;s screen, make adjustments, and continue refining your technique.</p><p> I highly recommend using your camera&#39;s base <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO setting (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO setting</a> . Not only does it prevent unsightly noise from compromising your images, but it also allows you to extend the shutter speed further, even in bright lighting conditions.</p><p> And to ensure that your subject remains (relatively) sharp, <a aria-label="manually focus (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dont-afraid-manual-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">manually focus</a> your lens in advance. This way, you won&#39;t have to worry about the camera struggling to find focus, which can be a problem in low-light situations or when using a neutral-density filter.</p><p> Finally, if your lens includes image stabilization, remember to deactivate it. Image stabilization tries to compensate for motion, which can hinder the desired blur effect in ICM photography.</p><h2 data-section id="how-to-do-icm-photography-my-three-step-approach"> How to do ICM photography: My three-step approach</h2><p> Now that you&#39;re familiar with the basic ICM settings and gear, it&#39;s time to have some fun! Here&#39;s what you do to achieve amazing results:</p><h3 data-section id="step-choose-a-subject"> Step 1: Choose a subject</h3><p> The first step to creating amazing ICM shots is selecting the perfect subject to work with.</p><p> Now, you might be wondering, “What&#39;s the best subject for ICM photography?” Well, the fantastic thing about ICM is that you can get creative with just about anything! But as you&#39;re starting out, it&#39;s helpful to pick a subject with clear lines and interesting shapes.</p><p> Imagine rows of majestic trees in a forest or the captivating horizon line at a beautiful beach. Even the edges of tall buildings can make for captivating ICM subjects. The more color and texture you can include in your scene, the better – it adds some wonderful pizzazz to your shot!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254365" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:62.73%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="941" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-24.jpg?resize=1500%2C941&#038;ssl=1" alt="Intentional camera movement (ICM) photography" class="wp-image-254365" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-24.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-24.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-24.jpg?resize=600%2C376&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-24.jpg?resize=768%2C482&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-24.jpg?resize=717%2C450&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Here&#39;s a little tip: Shooting in low-light conditions is ideal for ICM. So if you can, try to plan your ICM adventures during the magical <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-photograph-golden-hour/" target="_blank" aria-label="golden hours (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">golden hours</a> – just after sunrise and just before sunset – or during the enchanting <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-quick-tips-for-better-blue-hour-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="blue hour (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">blue hour</a> . Working at night can also produce some stunning results.</p><p> Of course, you can experiment with ICM in bright light too – like on a sunny afternoon – but in that case, you&#39;ll often need to use a filter to prevent overexposure.</p><h3 data-section id="step-select-your-settings-and-compose"> Step 2: Select your settings and compose</h3><p> Once you&#39;ve got your subject in mind, let&#39;s dive into the nitty-gritty of setting up your shot. It&#39;s time to position your subject just right and get those settings dialed in. Here&#39;s how to do it:</p><p> First things first, take a moment to frame your shot. Remember, the end result won&#39;t resemble what you see through the viewfinder, but it&#39;s still important to consider the size and position of the main elements in your scene. Move closer or farther away, or adjust your zoom, until you&#39;re satisfied with the composition. Then switch your lens to manual focus and turn the lens focus ring until your subject is reasonably sharp.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254366" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:80%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1200" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-23.jpg?resize=1500%2C1200&#038;ssl=1" alt="Intentional camera movement (ICM) photography" class="wp-image-254366" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-23.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-23.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-23.jpg?resize=600%2C480&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-23.jpg?resize=768%2C614&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-23.jpg?resize=717%2C574&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Set your camera to Shutter Priority mode and immediately choose ISO 100. Think about how heavily you want your subject to blur and choose a shutter speed accordingly. As I said above, 1/2s is a good starting point, but you might potentially start at 1s or more if you want a lot of blur.</p><p> One important note: Keep an eye on the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="aperture value (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture value</a> suggested by your camera. If it&#39;s blinking or showing “high,” it means the light is too strong, and your image will be overexposed. In that case, you have two options. You can either increase the shutter speed until the blinking disappears, or you can use a filter to reduce the amount of light entering the camera. (If you do add a filter, make sure you check the aperture value one more time before proceeding!)</p><h3 data-section id="step-move-your-camera-while-pressing-the-shutter"> Step 3: Move your camera while pressing the shutter</h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-254367" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Intentional camera movement (ICM) photography" class="wp-image-254367" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/intentional-camera-movement-photography-25.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> At this point, you&#39;re ready to take a photo, so start moving your camera in a smooth and deliberate manner.

If you&#39;re only snapping a few shots, chances are you won&#39;t end up with anything extraordinary, and you&#39;ll miss out on valuable learning opportunities.</p><p> To truly excel at intentional camera movement, you need to dedicate ample time to shooting and exploring different possibilities. Don&#39;t be afraid to click that shutter button repeatedly! The more photos you take, the more you&#39;ll familiarize yourself with the nuances of ICM and understand what works and what doesn&#39;t.</p><p> Once you&#39;ve captured a bunch of shots, set aside some quality time to review them. Take a close look at each image and consider what you like and dislike about it. Pay attention to the various elements, the movement, and the overall composition. This process of reflection and analysis will help you refine your technique and develop your own unique style.</p><p> Additionally, don&#39;t be afraid to experiment with different focal lengths and subjects. By trying out various approaches, you&#39;ll gain a better sense of your preferences and discover the aspects of ICM photography that truly resonate with you.</p><h3 data-section id="consider-including-one-sharp-element"> 2. Consider including one sharp element </h3><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bluebellaction750.jpg?ssl=1" alt="intentional camera movement in bluebell woods" title="bluebellaction750.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Intentional camera movement photography is all about creating abstract images, but adding a touch of clarity or a recognizable element can enhance the overall impact of your final photo. Think of it as giving your viewer an anchor amidst the artistic chaos.</p><p> Including at least one sharp or easily identifiable subject within your abstract composition can provide a point of reference for your audience. It gives them something to hold onto while they explore the mesmerizing swirls and blurs of the image.</p><p> For example, imagine capturing the graceful movement of trees in a forest, with branches blending into a dreamy haze. Amidst this captivating blur, having one tree trunk sharply in focus can create a striking contrast. It draws attention and adds a sense of structure to the otherwise ethereal scene.</p><p> The sharp element could be anything that stands out in the midst of your intentional camera movements. It could be a person&#39;s silhouette, a prominent architectural feature, or even a colorful object placed strategically within the frame. The key is to ensure that this element remains clear and distinct, providing a visual focal point.</p><h3 data-section id="shoot-the-same-subject-at-different-times"> 3.

Light and shadow play a significant role in ICM, and by capturing your subject during various lighting conditions, you&#39;ll discover how the atmosphere and mood can change dramatically.</p><p> Once you&#39;ve found a subject that catches your eye, don&#39;t just snap a single shot and move on. Make a mental note of the subject and return to it repeatedly, capturing ICM shots at different times, such as during the golden hours (just after sunrise and just before sunset), the blue hour (the brief period before sunrise and after sunset), or even at night.</p><p> By exploring these different timeframes, you&#39;ll witness how the interplay of light and shadow transforms your subject, creating unique and captivating ICM images. Not only will this allow you to experiment with different effects, but it will also give you a chance to refine your skills and find your own personal style.</p><h2 data-section id="intentional-camera-movement-photography-final-words"> Intentional camera movement photography: final words</h2><p> And there you have it!

We&#39;ve handpicked 16 outstanding options to elevate your photos.</em></strong></p><p> Selecting the best lens for <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-ways-to-take-stunning-portraits/" class="ek-link">portrait photography</a> can be overwhelming, but it&#39;s also an essential task, whether you&#39;re a beginner, an intermediate enthusiast, or a professional. The right portrait lens will capture crisp, flattering images with a beautiful background blur – while the <em>wrong</em> portrait lens will produce soft photos that are prone to unpleasant distortion.</p><p> The good news is that there are plenty of amazing portrait lenses available, and many of them come with relatively affordable price tags. The bad news is that sorting through the wide array of focal lengths, features, compatibilities, sizes, and prices can be a time-consuming headache. Fortunately, I&#39;ve been capturing portraits for years, and I think I can help you out.</p><p> Below, I share the 16 best portrait lenses for photographers, including options for a variety of different camera types (DSLR and mirrorless, full-frame and APS-C), and portrait specialties. My list of top-notch portrait glass also offers selections for beginners on a budget, professionals seeking the best of the best, and everything in between.</p><p> Ready to grab the lens that&#39;ll take your portraits to the next level? Let&#39;s dive right in, starting with my number one pick:</p><h2 id="1-nikon-50mm-f-1-8g"> 1.

The lens is tack sharp and focuses quickly, and the 50mm focal length is great for headshots, medium shots, and even wider shots with groups. The large f/1.8 aperture turns busy backgrounds into buttery smooth <a aria-label="bokeh (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-nice-bokeh-in-plain-english/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">bokeh</a> , and it works great in low-light situations, too. I have been shooting with this lens for nearly a decade and still bring it with me to portrait sessions because it just works so well.</p><p> You can also find similar inexpensive lenses from Sony, Canon, and other manufacturers – several of which are featured on this list! – so if you don&#39;t shoot with Nikon cameras, you can still pick up a 50mm f/1.8 lens for your camera at a great price.

Whether you&#39;re capturing portraits at a dimly lit venue or during the golden hour, this lens allows you to maintain a fast shutter speed, resulting in sharp images that truly shine.</p><p> It&#39;s important to note that this lens is not the most compact option out there, so it may not be the best choice for casual or travel-oriented portrait photography. However, if you&#39;re seeking to take your portraits to the next level and already have a 50mm and an 85mm lens in your kit, the Sony FE 135mm f/1.8 is an excellent addition. Its exceptional image quality, telephoto reach, and ability to handle low light make it a go-to choice for professionals and serious enthusiasts.</p><p> While the Sony FE 135mm f/1.8 comes with a higher price tag, its performance and image results make it worth every penny. If you&#39;re looking to invest in a lens that truly showcases your subject in the best possible light, this lens will not disappoint.</p><h3 id="pros"> Pros</h3><ul><li> Gorgeous bokeh</li><li> f/1.8 maximum aperture</li><li> Great focal length for headshots</li><li> Solid build</li></ul><h3 id="cons"> Cons</h3><ul><li> Extremely expensive</li><li> Big and heavy</li></ul><h2 data-section id="canon-rf-mm-f-l-usm"> 8.

This lens has gained a well-deserved reputation among professionals and serious enthusiasts alike.</p><p> What sets the Canon RF 85mm f/1.2L USM apart is its exceptional image quality and versatility. The lens boasts insanely sharp optics that capture every detail with stunning clarity. Whether you&#39;re shooting headshots, half-body portraits, or even environmental portraits, this lens delivers outstanding results.</p><p> But what truly makes the Canon RF 85mm f/1.2L USM shine is its wide maximum aperture of f/1.2. This is a rare feature that allows you to achieve incredibly smooth and creamy bokeh, separating your subject from the background in a breathtaking way. Whether you&#39;re shooting in a studio or a natural environment, this lens will give your portraits that professional, dreamy look.</p><p> Beyond its optical prowess, the Canon RF 85mm f/1.2L USM offers a fantastic focal length for a wide range of portrait styles and approaches. It provides just the right amount of compression to flatter your subjects, making it ideal for capturing emotions and expressions with depth and impact. Whether you&#39;re photographing individuals or couples, this lens excels in creating captivating portraits that tell a story.</p><p> Now, it&#39;s important to note that the Canon RF 85mm f/1.2L USM is not without its drawbacks. Firstly, it is on the larger and heavier side, which may make it less ideal for casual or on-the-go shooting. Additionally, the price tag of this lens is in the mid-$2000s, placing it in the higher-end range. However, for professionals and serious enthusiasts who value uncompromising image quality and exceptional performance, the Canon RF 85mm f/1.2L USM is a true gem that will elevate your portrait photography to new heights.</p><h3 id="pros"> Pros</h3><ul><li> f/1.2 maximum aperture</li><li> Classic portrait focal length</li><li> Beautiful image quality</li></ul><h3 id="cons"> Cons</h3><ul><li> Pricey</li><li> RF-mount only</li></ul><h2 id="4-sigma-40mm-f-1-4-dg-hsm-art"> 9.

Its 40mm focal length is wider than every other lens on this list, perfect for photographers who prefer to let a little more into their field of view to get a unique look. It&#39;s razor sharp even wide open, and the f/1.4 aperture means you can get full-body shots while keeping the background nice and blurry.</p><p> Autofocus is fast, though it&#39;s not quite comparable to other lenses like the Canon 85mm f/1.4, and this lens is a heavy beast that will give your arms a workout. The 40mm focal length results in a bit of distortion when shooting close-ups and headshots, but in normal daily use this wasn&#39;t a huge problem for me. Despite these drawbacks, there&#39;s almost an intangible beauty to this lens that&#39;s difficult to describe, which makes it wonderful for portraits as well as everyday shooting. I especially like how I can get several people in a shot for group portrait scenarios and still create a beautiful blurry background; at the end of the day, those results matter to me more than anything else.</p><h3 id="pros"> Pros</h3><ul><li> Amazing sharpness, even wide open at f/1.4</li><li> Good choice for daily use in mixed environments, not just portraits</li><li> Solid construction and an extra-large rubber grip around the focusing ring</li></ul><h3 id="cons"> Cons</h3><ul><li> Expensive; it shoots great photos, but you pay a premium</li><li> 40mm is good for portraits, but not as widely used as longer focal lengths like 85mm</li><li> Autofocus is fine, but not as fast as some class-leading lenses</li></ul><h2 id="9-nikon-z-85mm-f-1-8-s"> 10.

Why not include other lenses with more varied focal lengths? Well, 85mm is the sweet spot for many portrait photographers, and when Nikon made this lens for their Z-mount mirrorless cameras, they took everything they had learned from their already-exceptional F-mount DSLR lenses and kicked it up a notch. It&#39;s got everything you would expect in a lens of this caliber and in this price range: sharp optics, solid construction, a massive grip for focusing, and good weather sealing – all in a package that isn&#39;t too big and won&#39;t weigh you down during long photo sessions.</p><p> While it&#39;s true that the f/1.8 aperture isn&#39;t as wide as the Canon 85mm f/1.4 or Sony 85mm f/1.4, this lens is also much less expensive and gets the job done nearly as well. And f/1.8 lenses can still be used in low light and are capable of very shallow depth of field, even if it&#39;s not quite as shallow as its f/1.4 brethren. (For reference, I almost never shoot my Nikon 85mm lens wider than f/2 or f/2.4, since the depth of field is wafer-thin.) The 85mm f/1.8 doesn&#39;t have built-in image stabilization, but almost every Nikon mirrorless camera comes with that already, so you can get sharp shots at slow shutter speeds even with non-stabilized lenses. If you use Nikon Z-mount cameras and want a great portrait lens without breaking the bank, this is the one to get.</p><h3 id="pros"> Pros</h3><ul><li> Excellent image quality even on high-megapixel cameras like the <a aria-label="Nikon Z7 II (opens in a new tab)" href="https://geni.us/NikonZ7II" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Nikon Z7 II</a></li><li> Massive rubberized focus ring is easy to grip and rotate, and can also be assigned to adjust aperture or exposure compensation</li><li> Very good autofocus is well-suited to photos and videos</li></ul><h3 id="cons"> Cons</h3><ul><li> Maximum f/1.8 aperture isn&#39;t as bright as some competing lenses that go to f/1.4 or f/1.2</li><li> Some photographers prefer slightly smaller lenses</li></ul><h2 id="5-canon-ef-50mm-f-1-2l-usm"> 11.

It checks nearly every possible box a portrait photographer might have on their wishlist, and to this day, it is widely regarded as one of the best portrait lenses of all time. Its medium telephoto focal length of 105mm means you can get beautiful close-ups without standing nose-to-nose with your subjects, and its incredible sharpness is the envy of many photographers.

It&#39;s too bulky for daily casual shooting, and the 105mm focal length is ill-suited for nature, sports, and most other types of photography.

While the 28-70mm focal length essentially does the same work as two or three other lenses, its price is so high you could just purchase individual lenses instead. However, for an all-in-one workhorse, this lens is hard to beat. As you might expect, it is extremely sharp wide open at all focal lengths, has fast and reliable autofocus, and even sports a control ring that can be customized to change settings like aperture and ISO. If you shoot with Canon mirrorless cameras, like wider focal lengths, and want one lens to rule them all, this should be at the top of your list.</p><h3 id="pros"> Pros</h3><ul><li> Incredible versatility thanks to the extra-large f/2 maximum aperture across the entire focal range</li><li> Beautiful image quality at every focal length and aperture</li><li> Fast, reliable autofocus</li><li> Weather-resistant construction</li></ul><h3 id="cons"> Cons</h3><ul><li> Very expensive; given the price of this lens, some photographers might prefer buying a few prime lenses, instead</li><li> Minimum focal length isn&#39;t as wide as the 24mm found on other lenses (however, 24-70mm lenses have smaller maximum apertures of f/2.8 instead of f/2)</li></ul><h2 id="10-tamron-70-210mm-f-4-di-vc-usd"> 14.

Available for several hundred – as opposed to several <em>thousand</em> – dollars, this beauty from Tamron lets you get almost the same level of performance as high-end 70-200mm f/2.8 lenses and even includes image stabilization and weather sealing.</p><p> So what&#39;s the catch? For one, the maximum aperture of f/4 will frustrate plenty of professional portrait photographers. It&#39;s great if you have lots of light, but if you want a shallow depth of field or good low-light shots, you&#39;re out of luck. It&#39;s not a major drawback by any means, but it doesn&#39;t quite stack up against some of the more professional-oriented portrait lenses you can buy. This lens also isn&#39;t as sharp as its more expensive counterparts, especially in the corners, and build quality isn&#39;t as solid as other lenses, either. However, what this lens lacks in features it more than makes up for in price. You can easily capture client-worthy portraits with this lens, and if you are a new photographer looking to get a lot while spending a little, this lens deserves your consideration.</p><h3 id="pros"> Pros</h3><ul><li> Inexpensive but still produces quality portraits</li><li> 70-210mm focal range is longer than competing lenses</li><li> Respectable feature set including image stabilization</li><li> High-quality construction</li></ul><h3 id="cons"> Cons</h3><ul><li> Image quality can&#39;t match the pixel-perfect sharpness of other lenses on this list</li><li> The f/4 aperture is limiting in low-light situations</li><li> Autofocus is good but not quite on par with other lenses</li></ul><h2 data-section id="sony-fe-mm-f-gm-ii"> 15.

This zoom lens may not be the go-to option for portrait specialists seeking ultra-wide apertures and top-notch optics, but it brings a lot to the table for those who want to cover various shooting scenarios.</p><p> With a focal length range of 24-70mm, you have the flexibility to capture a wide range of images. Want to include the subject in their environment? Go wider and capture stunning environmental shots. Need to take full-body or half-body shots at an event? This lens has got you covered. And when it comes to tighter headshots, you can still achieve beautiful results with the 70mm reach.</p><p> The optical performance of this lens is impressive, capturing sharp and detailed images that can be printed to make great prints. While the maximum aperture of f/2.8 may not be as wide as the primes on this list, it still allows you to create pleasing bokeh and draw attention to your subject. It&#39;s a balance between versatility and performance.</p><p> Keep in mind that zoom lenses with wider apertures tend to be pricier, and the Sony FE 24-70mm f/2.8 GM is no exception. Additionally, it&#39;s not the most compact option, so if you prefer a more casual shooting style, you might find it a bit bulky. However, if you&#39;re a professional Sony shooter looking for a reliable all-in-one solution, this lens is definitely worth considering.</p><p> So, if you want a lens that can handle a variety of shooting situations while delivering solid image quality, the Sony FE 24-70mm f/2.8 GM is an excellent choice for portrait photographers who like to explore different genres and capture diverse moments with ease.</p><h3 id="pros"> Pros</h3><ul><li> Excellent focal-length range</li><li> Great optics</li><li> Outstanding build quality</li></ul><h3 id="cons"> Cons</h3><ul><li> Expensive</li><li> f/2.8 maximum aperture is somewhat limiting</li></ul><h2 data-section id="nikon-z-mm-f-s"> 16.

This lens marks a significant milestone for Nikon, as it&#39;s been a while since they released a 50mm lens with autofocus technology. But let me tell you, it&#39;s worth the wait!</p><p> Now, we all know the benefits of the classic 50mm focal length for portrait photography. It&#39;s versatile, allowing you to capture a variety of shots from half-body portraits to headshots. But what sets this lens apart is its incredible f/1.2 maximum aperture. With such a wide aperture, you can achieve dreamy bokeh that adds a touch of magic to your portraits. Imagine a beautifully blurred background that makes your subject pop, creating that professional and artistic look.</p><p> When it comes to the optical quality, Nikon doesn&#39;t disappoint. The image quality is simply stunning, delivering sharpness and clarity that will leave you in awe. Whether you&#39;re capturing portraits for social media, printing large photos, or displaying your work on a website, this lens ensures your images will look their absolute best.</p><p> In terms of build quality, the Nikon Z 50mm f/1.2 S doesn&#39;t cut any corners. It&#39;s designed to withstand challenging shooting conditions, making it an excellent choice for outdoor portrait sessions.

It features a large manual focusing ring that provides precise control, perfect for when you want to fine-tune the focus manually. Additionally, there&#39;s a programmable control ring that allows you to customize its function according to your shooting preferences. It&#39;s these little details that make the shooting experience with this lens so enjoyable and efficient.</p><p> Now, it&#39;s worth noting that the Nikon Z 50mm f/1.2 S lens is not lightweight. It has a solid build and feels substantial in your hands. If you prefer a more casual shooting style or prioritize portability, this lens might not be the best choice for you. However, for passionate Nikon Z users who want top-of-the-line performance and are willing to invest in quality, this lens is an enticing option that will take your portrait photography to new heights.</p><h3 id="pros"> Pros</h3><ul><li> Breathtaking bokeh</li><li> Standard portrait focal length</li><li> Amazing low-light capabilities</li><li> Excellent ergonomics</li></ul><h3 id="cons"> Cons</h3><ul><li> Ultra-expensive</li><li> Heavy</li></ul><h2 id="best-lenses-for-portrait-photography-final-words"> Best lenses for portrait photography: final words</h2><p> Those are my top picks for portrait lenses in 2023, and I hope this gives you several options to consider – whether you&#39;re new to portraiture or you&#39;re a seasoned professional looking to upgrade your gear.</p><p> Great glass is just one component of portrait photography, though.

Leave your thoughts in the comments below!</em></p><h2 id="best-portrait-photography-lenses-faq"> Best portrait photography lenses FAQ </h2><div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1634766075403"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Do I need a prime lens to shoot portraits?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> No, but it helps. Prime lenses have wide apertures and sharp optics, which is why they are preferred by portrait photographers. Today&#39;s zoom lenses are better than the zooms of ten or twenty years ago, but you will still get the best results with a prime lens.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1634766149961"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">What is the best focal length for portraits?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> While everyone has their own preferences, 85mm is often considered to be a good portrait focal length. If you can only get one portrait lens, I would recommend going with an 85mm; this works well for headshots, full-body portraits, and group shots, too.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1634766289723"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">How can I shoot portraits with the kit zoom lens that came with my camera?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> While I do not recommend kit zoom lenses for paid client work, it is certainly possible to shoot portraits with them. Zoom in as far as you can go, open your aperture as wide as possible, put a lot of distance between your subject and the background, and you can get some decent shots.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1634766420612"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Is a DSLR or mirrorless camera better for portraits?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> Either type of camera is fully capable of producing great portraits. Mirrorless cameras have features like eye-detect autofocus that can certainly help, but even today many photographers still prefer DSLRs over mirrorless. It all comes down to personal preference. Thankfully, if you currently shoot with a Nikon or Canon DSLR and want to upgrade to mirrorless someday, both companies make adapters that let you use your current lenses on mirrorless cameras without any drop in quality.</p></div></div><p> The post<a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-lens-for-portrait-photography/">16 Best Lenses for Portrait Photography (2023)</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com">Digital Photography School</a> .
