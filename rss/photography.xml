aria-label="macro photography (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">微距摄影</a>，您从哪里开始？如何记录一片微小的雪花及其美丽的细节？</p><p>多年来我一直在拍摄雪花。在这篇文章中，我将向您展示拍摄像我一样的照片所需了解的所有信息，包括：</p><ul><li>完美的雪花齿轮设置</li><li>如何使整个雪花清晰且清晰</li><li>拍摄雪花的最佳时间（这一点很关键！）</li><li>获得最佳效果的提示和技巧</li></ul><p>完成后，您将知道如何像专业人士一样拍摄雪花 - 并且您将知道入门所需的完美装备清单。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="snowflake-photography-gear">雪花摄影装备</h2><p>由于雪花非常小，因此您无法使用日常设备捕捉充满画面的图像。在拍摄雪花之前，您需要组装专业的设置。这是我的建议：</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-camera-and-lens">相机和镜头</h3><p>雪花的平均直径约为 2 毫米到 5 毫米，因此可以填满整个框架——我鼓励这样做！ – 需要强大的放大倍数。</p><p>任何相机都可以使用，只要它具有可更换镜头功能。但您需要将镜头设置为超过 1:1 的放大倍率，因此您必须至少拥有以下一项：</p><ul><li>具有 2:1（或更大）聚焦比的专用<a aria-label="macro lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/choose-perfect-macro-lens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">微距镜头</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/extension-tubes-close-up-photography-lesson-2/" target="_blank" aria-label="extension tubes (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">延长管</a>一套</li><li><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/macro-photography-budget-introduction-close-filters/" target="_blank" aria-label="Close-up filters (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">特写滤镜</a></li></ul><p>上述任何一种都可以，但请注意，大多数微距镜头都<em>无法</em>达到 2:1 的放大倍率；购买前，您需要检查规格（否则，您将无法填充框架）。</p><p>就我个人而言，我很喜欢延长管选项，它通常可以让您获得接近 2:1 的放大倍率。延长管是空心的，位于相机和镜头之间，如下所示： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/macro-setup.jpg?ssl=1" alt="snowflake photography camera setup" title="宏设置.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>它们不需要任何专业知识，而且不含玻璃，因此您不必担心清晰度问题。</p><p>特写滤镜是另一个不错的选择。它们就像相机的老花镜一样，您可以将多个堆叠在一起以增强效果。与延长管不同，近摄滤镜可能会导致光学问题——我发现它们会导致画面边缘变形——但它们很便宜，而且在拍摄雪花时，你可能会裁剪掉边缘。</p><p>请记住，特写滤镜确实会干扰大多数相机的自动对焦功能。但是，如果您遵循我的建议，您将使用<a aria-label="manual focus (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dont-afraid-manual-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">手动对焦</a>进行雪花摄影，因此这不会成为问题。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/How-to-Photograph-Snowflakes-2.jpg?ssl=1" alt="two snowflakes together" title="如何拍摄雪花-2.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="lighting">灯光</h3><p>照亮雪花似乎是一个挑战，但实际上非常简单：使用环形闪光灯。环形闪光灯安装在镜头前部，因此不会在拍摄对象上投射阴影，而且它们非常适合创造艺术雪花照明。</p><p>大多数环形闪光灯（我使用<a aria-label="Canon MR-14EX (opens in a new tab)" href="https://geni.us/CanonMR14EXIIdPS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">佳能 MR-14EX</a> ）可以让您控制两组光线，并使一组比另一组更亮。我喜欢调暗一侧，然后用一半的闪光灯照亮每片雪花。请注意，相机的角度会产生巨大的差异，获得正确的角度可以极大地改变结果，因此进行<em>大量</em>实验肯定是值得的，尤其是在刚开始时。</p><p>下面，我并排放置了两张雪花照片。看到不同？相机角度仅偏离几度，但其中一片雪花看起来是乳白色的，而另一片则是透明的。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/How-to-Photograph-Snowflakes-3.jpg?ssl=1" alt="how to photograph snowflakes making angle adjustments" title="如何拍摄雪花-3.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>同样，需要进行大量实验才能找到这些完美的角度，有时我什至使用小画笔将雪花推向正确的方向。 （不过，我会尽量避免这种情况，因为操纵时晶体经常会破碎。）</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-background">的背景</h3><p>从技术上讲，您可以在许多不同的背景上拍摄雪花。</p><p>但我的每一张雪花照片 - 包括本文中的所有照片！ – 用同样的旧黑色手套制成。出于多种原因，它是我的设置的重要组成部分。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mitten.jpg?ssl=1" alt="black mitten for snowflake photo background" title="手套.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>其一，手套为雪花创造了深色背景，产生了惊人的对比度。此外，手套还具有隔热功能——冰被纤维捕获，仅在几个点上接触，因此传递的热量最少，雪花保持固态。</p><p>最后，手套有助于将雪花隔离在黑色的海洋上。 （是的，每个镜头都存在一些羊毛纤维，但这些纤维比毛毡等平坦而细致的表面更容易编辑！）</p><p>底线：戴上手套！它不需要是黑色的，但我建议您坚持使用深色（这样您就可以保持我上面讨论的对比度）。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-photograph-snowflakes-the-step-by-step-process">如何拍摄雪花：分步过程</h2><p>现在您已经熟悉了雪花摄影的基本装备，是时候讨论实际的摄影过程了： </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="step-find-the-right-flakes">第 1 步：找到合适的薄片</h3><p>首先，等到开始下雪。</p><p>然后拿起你的深色手套并将其放在外面。 （不要戴手套；你不想促进热传递！）</p><p>观察手套，一旦几片雪花飘落，请仔细观察。您想要“美丽”的降雪，<em>而不是</em>冰球或覆盖着冰冻水滴的晶体。</p><p>不同的降雪会产生不同类型的雪花。在找到最适合摄影的晶体之前，您可能需要戴上手套观察几场降雪：大而干净的雪花，有很多树枝，如下图所示。 </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/How-to-Photograph-Snowflakes-4.jpg?ssl=1" alt="snowflake close-up photography" title="如何拍摄雪花-4.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>在降雪<em>期间</em>拍摄雪花非常重要。因此，一旦找到合适的雪花，就可以开始拍摄。如果等待一小时，晶体就会开始熔化或升华（即蒸发而不先熔化），并且尖锐的晶体边缘很快就会消失。</p><p>如果您刚刚错过了降雪，并且不确定是否有时间拍摄，请尝试将手套放在刚落下的雪上，然后再次拿起；纤维会接住掉落的雪花，您将有机会在雪花进一步恶化之前拍摄一些照片。 </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="step-capture-a-series-of-images-for-focus-stacking">步骤 2：拍摄一系列图像进行焦点堆叠</h3><p>一旦找到合适的降雪和合适的雪花，您就需要以<em><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/a-beginners-guide-to-focus-stacking/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">焦点堆叠</a></em>为目标进行拍摄。</p><p>我这是什么意思？焦点堆叠是一种技术，您可以在多个不同的焦点处拍摄同一主题的多个帧，然后在后期处理中将它们组合起来以获得最终的对焦图像。</p><p>因此，在拍摄雪花时，只需前后移动相机，同时拍摄一系列图像即可。 （连拍模式很有帮助；关键是拍摄足够的图像，使雪花的每个部分至少在一张照片中都清晰可见。）</p><p>您会看到，在如此高的放大倍率下，任何时候都只有一小片雪花会成为焦点。单个雪花镜头如下所示： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/How-to-Photograph-Snowflakes-6.jpg?ssl=1" alt="one of many snowflake images that go into a final focus-stacked shot" title="如何拍摄雪花-6.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>但是，通过足够的拍摄和一点焦点堆叠魔法，你最终会得到这样的镜头： </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/How-to-Photograph-Snowflakes-5.jpg?ssl=1" alt="focus-stacked snowflake image" title="如何拍摄雪花-5.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p>上图是最终构图中使用的 33 个镜头之一。组合框架的过程很漫长，部分原因是每张图像都是在没有三脚架的情况下完成的 - 它们都是手持式的。事实上，我拍摄的帧比我使用的多得多，我堆叠的 33 个帧是从总共 112 个帧中选出的！</p><p>我为什么不使用三脚架？嗯，将三脚架设置到正确的角度并调整聚焦轨以使一切完美需要花费大量时间。我需要快速工作，以确保雪花不会融化、吹走或被更多的雪覆盖。只要镜头之间的摄像机角度不偏离太大，Photoshop 就能很好地重新调整文件。</p><p>因此，我没有费力地架起三脚架，而是找到雪花，通过试拍来调整相机的角度以获得所需的反射，然后开始拍摄。</p><p>专业提示：确保以一定角度拍摄；这样，您就可以显示出表面反射、棱柱颜色，甚至是充满活力的中心颜色，如下所示：</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure

data-section id="step-process-the-files">步骤 3：处理文件</h3><p>我不会花太多时间讨论雪花编辑。这是拍摄雪花中最常规、最非原创的部分，一旦你认真对待它，它就会变得非常简单。</p><p>首先堆叠图像（您可以使用<a href="https://geni.us/PhotoshopCC" target="_blank" aria-label="Photoshop (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Photoshop</a> ，也可以尝试专用的堆叠程序，例如<a

</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-best-blue-hour-photography-settings">最好的蓝色小时摄影设置</h2><p>在蓝色时段，天空变得相对黑，因此您需要长的快门速度或高<a

- 从移动的云或移动的水中创建美丽的条纹 - 您可以缩小光圈的范围，从而导致相机延长快门速度。如果您决定要<em>较短的</em>快门速度（要冻结运动），则可以扩大光圈或提高ISO，尽管请记住，较宽的孔径会减少景深，而更高的ISO会将噪声引入图像中。</p><p>如果您使用手动模式路线，只需拨入相机的基本ISO和一个不错的光圈（就好像您使用的是光圈优先级时）。然后设置快门速度，以使相机的曝光表大致平衡。如果您需要提高或降低快门速度，请确保您<em>还</em>增加或减少另一个曝光变量（即孔或ISO）以保持曝光表保持平衡。</p><p>要记住的一件事：因为蓝色时光往往看起来相对黑，所以您的相机可能会试图过度表达场景，这最终会产生不自然的结果（并可能导致爆炸的亮点）。如果您使用的是Aperture优先级模式，则​​需要添加一些负面的<a

id="the-best-gear-for-blue-hour-photography">蓝时间摄影的最佳装备</h2><p>由于蓝色时光提供了如此有限的光线，因此您需要专业的装备来确保您的照片保持清晰无噪音。这是我的建议：</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-full-frame-camera">全画幅摄像头</h3><p>虽然您可以绝对可以使用任何相机（包括智能手机）捕获美丽的蓝色小时拍摄，但全画幅DSLR或无反光镜相机具有一个巨大的优势：它将让您根据需要加强ISO，而不会用噪音淹没图像。</p><p>正如我上面提到的那样，最好将ISO保持尽可能低，但是如果您正在拍摄移动的主题，工作手持或进行天体摄影术，则将ISO保持在100时并不总是一个选择。另外，您可以提高ISO的越高，您拥有的灵活性就越大，您可以拍摄的速度越快（等待相机完成五分钟的曝光并不总是很多乐趣！）。</p><p>那是全画幅摄像机将派上用场的时候。最新的无反光镜模型（例如<a aria-label="Sony a7 IV (opens in a new tab)" href="https://geni.us/Sonya7IV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">Sony A7 IV</a> ， <a

）倾向于在高ISOS上表现最好，但是较旧的和/或更便宜的型号也可以很好地工作。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-fast-lens">快速镜头</h3><p>大多数蓝色小时景观和城市景观摄影都是在狭窄的光圈上完成的，因此不需要f/1.8最大光圈的镜头 - 但是，如果您想进行蓝色时刻街道摄影，肖像画或天文摄影，镜头具有最大最大的镜头光圈会产生巨大的变化。您将能够在不增加ISO到12800的情况下使用手持式快门速度，并且您也可以冻结移动受试者。</p><p>如果您刚刚开始，我建议您抓住至少f/2.8的最大光圈的质镜头，而f/1.8最大光圈甚至更好。您可以以廉价（例如50mm f/1.8）来购买其中一种型号，因此您无需担心破坏银行。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-tripod">三脚架</h3><p>根据我的经验，平均蓝色小时快门速度位于一到六秒之间。如果您以如此长的快门速度拨号，然后尝试拍摄手持式，最终会以令人沮丧的模糊拍摄。</p><p>当然，您始终可以增加相机的ISO来补偿较短的快门速度，但是噪音通常难以忍受。虽然您可以将镜头的光圈扩大到f/2.8及以后，但您会失去景观，建筑和城市景观射击者所珍视的田野效应深度。</p><p>因此，为了获得最佳效果，您确实必须使用<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-tripods-for-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="good tripod (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">良好的三脚架</a>。</p><p>当您拍摄1秒，6秒甚至30秒的曝光时，三脚架将将相机固定在适当的位置。确保您投资坚固的模型；尽管那里有很多便宜的选择，但其中大多数将难以处理您的设置，尤其是在风中。</p><p>如果您是那种经常走长距离或经常旅行的摄影师，我建议您使用碳纤维三脚架，将坚固性与便携性结合在一起。否则，铝制模型很好（它们往往位于便宜的一面，但它们也更重）。但是，无论您做什么，<em>都不要购买塑料</em>。太脆弱了。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section

class="wp-block-heading" id="what-types-of-photos-should-you-take-during-the-blue-hour">您应该在蓝色时段拍摄哪些类型的照片？</h2><p> Blue Hour是全面的美妙之处，因此不要让您选择的类型限制您前往一些空灵的蓝光。 You can shoot moody street scenes or long-exposure architectural images. You can even capture gorgeous blue hour portraits by combining flash and natural light (more on this below!).</p><p> That said, blue hour is most suited to landscape and cityscape photography. It combines colors, clouds, long exposures, and flattering light – pretty much everything from the serious landscape and cityscape photographer&#39;s playbook. Scenes that are generally motionless but include a few moving elements – such as a beach with waves lapping at the shore – make for especially gorgeous blue hour shots. These types of images <em>do</em> take some patience and a bit of extra gear, but with the right approach, you can capture photos that really shine.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-206718" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:47.6%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="714" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blue-hour-photography-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C714&#038;ssl=1" alt="blue hour photography cityscape long exposure" class="wp-image-206718" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blue-hour-photography-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blue-hour-photography-4.jpg?resize=300%2C143&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blue-hour-photography-4.jpg?resize=600%2C286&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blue-hour-photography-4.jpg?resize=768%2C366&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blue-hour-photography-4.jpg?resize=717%2C341&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> The only types of images you should avoid during the blue hour are those that highlight action subjects, such as wildlife photography, bird photography, and sports photography. The low light makes it tough to capture sharp files, so it&#39;s best to tackle these photos during the day.</p><p> Of course, it&#39;s sometimes necessary to shoot action during this time period, but you&#39;ll need to take an approach that&#39;s different to the one I recommended above; instead of using a tripod and a slow shutter speed, you&#39;ll need to boost your ISO and widen your lens aperture until your shutter speed is at least 1/100s (and ideally much faster). You&#39;ll also want to use a lens with a wide maximum aperture (f/2.8 at minimum). That way, you can freeze your subjects in motion!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-tips-for-beautiful-blue-hour-photography"> 16 tips for beautiful blue hour photography</h2><p> Yes, blue hour is a great time to take photos.

Similar light can be achieved in the morning, too! And depending on when you photograph, you can find very different subjects and conditions.</p><p> During the blue hour in cities, buildings are lit and streetlights come on, making it an ideal time for urban and cityscape photography with a perfect blend of natural and artificial light. The sky takes on a deep blue hue with cold tones and warmer colors from the illuminated buildings. A gradient of colors from blue to orange tinges the sky in place of the sunrise and sunset.</p><p> But while the colors and quality of light are often the same, shooting in the morning will give you much quieter, empty scenes, while shooting at night will give you much more chaotic shots (often with lots of cars and passersby). </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-wide-angle-lens-for-expansive-shots"> 2.

These lenses are perfect for capturing expansive scenes that make your viewers go “wow.” With a wide-angle lens, you can take in breathtaking vistas, city skylines, and much more.</p><p> Why go wide? Well, these lenses offer a generous field of view, allowing you to include more in your frame. The wide-angle effect adds an extra punch to your shots, especially when you include interesting foreground elements (see the next tip!).</p><p> Not only that, but wide-angle lenses are great for reducing blur caused by camera shake. So, even if your tripod isn&#39;t the sturdiest or you&#39;re dealing with less-than-ideal weather conditions, your images will come out sharper with a wide-angle lens.</p><p> You don&#39;t need an ultra-wide focal length either; even a 24mm or 35mm lens can work wonders for capturing the magic of the blue hour. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="incorporate-foreground-and-background-elements-to-add-depth"> 3.

One effective technique is to incorporate interesting elements in both the foreground and the background of your shot.</p><p> Imagine you&#39;re photographing a stunning cityscape during the blue hour. Look for a striking skyline that catches your eye as your background element. It could be a cluster of towering buildings or a unique architectural structure. Then, find a compelling foreground element to complete the composition. It could be a stone pathway, a reflective puddle, or a line of trees.</p><p> By combining these elements, you give your photo a sense of three-dimensionality. It&#39;s like inviting the viewer to step into the frame and explore the scene. The foreground and background work together to create a visually engaging image that grabs attention.</p><p> Pro tip: Be sure to use a relatively narrow aperture to keep both the foreground and background elements sharp. And if your foreground subject is very close to the lens, you might want to try a focus-stacking technique to ensure everything remains in focus!</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-shoot-in-raw-and-post-process-your-photos"> 4.

You can easily adjust the exposure and colors of a RAW file, and these adjustments are often the difference between a stunning shot and a mediocre one.</p><p> For instance, you can bring up the shadows in a RAW photo to reveal all sorts of lovely details. You can also bring out the blues and pinks in the sky, enhance the warmth of artificial lighting, and even darken the edges of the frame, which will push the viewer&#39;s eye toward your main subject.</p><p> And while you can make <em>some</em> adjustments to JPEGs, the effects are much more limited. Plus, if you adjust a JPEG too much, you may start to see unpleasant artifacts, such as banding.</p><p> RAW files do come with a drawback: They need editing. (A RAW file literally cannot be displayed in its original form; you must edit and convert it to a viewable format, first.)</p><p> But as I explained above, editing is a key part of every blue hour image.

You can switch to manual focus and take control.</p><p> Manual focus might sound intimidating, but it&#39;s actually quite simple. Just turn the focus ring on your lens until your subject appears sharp in the viewfinder or on your camera&#39;s screen. It also comes in handy when you&#39;re dealing with scenes featuring lots of depth; that way, you can set the focus exactly where you want it, ensuring maximum depth of field.</p><p> Bottom line: Thanks to manual focusing, you won&#39;t waste time waiting for the autofocus to catch up, and you&#39;ll have more control over the sharpness of your images. I encourage you to give it a try when you have some time to practice, and you&#39;ll see how easy it can be to get the perfect focus for your blue-hour shots. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="think-about-your-subject-and-viewpoint"> 6.

Include electric lights in your images</h3><p> Don&#39;t get me wrong: You can take <em>amazing</em> blue-hour photos of unaltered, naturally lit landscapes.</p><p> But in my experience, electric lights offer two benefits:</p><ol><li> They decrease exposure times. As the blue hour wears on, the sky will rapidly darken – and you may find your shutter speeds increasing to 10 seconds, 20 seconds, and beyond. However, an electric light or two will add extra illumination to the scene, thereby shortening your exposures and creating time for a few extra shots.</li><li> They add drama and interest to your photos. If you use a narrow aperture (ie, f/8), electric lights will appear as beautiful starbursts, which can create a focal point or simply complement your main subject.</li></ol><p> For instance, check out the image below, which relies on star-shaped lights to captivate the viewer:</p><p> Electric lights do come with some challenges, however. If you stand too close to a light source, you may get lens flare across your entire frame. And if you&#39;re not careful, electric lights can create major spots of overexposure in an otherwise well-exposed scene.</p><p> So don&#39;t get too close to the lights – the smaller the lights, the less problematic the flare and overexposure areas – and if you&#39;re struggling with exposure issues, check out my next tip: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-hdr-techniques-to-recover-highlights"> 8.

Unfortunately, they can also result in all sorts of exposure problems, because electric lights are significantly brighter than their surroundings.</p><p> One approach is to expose for the electric lights and let the rest of the scene go dark. The idea is that you can then recover the shadows in post-processing – but this will introduce lots of noise, so it&#39;s really not ideal.</p><p> Another approach is to ignore the highlights. Expose for the rest of the scene, let the lights blow out, and embrace the resulting shot. This can work, but there&#39;s a better option that <em>combines</em> both of the approaches I&#39;ve shared.</p><p> You see, the best way to handle bright electric lights and dark skies is to capture two shots. First, expose for the lights and let the rest of the scene go dark; second, expose for the other portions of the scene and let the lights blow out. Then you can <a aria-label="merge the two images together (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/getting-real-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">merge the two images together</a> in your favorite post-processing program – both Lightroom and Photoshop have this capability – and you&#39;ll end up with a well-exposed, fully detailed result!</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="look-for-reflections"> 9. Look for reflections</h3><p> The blue hour sky looks amazing, but while direct sky shots can be breathtaking, incorporating sky <em>reflections</em> can add an extra layer of depth and creativity to your images.</p><p> Fortunately, reflections can be found almost anywhere if you take the time to look for them. For landscape photographers, bodies of water like lakes and ponds offer a mirror-like surface that can reflect the beauty of the sky (especially in the early morning when the air is still and the water is calm!).</p><p> City photographers, too, have plenty of opportunities to capture reflections. The glass windows of skyscrapers, the polished surfaces of cars, and even the sleek metal facades of modern buildings can all show off the sky&#39;s changing colors!</p><p> One more quick tip: By positioning your camera to capture both the sky and its reflection, you can create images that are both grounded and ethereal – but you can also experiment with capturing <em>only</em> reflections for a different type of shot. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="experiment-with-different-shutter-speeds"> 10.

Photograph through shop windows</h3><p> Street and architectural photographers have enjoyed photographing through windows for over a century, but if you&#39;ve ever tried taking photos through glass, you know reflections can be a <em>huge</em> problem.</p><p> Fortunately, blue hour changes all that. As the light dims, the bright interior lights will overpower the ambient outdoor light, and reflections become far less distracting. <em>This opens up so many possibilities</em> .</p><p> For instance, you can create long exposures that capture the hustle and bustle of a shop, with a mix of blurry people and sharp objects. Or, if you&#39;re after even more artsy vibes, use a wide aperture to intentionally throw foreground objects out-of-focus, or use the dark outlines of the building itself to frame your shot.</p><p> Note that you don&#39;t have to stick to stores; cozy cafes and bustling restaurants work great for this kind of photography, too. For instance, you can capture Hopperesque shots that combine intimate diner moments with dreamy blue tones filtering through from the street outside! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-converting-to-black-and-white"> 12.

Here&#39;s how you can capture images like mine:</p><p> First, some observation decks don&#39;t allow tripods because they are seen as a hindrance for other visitors. In that case, you may try to bring in a mini-tripod, as it&#39;s unlikely to disturb other non-photography visitors.</p><p> Next, wipe the class with a cloth. Glass windows of an observation deck aren&#39;t always clean. Make sure to keep a cloth in your camera bag so that you can wipe an area to shoot through if it&#39;s dirty. Obviously, you can&#39;t wipe the other side of the window, though, so choose an area that has no stains, etc.</p><p> Third, to eliminate reflections, get in close and shoot so your lens is parallel to the glass. Also consider using a polarizing filter, which helps cut down on reflections to some extent. Unfortunately, as you can see in the example below, that&#39;s not always enough: </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/reflections.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Reflections - Tips for Shooting Through the Glass Window of an Observation Deck at Blue Hour" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The Ho Chi Minh City skyline (in Vietnam) shot through the window of Bitexco Financial Tower. I tried my best here – I got the lens really close to the window (it was almost touching it!) and used a polarizing filter, but the room interior and stray lights were still reflected in the glass. (Image by Joey J)</figcaption></figure></div><p>所以你会怎么做？ One option is to create a DIY blackout curtain; I recently came across a photographer doing this on the observation deck of Shanghai World Financial Center. However, you do run the risk of blocking the view for other visitors and being asked to leave by staff, especially if the curtain is large.</p><p> If you like the curtain idea but don&#39;t want to be so conspicuous, you can always try draping a black jacket over your rig, or you can surround your camera with a black neck gaiter (ie, a neck warmer or scarf). I used to use both of those methods, but I&#39;ve recently found something even better: a lenskirt.</p><p> A lenskirt is a tool specifically created to cut out reflections. It&#39;s what I&#39;ve been using for the past few years with great success – because by attaching a lenskirt to the front of your lens and pushing suction cups onto the window, you can shade the front element of the lens. This helps prevent reflections in the window, leaving no room for stray light to get in. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lenskirt.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Lenskirt - Tips for Shooting Through the Glass Window of an Observation Deck at Blue Hour" title="lenskirt.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> My camera setup with the lenskirt added!

Stick to well-marked trails, use a flashlight or headlamp for visibility, and let someone know your plans and where you&#39;ll be <em>before</em> you set off.</p><p> In the city, being aware of your surroundings is key. Always keep an eye on your gear, avoid isolated areas, and trust your instincts – if a situation feels unsafe, it&#39;s best to move on. Finally, the blue hour can be cold, even when daytime temperatures are comfortable! Dress appropriately, and remember that temperatures can drop fast after the sun goes down. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="additional-resources-for-shooting-at-blue-hour"> Additional resources for shooting at blue hour</h2><p>寻找更多？ To help you out with blue hour photography, here are several videos and additional tips: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-shoot-blue-hour-light-trails"> How to shoot blue hour light trails</h3><p> Light trails are a favorite of blue hour photographers and look especially gorgeous in cityscape shots.

Without an ND filter, you can push your shutter speed to a couple of seconds when the light falls toward the end of dusk.</p><p> But an ND filter lets you capture even longer exposure photos (minutes, not just seconds!) so you can create beautiful effects such as light trails, silky smooth water, rushing clouds, etc.</p><p> ND filters come in different strengths, and some popular ones are 3-stop, 6-stop, and 10-stop. The bigger the number, the darker the filter (ie, the less light that is let through) and the more you can lengthen your shutter speed.</p><p> Let&#39;s take a closer look at your different options:</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="stop-nd-filter"> 3-Stop ND filter</h4><p> I don&#39;t use a 3-stop ND filter when taking images with water or interesting clouds, as the strength is too mild to create a silky-smooth effect. So my use of a 3-stop ND filter is limited to scenes that have no water or clouds to be smoothed out, such as the photo below with light trails of moving cars. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/shanghai_0075.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Shanghai skyline - Using Neutral Density Filters for Cityscape Photography at Blue Hour" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Shanghai skyline (China) shot with a 25-second exposure at blue hour.

To create silky-smooth water, slowing down the shutter speed by 3 stops isn&#39;t quite enough, while a 10-stop drop is way too strong.</p><p> For example, a base shutter speed of 2 seconds (with no filter attached) gets extended to 15 seconds (with 3-stop ND filter), 128 seconds (with a 6-stop ND filter), and a whopping 34 minutes and 8 seconds (with a 10-stop ND filter). </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/shanghai_0061.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Shanghai - Using Neutral Density Filters for Cityscape Photography at Blue Hour" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Shanghai skyline (China) shot with a 164-second exposure using a 6-stop ND filter at blue hour.

In order to create a silky smooth water effect, 2-3 minutes of exposure is just right.</p><p> By the way, if you&#39;re planning to buy only one filter for blue hour photography, I&#39;d recommend a 6-stop ND filter. I&#39;ve probably photographed 90% of my blue hour cityscapes using a 6-stop ND filter. It&#39;s a game-changer if you&#39;re interested in doing this kind of work!</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="stop-nd-filter"> 10-Stop ND filter</h4><p> A 10-stop ND filter is a special filter that lets you use extremely long shutter speeds (longer than necessary in most cases!). Personally, I don&#39;t really find a 10-stop ND filter useful for shooting cityscapes at blue hour, as the exposure goes too long (a base shutter speed of 1/2s gets extended to 8 and a half minutes), and the digital noise caused by the long exposure becomes unbearable (even with in-camera long-exposure noise reduction turned on).</p><p> So this filter is better used <em>before</em> blue hour in the evening (or after blue hour in the morning). In fact, one big advantage of a 10-stop ND filter is that it lets you take long exposure photos while the sky is still bright, which is something 3- and 6-stop ND filters aren&#39;t up to the task of doing. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/singapore_3226.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Singapore - Using Neutral Density Filters for Cityscape Photography at Blue Hour" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Singapore skyline shot with a 258-second exposure (at f/8) using a 10-stop ND filter.

Consider the type of shoot</h3><p> Before you start directing your model into specific poses, consider the purpose of the photoshoot you&#39;re doing. A fashion shoot will demand bolder, more stylized poses, while a simple photoshoot for a business profile picture needs a clean, professional, formal feel. Is your shoot outdoors or in a studio? Are you photographing an individual, a couple, or an entire family?</p><p> Without fail, the type of photo you want should dictate the style of posing you use. And having a clear plan and mood in mind beforehand means you can tailor poses to achieve that goal. If you&#39;re working with a client, be sure to thoroughly discuss the style and desired feel of the shoot <em>in advance</em> , then choose your locations and posing approach accordingly.</p><p> Even if you&#39;re shooting for your own creative purposes, taking a moment to picture the end result will help you decide how to guide your subject effectively. Are you after a more polished feel, or do you prefer something fun and whimsical? This should affect everything from the wardrobe to where you shoot and, of course, your approach to posing!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-206417" style="width:1264px"><span class="space" style="width:1264px; padding-top:118.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1264" height="1500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/people-posing-photography-1003.jpg?resize=1264%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="people posing photography" class="wp-image-206417" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/people-posing-photography-1003.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/people-posing-photography-1003.jpg?resize=253%2C300&amp;ssl=1 253w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/people-posing-photography-1003.jpg?resize=506%2C600&amp;ssl=1 506w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/people-posing-photography-1003.jpg?resize=768%2C911&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/people-posing-photography-1003.jpg?resize=717%2C851&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="look-for-inspiration-online">2.

Build rapport</h3><p>这是至关重要的。 If your model likes you and sees what you are trying to achieve, they will work harder.</p><p> Talk to your model about things they like; this will help produce more life in their eyes and get <a aria-label="better expressions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/poser-achieve-perfect-portrait-expression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">better expressions</a> , including natural smiles. And they&#39;ll be more relaxed.</p><p> But if your model is tense, you are going to struggle to get natural-looking portraits. In that case, take the pressure off the model and bring it back on yourself. Assure them that if the photos don&#39;t work out, it&#39;s your fault, not theirs. Build their confidence.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="start-with-easy-poses"> 6. Start with easy poses</h3><p> Especially when working with first-time models or anyone a little camera-shy, it&#39;s crucial to go easy on them at the start. Don&#39;t expect them to strike complex, magazine-worthy poses right off the bat. Instead, keep the initial instructions simple and encourage your subjects to relax.</p><p> Poses that involve leaning against a wall, casually placing hands in pockets, or sitting comfortably on a set of stairs are all great places to start. These are positions people naturally default to in daily life, and they tend to be very easy for most individuals, which is a great way to help them warm up to the experience of standing in front of the camera. Plus, these more casual poses can look very good despite their simplicity!</p><p> Bottom line: Even if you have certain complex poses that you want to capture, if you start with something too intimidating, your model might clam up, and the whole shoot might be a struggle. Instead, start easy, and as your subject sheds their nerves and gets into the groove, bring in the more stylized poses. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="look-for-natural-expressions"> 7. Look for natural expressions</h3><p> As you talk to your model, you will notice natural expressions and mannerisms that you can capture. These tend to make for far better portraits than unnatural, stiff expressions that are truly posed!</p><p> So don&#39;t be afraid to say “Hold that pose!” or “Do that again!” </p><div class="wp-block-image caption-align-left size-full wp-image-68388 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-68388" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/posing-models-5.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="people posing photography" class="wp-image-68388" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/posing-models-5.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/posing-models-5.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> I noticed that this model had an interesting mannerism, so I asked her to repeat the gesture. The result turned out to be one of her favorites! </figcaption></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="direct-the-eyes"> 8. Direct the eyes</h3><p> The subject&#39;s eye direction is absolutely <em>vital</em> to creating a captivating portrait. Viewers tend to focus on the eyes, so it&#39;s important that they look good – plus the gaze has a certain weight that you should always consider when composing.</p><p> One helpful tip here is to instruct your subject to look at the camera <em>or</em> follow the line of their nose. Both of these approaches keep the eye from showing too much white.</p><p> Additionally, pay attention to the mood that different eye directions create. In general, having your subject look directly into the camera conveys confidence and intensity. Looking up can lend a feeling of aspiration or whimsy, while glancing downward conveys introspection or can subtly emphasize features like strong cheekbones.</p><p> At the end of the day, pay attention to the eyes, but don&#39;t be afraid to experiment. Depending on the look you want, different approaches will make sense! You might even ask your subject to close their eyes for a more peaceful (or moody) result.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="adapt-poses"> 9. Adapt poses</h3><p> When you suggest a pose to your model – such as a pose used in another photo or a pose from the Posing App – treat it as a starting point. Then adapt it to suit the model.</p><p> In other words: If your model looks unnatural in a certain pose, then change it! Adjust each pose to suit your model&#39;s body and clothes. </p><div class="wp-block-image caption-align-left size-full wp-image-68386 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-68386" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:74.83%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="449" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/posing-models-3.jpg?resize=600%2C449&#038;ssl=1" alt="woman posing against a wall" class="wp-image-68386" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/posing-models-3.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/posing-models-3.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The pose on the left is one I found in the Posing App. For the second portrait, I asked my model to drop her left arm so I couldn&#39;t see it.

You&#39;ll likely need to adjust their pose so their energy flows <em>into</em> the space of the photo.</p><p> Another rule of thumb to keep in mind is to never cut off joints awkwardly with the frame&#39;s edge, and avoid creating unwanted tension by instructing your model to cross their arms, legs, or ankles tightly at the edge of the image! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="find-something-for-your-model-to-lean-on"> 13.

But at night, this changes. In the brightest areas – lit by streetlights or car headlights – you can comfortably photograph at 1/250s, but most of the time, you&#39;ll need to use a shutter speed between 1/60s and 1/160s. Otherwise, you&#39;ll be forced to boost your ISO to ridiculous heights, and you&#39;ll risk ruining your images with noise.</p><p> Note that when your shutter speed is set to 1/60s, you&#39;ll need steady hands. (A lens or camera with image stabilization can help; fortunately, most decent mirrorless cameras these days do come with in-body image stabilization, and most lenses have it, too!) Note that, to photograph handheld at 1/60s, you need to stop your own motion completely. Fortunately, with some practice, this can be done – just make sure you&#39;re always paying attention to your hand movements as you press the shutter button.</p><p> As for the best aperture setting for night street photography: The wider the aperture, the faster you can make your shutter speed (or the lower you can drop your ISO). It&#39;s possible to shoot at f/4 in brighter areas at night, but if you can shoot at f/2.8, f/2, or even f/1.8, you&#39;ll have a much easier time. In other words, the wider your aperture for night street photography, the better. (That said, wider apertures come with a major drawback: extremely shallow depth of field. Therefore, as I explain below, you&#39;ll need to focus very carefully to avoid producing a slew of out-of-focus shots.)</p><p> Finally, you&#39;ll need to raise your ISO to 1600, 3200, or even 6400. With modern digital cameras, you can photograph at high ISOs and come away with decent images, and while it&#39;s always best to keep the ISO as low as possible, you just won&#39;t manage to get well-exposed shots at night otherwise. (I personally shoot at ISO 3200, and I sometimes go to ISO 6400 in especially dark areas or when I&#39;m photographing fast-moving subjects.) Plus, grainy shots at night can look surprisingly good; the grit adds to the aesthetic, especially if you convert to black and white.</p><p> What camera mode should you use? If you&#39;re doing fast-paced shooting in a variety of different lighting scenarios (ie, moving in and out of the street lights), Aperture Priority can work well – just set your camera to your widest aperture and highest tolerable ISO, then let it choose the shutter speed for you. (If the shutter speed drops below 1/60s, then you&#39;ll either need to accept some blurriness, boost that ISO further, or shoot in an area with more light.)</p><p> And as for your method of focusing: Normally, zone focusing is a great method for street photography, but when using an ultra-wide aperture at night, you&#39;ll end up missing a lot of images. You can try using manual focus to prefocus in a certain area if you can anticipate a shot in advance, but working with continuous AF and one of your camera&#39;s tracking modes might be the better option, depending on your camera&#39;s capability. (If you&#39;re not sure what will work best, try to do some experimentation!) </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="essential-gear-for-nighttime-street-photography"> Essential gear for nighttime street photography</h2><p> The best nighttime street photography gear is broadly similar to daytime street photography gear in that you want your equipment to be lightweight, compact, and inconspicuous. That said, there are a few things to keep in mind when purchasing new equipment for those nighttime adventures: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="pick-a-camera-with-good-high-iso-capabilities"> Pick a camera with good high-ISO capabilities</h3><p> Since you&#39;ll often be shooting at ISO 3200, ISO 6400, and even beyond, it&#39;s essential that you use a street photography camera that won&#39;t ruin your shots with an explosion of noise. Consider investing in a compact full-frame camera or a top-notch APS-C model, and try to keep the megapixel count on the lower side, as ultra-high MP cameras tend to actually perform worse when shooting at high ISOs compared to the lower MP siblings (assuming the technology is from the same generation).</p><p> Low-light focusing capabilities are also very handy – many cameras struggle to acquire focus in the dark, while others are high performers in this area. If your camera can&#39;t focus in near darkness, that&#39;s not an absolute dealbreaker – you can focus manually or shoot in the streetlights – but it&#39;ll certainly limit your flexibility. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="pick-a-lens-with-a-wide-maximum-aperture"> Pick a lens with a wide maximum aperture</h3><p> As I mentioned above, you&#39;ll want to make sure you pick a compact lens for shooting the streets at night. But while most daytime street photography is shot at an aperture of around f/8, nighttime is a whole different ball game. You&#39;ll need to widen your lens&#39;s aperture to its maximum, which means that the wider the maximum aperture that&#39;s offered by the lens, the better.</p><p> Therefore, I&#39;d recommend grabbing a lens with a maximum aperture of at least f/2.8 (and f/1.8 or f/1.4 can be even better, assuming the models are still relatively compact).</p><p> It can also help to grab a slightly wider prime than you might be inclined to use otherwise, such as a 35mm, 28mm, or – if you&#39;re interested in a more unique look – 24mm. Wider lenses are less prone to camera shake, and they&#39;re also easier to use at night since the darkness and lack of activity results in fewer distractions throughout a broader scene.</p><p> Of course, you can still use a standard 50mm lens for nighttime street photography – a 50mm f/1.8, for instance, is great in nearly every street-photography scenario – but if you have the opportunity to go wide, I&#39;d recommend at least testing it out! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="tips-for-night-street-photography"> 10 tips for night street photography</h2><p> Now that you understand the best settings and equipment for photographing the streets at night, let&#39;s take a look at a few tips – for both beginners and advanced street shooters – to enhance your results.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="seek-out-light-sources"> 1. Seek out light sources</h3><p> Always pay attention to the main light sources in a scene. This is true no matter where or when you are photographing, but it becomes even more important at night. So instead of hunting for subjects, start by finding a beautiful light source or an area with good lighting, then wait around for something to happen.</p><p> Note that night street photography lighting can be anything: car headlights, streetlights, neon signs, window lighting, or even smartphone light. Simply look for noticeable illumination, then pay careful attention to how these light sources hit potential subjects. Adjust your angle until you get the lighting effect you want, then shoot away!</p><p> When I was <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/street-photographers-guide-new-york-city/" target="_blank" aria-label="photographing the streets of New York City (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">photographing the streets of New York City</a> , I found a beautiful restaurant with bright windows.

Take plenty of shots</h3><p> Sometimes, street photographers like to use a more deliberate approach, capturing only a couple of images of each subject. This works fine during the day, especially if you can confidently nail the focus and exposure – but at night, it&#39;s a recipe for a lot of failed images.</p><p> So instead of just taking one or two images of each subject or scene, when you&#39;re out at night, push things a bit. Don&#39;t be afraid to capture 5-10 shots of the same subject, and if you&#39;re willing to sort through all the shots later, you might even consider using your camera&#39;s burst mode to fire off dozens of shots in a few seconds.</p><p> The idea here is to simply maximize your chances of success. The more you shoot, the more likely you are to hit on that moment when your subject is moving slowly enough to stay sharp, even at 1/60s – and the more likely are you to nail the focus even with a razor-thin depth of场地。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photograph-nightlife"> 3. Photograph nightlife</h3><p> Certain parts of the city – such as the business district – can empty out at night; they&#39;ll make for a poor night street photography experience. Other areas, however, will get busier after sunset, and they&#39;ll offer plenty of opportunities.</p><p> So seek out the nightlife and shoot it! You might consider doing some internet searches for bars and clubs in your area, then make sure you head on over as the night begins. Alternatively, if you&#39;re after more formal-looking subjects, go for a walk near some upscale restaurants and see what you can find!</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-62984" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="photographing the nightlife" class="wp-image-62984" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> 1/125s | f/2 | ISO 6400</figcaption></figure></div><p> And don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re restricted to photographing people on the street outside clubs and restaurants. You can capture all sorts of stunning effects by shooting through windows (plus, if you&#39;re feeling a bit nervous about photographing people, the window can act as a barrier and reduce your anxiety). </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="alternate-between-getting-close-and-stepping-back"> 4. Alternate between getting close and stepping back</h3><p> I&#39;m a big proponent of Robert Capa&#39;s advice that “if your photos aren&#39;t good enough, you&#39;re not close enough.” However, I often violate this rule at night.</p><p> You see, while I do try to get close to many of my subjects – and I encourage you to do the same – I also try to create compositions where the subjects are small aspects of the overall scene. At night, backgrounds can be much more beautiful than during the day, so it often pays to have people become the secondary element in the scene, rather than the primary focus.</p><p> This approach comes with a technical advantage: When your subjects are off in the distance, you won&#39;t need to use a fast shutter speed to capture their motion. A nearby subject can be frozen at 1/125s or faster; a distant subject can often be photographed at 1/60s and turn out sharp, even if it&#39;s on the move. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="experiment-with-a-tripod-for-creative-effects"> 5. Experiment with a tripod for creative effects</h3><p> When doing street night photography, it&#39;s usually best to go handheld.

You&#39;ll need to experiment with different shutter speeds (1/8s is a good starting point), and you&#39;ll need to shoot a <em>lot</em> of photos, but you&#39;ll eventually end up with some gorgeous motion blur effects:</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/5-lower_east_side_nightlife_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-62987" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/5-lower_east_side_nightlife_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="motion blur night street photography" class="wp-image-62987" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/5-lower_east_side_nightlife_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/5-lower_east_side_nightlife_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/5-lower_east_side_nightlife_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> 1/8s | f/4 | ISO 800 |三脚架</figcaption></figure></div><p>It took me a long time to capture the image displayed above; I wanted the people spread throughout the entire scene, and I also wanted an interesting foreground subject (in the end, I was satisfied by the pose of the woman in the street and the man looking at her). </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-working-with-a-flash"> 6. Try working with a flash</h3><p> Some street photographers love using a flash, while others hate it. Whether you decide to try flash at night is up to you; on the one hand, it&#39;ll provide extra illumination so you can use a faster shutter speed, a narrower aperture, and a lower ISO. On the other hand, it&#39;ll give a very intense deer-in-the-headlights look, plus it can lead to confrontation (people don&#39;t like being flashed, especially in the dark!).</p><p> Personally, I prefer to work with the constraints of natural light, and I also get uncomfortable flashing strangers in dark settings. But if you feel confident enough to shoot with flash, then by all means, try it and see what you think. It can give a fantastic look when done well.</p><p> Note that you can have the flash do all the work lighting the scene (so that the foreground area turns out lit and the background is completely dark). But you can also set your camera to slightly underexpose the scene, then use the flash to add some fill light to your main subjects in the foreground. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="be-careful-when-boosting-the-exposure"> 7.

And when this happens, you&#39;ll have no choice but to raise the exposure when editing. <em>Just make sure you do it carefully</em> .</p><p> Here&#39;s my recommendation: First, ignore the noise and get the exposure and look correct. If you have to raise the exposure a significant amount, the noise will be terrible, so you&#39;ll need to apply some <a aria-label="noise reduction (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-do-noise-reduction-in-lightroom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">noise reduction</a> .</p><p> There are many excellent noise reduction programs, but I like Lightroom&#39;s built-in noise reduction. If the noise is still bad after applying the noise reduction algorithm, try bringing the image into Photoshop to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tips-blur-filters-photoshop/" target="_blank" aria-label="add a very slight Gaussian blur (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">add a very slight Gaussian blur</a> .</p><p> At that point, I often use Lightroom&#39;s grain settings to add texture back into the photo. The result looks much more pleasing to the eye than extreme digital noise, and it can hide some of the technical deficiencies of underexposed images. The photo will not look perfectly sharp, but it can still be beautiful. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-be-afraid-of-blur-and-imperfection"> 8. Don&#39;t be afraid of blur and imperfection</h3><p> Most street photographers aim to get their photos as sharp as possible. Sharpness certainly isn&#39;t a bad thing – but know that a photo can still look fantastic even if it isn&#39;t incredibly crisp.</p><p> You see, when photographing at night, you don&#39;t need to freeze motion perfectly to get a stunning result. Personally, I hold my day images to a higher standard than my night images. My day images need to look sharp, while my night photos simply need to be interesting and look good, even if they&#39;re a little blurry in places.</p><p> Also, at shutter speeds from around 1/60s to 1/30s, it can be fun to shoot handheld. Your subjects will turn out somewhat sharp, yet there will be a little motion, too. It&#39;s a great way to add a sense of energy to your compositions. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="let-your-night-street-photos-look-dark"> 9.

They should be dark, with deep shadows and areas that are hard to see. When you <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-read-and-use-histograms/" target="_blank" aria-label="look at the histogram (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">look at the histogram</a> of a night image, it should be skewed toward the far left, especially relative to your day images.</p><p> But when you point your camera toward a street scene at night, it&#39;ll often overexpose the photo. The resulting file will look bright and you&#39;ll be able to see plenty of detail, but the scene just won&#39;t feel real. (You&#39;ll also end up with blown-out streetlights and store windows.) In such cases, you&#39;ll want to lower the <a aria-label="exposure compensation (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-exposure-compensation-to-take-control-of-your-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure compensation</a> on your camera slightly or – if you&#39;re shooting in <a aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> – boost the shutter speed, narrow the aperture, or widen the ISO.</p><p> I do think that bright night images <em>can</em> look good. But dark, realistic night images are generally better, so carefully monitor the histogram and don&#39;t be afraid to drop that exposure compensation as needed.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shoot-in-bad-weather"> 10. Shoot in bad weather</h3><p> Venturing out into the night when the weather turns sour can be daunting. (I know this from personal experience!) Yet it&#39;s precisely those conditions – snow, rain, fog, and sleet – that can transform an ordinary street scene into a photo brimming with atmosphere and emotion. Think snowflakes swirling under the glow of street lamps, or a foggy evening with dark figures moving in and out of buildings. These elements introduce a layer of complexity and mood that&#39;s hard to replicate under clear skies.</p><p> That said, embracing bad weather does mean facing some challenges. Temperatures generally drop at night, and precipitation amplifies the risk of hypothermia; therefore, even street photography in the summer can be uncomfortable or even dangerous when the rain starts to pour. Plus, keeping your camera dry can be a hassle, and in worst-case scenarios, you may even damage your equipment.</p><p> Fortunately, with the proper preparation, you can (generally) prevent these problems. Dress warmly – think coats, hats, gloves – and use lots of layers to keep yourself comfortable. For your camera, a simple rain cover can be a lifesaver. I also recommend bringing a rocket blower (so you can rid your front lens element of water droplets) and a small towel (so you can wipe off your camera and lens barrel regularly). And whatever you do, don&#39;t forget that lens hood; otherwise, the precipitation will quickly cover your lens and ruin your images.</p><p> One more thing: Shooting in bad weather at night is hard, and accepting that not every shot will be a masterpiece is part of the process. Night and adverse weather conditions can be unpredictable, but they also open the door to unique photographic opportunities. If you&#39;re willing to take a lot of pictures, chances are you&#39;ll snag at least a couple of keepers. It&#39;s all about patience, perseverance, and a bit of an adventurous spirit!</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="be-careful"> 11. Be careful</h3><p> This tip is absolutely necessary, but it&#39;s also very difficult to write about. You see, depending on where you&#39;re shooting, heading out at night with a camera is not always the safest idea. On the other hand, many areas are safer than you might think at night, especially in the earlier evening.</p><p> Therefore, don&#39;t be so afraid to shoot at night that you never head out, but also make sure that you stay safe. Travel light, keep your equipment to a minimum, and be careful about where you go. Make sure you pay attention to your surroundings, and if you start to feel uncomfortable, head in the other direction.</p><p> If you&#39;re not sure whether you can safely photograph on the streets at night, do some research. I&#39;d recommend messaging veteran street shooters in the area, though you can also look at general articles and statistics covering city crime rates.</p><p> Use your best judgment regarding who to photograph, and think about bringing a friend along. Don&#39;t stay in one place for too long, and avoid putting down your gear to change lenses. Finally, if you desire greater peace of mind, insure your gear before you head out! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="focus-on-your-editing-skills"> 12. Focus on your editing skills</h3><p> The challenging lighting conditions of night street photography often mean that your images will require a touch of post-processing to really shine – and that&#39;s where your editing skills come into play. I highly recommend purchasing (or subscribing to) a dedicated photo-editing program; it&#39;ll give you the tools you need to create pro-level images, and while the learning curve can be a bit significant at first, it won&#39;t take you long to master the essential techniques.</p><p> When you&#39;re just starting out, pay special attention to the white balance and the exposure. Tweak these elements until you get a natural, nice-looking result. Initially, you might find yourself sliding controls back and forth, experimenting until something clicks. That&#39;s totally okay; in my experience, this trial-and-error phase is how you develop an eye for what works.</p><p> As you grow more comfortable with the tools at your disposal, you&#39;ll begin to appreciate the power of subtle adjustments. You might even start to develop certain editing preferences, which you can bake into your own presets. (As an aside, creating presets can streamline the editing process, plus they can make it easier to achieve consistent results across your portfolio!)</p><p> But the journey doesn&#39;t end there. Once you&#39;ve mastered the basics, it&#39;s time to play with more advanced techniques like color grading. This can add a stylistic flair to your images and really set your work apart. With practice, you&#39;ll find that editing becomes a natural extension of your photography, and you can use it to express your unique perspective on the nighttime cityscape! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-benefits-and-drawbacks-of-photographing-the-streets-at-night"> The benefits and drawbacks of photographing the streets at night</h2><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-62977" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="street night photography diner" class="wp-image-62977" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> 1/80s | f/2.8 | ISO 1600</figcaption></figure></div><p> Nighttime street photography comes with several major benefits – in other words, there&#39;s a reason for its popularity!</p><p> For one, the streets tend to be emptier at night, allowing you to isolate a subject or two without difficulty – this can make for more powerful minimalistic shots.</p><p> Photographing at nighttime with streetlights also adds a different mood to images, giving a sense of mystery, nostalgia, drama, and even horror, depending on how you approach your shots.</p><p> And budding street photographers – and even more accomplished shooters – sometimes struggle with fear or discomfort when photographing strangers. Working at night, however, lends a sense of distance and anonymity that makes for less anxiety.</p><p> Of course, night street photography comes with several significant challenges. Cameras rely on light to capture sharp, well-exposed images, and nighttime – as you are undoubtedly aware! – doesn&#39;t offer much light. To address this, it&#39;s important to have a real technical mastery of the camera; otherwise, you&#39;ll end up with images that are blurry, grainy, or dark (or a combination of the three).</p><p> And as I emphasized above, photographing at night in certain areas can be genuinely dangerous. Obviously, this depends on the location, and it also depends on the approach you take. Below, I offer tips for taking proper safety precautions at night, but it really is important to keep this in mind so you don&#39;t go in unprepared. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="tips-for-night-street-photography-final-words"> Tips for night street photography: final words</h2><p> Well, there you have it:</p><p> Everything you need to know for stunning night street shots.</p><p> Getting beautiful street photos at night isn&#39;t always easy.

Nighttime street photography can be relatively safe, but there&#39;s always a risk, so it pays to be cautious and take proper precautions.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1690730178545"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Is it worth photographing on the streets at night?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer">我想是这样！ The streets can look pretty magical at night and allow for a whole new type of image.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1690730200656"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">What is the best ISO for night street photos?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> I&#39;d recommend pushing your ISO as high as it can go without causing a ridiculous level of noise. You need a high ISO to achieve a reasonably fast shutter speed, plus noise doesn&#39;t look that bad in nighttime shots.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1690730213925"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">What camera should I use for night street photos?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> Compact, lightweight cameras with larger sensors tend to work well for

wider to achieve more unusual shots. </p></div></div><div class="topics-list"><div class="wrapper"><div class="list-header"><h4 class="title-small">目录</h4><h3 class="title-pillar"><a

But shooting interiors isn&#39;t exactly a walk in the park. It comes with plenty of challenges, including cramped spaces, low light, and difficult camera techniques.</p><p> Fortunately, I&#39;ve spent years honing my interior architectural shooting skills, and in this article, I share my top tips to ensure success. I discuss:</p><ul><li> The best focal lengths for interior architecture</li><li> The equipment item that you absolutely must own</li><li> Easy ways to improve your compositions</li><li> Simple editing steps for refined results</li><li>多得多！</li></ul><p> So if you&#39;re ready to level up your interior shots, then let&#39;s dive right in. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="if-possible-prepare-the-space"> 1. If possible, prepare the space</h2><p> If you&#39;re photographing the interior of a house or a business, I highly recommend you set the stage by taking the time to de-clutter and open up the space. Clear all flat surfaces and floor areas. Open all blinds and curtains. Clean any dirty dishes in the sink and put them away. Be sure to clean the space much more so than you would for yourself. We get used to clutter and become blind to it, but a bit of clutter in a photo will be instantly obvious.</p><p> Once you&#39;re done, the space should feel inviting, like the kind of place you can imagine yourself living or working. But if you&#39;ve finished cleaning and you&#39;re still not impressed, you can create those feelings in your photos by adding personal touches. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Interiors2.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interiors2" title="Interiors2.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by Natalia Robert</figcaption></figure></div><p> If there&#39;s a dinner table, set it for two and place a vase of fresh flowers in the center. Transform an empty breakfast nook into a great spot to lounge by adding a newspaper, coffee cup, and a plate or bowl of light (and pretty) snacks. Hang a fluffy bathrobe on a hook next to the bathtub.</p><p> If there&#39;s a desk, consider adding a work laptop and a book (or three). When it comes to decorations or color palettes, you want to either fill the space with personality to play up its uniqueness <em>or</em> keep everything neutral with pops of bright color.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="always-use-a-tripod"> 2. Always use a tripod </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-01.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Whenever you shoot architectural interiors, you absolutely <em>must</em> use a tripod. This is for a few main reasons:</p><p> First, a tripod will stabilize your camera/lens setup, which dramatically reduces the possibility of camera shake. Since interior shots tend to be taken at narrow <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="apertures (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">apertures</a> and slow <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speeds (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speeds</a> , keeping your camera on rock-solid support is essential.</p><p> Second, if you use a tripod, it&#39;s much easier to make sure your camera is level. (While I discuss the importance of a level camera later on in this article, it&#39;s a fundamental part of pretty much all <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/creative-architecture-photography-techniques/" target="_blank" aria-label="architectural photography (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">architectural photography</a> .) </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-02.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Additionally, there&#39;s no good reason <em>not</em> to use a tripod when photographing interiors. Sure, if you were tracking subjects or needing to constantly change your position on the fly, a tripod would be a hindrance. But architectural photography is slow and deliberate; since your subject matter is buildings, you can always count on it to sit nice and still while you set up your camera, dial in various settings, and fine-tune your composition.</p><p> Note that interior photoshoots tend to involve very little wind, rushing water, or rain, so you can often get away with using a cheaper tripod (though there are also reasons to invest in a good sturdy model, including gear safety, so make sure you choose your model very carefully!). </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="start-with-natural-light"> 3. Start with natural light</h2><p> One of the advantages of architectural photography, especially interior architectural photography, is that nothing moves. You can leverage this by playing with your settings, especially the shutter speed.</p><p> With the camera rested on a tripod, you can dial in very slow shutter speeds to capture all the ambient light, even in very dark corners. If some lamps and lights add to the overall ambiance of the room, include them and take advantage of slow shutter speeds and long exposures.</p><p> It is important to remember that for interiors, you should aim for balanced lighting; in other words, there should be no overly dark shadows or overly bright highlights. You want to see the detail in dark areas but not blow out the light areas altogether. And think about which times of the day best feature the interior space. Early morning and late afternoon light are very soft, though overcast days also produce soft light.</p><p> On the other hand, bright super sunny days produce harsher light, especially around midday. Therefore you may want to take into consideration shadows produced in the interior from harsh outside light. If you&#39;re creating fine-art images, you can use these shadows as artistic elements, but if you&#39;re doing commercial photography, this may not be appropriate. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="whenever-possible-use-a-flash"> 4. Whenever possible, use a flash</h2><p> In the previous tip, I emphasized the value of natural light. But while you should aim to get as much natural lighting is possible, if you shoot a room without a flash, you&#39;ll typically get shadows scattered around the room (caused by artificial lighting positioned along walls and at various places across the ceiling). This often doesn&#39;t look great and can be difficult to handle from an exposure perspective, so I encourage you to use a bit of flash. You only need one or two speedlights or strobes, and they&#39;ll help balance the exposure across the entire frame.</p><p> Here&#39;s what I recommend:</p><p> Make sure your flashes are mounted on separate tripods or stands (they shouldn&#39;t be on your camera!), and place them a few feet off to the side and a foot or so behind your camera. (If you&#39;re using two flashes, make sure they&#39;re on opposite sides.) Aim the flashes so they point toward the ceiling and slightly away from the room you&#39;re shooting.</p><p> Set the flashes manually at half power (a stop below full power) and fire away. Given the angle, the light from the flashes will illuminate the room indirectly (ie, bouncing off the ceilings and walls), and you&#39;ll get a soft, even fill light for the room you&#39;re shooting. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-03.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This was a tricky shot because my flash was reflecting off the windows no matter where I positioned it. In the end, I took two shots (one with flash and one without), then masked them together in Photoshop. The windows you see in this image are from the file without a flash, but the rest of the room is from the file <em>with</em> the flash.</figcaption></figure></div><p> I always encourage you to review the resulting image on your camera&#39;s LCD and make changes accordingly. Watch for strange shadows, too-bright walls, dark corners, and reflections from the flash in windows and other glass objects. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="when-shooting-whole-rooms-dont-go-too-wide"> 5. When shooting whole rooms, don&#39;t go too wide</h2><p> When I first started taking architectural interior shots, I used the widest-angle lens I could get my hands on. I thought that with an <a aria-label="ultra-wide lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-reasons-love-ultra-wide-lenses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ultra-wide lens</a> , I could get more of the room in the frame – but while I was technically correct, <em>more isn&#39;t always better</em> . I soon noticed a high level of <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/lens-distortion-in-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="distortion (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">distortion</a> toward the edges of the frame, especially in smaller rooms, and I determined that ultra-wide focal lengths (ie, 14mm) make the sides of the frame look oddly stretched and off the horizontal plane, even when corrected in post-production. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-04.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> So I experimented with different focal lengths and found that an effective focal length between 21mm and 28mm gives you a very nice balance; at 25mm, you get limited distortion <em>and</em> a wide-enough frame to capture the character and presence of the scene.</p><p> One option is to grab a 24mm prime, which can be very cost-effective when you&#39;re just starting out (most manufacturers offer a high-quality 24mm lens for cheap). Alternatively, you might invest in a 24-70mm zoom – yes, it will cost a lot more, but it&#39;ll offer extra flexibility and even allow you to capture some nice detail shots in the 50-70mm range. If you do prefer a wider perspective, you could look into a 16-35mm zoom instead.</p><p> By the way, if you&#39;re in a situation where 21mm won&#39;t capture enough of the scene, a panorama is always an option. Speaking of which: </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-panoramas-for-ultra-wide-shots"> 6. Try panoramas for ultra-wide shots</h2><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/21-tips-create-better-panoramas/" target="_blank" aria-label="Panoramas (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Panoramas</a> are a great way to capture an entire room, especially if you&#39;re using a longer lens or you&#39;re dealing with a cramped interior. But how can you create one?</p><p> Start by setting up your camera vertically on the tripod. Many photographers think it&#39;s best to do panoramas horizontally, but the vertical orientation will give you a taller image.</p><p> Then do your best to pivot your camera while taking a series of images. Determine your start and end point in advance, and make sure that you have plenty of overlap between compositions. Using a tripod is essential, and it&#39;s important that you rotate your camera on a perfectly level horizontal plane – with the pivot point being roughly where the lens meets the camera). Note that, if the pivot point is too far forward (ie, somewhere on the lens) or too far backward (ie, on the body of the camera), the panorama will appear distorted.</p><p> For the picture below, the pivot point was on the body of the camera, which is behind the ideal spot. As a result, the shot has a weird sort of convex distortion: </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-05.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This is a seven-image panorama.

Whenever possible, try to shoot only one or two walls</h2><p> Beginner interior architectural photographers sometimes try to squeeze too much into the frame by including three or even four walls – but when you use this approach, the shot will often appear rather awkward-looking (if you aren&#39;t extremely careful with the composition, that是）。</p><p> Instead, go for a one- or two-wall shot, which will give the viewer the most geometrically pleasant image to view: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-06.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> The shot displayed above is a generic two-wall scene with the walls meeting at a standard 90-degree angle.

Strike a balance</h2><p> When composing your shot, focus the viewer&#39;s attention on where you want it to go. If you can, consider using staged items to add depth and interest in the foreground. Avoid flat-looking photos by contrasting different elements in the foreground, midground, and background. Remember to aim for balance, not distraction.</p><p> Using the background to show a connecting room is also a great way to give the viewer a sense of space. This will add interest and make the viewer feel like they can visualize walking through the building. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Interiors3.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interiors3" title="Interiors3.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by Natalia Roberts </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="make-sure-your-camera-is-perfectly-level"> 9. Make sure your camera is perfectly level</h2><p> When shooting any form of architecture, and especially interiors, this is a <em>big</em> deal:</p><p> You should work as hard as possible to ensure your camera isn&#39;t tilted up, down, left, or right when shooting. Even the slightest tilt will require post-production cleanup, and you&#39;ll lose pixels in the process.</p><p> Here&#39;s an example of what I&#39;m talking about: </p><figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-09.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure><p> See how slanted the windows are? They lean outward, which is a sign of perspective distortion. Clearly, this is not an accurate depiction of the room; instead, it&#39;s the result of the camera being tilted ever-so-slightly downward.</p><p> But once we get the camera nice and level, here&#39;s the result: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-10.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> As you can see, keeping your camera level makes a <em>huge</em> difference. Happily, there are a couple of ways to help you get your camera perfectly straight when you compose your photos. Most cameras have a built-in level (with the built-in level activated, when you look into the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/optical-versus-electronic-viewfinders-best/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">viewfinder</a> , you&#39;ll see lines across the focusing screen that tilt when the camera tilts). If you&#39;re not sure whether your camera has this option, take a peek at the manual or do a bit of Googling.</p><p> You can also use a bubble level that slides onto the camera&#39;s hot shoe. (When the little bubble is centered, it means your camera is level.) You can buy one of these levels at just about any photography store for just a few bucks, and it&#39;s my preferred solution because it tends to be more accurate than built-in camera levels). </p><figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-11.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="get-the-white-balance-right">10. Get the white balance right</h2><p> This is tricky and the nemesis of many photographers. Most non-photographers are oblivious to white balance. (This is especially obvious in wedding photos where the bride&#39;s dress looks blue and people&#39;s faces register as magenta, yet hardly anyone notices!)</p><p> When I sold my house a few years back, the real estate agents who boasted of great property photography sent a photographer to my house to take some professional pictures. She arrived with a camera on the tripod and a flash head pointed slightly upward. The lens used was very wide – I&#39;d guess around 10mm or 14mm. When the photos were uploaded, I was dismayed to find that the images were all very blue. My home felt so cold, and one of the reasons for that was the incorrect white balance.</p><p> Personally, I prefer to add a warm feel to all my photos, so I tend to add that during editing. You can go for a neutral look – and it can help to use a gray card when on site – or you can emphasize warmth, but if you try the latter approach, do be careful that the whites still look white and not yellow or cream.</p><p> Bottom line: Always remember that what often draws people to an image is a feeling or emotion. Your image becomes all the more powerful if it reminds the viewer of a sentiment, experience, or something that resonates with them. <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/setting-the-mood-by-adjusting-your-white-balance/">White balance is key</a> in helping achieve this kind of engagement with your viewer. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="carefully-edit-your-interior-images"> 11. Carefully edit your interior images</h2><p> Without editing your architectural photos, the results will be lackluster. Therefore, I encourage you to edit each and every image that you plan to share!</p><p> Start by importing your photos to your favorite editing program and follow these basic editing steps to create more refined results. (Note that I reference Lightroom Classic, but you can achieve the same effects in pretty much any editor.) </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="straighten-out-the-lines"> Straighten out the lines</h3><p> Doing this will instantly polish up your photos. If you shot at a height of roughly five feet from the floor and kept the camera level, the amount of straightening you have to correct should be minimal. In Lightroom, you can find straightening options in the Lens Corrections panel. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="fill-in-and-even-out-the-light"> Fill in and even out the light</h3><p> Before making any adjustments to the brightness or exposure, be sure to correct any lens vignetting. (This is when the corners of the image are a bit darker and is especially common with wide-angle lenses.) Lightroom offers lens profiles that will automatically take into account your lens&#39;s optics and make automatic corrections; just make sure that <strong>Enable Profile Corrections</strong> is checked in the Lens Corrections panel.</p><p> And if you don&#39;t like Lightroom&#39;s automatic adjustments, you can always head into the <strong>Manual</strong> tab and use the sliders to achieve the effect you envisioned.</p><p> Once your corners are corrected, use a Brush to correct the exposure in bright or dark areas. This is your time to dodge and burn. I find that erring on the side of overexposure lends a more natural feel to the space. I recommend pushing the overall exposure up slowly, and when it feels too bright, start pulling back.</p><p> You can also lighten dark areas slightly with the <strong>Shadows</strong> slider in the Basic panel. However, be careful not to lighten the shadows so much that you bring out grain (noise) or that the image looks fake. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="perform-color-corrections"> Perform color corrections</h3><p> Adjust the overall color temperature as needed. If you like a warmer effect, as I do, aim for warmth, not obvious yellow.</p><p> Also, bump up the <strong>Vibrance</strong> slider a bit instead of messing with the <strong>Saturation</strong> slider. Added Saturation can quickly make a photo look too fake, while Vibrance is a more subtle tool that helps give the color a little extra kick. Again, play with the sliders on these settings; seeing what your eye is comfortable with will go a long way toward honing your color-correcting skills. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Interiors4.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interiors4" title="Interiors4.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by Natalia Roberts </figcaption></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="adjust-the-clarity-and-sharpness"> Adjust the clarity and sharpness</h3><p> Boost the Clarity slider, but do it slowly. Clarity is a great way to polish up a photo without going overboard on contrast, plus it gives the photo an overall crisp look. Depending on the image, you may want to simultaneously play with decreasing the Blacks slider a bit, too.</p><p> You may also want to add a bit of sharpening (in the <strong>Details</strong> panel). Be careful not to push the <strong>Amount</strong> slider too far, however; you want an image that looks detailed, not an image that&#39;s full of unpleasant haloing. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="clean-up-the-scene-with-cloning-and-healing"> Clean up the scene with cloning and healing</h3><p> Use your editing program&#39;s healing tools to remove any dust spots or other anomalies that may have gotten onto the photo.</p><p> Lightroom offers a few options: Clone, Heal, and Content-Aware REmove. Healing is a great option when correcting small spots, as it will have a softer blend to it, but I like to use the Clone tool to remove any glares or reflections. You can also use it to remove address numbers if needed.</p><p> By the way, while I typically use Lightroom for editing photos, my personal preference for cloning is Photoshop&#39;s Stamp tool. It seems to allow for more control over the brush itself, therefore making it easier to clone in a way that looks natural. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="interior-architectural-photography-tips-final-words"> Interior architectural photography tips: final words</h2><p> Shooting interiors often comes with difficulties, and getting good at interior photography isn&#39;t always easy.</p><p> However, with the tips I shared above plus some practice, you&#39;ll be capturing stunning photos in no time at all!

Let&#39;s dive right in! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="why-does-lightroom-build-previews"> Why does Lightroom build previews?</h2><p> Every file in Lightroom has a preview – but why? Why is this necessary, when other programs, including Photoshop, don&#39;t use previews at all?</p><p> It has to do with Lightroom&#39;s unique form of image editing, which is referred to as <em>non-destructive</em> . You see, when you edit images in Lightroom – for instance, when you boost the exposure or increase the sharpening – the software doesn&#39;t change the pixels of your photos directly. Instead, Lightroom stores a record of these edits in its own database. And each time you view a photo, Lightroom accesses the database record for that file, then serves up a <em>preview</em> with all your edits.</p><p> In other words, no matter how heavily you edit a photo, Lightroom leaves the original file unchanged. It uses <em>previews</em> to display the adjustments. Then, when you export an image, you get an entirely new file with all the edits baked in. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="lightroom-previews-in-the-library-module"> Lightroom previews in the Library module</h2><p> The Lightroom Library module uses previews to display your photos so that you can view, zoom, rate, and flag them.</p><p> Note that there are several types of previews you can build in the Library, and each one offers slightly different functionality:</p><ul><li> Minimal previews</li><li> Embedded &amp; Sidecar previews</li><li> Standard previews</li><li> 1:1 previews</li></ul><p> There&#39;s also a fifth type of preview, Smart Previews, which I discuss elsewhere in the article.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-224247" style="width:441px"><span class="space" style="width:441px; padding-top:66.89%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="441" height="295" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/lightroom-previews-2.jpg?resize=441%2C295&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom preview options upon importing" class="wp-image-224247" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/lightroom-previews-2.jpg?w=441&amp;ssl=1 441w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/lightroom-previews-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/lightroom-previews-2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/lightroom-previews-2.jpg?resize=436%2C293&amp;ssl=1 436w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="minimal-previews"> Minimal previews</h3><p> Minimal previews are the smallest previews Lightroom offers.</p><p> Using Minimal previews – as opposed to the other options on the list – will save space, and Lightroom can add minimal previews <em>fast</em> (they actually come straight from the original image file). But the results won&#39;t be high quality.</p><p> So if you need to import hundreds of photos and you&#39;re in a rush, Minimal previews might make sense. Later on, as you view and edit your images, Lightroom will then spend time creating larger previews.</p><p> Unfortunately, creating larger previews eats up processing power. So while Minimal previews may allow for quicker imports in the beginning, if you want to view your photos at the highest-possible quality without lag, consider using a different preview type. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="embedded-sidecar-previews"> Embedded &amp; Sidecar previews</h3><p> Like Minimal previews, Lightroom&#39;s Embedded &amp; Sidecar previews come directly from the original image file. They&#39;re bigger than Minimal previews, but they&#39;re not <em>much</em> bigger, so they&#39;re quick and easy to add to the catalog.</p><p> But Embedded &amp; Sidecar previews aren&#39;t sufficient for closer viewing or editing. If you tell Lightroom to use Embedded previews, and then you browse through the Library module or you try to edit images in the Develop module, you&#39;ll notice delays as Lightroom builds its own better-quality previews (see the section on standard previews,以下）。</p><p> As with Minimal previews, Embedded &amp; Sidecar previews are helpful when you&#39;re looking to quickly import your photos, but they&#39;re not ideal if you plan to spend significant time browsing, organizing, and editing your files.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="standard-previews"> Standard previews</h3><p> Standard previews are designed for everyday Lightroom use. They look good, they offer a beautiful rendering of an image, and they&#39;re not as big as 1:1 previews (featured below).</p><p> Lightroom takes longer to build Standard previews than it does to add Minimal previews or Embedded &amp; Sidecar previews. This is because Lightroom makes its Standard previews from scratch rather than pulling them from the original image file.</p><p> Note that, if you feel your Standard previews are taking up too much space, or you simply want Lightroom to build them faster, you can adjust their size in the Catalog Settings window. I&#39;d recommend picking the <strong>Auto</strong> option, which tells Lightroom to build previews that match your monitor resolution, though if you&#39;re running low on hard drive space, you can always choose a lower-resolution option as needed:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-126676" style="width:658px"><span class="space" style="width:658px; padding-top:69%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="658" height="454" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-2.jpg?resize=658%2C454&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom catalog settings" class="wp-image-126676" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-2.jpg?w=658&amp;ssl=1 658w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-2.jpg?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-2.jpg?resize=600%2C414&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Standard previews are great, especially if you&#39;re planning on simply viewing your photos in Lightroom. The only problem is that Standard previews aren&#39;t designed for zooming in for close-up views; if you start with a Standard preview, then zoom in, Lightroom is forced to build a 1:1 preview, which can cause lag.</p><p> And speaking of 1:1 previews:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="previews"> 1:1 previews</h3><p> 1:1 previews are Lightroom&#39;s highest-quality option for image viewing because they&#39;re full-sized previews that let you zoom into 100%. They also take the longest to build.</p><p> In other words, if you tell Lightroom to build 1:1 previews, it&#39;ll take a <em>long</em> time – but when browsing photos afterward, you can zoom in with zero delay.</p><p> Another drawback to 1:1 previews is that they take up a lot of hard drive space. Lightroom handles this by discarding the preview file after a set amount of time. The default is 30 days, but you can change that in the Catalog settings if need be:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-126677" style="width:658px"><span class="space" style="width:658px; padding-top:69%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="658" height="454" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-3.jpg?resize=658%2C454&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom previews" class="wp-image-126677" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-3.jpg?w=658&amp;ssl=1 658w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-3.jpg?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-3.jpg?resize=600%2C414&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you like to pixel peep, then it probably does make sense to generate 1:1 previews in advance. That way, you don&#39;t have to wait while Lightroom makes the files. On the other hand, if you rarely use Lightroom&#39;s zoom function, you might want to stick to Standard previews and only create 1:1 previews as required. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-build-the-right-preview-in-the-library-module"> How to build the right preview in the Library module</h3><p> I&#39;ve talked a lot about these different Lightroom previews, but how do you actually build them?</p><p> There are a few ways, but the easiest is to simply select your desired preview type upon import. On the right-hand side of the import dialog, Lightroom lets you select from the Build Preview dropdown:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-126675" style="width:333px"><span class="space" style="width:333px; padding-top:110.51%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="333" height="368" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-1.jpg?resize=333%2C368&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom previews upon import" class="wp-image-126675" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-1.jpg?w=333&amp;ssl=1 333w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-1.jpg?resize=271%2C300&amp;ssl=1 271w" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Remember: If you&#39;re happy with a low-resolution preview (and lag when viewing photos later on), go with a Minimal or Embedded preview. Otherwise, choose Standard or 1:1.</p><p> By the way, if you initially create too-small previews and you decide you&#39;d like Lightroom to generate larger files, you can always select <strong>Library>;Previews</strong> , then direct Lightroom to build Standard or 1:1 previews.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-126680" style="width:555px"><span class="space" style="width:555px; padding-top:119.28%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="555" height="662" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-6.jpg?resize=555%2C662&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom previews" class="wp-image-126680" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-6.jpg?w=555&amp;ssl=1 555w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-6.jpg?resize=252%2C300&amp;ssl=1 252w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-6.jpg?resize=503%2C600&amp;ssl=1 503w" sizes="(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="smart-previews"> Smart Previews</h3><p> A Smart Preview is a high-quality, highly compressed preview, and it differs from the options discussed above because it can be used in the Develop module.</p><p> You see, even after generating Standard and 1:1 previews, you can&#39;t <em>edit</em> in the Develop module without access to the original image file. But if you&#39;ve created Smart Previews, you can edit images – even when the hard drive containing the original files isn&#39;t connected to your computer.</p><p> This feature lets you use Smart Previews to edit while traveling. All you need is a laptop, a copy of your Lightroom Catalog, the preview files containing Library module previews, and Smart Previews.</p><p> Note that you can create Smart Previews upon import:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-126678" style="width:336px"><span class="space" style="width:336px; padding-top:108.33%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="336" height="364" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-4.jpg?resize=336%2C364&#038;ssl=1" alt="Smart Previews Lightroom" class="wp-image-126678" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-4.jpg?w=336&amp;ssl=1 336w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-4.jpg?resize=277%2C300&amp;ssl=1 277w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Though you can also generate Smart Previews later on, simply by selecting a photo, then tapping <strong>Library>;Previews>;Build Smart Previews</strong> . </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="lightroom-previews-in-the-develop-module"> Lightroom previews in the Develop module</h2><p> When you switch from the Library module to the Develop module, Lightroom uses different previews to display your images. Lightroom renders high-quality previews that let you see the result of actions such as <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learn-how-to-use-the-sharpening-tools-in-lightroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharpening</a> , <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-avoid-and-reduce-noise-in-your-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noise reduction</a> , and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/11-steps-basic-portrait-editing-lightroom-beginners-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portrait retouching</a> .</p><p> Note that Develop module previews are cached rather than saved in a preview file; otherwise, Lightroom would need to generate a new preview each time you made an adjustment, which would rapidly eat up most of your hard drive space.</p><p> Now, creating 1:1 previews in the Library module makes no difference to the speed at which Lightroom renders previews in the Develop module. <span style="font-size: revert; color: initial;">But if a Smart Preview exists for a photo, Lightroom uses it instead of rendering a Develop module preview – in either of the following situations:</span></p><ol><li> The hard drive containing the original photo file is disconnected from the computer.</li><li> You have Lightroom CC 2015.7 or Lightroom 6.7 or later, the hard drive containing the original photo file is connected to the computer, and you have the <strong>Use Smart Previews instead of Originals for image editing</strong> preference enabled in Preferences (see below). Note that if you zoom into 1:1, Lightroom will stop using the Smart Preview and will render a full-size preview instead.</li></ol><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-126681" style="width:768px"><span class="space" style="width:768px; padding-top:84.11%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="768" height="646" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-7.jpg?resize=768%2C646&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom previews" class="wp-image-126681" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-7.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-7.jpg?resize=300%2C252&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-7.jpg?resize=600%2C505&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-7.jpg?resize=717%2C603&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Smart Previews are smaller than full-size previews, so Lightroom can run faster when Smart Previews are used in the Develop module. The speed increase can be quite significant. If you don&#39;t frequently zoom into your photos at 100% magnification, then the benefits of preferentially using Smart Previews are considerable. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="which-lightroom-previews-should-you-use"> Which Lightroom previews should you use?</h2><p> Lightroom previews are somewhat confusing, especially for beginners. So I&#39;ll make it easy by sharing hard-and-fast recommendations for different situations:</p><p> When you import images into Lightroom, choose either Standard or 1:1 previews. If you intend to zoom into your images while viewing them in the Library module, you definitely want to pick 1:1 previews. Otherwise, pick Standard.</p><p> If you frequently edit images while traveling, also tick the <strong>Build Smart Previews</strong> option in the Develop module. And if you rarely zoom in to 100% when editing, select the <strong>Use Smart Previews instead of Originals for image editing</strong> option in your Lightroom preferences.</p><p> Now over to you:</p><p> <em>Which previews do you plan to use?
