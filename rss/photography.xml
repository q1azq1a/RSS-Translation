If so, you saw the interesting effect created by the rapid flashing. Smooth movement gets broken into a series of frozen-stepped motion, not unlike the frames of an old-time movie.</p><p> Now, what if you could do that with your still camera – that is, create a series of images, all within one frame? If you have a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/a-beginners-guide-to-working-with-flash-off-camera/" target="_blank" aria-label="portable flash (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">portable flash</a> or studio strobe capable of generating the stroboscopic effect, there&#39;s a good chance you can do this. You can create images that are a great way of analyzing and showing motion, and this article will show you how! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-is-an-in-camera-stroboscopic-effect"> What is an in-camera stroboscopic effect?</h2><p> Different flash manufacturers may use different names for this capability. Canon, Godox, and Yongnuo call it Multi-Mode, while Nikon calls it the Repeating Flash Function. However you refer to it, multi-flash is the capability to fire multiple flashes during one camera exposure.</p><p> The best way to see if your flash is capable of this effect is to read your flash manual. If the flash you own <em>does</em> have this capability, a photo illustration will often accompany it showing the kind of images possible, like this one here: </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-175452 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-175452" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Week-29-Pepper-Strobe.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Stroboscopic photography with multi-flash mode" class="wp-image-175452" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Week-29-Pepper-Strobe.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Week-29-Pepper-Strobe.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Week-29-Pepper-Strobe.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Week-29-Pepper-Strobe.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Week-29-Pepper-Strobe.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> A bright object on a dark background will help a lot when using the multi-flash technique!</figcaption></figure></div><p> If your flash unit supports it, there will be three constants you can control regardless of the make or model of your flash unit.他们是：</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="power-output"> 1. Power output</h3><p> This controls the intensity of the light output. Typically, output runs from 1/1 (full power) down in fractions of that, such as 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64, or 1/128. The smaller the fraction, the less intense the flash output.</p><p> There are two other things to remember about the flash output:</p><ol><li> The higher the output, the more battery power used, and the longer it will take to recycle the flash before it&#39;s ready for another burst.</li><li> The duration of the flash is shorter as the output power gets lower.  As a result, lower power/shorter durations have more “stopping power” when it comes to freezing motion.</li></ol><p> Just to give you an idea of different flash speeds at different power outputs, the chart below shows approximate flash durations for various power settings on a Canon 580EX Speedlite:</p><figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th> Flash output setting</th><th> Flash duration</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> 1/1</td><td> 1/250 of a second</td></tr><tr><td> 1/2</td><td> 1/919 of a second</td></tr><tr><td> 1/4</td><td> 1/2,066 of a second</td></tr><tr><td> 1/8</td><td> 1/3,759 of a second</td></tr><tr><td> 1/16</td><td> 1/6,024 of a second</td></tr><tr><td> 1/32</td><td> 1/9,470 of a second</td></tr><tr><td> 1/64</td><td> 1/14,000 of a second</td></tr><tr><td> 1/128</td><td> 1/20,000 of a second </td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-number-of-flashes"> 2. The number of flashes</h3><p> This one is easy and is exactly what it sounds like: it&#39;s the number of times the flash will fire during the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure</a> .</p><p> Set it for however many times you want the flash to fire in your image. That&#39;s how many “steps” of the moving object you will see. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-175461 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/stroboscopic-flash-hammer-swing.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Stroboscopic photography with multi-flash mode" class="wp-image-175461" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> How many times did the flash fire during this sequence? Count the number of steps. </figcaption></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-flash-frequency"> 3、闪光频率</h3><p>This one can sometimes throw the new user as it uses a term not always familiar to everyone: hertz. In very simple terms, hertz refers to the number of cycles in one second. So, 1 Hz=1 flash per second, 10 Hz=10 flashes per second, etc. </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-175460 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/multi-flash-mode_(5).jpg?ssl=1" alt="Stroboscopic photography with multi-flash mode" class="wp-image-175460" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The three settings you can control are power output, number of flashes, and frequency. This is a Canon 550EX flash. </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-determine-your-flash-settings-the-formula"> How to determine your flash settings: the formula</h2><p> Here&#39;s how you put it all together.</p><p> Figure out how much power you need and set the power output first. Your distance from the flash to the subject will help you determine it, and so will how fast and how many flashes you expect to fire and how much “freezing action” you need.</p><p> Then think about the speed of the action you intend to capture and its duration. Finally, determine how many steps you want to see freezing the action.</p><p> The formula looks like this:</p><p> <strong>Number of flashes/Hz = Shutter speed</strong></p><p> Let&#39;s use an example. You want to take a strobed shot of a hammer swinging down and striking a nail. You can put the flash close to the action, so 1/32 power might be enough. If you use a slow swing, you can complete the action in one second. You&#39;d like 6 steps of action in the shot.</p><p> Plug those numbers into the formula:</p><p> <strong>6 flashes/6 Hz (6 flashes per second) = 1 second shutter speed</strong></p><p> Now say you want to capture something faster like a club hitting a golf ball off a tee. You can still get the flash close enough to use 1/32 power. You want 15 steps in your sequence and guess the action will take just 1/30th of a second to complete.</p><p> Here&#39;s how the formula looks for that:</p><p> <strong>15 flashes/199 Hz = ~1/15s shutter speed</strong></p><p>公式是正确的，但也许您使用的热靴闪光灯（在我的例子中是<a href="https://geni.us/dPSCanon580EXIIFlash" target="_blank" aria-label="Canon 550EX (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" class="ek-link">佳能 550EX</a> ）最多只能达到 199 Hz。 Even at that, the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> would have to be about 1/15s, not the 1/30s you wanted. Could you live with just eight steps in your shot?</p><p> <strong>8 flashes/150 Hz = ~1/20s shutter speed</strong></p><p> That&#39;s closer! If you slow down your swing, it just might work.</p><p> You will find that at the higher hertz rates, the flash fires so fast that it seems like just one burst. However, when you check your shot, a fast-moving subject lit with a high flash-per-second (hertz) rate should show the individual steps in the movement. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="exposing-for-a-stroboscopic-image"> Exposing for a stroboscopic image</h2><p> You&#39;ve used the formula to determine what numbers you want to enter into the flash, and that&#39;s determined your minimum shutter speed. Here, however, the flash is firing within the scope of the shutter duration, and shutter speed isn&#39;t really a factor in setting exposure.</p><p> Here are the factors that <em>will</em> affect your exposure:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="ambient-light">环境光</h3><p>You want the flash doing the work here. Also, you will typically be shooting at longer shutter speeds to capture the duration of the action.</p><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-mix-ambient-light-and-fill-flash-for-outdoor-portraits/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Ambient light</a> is not your friend as it will begin to force settings you may not want. You also want to eliminate distractions in the shot as the steps of the object in motion will create a busy enough image already. Your best bet is to work in a darkened room and use a black or very dark background.</p><p> Set everything up with a work light on, but switch it off before making the shot so the flash is the only source of illumination.</p><p> That leaves a few things you can do to adjust exposure:</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="set-the-iso"> Set the ISO</h4><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="ISO adjustments (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO adjustments</a> can be helpful here as they allow you to have the aperture and shutter speed where you want them and adjust this third leg of the <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/mastering-the-exposure-triangle-for-newbies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure triangle</a> to get the exposure where you need it. As always, aim to keep the ISO as low as possible to limit noise – but also remember modern cameras have become far less noisy in recent times. Know what your camera can do and at what point you will get too much noise.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="set-the-aperture"> Set the aperture</h4><p> You will want to adjust your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> based on the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> you need for your particular shot. Also, keep in mind that most lenses perform best between f/8 and f/16, so try to be in that range if you can. You can also adjust your aperture for exposure if you need to. However, I recommend making exposure adjustments using ISO and flash power first.</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="set-the-flash-power"> Set the flash power</h4><p> Remember, this is one of the settings you enter into the flash. The flash output will very much control your exposure. The best rule of thumb here is to only use as much power as you need.</p><p> To recap, these are the advantages of lower flash power settings:</p><ul><li> You&#39;ll use less battery. (If you have an external power source for your flash, use it.  Stroboscopic flash work drains batteries fast.)</li><li> The flash will recycle faster.</li><li> Lower power = shorter flash duration = more motion-stopping capabilities.</li></ul><p> Increase the flash output if you need to, but remember that increasing the ISO might be a better move.</p><p> You may also find the flash will limit what other settings you can input, especially with higher power settings. To allow sufficient time to recycle between flashes and to prevent the flash from overheating, it may not allow many flashes or a higher hertz setting at higher power settings.</p><p> For example, my Canon 550EX can shoot 70 continuous flashes at 10 Hz <em>if</em> the power is turned down to 1/128 power. However, it can only shoot 2 consecutive flashes at that same 10 Hz rate if the flash is turned up to 1/4 power.</p><p> The Multi-Mode on my Canon flash will not work at all if the flash power is set to anything higher than 1/4 power. Full or 1/2 power in Multi-Mode on the 500EX? It simply cannot do it.</p><p> My flash manual has a chart showing how many sequential flashes are possible at various power and hertz settings. Also, the flash&#39;s programming will not allow settings to be input that exceed its capabilities. Canon also warns: “To prevent overheating and deterioration of the flash head, do not use stroboscopic flash for more than 10 frames in rapid succession. After 10 frames, allow the 550EX to cool for at least 10 minutes.”</p><p> So whether you&#39;re using a Canon flash or another make/model, know that stroboscopic flash works your unit hard and be aware of its limitations. </p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-longer-shutter-speed-is-generally-okay">较长的快门速度（通常）是可以的</h4><p>Here&#39;s one more thing to think about when inputting the three parameters into the flash and calculating the shutter speed:</p><p> When you click the shutter, the flash will immediately begin its strobed sequence.</p><p> If you input, say, 6 flashes at 6 hz at 1/32 power, per the formula, it will take 1 second for the flash to complete the programmed cycle. However, there&#39;s no reason that the shutter speed couldn&#39;t be <em>longer</em> , especially since in low ambient light conditions, little if any additional light will add to the exposure once the flash cycle completes.</p><p> So to amend the formula just slightly:</p><p> <strong>The number of flashes/Hz = The <em>minimum</em> shutter speed</strong></p><p> With no additional flashes after the sequence completes, further action is not likely to be seen in the shot. So overestimating the shutter speed is usually not a problem. Underestimating the shutter speed, however, won&#39;t allow the flash sequence to complete before the shutter closes. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-175459 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-175459" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:65.93%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="989" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Mode-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C989&#038;ssl=1" alt="Stroboscopic photography with multi-flash mode" class="wp-image-175459" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Mode-4.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Mode-4.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Mode-4.jpg?resize=768%2C506&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Mode-4.jpg?resize=600%2C396&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Mode-4.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Mode-4.jpg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Mode-4.jpg?resize=717%2C473&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> These are the settings for the golf club shot below.

I&#39;ve offered some guidelines in the previous sections, but how can you ensure perfect exposure? There are a few ways to approach this:</p><ol><li> <strong>Use an external light meter.</strong> Fire the flash and take a reading as you normally would with an <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/photography-1018-meter/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">external meter</a> . Use that to determine your camera setting at the predetermined shutter speed.调整 ISO、光圈和/或闪光灯输出功率以获得正确的曝光。 If you are familiar with using an external flash meter, you will know how to do this. But if you don&#39;t have an external light meter, you might try the next method:</li><li> <strong>Do manual calculations.</strong> Look up the guide number of your flash, determine the distance to your subject, and then – using the formulas in your flash manual – calculate your settings. It can work! But if math is not your forte, or you don&#39;t fancy crunching numbers, you could always try the third option:</li><li> <strong>The trial-and-error chimping method.</strong> Okay, that&#39;s my name for it. But it simply involves starting at, say, an ISO of 100, an f-stop of about f/8, and a flash output of 1/32 power. Set the number of flashes and frequency that you think best. Shoot, take a look at the LCD playback (ie, chimp), and if the image is too dark, increase the flash power or open the aperture. Test, chimp, and repeat as needed until you get it dialed in. Digital storage is cheap, and once you figure out your settings, unless you change the flash-to-subject distance, you should be set for the session. </li></ol><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="how-to-get-even-better-multi-flash-photos"> How to get even better multi-flash photos</h2><p> At this point, you should be familiar with the basics of stroboscopic photography.

Also, because <em>static</em> objects in the shot will get the full sum of the light, they will be brighter.</p><p> You can learn from your mistakes, but why not learn from mine instead? </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-175453 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-175453" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:77.6%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1164" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Golf-Swing-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1164&#038;ssl=1" alt="Stroboscopic photography with multi-flash mode" class="wp-image-175453" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Golf-Swing-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Golf-Swing-1.jpg?resize=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Golf-Swing-1.jpg?resize=768%2C596&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Golf-Swing-1.jpg?resize=600%2C466&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Golf-Swing-1.jpg?resize=717%2C556&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> A patterned background placed too close to the subject and a golf club with a black shaft and head made this image less than it could have been.</figcaption></figure></div><p> For the stroboscopic shot above, I used a dark, patterned photographer&#39;s popup background, but I should have used a solid black background and placed it farther from the subject.

A remote trigger can help</h3><p> Unless you have an assistant (or maybe three hands), trying to control the camera while performing the action you&#39;re trying to capture and <em>also</em> nailing the timing is not impossible, but it makes things a lot more difficult. Therefore, a remote trigger that allows you to fire the camera as you start the action sequence can be a huge help.</p><p> If you are mounting your flash off-camera, a means of triggering the flash will also be necessary. Use either a wired connection, a wireless radio trigger, or an infrared camera/flash system.</p><p> Another level of sophistication, if you want to add it, would be a flash trigger, perhaps activated by sound, breaking a laser beam, etc. I have used the <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/review-of-the-miops-smart-trigger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">MIOPS Smart Trigger</a> on other photo projects with success. A real advantage it adds is precision and repeatability of a shot – something that you will otherwise be forced to leave up to luck and timing.</p><p> In a dark environment, use Bulb mode. Open the shutter, and when the action activates the flash trigger (ie, breaks the laser beam or creates a sound), the flash fires its strobe sequence.</p><p> Good flash triggers aren&#39;t cheap. However, if you do a lot of this kind of photography, they significantly speed up the work and permit the repeatability of a shot, which saves a <em>lot</em> of time and effort.</p><p> <span class="responsive-image aligncenter wp-image-175454 size-full" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:34.8%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-175454 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Golf-Swing-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C522&#038;ssl=1" alt="How-to-Use-Multi-flash-to-Capture-Compelling-Action-Photos" width="1500" height="522" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Golf-Swing-2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Golf-Swing-2.jpg?resize=300%2C104&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Golf-Swing-2.jpg?resize=768%2C267&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Golf-Swing-2.jpg?resize=600%2C209&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Multi-Flash-Golf-Swing-2.jpg?resize=717%2C250&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="practice-makes-perfect">熟能生巧！</h2><p> Like any photography, practice will improve your results with stroboscopic flash work.

Your “Why?” doesn&#39;t have to be etched in stone, but a clear answer will guide how you invest your time and money into growing.</p><p> Here are some example objectives. “I invest time in my landscape photography because…”</p><ul><li> “我想旅行。”</li><li> “I want to make a full-time living.”</li><li> “I want to capture unique locations.”</li><li> “I want to grow my local following.”</li><li> “I want to be the best at my craft.”</li></ul><p> You probably have several objectives in mind, so the next step is to prioritize them. Which objective(s) trumps the others in the competition for your time? Objectives are critical because they help you identify conflicts of interest. Once you start formulating goals, you want to ensure they naturally support your objectives.</p><p> For example, you might be a landscape photographer because you love traveling, but your goal might be to sell prints at local art shows. These may well clash with each other, as manning a booth three days a week means less freedom to travel. In that case, you may need to adjust your goals and find another way to support your wanderlust, even if it&#39;s unrelated to photography.</p><p> You should write your objectives out on paper, or at least on the computer, by the way; this is important because it helps clarify your thoughts and gives you accountability.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="set-effective-goals"> 2. Set effective goals </h2><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mt_bachelor,_cascade_lakes_bend,_oregon.jpg?ssl=1" alt="How to use goal planning to grow as a landscape photographer" class="wp-image-154677" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Mt Bachelor, Cascade Lakes Bend, Oregon</figcaption></figure></div><p> Setting a goal often has a disheartening tone. We&#39;ve all made goals or resolutions that yielded no results other than self-reproach.</p><p> “Oh, I didn&#39;t lose 10 pounds.”</p><p> “I didn&#39;t write half as much as I wanted.”</p><p> “I didn&#39;t read a book this month.”</p><p> But self-reproach is often a symptom of a poorly chosen goal. Effective goals aren&#39;t about slapping yourself for missing them. They&#39;re about deliberately deciding how you want to invest your time and resources. It&#39;s about determining the trajectory you want to take instead of going with the fluctuations of each day.</p><p> Here are two of my personal goals:</p><ol><li> Capture and produce better photography.</li><li> Expand my photography audience.</li></ol><p> But while these goals offer a general direction, they aren&#39;t concrete. So I like to follow them up with more specific formulations for what success looks like.</p><ol><li> Expand my portfolio with shots that have a compelling foreground, middleground, and background.</li><li> Write for two new publications.</li></ol><p> Of course, your goals probably won&#39;t be the same as mine (though they can be!). As you write your goals, pay careful attention to your objectives, and try to pick specific, practical, measurable goals that will help you take steps toward achieving each objective.</p><p> Note that goal-setting can involve significant brainstorming and even guesswork; if your objective is to make money with your landscape photography, for instance, then you should think about various options (leading workshops? selling prints? teaching classes?) and craft your goals accordingly. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="apply-and-adapt-shoot-goals">3. Apply and adapt “shoot” goals</h2><p> Along with your general goals (see the previous section!), I recommend setting specific goals for each landscape photography trip. I call these “shoot” goals, and I often select them in response to notes I took in the field on a previous outing, or based on frustrations I faced in post-production. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/man-o-war_bay,_dorset,_england.jpg?ssl=1" alt="How to use goal planning to grow as a landscape photographer" class="wp-image-154676" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Man-O-War Bay, Dorset, England</figcaption></figure></div><p> Your “shoot” goals should be highly practical and focused on your photographic approach.

Break your goals into results </h2><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/brunate_lago_di_como,_italy.jpg?ssl=1" alt="How to use goal planning to grow as a landscape photographer" class="wp-image-154674" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Brunate Lago Di Como, Italy</figcaption></figure></div><p> Objectives give you direction. Goals give you outcomes. But neither tells you <em>how</em> to accomplish them or how much progress you&#39;ve made towards them. That&#39;s where <em>results</em> come in.</p><p> How will you accomplish your goals? You can&#39;t – at least, you can&#39;t accomplish them all at once. They&#39;re too big, and they say nothing about what actions you should take. To reach your goals, they need to be broken down into small, measurable steps – ie, results. These are small tasks you can complete in no more than a day, and that contribute toward the overall goal.</p><p> Results need to be carefully phrased so they reflect tangible outcomes. Here are some examples of poorly formulated results:</p><ul><li> “Edit for one hour every day.”</li><li> “Spend 30 minutes writing about photography.”</li></ul><p> These results are ineffective because they involve time. Who cares whether you spent 30 minutes editing or three hours? Instead, phrase them in terms of tangible outcomes:</p><ul><li> “Finish a rough edit of three photos today.”</li><li> “Finish outlining my landscape photography article.”</li></ul><p> Each of these results produces something of value – edited photos and an outlined article – and can be completed in one sitting. Plus, the faster you complete each result, the sooner you can move on to other things.</p><p> Breaking down goals into results is hard to do in any field, whether it&#39;s productivity, photography, or software development. But failing to formulate effective results is the number one reason we fail to accomplish anything.</p><p> Don&#39;t tackle a goal and plan as you go. Planning and execution are two different skills. And when you do them simultaneously, you ironically spend the least amount of time on the hardest part: planning. It sounds counterintuitive, but (at least for me), once I break the goal into results, executing them is usually the easiest part.</p><p> What about self-imposed deadlines? Personally, I&#39;ve had limited success with them because time is a poor measure of progress. I sketch out a rough timeline (“by this time next year”), but I write those dates alongside my goals instead of my results. As long as my results are prioritized, deadlines are often arbitrary because I&#39;m always working on the most valuable results.</p><p> How are you spending your time so each minute counts? Focus on <em>results</em> , not <em>time</em> .</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="do-a-retrospective"> 5. Do a retrospective</h2><p> The learning doesn&#39;t end after a shoot. In fact, I learn the most by reviewing photographs from shoots that <em>didn&#39;t</em> quite work out. It sounds counterintuitive, but thanks to something called <em>survival bias</em> , we tend to:</p><ul><li> Overestimate what we can learn from successful shots</li><li> Underestimate what we can learn from shots that didn&#39;t make the cut.</li></ul><p> Consequently, we end up discarding our best source of learning material!</p><p> To beat survivorship bias, conduct a retrospective on some of your failed shots to understand <em>why</em> they didn&#39;t work, and what you&#39;ll do differently next time. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/slea_head,_dingle,_ireland.jpg?ssl=1" alt="How to use goal planning to grow as a landscape photographer" class="wp-image-154680" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Slea Head, Dingle, Ireland</figcaption></figure></div><p> None of my shots from Slea Head on Ireland&#39;s Dingle Peninsula worked out.

And for me, they often form my shoot goals for the <em>next</em> trip. On this year&#39;s trip to Oregon, my goals changed to reflect the lessons I learned from Ireland and the UK. I&#39;ve reproduced them here:</p><ul><li> Capture two stunning images per day for a total of 26 from the trip.</li><li> Identify the emotion of a scene, then highlight it with composition and light.</li><li> Spend 30% less time snapping photos and instead spend it testing compositions.</li><li> Shoot exclusively at dawn and twilight and spend the rest of the day trying compositions on my smartphone.</li><li> Use an <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/neutral-density-filters-landscape-photos/" target="_blank" aria-label="ND filter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ND filter</a> for water without exception.</li><li> Identify a strong foreground, middleground, and background before snapping.</li><li> Don&#39;t waste a second on angles filled with busy textures.</li></ul><p> I would have forgotten many of these shoot goals if I hadn&#39;t written them down and reviewed them before each shoot. But I took my shoot goals seriously, and being so intentional paid off. As I said earlier, I learned more in two weeks than I had in two years of shooting – and I produced some of my favorite work to date. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/roads_end,_oregon.jpg?ssl=1" alt="How to use goal planning to grow as a landscape photographer" class="wp-image-154678" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Roads End, Oregon </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="start-intentionally-growing-as-a-landscape-photographer"> Start intentionally growing as a landscape photographer!</h2><p> While approaches to goal planning come in many flavors with various terminologies, they all aim to help individuals connect desired outcomes with strategic actions.

Seeing such a tiny and perfect little human being stirs emotions in everyone. It&#39;s no wonder that there has been a significant rise in the number of photographers offering their services not only for pregnancy and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/newborn-photography-tips-for-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="newborn images (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">newborn images</a> but also for photographing the birth itself as a way to tell the story of that particular moment in time.</p><p> That said, while photographing childbirth can make for deeply meaningful pictures that parents will treasure for decades, it&#39;s very tough to do well. I&#39;m sure you can understand why: your photographic subjects will not be focused on you, you&#39;ll likely be in a busy area with medical professionals moving around, and the parent(s) will be extremely stressed (to say the least) 。</p><p> And let&#39;s not forget the privacy concerns, the low light, the raw emotions, the responsibility that comes from a complete lack of do-overs…it&#39;s enough to make any professional photographer think twice before agreeing to such a photoshoot.</p><p> (Note: If you&#39;re thinking of photographing the birth of your own child, only some of the above difficulties will apply – but you&#39;ll run into additional problems, such as the need to divide your attention between your partner&#39;s labor and your camera, all while feeling unbelievably stressed. It <em>is</em> possible to do your own birth photography, and during COVID, a lot of couples took this approach out of necessity. However, before you commit to photographing your partner&#39;s upcoming childbirth, you should think long and hard about hiring a professional.)</p><p> If you&#39;re still reading, then I&#39;m guessing you do indeed plan to photograph a childbirth in the near future. At the very least, you want to know what birth photography involves so you can make an informed decision. Below, I walk you through considerations, tips, and techniques to help you handle such a difficult but profoundly meaningful photoshoot.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="you-are-always-on-call"> 1. You are <em>always</em> on call</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-261577" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:72.17%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="433" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-14.jpeg?resize=600%2C433&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to photograph childbirth" class="wp-image-261577" title="Story 1.jpg" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-14.jpeg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-14.jpeg?resize=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you are interested in birth photography, you will want to make sure that you have the time and flexibility for it. Your client can go into labor at any time (even with a cesarean birth because a doctor&#39;s schedule can change if there is an emergency!). You might get a call at 3 AM, or when you&#39;re running your own child&#39;s birthday party, or two months before the baby is due.</p><p> That&#39;s all part of the job, so make sure you have arranged for child care for your own children and that you can clear anything off your schedule if the need arises. Also remember that births can be short or they can be very long, so you may find yourself spending long hours at the hospital, which again requires extreme schedule flexibility.</p><p> Oh, and because you&#39;re always on call, you must be reachable; in other words, once you&#39;ve been hired to photograph a birth, you must keep your phone on at all times, and you cannot head off for an off-the-grid yoga retreat in the mountains.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="you-cant-set-the-scene"> 2. You can&#39;t set the scene</h2><p> During a childbirth, nurses, doctors, techs, and interns will all be walking in and out of the room. This is something that you&#39;ll have to accept because you simply cannot ask medical professionals to stay out so you can set up the perfect shot.</p><p> You have to just go with the flow and work within the space you have and around the people in the room.

If at all possible, arrange to meet the doctor before the birth</h2><p> Meeting the doctor ahead of time can give you an opportunity to talk to them and find out if they have any particular rules for photographing or recording labor and birth.</p><p> It also gives you a chance to talk to them about what happens if your client has a cesarean. Some doctors will arrange with the anesthesiologist to get the photographer back into the operating room in non-emergency cases. (In an emergency, you will not be allowed back there.) In most cases, the anesthesiologist has the final say because you would be in their area to shoot. Don&#39;t take it personally if they say no to a photographer in the OR. They are looking out for your client.</p><p> Speaking of which:</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="have-a-backup-plan"> 6. Have a backup plan</h2><p> If your client does have an emergency cesarean and you&#39;re not allowed into the operating room, it&#39;s important that you&#39;re ready to make the most of the time you <em>do</em> have to photograph. While you never know for sure what&#39;s going to happen, with a backup plan in place, you&#39;ll be much more likely to end up with shots that your client will love.</p><p> This means making sure you know where the nursery is and where your client will be brought to after delivery. The doctor will fill you in during your meeting about their standard protocol (see above!), but make sure you know where everything is once you are there.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-261576" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.5%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="399" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-13.jpeg?resize=600%2C399&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to photograph childbirth" class="wp-image-261576" title="OR.jpg" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-13.jpeg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-13.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-13.jpeg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-13.jpeg?resize=115%2C75&amp;ssl=1 115w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="be-prepared-for-the-unexpected"> 7. Be prepared for the unexpected</h2><p> As I explained at the beginning of this article, babies pay no attention to your time frame, the doctor&#39;s time frame, or anyone else&#39;s. They come when they want to. Be ready for a short labor and be even more prepared for a long one. Make sure you have a battery supply for your camera and your phone and extra memory cards. Make sure you have money for vending machines.</p><p> It&#39;s better to have all of that and not need it than to suddenly find yourself on hour 13 of a birth, needing something to snack on but having no money and with a near-dead camera and no extra batteries or chargers.</p><p> Bottom line: Be overprepared, not underprepared. Not only will it give you the best chance at photographic success, but it&#39;ll keep your stress levels (and your client&#39;s stress levels) from going higher than expected. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="make-sure-your-images-tell-the-story-of-the-day"> 8. Make sure your images tell the story of the day</h2><p> Birth photography isn&#39;t just about photographing the actual birth. It&#39;s about telling the story of the entire day, both before and after the birth itself.</p><p> Flowers, balloons, visitors – they all help tell the story. Capture the moments that you think your clients will want to remember. Even take a photo of the dry-erase board where their nurse writes their name and room number. The parents will want to remember their nurse&#39;s name. And if there is a shift change, take a new photo of the board. Record it until the baby is born! They may have a favorite nurse, and you will help them remember their name. Some parents send thank-you cards to the staff, and it&#39;s nice when they can include the names of the people who took care of them.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-261574" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-11.jpeg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to photograph childbirth" class="wp-image-261574" title="Chucks.jpg" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-11.jpeg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-11.jpeg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="remember-that-the-day-is-not-about-you"> 9. Remember that the day is not about you</h2><p> Don&#39;t try to chat with everyone and make yourself the focus of the day. It&#39;s easy to get consumed in the activity and not even realize that you have distracted from the real star of the day! Let your clients know that you are there documenting everything that they want you to. That makes their job a little easier and allows them to focus.</p><p> Relatedly, meet with your clients ahead of time (well in advance, to be safe!) and discuss any concerns they might have and the photos that they do and don&#39;t want you to take. Different clients will have different preferences and comfort levels, and you want to make sure you cater to their needs. Your goal shouldn&#39;t be to capture the pictures that <em>you</em> think matter but to capture the pictures that the <em>client</em> thinks matter. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="convert-the-images-to-black-and-white-but-give-color-versions-too"> 10.

Document the moments and learn from your experience. The next birth will be easier, and you will gradually learn to adapt and navigate your way through the whole birthing process.

It couldn&#39;t be <em>that</em> hard…right?</p><p> Before you decide to make that leap, read this article. Drawing on my own experiences as a professional photographer, I share six essential items to consider before going pro. By the time you&#39;re done, you may find that you are truly ready to become a professional photographer – or you may realize that you should probably throw that idea out the window.</p><p> Before we go any further, I want to clarify something about the photos in this article. First of all, I had to include photos, because every article is better with pictures, right? Secondly, this session was inspiring, fun, and an example of every reason that I <em>love</em> being a photographer. The client who appears does not exemplify any of the cons of the business.</p><p> Oh, and one more thing: For this article, a “professional photographer” is defined as someone who gets paid to take photos, particularly <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-ways-to-take-stunning-portraits/" target="_blank" aria-label="portraits (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">portraits</a> . </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="you-might-not-be-good-enough-yet"> 1. You might not be good enough (yet)</h2><p> Maybe you love photography, and maybe you get a lot of compliments on your photos, but are you a good enough photographer to actually take money from people? It&#39;s a tricky question to answer, but it&#39;s important to consider before you try to turn your photography hobby into a career.</p><p> For instance, do you sometimes take a bunch of photos where the majority of them are garbage? Do you often say to yourself, “I&#39;ll fix that later in Photoshop?” If your photos aren&#39;t consistently in focus, exposed correctly, and great <em>before</em> you get to the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/basic-photo-editing-for-beginners/" target="_blank" aria-label="post-processing stage (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">post-processing stage</a> , you&#39;re not ready to go pro.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-83882" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="499" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/192.jpg?resize=750%2C499&#038;ssl=1" alt="192" class="wp-image-83882" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/192.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/192.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/192.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/192.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Additionally, if you look at other professional photographers&#39; work and wonder how they ever managed to get their photos to look like that, you are not ready. I don&#39;t mean that you have to be able to produce photos exactly like the photographers that you admire. I&#39;m saying that you should have an understanding of how they achieve the look they get. You should know how light, <a aria-label="depth of field (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">depth of field</a> , <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/make-photos-creative-using-camera-angles/" target="_blank" aria-label="camera angles (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">camera angles</a> , etc., contribute to a photo; you should also have an idea of how much a great photo comes from shooting in the field and how much comes from post-processing.</p><p> Here, I want to emphasize one major point: Having a nice camera does not qualify you to be a professional photographer!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-83875" style="width:499px"><span class="space" style="width:499px; padding-top:150.3%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="499" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/151.jpg?resize=499%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="151" class="wp-image-83875" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/151.jpg?w=499&amp;ssl=1 499w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/151.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/151.jpg?resize=399%2C600&amp;ssl=1 399w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="you-might-not-have-enough-experience"> 2. You might not have enough experience</h2><p> This goes along with not being good enough (see the previous tip!), but experience and raw talent aren&#39;t the same thing. Experience is uniquely important because, as a professional photographer, you have to be consistent every time. You have to know that every single session you do will result in good photos and that you can roll with the punches if conditions aren&#39;t ideal. You have to know your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/beginners-guide-to-camera-settings/" target="_blank" aria-label="camera settings (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">camera settings</a> inside and out – because when you&#39;re chasing an uncooperative toddler or doing a fashion shoot just before sunset, you don&#39;t have time to carefully figure out what your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> should be.</p><p> I&#39;ll admit that I didn&#39;t have enough experience when I started. I did some sessions for friends and family, then requests started coming in. I didn&#39;t really have the goal of making money with my photography, but when people started asking me, I thought, “Hey, why not?” Some of my early sessions are dear to my heart, but when I look at some of the photos, I cringe. I feel bad that people paid money for me to experiment and find out who I was as a photographer.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-83879" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="499" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/182.jpg?resize=750%2C499&#038;ssl=1" alt="182" class="wp-image-83879" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/182.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/182.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/182.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/182.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="you-might-lose-the-love-of-photography"> 3. You might lose the love of photography</h2><p> Once you turn a passion into a job or career, there&#39;s a very real possibility of it turning into something you do because you <em>have</em> to, and not because you <em>want</em> to. I&#39;m not saying this happens to everyone, but I&#39;ve seen enough professional photographers burn out and quit that I know it&#39;s a very real thing. You may think that it will be fantastic to make money doing something you love, but are you ready for the possibility of not loving that thing anymore?</p><p> Confession here: I rarely get my camera out anymore for anything except a paid session. When I&#39;m on vacation, sometimes the last thing I want to do is “work” while I&#39;m there, and I certainly don&#39;t want to drag my camera around when I&#39;m supposed to be having fun.  Then, if I do take some photos just for the heck of it, they sit there on my computer forever, because I don&#39;t really feel like sorting and editing yet <em>another</em> batch of photos.</p><p> This doesn&#39;t happen to every pro photographer, but I&#39;m being real here. Sometimes I wish that I could take photos for the fun of it, but the truth is that I&#39;m often too tired after my paid sessions to get my camera out on the weekend and just <em>shoot</em> . I still love photography, but it&#39;s more that I love my job: I love the photos and what I can create, I love working with people, but I don&#39;t love photography just for photography&#39;s sake anymore.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-83880" style="width:499px"><span class="space" style="width:499px; padding-top:150.3%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="499" height="750" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/186.jpg?resize=499%2C750&#038;ssl=1" alt="186" class="wp-image-83880" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/186.jpg?w=499&amp;ssl=1 499w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/186.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/186.jpg?resize=399%2C600&amp;ssl=1 399w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="you-may-not-enjoy-dealing-with-business-stuff"> 4. You may not enjoy dealing with business stuff</h2><p> Taxes, business licenses, contracts, equipment upkeep, scheduling, email, phone calls – they&#39;re all a very real part of running a photography business, and they take far more time and effort than you want to believe. Being a professional photographer is not just happily snapping some photos, collecting money, and then spending all of that money on anything you&#39;d like. There are expenses – lots and lots of them. There are boring, repetitive tasks. There are hours spent doing behind-the-scenes stuff.</p><p> No matter how great of a photographer you are, if you aren&#39;t good at the business side of things, you are going to struggle as a professional.这个很难（硬。真令人沮丧。 Sometimes it&#39;s overwhelming. Some days horrible things happen, like your entire photography calendar disappearing from the cloud (yes, speaking from experience). Sometimes you have to ask people for money, and that&#39;s not easy for everyone. You have to be able to run a pretty tight ship with scheduling, collecting money, and sticking to your policies.</p><p> You also have to <em>decide</em> on your policies, your fees, and how you are going to do business. Believe me, people will ask you to change <em>all of it</em> for them, and you have to be ready.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-83877" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="499" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/165.jpg?resize=750%2C499&#038;ssl=1" alt="165" class="wp-image-83877" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/165.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/165.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/165.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/165.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dealing-with-people-can-be-tough"> 5. Dealing with people can be tough</h2><p> Luckily for me, I really love working with people. Even then, however, some people are hard to deal with sometimes. When people are paying you money to photograph them, sometimes they expect you to do anything and everything they want, and sometimes, even when you&#39;ve done your best, they aren&#39;t happy with you. If you are sensitive – and I am! – that kind of criticism can be very hard to take.</p><p> Most of the people you will take photos for are fantastic, wonderful people who love your work and love you, which is why they hired you in the first place. That won&#39;t happen every time, though.</p><p> Sometimes you&#39;ll have to spend lots of time on the phone talking to a worried client (“What about the weather? What about a child&#39;s bad haircut? What clothes should they wear? What if they smile awkwardly?”). Other times, you&#39;ll work with someone who has lots of ideas they found on Pinterest and wants to discuss every one of them with you, in depth, even if they don&#39;t remotely match your style of photography.</p><p> Sometimes you&#39;ll <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/online-photo-gallery/" target="_blank" aria-label="show a client their gallery (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">show a client their gallery</a> after the shoot, and they&#39;ll say they love it – except they want you to Photoshop every single wrinkle off of their face. Questions are great, and most people don&#39;t have unreasonable demands. But you have to know that sometimes people are just not on the same page as you are, and you have to be able to work with them and do your best to keep them happy.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-83876" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="499" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/155.jpg?resize=750%2C499&#038;ssl=1" alt="155" class="wp-image-83876" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/155.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/155.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/155.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/155.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="being-a-professional-photographer-isnt-the-fairytale-job-you-think-it-is"> 6. Being a professional photographer isn&#39;t the fairytale job you think it is</h2><p> I hear from people all the time about how much fun it must be to be a photographer and how much they wish they could be a photographer, too.</p><p> I also know that many people who jump into the photography business without doing a lot of research and self-evaluation get a harsh slap to the face when they realize that it&#39;s <em>work</em> .<em>很多</em>工作。 Some people step into the “professional photographer” scene on a whim, then step right back out of it within a year or two. Some don&#39;t even last a few months. It&#39;s work to get clients, and it&#39;s work to keep clients. They don&#39;t just fall in your lap, waving hundred dollar bills and smiling their pearly whites for your camera.</p><p> You&#39;re going to have competition, and sometimes you&#39;ll have criticism from others. The world of photographers can be pretty nasty. You will find wonderful people to collaborate with and those who encourage you, but you will also find some who will tear you down if they get the chance.</p><p> It&#39;s not nice to think about, but it&#39;s important that you have a realistic understanding of the job before you sacrifice significant time and money on a career that isn&#39;t right for you.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-83878" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.53%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="499" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/169.jpg?resize=750%2C499&#038;ssl=1" alt="169" class="wp-image-83878" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/169.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/169.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/169.jpg?resize=600%2C399&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/169.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="so-will-you-become-a-professional-photographer"> So…will you become a professional photographer?</h2><p> There are many benefits to running your own business, but it&#39;s also hard. You have to know what you are doing, and if something goes wrong, it&#39;s all on your shoulders. Being a professional photographer requires much more than loving to take pictures. When you realize all of the work it&#39;s going to be, you might decide that taking photos for the love of it, and because you&#39;re an artist, is much more fulfilling in the end.</p><p> Do I sound a little bitter? I know that I might, but I want to be realistic here. I think being a photographer is such a romanticized notion that there are oodles of people just itching to jump into photography as a business without really knowing what they&#39;re getting into. I&#39;ve learned so much over the years, and sometimes I wonder if I would have taken that first step had I really understood all of the cons.</p><p> Then I remember why I do this. Yes, it&#39;s a job, and it&#39;s hard. Yes, I hate the business side of things sometimes. Yes, some days I want to go hide in a hole and bury my camera there. But most of the time I feel blessed beyond measure to be a photographer. I love the people I get to work with. I love creating beautiful photos and capturing real personalities. I love happy clients, and I love that I can create memories for them that will last forever. Right now I wouldn&#39;t trade this job for any other, because now that I&#39;ve learned and lived through the hard parts of my job, I know that it&#39;s all worth it for me.</p><p> Now you get to decide: Will it be worth it for you?

As you move from one image to the next, something intriguing catches your eye: the presence of horizontal lines in many of the images, which lead your eye from one side of the frame to the other and give each <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/composition-in-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="composition (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">composition</a> a stretched, even <em>languid</em> feel 。</p><p> These lines, whether they appear as horizons, outstretched arms, roads, or sidewalks, are powerful tools in the hands of a photographer – and while you don&#39;t need to use them in <em>every</em> shot, the inclusion of horizontal lines can go a long way toward enhancing your images. But you shouldn&#39;t add horizontal lines at random. Instead, it&#39;s important to make conscious decisions about the types of horizontal lines you use, as well as their placement. In this article, I aim to share with you some insightful tips and tricks – so you can master the use of horizontal lines in your photography and transform your compositions!</p><p>让我们开始吧。 </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="why-are-horizontal-lines-so-important-in-photography"> Why are horizontal lines so important in photography?</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-206612" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:56.13%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="842" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-3.jpg?resize=1500%2C842&#038;ssl=1" alt="horizontal lines in photography" class="wp-image-206612" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-3.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-3.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-3.jpg?resize=600%2C337&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-3.jpg?resize=768%2C431&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-3.jpg?resize=717%2C402&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Horizontal lines possess unique properties. For one, they often evoke a sense of stability and rest. Consider the image of a tranquil horizon, a fallen tree, or a calm ocean. Each of these scenes, featuring prominent horizontal lines, exudes a feeling of permanence, timelessness, or serenity. In other words, the lines don&#39;t just exist within the frame; they communicate with the viewer, conveying messages and emotions.</p><p> Horizontal lines aren&#39;t just about creating a mood of stability, however. They also guide the viewer. When your gaze falls upon a horizontal line in an image, it&#39;s almost instinctive to follow it across the frame. (Don&#39;t believe me? Take a look at the images displayed throughout this article, and pay attention to how your eye moves across them!)</p><p> This characteristic makes horizontal lines invaluable for creating emphasis and directing visual flow. They can lead the viewer&#39;s eye toward key elements and keep them engaged with the shot.</p><p> As I emphasized above, it&#39;s crucial to use horizontal lines thoughtfully. When misused, they can lead to unwanted distractions, a lack of dynamism, or even unintentional tension in your composition. That&#39;s why understanding how to use horizontal lines effectively is essential. By mastering this aspect of composition, you can elevate your photography – whether you like to capture the grandeur of landscapes or the subtle nuances of everyday life. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="tips-and-techniques-for-using-horizontal-lines"> Tips and techniques for using horizontal lines</h2><p> Mastering the use of horizontal lines can make a huge difference to your photography – and in the following sections, I&#39;ll delve into several practical techniques. These tips will help you harness the power of horizontal lines, whether you&#39;re a beginner or an experienced photographer seeking to refine your skills! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="start-with-the-rule-of-thirds"> 1. Start with the rule of thirds</h3><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/" target="_blank" aria-label="The rule of thirds (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">The rule of thirds</a> is a compositional guideline that aims to create visually balanced and dynamic images. Picture your frame divided into nine equal segments by two vertical and two horizontal lines. According to the rule of thirds, by placing key elements along these lines or at their intersections, you can significantly enhance your photo&#39;s appeal.</p><p> The rule of thirds is fairly broad, but you can easily use it to guide the placement of horizontal lines within the frame. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re photographing a landscape with a striking foreground or sky. Instead of positioning the horizon line dead-center in the frame, you can use the rule of thirds to position the horizon along the upper or lower horizontal third, adding a sense of depth and interest to your image, like so:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-206611" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-4-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="horizontal lines in photography" class="wp-image-206611" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-4-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-4-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-4-1.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-4-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-4-1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-4-1.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> (Of course, this technique isn&#39;t just for landscapes; it&#39;s versatile enough to be used when positioning horizontal lines in pretty much any photographic genre!)</p><p> For beginners, the rule of thirds is a great starting point. It provides a simple yet effective framework for arranging elements within the frame. But remember, rules are made to be broken. Once you&#39;re comfortable with the rule of thirds, feel free to experiment. Breaking away from these guidelines can lead to uniquely compelling and creative results! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-a-horizontal-line-to-divide-the-frame"> 2. Use a horizontal line to divide the frame</h3><p> Horizontal lines can lead the eye around the frame – but they can <em>also</em> act as visual barriers in an image, effectively halting the viewer&#39;s gaze. This can be creatively exploited to divide your frame, separating various elements or layers within your composition. For instance, an outstretched arm in a group photo can serve as a dividing line, creating a distinction between foreground and background interactions.</p><p> Even if your image doesn&#39;t contain multiple layers, you can still use a horizontal line to divide the frame, creating a sense of simplicity. Imagine a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/photographic-minimalism/" target="_blank" aria-label="minimalist scene (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">minimalist scene</a> where a lone horizon line stretches across the shot. This simplicity can evoke a sense of vastness and solitude. Also, depending on its placement – along a third, or at the center – the line can create subtly different moods.</p><p> This technique of using a horizontal line to divide the frame offers endless creative possibilities. If you take it to heart, it&#39;ll encourage you to look at everyday scenes from a new perspective and work with strong horizontals to effectively divide and balance your images! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-landscape-orientation-for-a-calmer-shot"> 3.

When you want to amplify the calming and stable effect of a horizontal line, such as a horizon, consider shooting in landscape orientation.</p><p> In other words, position your camera so that the frame is wider than it is tall and allow the horizontal line to stretch across the frame. As the name suggests, landscape orientation is frequently employed by landscape photographers, especially when capturing minimalist scenes – but it works for plenty of other genres and subjects, too!</p><p> With a landscape orientation, the viewer&#39;s eye naturally follows the extended line, leading to a visually soothing experience. The unbroken stretch of the horizon or any other horizontal element offers a sense of peace and vastness. It&#39;s an excellent way to highlight the simple beauty of the scene or subject. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-portrait-orientation-for-more-tension"> 4. Use portrait orientation for more tension</h3><p> Conversely, if your goal is to inject a sense of tension or dynamism into your photo, try flipping your camera into portrait orientation. This vertical framing cuts off the horizontal lines, creating a more intense and energetic composition. It&#39;s an effective strategy for capturing bustling street scenes or any setting where chaos and movement are key elements.</p><p> In portrait orientation, the truncated horizontal lines often create a visual barrier, adding an element of surprise or anticipation. This technique is particularly useful when you want to focus on vertical elements, like skyscrapers or trees, while still incorporating the energy of horizontal motion.</p><p> Quick tip: If you&#39;re not sure whether to use a landscape or portrait orientation, try both! It&#39;s always worth experimenting to see which best conveys the story you&#39;re trying to tell with your image.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-206610" style="width:400px"><span class="space" style="width:400px; padding-top:150%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-2.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="horizontal lines in photography" class="wp-image-206610" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-2.jpg?resize=400%2C600&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-2.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-2.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="use-horizontal-lines-to-lead-the-eye"> 5.

This technique can be used in various settings, from urban landscapes to natural scenes, guiding the viewer&#39;s eye to the focal point of your photograph. (Remember, the goal is to use these lines not just as part of the scenery, but as active elements that contribute to the overall impact of your image!) </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="keep-your-horizontal-lines-straight"> 6. Keep your horizontal lines straight</h3><p> One fundamental aspect of using horizontal lines effectively in photography is <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/keeping-your-horizon-line-level/" target="_blank" aria-label="ensuring they are perfectly straight (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ensuring they are perfectly straight</a> . This might seem like a simple tip, but its importance cannot be overstated. A slightly tilted horizon can ruin the visual harmony of an image!</p><p> To maintain straight lines, especially horizons, start by simply paying attention to how you&#39;re holding your camera, and do your best to keep it level. (Many cameras have built-in gridlines in the viewfinder or on the LCD screen. These grids can serve as your guide, aligning the horizontal elements in your frame with precision.) For those who want an extra level of accuracy, a hot shoe bubble level is a handy accessory. It ensures your camera is perfectly level, regardless of the terrain you&#39;re shooting on.</p><p> And if your camera is equipped with an electronic level, take advantage of it! This feature is particularly useful in challenging shooting conditions – such as when you&#39;re photographing from a hill or a moving vehicle – where keeping your camera level might be difficult.</p><p> Finally, if you do end up with a slightly skewed line, it&#39;s not the end of the world. Post-processing programs offer <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-straighten-a-crooked-image-in-photoshop/" target="_blank" aria-label="plenty of effective leveling tools (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">plenty of effective leveling tools</a> , and they&#39;re extremely easy to use. But strive to get it right in-camera first, as straightening an image while editing will cause you to lose some pixels around the edges of the frame.</p><p> Bottom line: Straight horizontal lines will give your images a professional, polished look, ensuring the viewer&#39;s attention remains on the story you&#39;re telling! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="horizontal-lines-in-photography-final-words"> Horizontal lines in photography: final words</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-206614" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-6.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="horizontal lines in photography" class="wp-image-206614" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-6.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-6.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-6.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-6.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-6.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/horizontal-lines-photography-6.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you can use horizontal lines effectively, you can significantly enhance the impact and appeal of your images! Just remember the tips I&#39;ve shared – such as applying the rule of thirds, using lines to divide the frame, and switching orientations to create different moods – and get some hands-on experience using them in the field.</p><p> That said, photography is an art form where rules are meant to guide, not restrict. So while keeping these tips in mind, don&#39;t forget to experiment. Play with the placement of horizontal lines, and always be conscious of how these lines affect the balance and mood of your image.</p><p> With practice and experimentation, you&#39;ll find that using horizontal lines effectively becomes second nature, allowing you to create more dynamic, engaging, and visually appealing photographs!</p><p> Now over to you:</p><p> <em>What do you think of horizontal lines?

Using non-destructive methods, you will always be able to backtrack on adjustments made to an image, retaining flexibility and keeping the resolution of the original image intact.</p><p> In fact, you may have already encountered non-destructive editing while following online Photoshop tutorials that instruct you to use a particular adjustment layer to make modifications rather than applying adjustments directly.</p><p> Note that non-destructive editing is not one single technique. You can perform it in numerous ways in Photoshop depending on the desired outcome of an image.
