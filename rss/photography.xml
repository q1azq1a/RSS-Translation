aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noopenernoreferrer noopener nofollow" class="ek-link">PhotoPills</a>这样的应用程序，它会为您提供适合您所在位置和一年中时间的特定蓝色时间。 （PhotoPills 还指示黄金时段的开始和结束时间，这对于大多数形式的摄影也非常有用！）</p><p>至少，您应该在拍摄前一天晚上研究日出和日落时间，然后尽早到达拍摄地点并提前做好准备。如果可能的话，找到一两个不错的作品。一旦魔法开始，就开枪吧！</p><p>请注意，如果您想在日出前拍摄蓝色时刻的照片，通常最好在前一天勘察地点。尝试在黑暗中找到构图可能很困难，因此如果您可以提前完成此操作，您将大大提高拍摄精彩照片的机会。相反，如果您的目标是在日落后拍摄蓝色时刻的照片，请确保您确切知道如何回到车上，并且不要忘记带手电筒；您不想在路上被困 8 个多小时的黑暗！ </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-best-blue-hour-photography-settings">最佳蓝色时刻摄影设置</h2><p>在蓝色时段，天空变得相对较暗，因此您需要较长的快门速度或较高的<a

href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">手动模式</a>允许您选择 ISO、快门速度<em>和</em>光圈。这两种模式都可以工作，尽管光圈优先通常是初学者的更好选择，而手动模式更适合专业工作流程。</p><p>如果您选择光圈优先路线，则应设置一个能够保持整个镜头锐利的光圈（f/8 是一个很好的起点），并将 ISO 设置为 100 左右（以防止不必要的高 ISO 噪点）。然后让您的相机确定适当的快门速度以获得良好的曝光。</p><p>如果您决定需要比相机选择的快门速度<em>更长的</em>快门速度（以便在移动的云朵或移动的水中创造出美丽的条纹），您可以缩小光圈，这将导致相机延长快门速度。如果您决定想要<em>更短的</em>快门速度（以冻结运动），您可以扩大光圈或提高 ISO，但请记住，较宽的光圈会减少景深，而较高的 ISO 会在图像中引入噪点。</p><p>如果您选择手动模式，只需拨入相机的基本 ISO 和合适的光圈（就像使用光圈优先一样）。然后设置快门速度，使相机的曝光表大致平衡。如果您需要增加或降低快门速度，请确保<em>同时</em>增加或减少另一个曝光变量（即光圈或 ISO）以保持曝光表平衡。</p><p>需要记住的一件事：由于蓝色时刻看起来相对较暗，因此您的相机可能会尝试使场景过度曝光，这最终会产生不自然的结果（并可能导致高光过曝）。如果您使用光圈优先模式，则需要添加一些负<a

noopener" class="ek-link">曝光补偿</a>来抵消这种趋势，如果您使用手动模式，则需要故意曝光不足一两档。</p><p>我能给出的最好建议是在每张图像之后检查 LCD 预览和直方图，如果您发现照片看起来太亮（或太暗），请采取措施纠正问题。合理？</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter

id="a-full-frame-camera">全画幅相机</h3><p>虽然您绝对可以使用任何相机（包括智能手机）拍摄美丽的蓝色时光照片，但全画幅数码单反相机或无反光镜相机具有一个巨大的优势：它可以让您根据需要提高 ISO，而不会因为噪音而淹没图像。</p><p>正如我上面提到的，最好将 ISO 保持在尽可能低的水平，但如果您要拍摄移动物体、手持工作或进行天文摄影，则将 ISO 保持在 100 并不总是一个选择。另外，ISO 提高得越高，您的灵活性就越大，拍摄速度也就越快（等待相机完成五分钟的曝光并不总是很有趣！）。</p><p>这时候全画幅相机就会派上用场。最新的无反光镜型号（例如<a aria-label="Sony a7 IV (opens in a new tab)" href="https://geni.us/Sonya7IV" target="_blank"

id="a-fast-lens">快速镜头</h3><p>大多数蓝色小时风景和城市景观摄影都是在窄光圈下完成的，因此不需要最大光圈为 f/1.8 的镜头 - 但如果您想进行蓝色小时街头摄影、人像或天文摄影，则需要最大光圈较宽的镜头光圈会产生巨大的差异。您将能够使用手持式快门速度，而无需将 ISO 提高到 12800，并且您还能够冻结移动的主体。</p><p>如果您刚刚开始使用，我建议您使用最大光圈至少为 f/2.8 的定焦镜头，最大光圈为 f/1.8 更好。您可以以便宜的价格购买其中一款型号（例如 50mm f/1.8），因此您无需担心破产。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="a-tripod">三脚架</h3><p>根据我的经验，蓝色小时的平均快门速度在一到六秒之间。如果您设置如此长的快门速度，然后尝试手持拍摄，您最终会得到令人沮丧的模糊照片。</p><p>当然，您始终可以提高相机的 ISO 来补偿较短的快门速度，但噪点通常令人难以忍受。虽然您可以将镜头光圈扩大到 f/2.8 及以上，但您会失去风景、建筑和城市景观拍摄者所珍视的深景深效果。</p><p>因此，为了获得最佳效果，您确实必须使用<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-tripods-for-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="good tripod (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">好的三脚架</a>。</p><p>当您拍摄 1 秒、6 秒甚至 30 秒曝光时，三脚架可将相机固定到位。确保你投资的是一个坚固的模型；虽然有很多便宜的选择，但大多数都很难处理你的设置，尤其是在风中。</p><p>如果您是那种长途行走或经常旅行的摄影师，我会推荐碳纤维三脚架，它兼具坚固性和便携性。否则，铝制模型就很好（它们往往更便宜，但也重得多）。然而，无论你做什么，<em>都不要购买塑料</em>。实在是太脆弱了。</p><h3

在图像中加入电灯</h3><p>不要误会我的意思：您可以在自然光照射下的未改变的风景中拍摄<em>令人惊叹的</em>蓝色小时照片。</p><p>但根据我的经验，电灯有两个好处：</p><ol><li>它们减少了曝光时间。随着蓝色时间的流逝，天空会迅速变暗 - 您可能会发现快门速度增加到 10 秒、20 秒甚至更长。然而，一两个电灯将为场景增加额外的照明，从而缩短曝光时间并为一些额外的拍摄创造时间。</li><li>它们为您的照片增添戏剧性和趣味性。如果您使用窄光圈（即 f/8），电灯将显示为美丽的星芒，这可以创建焦点或简单地补充您的主要拍摄对象。</li></ol><p>例如，看看下面的图片，它依靠星形灯光来吸引观看者：</p><p>然而，电灯确实面临一些挑战。如果您站得离光源太近，整个画面上可能会出现镜头眩光。如果您不小心，电灯可能会在曝光良好的场景中产生主要的曝光过度斑点。</p><p>因此，不要离灯光太近 - 灯光越小，眩光和过度曝光区域的问题就越少 -

9.寻找倒影</h3><p>蓝色时刻的天空看起来令人惊叹，虽然直接拍摄天空照片可能令人惊叹，但结合天空<em>反射</em>可以为您的图像增添一层额外的深度和创造力。</p><p>幸运的是，如果您花时间寻找倒影，几乎可以在任何地方找到它们。对于风景摄影师来说，湖泊和池塘等水体提供了镜面般的表面，可以反射天空的美丽（尤其是在清晨，空气静止，水面平静！）。</p><p>城市摄影师也有很多机会捕捉倒影。摩天大楼的玻璃窗、汽车抛光的表面，甚至现代建筑光滑的金属外墙，都可以展现出天空变幻的色彩！</p><p>还有一个快速提示：通过放置相机来捕捉天空及其反射，您可以创建既接地又空灵的图像

ND过滤器具有不同的优势，有些受欢迎的过滤器是三站，6平台和10站。数字越大，滤波器越暗（即，让通过的光线就越少），您可以延长快门速度的越多。</p><p>让我们仔细研究一下您的不同选择：</p><h4 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section

With modern digital cameras, you can photograph at high ISOs and come away with decent images, and while it&#39;s always best to keep the ISO as low as possible, you just won&#39;t manage to get well-exposed shots at night otherwise. (I personally shoot at ISO 3200, and I sometimes go to ISO 6400 in especially dark areas or when I&#39;m photographing fast-moving subjects.) Plus, grainy shots at night can look surprisingly good; the grit adds to the aesthetic, especially if you convert to black and white.</p><p> What camera mode should you use? If you&#39;re doing fast-paced shooting in a variety of different lighting scenarios (ie, moving in and out of the street lights), Aperture Priority can work well – just set your camera to your widest aperture and highest tolerable ISO, then let it choose the shutter speed for you. (If the shutter speed drops below 1/60s, then you&#39;ll either need to accept some blurriness, boost that ISO further, or shoot in an area with more light.)</p><p> And as for your method of focusing: Normally, zone focusing is a great method for street photography, but when using an ultra-wide aperture at night, you&#39;ll end up missing a lot of images. You can try using manual focus to prefocus in a certain area if you can anticipate a shot in advance, but working with continuous AF and one of your camera&#39;s tracking modes might be the better option, depending on your camera&#39;s capability. (If you&#39;re not sure what will work best, try to do some experimentation!) </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="essential-gear-for-nighttime-street-photography"> Essential gear for nighttime street photography</h2><p> The best nighttime street photography gear is broadly similar to daytime street photography gear in that you want your equipment to be lightweight, compact, and inconspicuous. That said, there are a few things to keep in mind when purchasing new equipment for those nighttime adventures: </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="pick-a-camera-with-good-high-iso-capabilities"> Pick a camera with good high-ISO capabilities</h3><p> Since you&#39;ll often be shooting at ISO 3200, ISO 6400, and even beyond, it&#39;s essential that you use a street photography camera that won&#39;t ruin your shots with an explosion of noise. Consider investing in a compact full-frame camera or a top-notch APS-C model, and try to keep the megapixel count on the lower side, as ultra-high MP cameras tend to actually perform worse when shooting at high ISOs compared to the lower MP siblings (assuming the technology is from the same generation).</p><p> Low-light focusing capabilities are also very handy – many cameras struggle to acquire focus in the dark, while others are high performers in this area. If your camera can&#39;t focus in near darkness, that&#39;s not an absolute dealbreaker – you can focus manually or shoot in the streetlights – but it&#39;ll certainly limit your flexibility. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="pick-a-lens-with-a-wide-maximum-aperture"> Pick a lens with a wide maximum aperture</h3><p> As I mentioned above, you&#39;ll want to make sure you pick a compact lens for shooting the streets at night. But while most daytime street photography is shot at an aperture of around f/8, nighttime is a whole different ball game. You&#39;ll need to widen your lens&#39;s aperture to its maximum, which means that the wider the maximum aperture that&#39;s offered by the lens, the better.</p><p> Therefore, I&#39;d recommend grabbing a lens with a maximum aperture of at least f/2.8 (and f/1.8 or f/1.4 can be even better, assuming the models are still relatively compact).</p><p> It can also help to grab a slightly wider prime than you might be inclined to use otherwise, such as a 35mm, 28mm, or – if you&#39;re interested in a more unique look – 24mm. Wider lenses are less prone to camera shake, and they&#39;re also easier to use at night since the darkness and lack of activity results in fewer distractions throughout a broader scene.</p><p> Of course, you can still use a standard 50mm lens for nighttime street photography – a 50mm f/1.8, for instance, is great in nearly every street-photography scenario – but if you have the opportunity to go wide, I&#39;d recommend at least testing it out! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="tips-for-night-street-photography"> 10 tips for night street photography</h2><p> Now that you understand the best settings and equipment for photographing the streets at night, let&#39;s take a look at a few tips – for both beginners and advanced street shooters – to enhance your results.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="seek-out-light-sources"> 1. Seek out light sources</h3><p> Always pay attention to the main light sources in a scene. This is true no matter where or when you are photographing, but it becomes even more important at night. So instead of hunting for subjects, start by finding a beautiful light source or an area with good lighting, then wait around for something to happen.</p><p> Note that night street photography lighting can be anything: car headlights, streetlights, neon signs, window lighting, or even smartphone light. Simply look for noticeable illumination, then pay careful attention to how these light sources hit potential subjects.

Take plenty of shots</h3><p> Sometimes, street photographers like to use a more deliberate approach, capturing only a couple of images of each subject. This works fine during the day, especially if you can confidently nail the focus and exposure – but at night, it&#39;s a recipe for a lot of failed images.</p><p> So instead of just taking one or two images of each subject or scene, when you&#39;re out at night, push things a bit. Don&#39;t be afraid to capture 5-10 shots of the same subject, and if you&#39;re willing to sort through all the shots later, you might even consider using your camera&#39;s burst mode to fire off dozens of shots in a few seconds.</p><p> The idea here is to simply maximize your chances of success. The more you shoot, the more likely you are to hit on that moment when your subject is moving slowly enough to stay sharp, even at 1/60s – and the more likely are you to nail the focus even with a razor-thin depth of场地。</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="photograph-nightlife"> 3. Photograph nightlife</h3><p> Certain parts of the city – such as the business district – can empty out at night; they&#39;ll make for a poor night street photography experience. Other areas, however, will get busier after sunset, and they&#39;ll offer plenty of opportunities.</p><p> So seek out the nightlife and shoot it! You might consider doing some internet searches for bars and clubs in your area, then make sure you head on over as the night begins. Alternatively, if you&#39;re after more formal-looking subjects, go for a walk near some upscale restaurants and see what you can find!</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-62984" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="photographing the nightlife" class="wp-image-62984" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/4-champagne_celebration_night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> 1/125s | f/2 | ISO 6400</figcaption></figure></div><p> And don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re restricted to photographing people on the street outside clubs and restaurants.

Alternate between getting close and stepping back</h3><p> I&#39;m a big proponent of Robert Capa&#39;s advice that “if your photos aren&#39;t good enough, you&#39;re not close enough.” However, I often violate this rule at night.</p><p> You see, while I do try to get close to many of my subjects – and I encourage you to do the same – I also try to create compositions where the subjects are small aspects of the overall scene. At night, backgrounds can be much more beautiful than during the day, so it often pays to have people become the secondary element in the scene, rather than the primary focus.</p><p> This approach comes with a technical advantage: When your subjects are off in the distance, you won&#39;t need to use a fast shutter speed to capture their motion. A nearby subject can be frozen at 1/125s or faster; a distant subject can often be photographed at 1/60s and turn out sharp, even if it&#39;s on the move. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="experiment-with-a-tripod-for-creative-effects"> 5.

Try working with a flash</h3><p> Some street photographers love using a flash, while others hate it. Whether you decide to try flash at night is up to you; on the one hand, it&#39;ll provide extra illumination so you can use a faster shutter speed, a narrower aperture, and a lower ISO. On the other hand, it&#39;ll give a very intense deer-in-the-headlights look, plus it can lead to confrontation (people don&#39;t like being flashed, especially in the dark!).</p><p> Personally, I prefer to work with the constraints of natural light, and I also get uncomfortable flashing strangers in dark settings. But if you feel confident enough to shoot with flash, then by all means, try it and see what you think. It can give a fantastic look when done well.</p><p> Note that you can have the flash do all the work lighting the scene (so that the foreground area turns out lit and the background is completely dark). But you can also set your camera to slightly underexpose the scene, then use the flash to add some fill light to your main subjects in the foreground. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="be-careful-when-boosting-the-exposure"> 7.

And when this happens, you&#39;ll have no choice but to raise the exposure when editing. <em>Just make sure you do it carefully</em> .</p><p> Here&#39;s my recommendation: First, ignore the noise and get the exposure and look correct. If you have to raise the exposure a significant amount, the noise will be terrible, so you&#39;ll need to apply some <a aria-label="noise reduction (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-do-noise-reduction-in-lightroom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">noise reduction</a> .</p><p> There are many excellent noise reduction programs, but I like Lightroom&#39;s built-in noise reduction. If the noise is still bad after applying the noise reduction algorithm, try bringing the image into Photoshop to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tips-blur-filters-photoshop/" target="_blank" aria-label="add a very slight Gaussian blur (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">add a very slight Gaussian blur</a> .</p><p> At that point, I often use Lightroom&#39;s grain settings to add texture back into the photo. The result looks much more pleasing to the eye than extreme digital noise, and it can hide some of the technical deficiencies of underexposed images. The photo will not look perfectly sharp, but it can still be beautiful. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-be-afraid-of-blur-and-imperfection"> 8. Don&#39;t be afraid of blur and imperfection</h3><p> Most street photographers aim to get their photos as sharp as possible. Sharpness certainly isn&#39;t a bad thing – but know that a photo can still look fantastic even if it isn&#39;t incredibly crisp.</p><p> You see, when photographing at night, you don&#39;t need to freeze motion perfectly to get a stunning result. Personally, I hold my day images to a higher standard than my night images. My day images need to look sharp, while my night photos simply need to be interesting and look good, even if they&#39;re a little blurry in places.</p><p> Also, at shutter speeds from around 1/60s to 1/30s, it can be fun to shoot handheld. Your subjects will turn out somewhat sharp, yet there will be a little motion, too. It&#39;s a great way to add a sense of energy to your compositions. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="let-your-night-street-photos-look-dark"> 9.

They should be dark, with deep shadows and areas that are hard to see. When you <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-read-and-use-histograms/" target="_blank" aria-label="look at the histogram (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">look at the histogram</a> of a night image, it should be skewed toward the far left, especially relative to your day images.</p><p> But when you point your camera toward a street scene at night, it&#39;ll often overexpose the photo. The resulting file will look bright and you&#39;ll be able to see plenty of detail, but the scene just won&#39;t feel real. (You&#39;ll also end up with blown-out streetlights and store windows.) In such cases, you&#39;ll want to lower the <a aria-label="exposure compensation (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-exposure-compensation-to-take-control-of-your-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure compensation</a> on your camera slightly or – if you&#39;re shooting in <a aria-label="Manual mode (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Manual mode</a> – boost the shutter speed, narrow the aperture, or widen the ISO.</p><p> I do think that bright night images <em>can</em> look good. But dark, realistic night images are generally better, so carefully monitor the histogram and don&#39;t be afraid to drop that exposure compensation as needed.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shoot-in-bad-weather"> 10. Shoot in bad weather</h3><p> Venturing out into the night when the weather turns sour can be daunting. (I know this from personal experience!) Yet it&#39;s precisely those conditions – snow, rain, fog, and sleet – that can transform an ordinary street scene into a photo brimming with atmosphere and emotion. Think snowflakes swirling under the glow of street lamps, or a foggy evening with dark figures moving in and out of buildings. These elements introduce a layer of complexity and mood that&#39;s hard to replicate under clear skies.</p><p> That said, embracing bad weather does mean facing some challenges. Temperatures generally drop at night, and precipitation amplifies the risk of hypothermia; therefore, even street photography in the summer can be uncomfortable or even dangerous when the rain starts to pour. Plus, keeping your camera dry can be a hassle, and in worst-case scenarios, you may even damage your equipment.</p><p> Fortunately, with the proper preparation, you can (generally) prevent these problems. Dress warmly – think coats, hats, gloves – and use lots of layers to keep yourself comfortable. For your camera, a simple rain cover can be a lifesaver. I also recommend bringing a rocket blower (so you can rid your front lens element of water droplets) and a small towel (so you can wipe off your camera and lens barrel regularly). And whatever you do, don&#39;t forget that lens hood; otherwise, the precipitation will quickly cover your lens and ruin your images.</p><p> One more thing: Shooting in bad weather at night is hard, and accepting that not every shot will be a masterpiece is part of the process. Night and adverse weather conditions can be unpredictable, but they also open the door to unique photographic opportunities. If you&#39;re willing to take a lot of pictures, chances are you&#39;ll snag at least a couple of keepers. It&#39;s all about patience, perseverance, and a bit of an adventurous spirit!</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="be-careful"> 11. Be careful</h3><p> This tip is absolutely necessary, but it&#39;s also very difficult to write about. You see, depending on where you&#39;re shooting, heading out at night with a camera is not always the safest idea. On the other hand, many areas are safer than you might think at night, especially in the earlier evening.</p><p> Therefore, don&#39;t be so afraid to shoot at night that you never head out, but also make sure that you stay safe. Travel light, keep your equipment to a minimum, and be careful about where you go. Make sure you pay attention to your surroundings, and if you start to feel uncomfortable, head in the other direction.</p><p> If you&#39;re not sure whether you can safely photograph on the streets at night, do some research. I&#39;d recommend messaging veteran street shooters in the area, though you can also look at general articles and statistics covering city crime rates.</p><p> Use your best judgment regarding who to photograph, and think about bringing a friend along. Don&#39;t stay in one place for too long, and avoid putting down your gear to change lenses. Finally, if you desire greater peace of mind, insure your gear before you head out! </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="focus-on-your-editing-skills"> 12. Focus on your editing skills</h3><p> The challenging lighting conditions of night street photography often mean that your images will require a touch of post-processing to really shine – and that&#39;s where your editing skills come into play. I highly recommend purchasing (or subscribing to) a dedicated photo-editing program; it&#39;ll give you the tools you need to create pro-level images, and while the learning curve can be a bit significant at first, it won&#39;t take you long to master the essential techniques.</p><p> When you&#39;re just starting out, pay special attention to the white balance and the exposure. Tweak these elements until you get a natural, nice-looking result. Initially, you might find yourself sliding controls back and forth, experimenting until something clicks. That&#39;s totally okay; in my experience, this trial-and-error phase is how you develop an eye for what works.</p><p> As you grow more comfortable with the tools at your disposal, you&#39;ll begin to appreciate the power of subtle adjustments. You might even start to develop certain editing preferences, which you can bake into your own presets. (As an aside, creating presets can streamline the editing process, plus they can make it easier to achieve consistent results across your portfolio!)</p><p>但旅程并没有就此结束。 Once you&#39;ve mastered the basics, it&#39;s time to play with more advanced techniques like color grading. This can add a stylistic flair to your images and really set your work apart. With practice, you&#39;ll find that editing becomes a natural extension of your photography, and you can use it to express your unique perspective on the nighttime cityscape! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="the-benefits-and-drawbacks-of-photographing-the-streets-at-night"> The benefits and drawbacks of photographing the streets at night</h2><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-62977" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="street night photography diner" class="wp-image-62977" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1-Chinatown-night_nyc_street_photography_at_night.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> 1/80s | f/2.8 | ISO 1600</figcaption></figure></div><p> Nighttime street photography comes with several major benefits – in other words, there&#39;s a reason for its popularity!</p><p> For one, the streets tend to be emptier at night, allowing you to isolate a subject or two without difficulty – this can make for more powerful minimalistic shots.</p><p> Photographing at nighttime with streetlights also adds a different mood to images, giving a sense of mystery, nostalgia, drama, and even horror, depending on how you approach your shots.</p><p> And budding street photographers – and even more accomplished shooters – sometimes struggle with fear or discomfort when photographing strangers. Working at night, however, lends a sense of distance and anonymity that makes for less anxiety.</p><p> Of course, night street photography comes with several significant challenges. Cameras rely on light to capture sharp, well-exposed images, and nighttime – as you are undoubtedly aware! – doesn&#39;t offer much light. To address this, it&#39;s important to have a real technical mastery of the camera; otherwise, you&#39;ll end up with images that are blurry, grainy, or dark (or a combination of the three).</p><p> And as I emphasized above, photographing at night in certain areas can be genuinely dangerous.

Nighttime street photography can be relatively safe, but there&#39;s always a risk, so it pays to be cautious and take proper precautions.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1690730178545"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">Is it worth photographing on the streets at night?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer">我想是这样！ The streets can look pretty magical at night and allow for a whole new type of image.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1690730200656"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">What is the best ISO for night street photos?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> I&#39;d recommend pushing your ISO as high as it can go without causing a ridiculous level of noise. You need a high ISO to achieve a reasonably fast shutter speed, plus noise doesn&#39;t look that bad in nighttime shots.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1690730213925"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">What camera should I use for night street photos?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> Compact, lightweight cameras with larger sensors tend to work well for street shots at night.</p></div><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1690730226185"> <strong class="schema-faq-question">What&#39;s the best focal length for night street photography?</strong><p class="schema-faq-answer"> The 50mm focal length is a street photography classic, but because the streets tend to be emptier at night, it&#39;s often easy to shoot at 35mm or wider to achieve more unusual shots. </p></div></div><div class="topics-list"><div class="wrapper"><div class="list-header"><h4 class="title-small">目录</h4><h3 class="title-pillar"><a

But shooting interiors isn&#39;t exactly a walk in the park. It comes with plenty of challenges, including cramped spaces, low light, and difficult camera techniques.</p><p> Fortunately, I&#39;ve spent years honing my interior architectural shooting skills, and in this article, I share my top tips to ensure success. I discuss:</p><ul><li> The best focal lengths for interior architecture</li><li> The equipment item that you absolutely must own</li><li> Easy ways to improve your compositions</li><li> Simple editing steps for refined results</li><li>多得多！</li></ul><p> So if you&#39;re ready to level up your interior shots, then let&#39;s dive right in. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="if-possible-prepare-the-space"> 1. If possible, prepare the space</h2><p> If you&#39;re photographing the interior of a house or a business, I highly recommend you set the stage by taking the time to de-clutter and open up the space. Clear all flat surfaces and floor areas. Open all blinds and curtains. Clean any dirty dishes in the sink and put them away. Be sure to clean the space much more so than you would for yourself. We get used to clutter and become blind to it, but a bit of clutter in a photo will be instantly obvious.</p><p> Once you&#39;re done, the space should feel inviting, like the kind of place you can imagine yourself living or working. But if you&#39;ve finished cleaning and you&#39;re still not impressed, you can create those feelings in your photos by adding personal touches. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Interiors2.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interiors2" title="Interiors2.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by Natalia Robert</figcaption></figure></div><p> If there&#39;s a dinner table, set it for two and place a vase of fresh flowers in the center. Transform an empty breakfast nook into a great spot to lounge by adding a newspaper, coffee cup, and a plate or bowl of light (and pretty) snacks. Hang a fluffy bathrobe on a hook next to the bathtub.</p><p> If there&#39;s a desk, consider adding a work laptop and a book (or three). When it comes to decorations or color palettes, you want to either fill the space with personality to play up its uniqueness <em>or</em> keep everything neutral with pops of bright color.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="always-use-a-tripod"> 2. Always use a tripod </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-01.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Whenever you shoot architectural interiors, you absolutely <em>must</em> use a tripod. This is for a few main reasons:</p><p> First, a tripod will stabilize your camera/lens setup, which dramatically reduces the possibility of camera shake. Since interior shots tend to be taken at narrow <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" aria-label="apertures (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">apertures</a> and slow <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speeds (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speeds</a> , keeping your camera on rock-solid support is essential.</p><p> Second, if you use a tripod, it&#39;s much easier to make sure your camera is level. (While I discuss the importance of a level camera later on in this article, it&#39;s a fundamental part of pretty much all <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/creative-architecture-photography-techniques/" target="_blank" aria-label="architectural photography (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">architectural photography</a> .) </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-02.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Additionally, there&#39;s no good reason <em>not</em> to use a tripod when photographing interiors. Sure, if you were tracking subjects or needing to constantly change your position on the fly, a tripod would be a hindrance. But architectural photography is slow and deliberate; since your subject matter is buildings, you can always count on it to sit nice and still while you set up your camera, dial in various settings, and fine-tune your composition.</p><p> Note that interior photoshoots tend to involve very little wind, rushing water, or rain, so you can often get away with using a cheaper tripod (though there are also reasons to invest in a good sturdy model, including gear safety, so make sure you choose your model very carefully!). </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="start-with-natural-light"> 3. Start with natural light</h2><p> One of the advantages of architectural photography, especially interior architectural photography, is that nothing moves. You can leverage this by playing with your settings, especially the shutter speed.</p><p> With the camera rested on a tripod, you can dial in very slow shutter speeds to capture all the ambient light, even in very dark corners. If some lamps and lights add to the overall ambiance of the room, include them and take advantage of slow shutter speeds and long exposures.</p><p> It is important to remember that for interiors, you should aim for balanced lighting; in other words, there should be no overly dark shadows or overly bright highlights. You want to see the detail in dark areas but not blow out the light areas altogether. And think about which times of the day best feature the interior space. Early morning and late afternoon light are very soft, though overcast days also produce soft light.</p><p> On the other hand, bright super sunny days produce harsher light, especially around midday. Therefore you may want to take into consideration shadows produced in the interior from harsh outside light. If you&#39;re creating fine-art images, you can use these shadows as artistic elements, but if you&#39;re doing commercial photography, this may not be appropriate. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="whenever-possible-use-a-flash"> 4. Whenever possible, use a flash</h2><p> In the previous tip, I emphasized the value of natural light. But while you should aim to get as much natural lighting is possible, if you shoot a room without a flash, you&#39;ll typically get shadows scattered around the room (caused by artificial lighting positioned along walls and at various places across the ceiling). This often doesn&#39;t look great and can be difficult to handle from an exposure perspective, so I encourage you to use a bit of flash. You only need one or two speedlights or strobes, and they&#39;ll help balance the exposure across the entire frame.</p><p> Here&#39;s what I recommend:</p><p> Make sure your flashes are mounted on separate tripods or stands (they shouldn&#39;t be on your camera!), and place them a few feet off to the side and a foot or so behind your camera. (If you&#39;re using two flashes, make sure they&#39;re on opposite sides.) Aim the flashes so they point toward the ceiling and slightly away from the room you&#39;re shooting.</p><p> Set the flashes manually at half power (a stop below full power) and fire away. Given the angle, the light from the flashes will illuminate the room indirectly (ie, bouncing off the ceilings and walls), and you&#39;ll get a soft, even fill light for the room you&#39;re shooting. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-03.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This was a tricky shot because my flash was reflecting off the windows no matter where I positioned it. In the end, I took two shots (one with flash and one without), then masked them together in Photoshop. The windows you see in this image are from the file without a flash, but the rest of the room is from the file <em>with</em> the flash.</figcaption></figure></div><p> I always encourage you to review the resulting image on your camera&#39;s LCD and make changes accordingly. Watch for strange shadows, too-bright walls, dark corners, and reflections from the flash in windows and other glass objects. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="when-shooting-whole-rooms-dont-go-too-wide"> 5. When shooting whole rooms, don&#39;t go too wide</h2><p> When I first started taking architectural interior shots, I used the widest-angle lens I could get my hands on. I thought that with an <a aria-label="ultra-wide lens (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-reasons-love-ultra-wide-lenses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ultra-wide lens</a> , I could get more of the room in the frame – but while I was technically correct, <em>more isn&#39;t always better</em> . I soon noticed a high level of <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/lens-distortion-in-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label="distortion (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">distortion</a> toward the edges of the frame, especially in smaller rooms, and I determined that ultra-wide focal lengths (ie, 14mm) make the sides of the frame look oddly stretched and off the horizontal plane, even when corrected in post-production. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-04.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> So I experimented with different focal lengths and found that an effective focal length between 21mm and 28mm gives you a very nice balance; at 25mm, you get limited distortion <em>and</em> a wide-enough frame to capture the character and presence of the scene.</p><p> One option is to grab a 24mm prime, which can be very cost-effective when you&#39;re just starting out (most manufacturers offer a high-quality 24mm lens for cheap). Alternatively, you might invest in a 24-70mm zoom – yes, it will cost a lot more, but it&#39;ll offer extra flexibility and even allow you to capture some nice detail shots in the 50-70mm range. If you do prefer a wider perspective, you could look into a 16-35mm zoom instead.</p><p> By the way, if you&#39;re in a situation where 21mm won&#39;t capture enough of the scene, a panorama is always an option. Speaking of which: </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="try-panoramas-for-ultra-wide-shots"> 6. Try panoramas for ultra-wide shots</h2><p> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/21-tips-create-better-panoramas/" target="_blank" aria-label="Panoramas (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Panoramas</a> are a great way to capture an entire room, especially if you&#39;re using a longer lens or you&#39;re dealing with a cramped interior. But how can you create one?</p><p> Start by setting up your camera vertically on the tripod. Many photographers think it&#39;s best to do panoramas horizontally, but the vertical orientation will give you a taller image.</p><p> Then do your best to pivot your camera while taking a series of images. Determine your start and end point in advance, and make sure that you have plenty of overlap between compositions. Using a tripod is essential, and it&#39;s important that you rotate your camera on a perfectly level horizontal plane – with the pivot point being roughly where the lens meets the camera). Note that, if the pivot point is too far forward (ie, somewhere on the lens) or too far backward (ie, on the body of the camera), the panorama will appear distorted.</p><p> For the picture below, the pivot point was on the body of the camera, which is behind the ideal spot. As a result, the shot has a weird sort of convex distortion: </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-05.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This is a seven-image panorama. See how artificially “rounded” the walls are? This will happen if your camera and lens are not properly situated on the tripod. </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="whenever-possible-try-to-shoot-only-one-or-two-walls"> 7. Whenever possible, try to shoot only one or two walls</h2><p> Beginner interior architectural photographers sometimes try to squeeze too much into the frame by including three or even four walls – but when you use this approach, the shot will often appear rather awkward-looking (if you aren&#39;t extremely careful with the composition, that是）。</p><p> Instead, go for a one- or two-wall shot, which will give the viewer the most geometrically pleasant image to view: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-06.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> The shot displayed above is a generic two-wall scene with the walls meeting at a standard 90-degree angle. Looks nice, right? Well, I also took a second shot, where I backed up several feet to deliberately include the third wall on the left edge of the frame: </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-07.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The third wall on the left side of this shot creates an unnatural and visually displeasing scene.</figcaption></figure></div><p> I don&#39;t know about you, but to me, the third wall makes the photo look compositionally awkward and disorienting. I much prefer the two-wall version, and I recommend you pay careful attention to the number of walls you incorporate into your photos.</p><p> That said, including three walls in a shot is sometimes okay, provided that everything is geometrically aligned: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-08.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="strike-a-balance"> 8. Strike a balance</h2><p> When composing your shot, focus the viewer&#39;s attention on where you want it to go. If you can, consider using staged items to add depth and interest in the foreground. Avoid flat-looking photos by contrasting different elements in the foreground, midground, and background. Remember to aim for balance, not distraction.</p><p> Using the background to show a connecting room is also a great way to give the viewer a sense of space.

Make sure your camera is perfectly level</h2><p> When shooting any form of architecture, and especially interiors, this is a <em>big</em> deal:</p><p> You should work as hard as possible to ensure your camera isn&#39;t tilted up, down, left, or right when shooting. Even the slightest tilt will require post-production cleanup, and you&#39;ll lose pixels in the process.</p><p> Here&#39;s an example of what I&#39;m talking about: </p><figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-09.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure><p> See how slanted the windows are? They lean outward, which is a sign of perspective distortion. Clearly, this is not an accurate depiction of the room; instead, it&#39;s the result of the camera being tilted ever-so-slightly downward.</p><p> But once we get the camera nice and level, here&#39;s the result: </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-10.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> As you can see, keeping your camera level makes a <em>huge</em> difference. Happily, there are a couple of ways to help you get your camera perfectly straight when you compose your photos. Most cameras have a built-in level (with the built-in level activated, when you look into the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/optical-versus-electronic-viewfinders-best/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">viewfinder</a> , you&#39;ll see lines across the focusing screen that tilt when the camera tilts). If you&#39;re not sure whether your camera has this option, take a peek at the manual or do a bit of Googling.</p><p> You can also use a bubble level that slides onto the camera&#39;s hot shoe. (When the little bubble is centered, it means your camera is level.) You can buy one of these levels at just about any photography store for just a few bucks, and it&#39;s my preferred solution because it tends to be more accurate than built-in camera levels). </p><figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/interior-architecture-tips-11.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interior architectural photography tips" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="get-the-white-balance-right">10. Get the white balance right</h2><p> This is tricky and the nemesis of many photographers. Most non-photographers are oblivious to white balance. (This is especially obvious in wedding photos where the bride&#39;s dress looks blue and people&#39;s faces register as magenta, yet hardly anyone notices!)</p><p> When I sold my house a few years back, the real estate agents who boasted of great property photography sent a photographer to my house to take some professional pictures. She arrived with a camera on the tripod and a flash head pointed slightly upward. The lens used was very wide – I&#39;d guess around 10mm or 14mm. When the photos were uploaded, I was dismayed to find that the images were all very blue. My home felt so cold, and one of the reasons for that was the incorrect white balance.</p><p> Personally, I prefer to add a warm feel to all my photos, so I tend to add that during editing. You can go for a neutral look – and it can help to use a gray card when on site – or you can emphasize warmth, but if you try the latter approach, do be careful that the whites still look white and not yellow or cream.</p><p> Bottom line: Always remember that what often draws people to an image is a feeling or emotion. Your image becomes all the more powerful if it reminds the viewer of a sentiment, experience, or something that resonates with them. <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/setting-the-mood-by-adjusting-your-white-balance/">White balance is key</a> in helping achieve this kind of engagement with your viewer. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="carefully-edit-your-interior-images"> 11. Carefully edit your interior images</h2><p> Without editing your architectural photos, the results will be lackluster. Therefore, I encourage you to edit each and every image that you plan to share!</p><p> Start by importing your photos to your favorite editing program and follow these basic editing steps to create more refined results. (Note that I reference Lightroom Classic, but you can achieve the same effects in pretty much any editor.) </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="straighten-out-the-lines"> Straighten out the lines</h3><p> Doing this will instantly polish up your photos. If you shot at a height of roughly five feet from the floor and kept the camera level, the amount of straightening you have to correct should be minimal. In Lightroom, you can find straightening options in the Lens Corrections panel. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="fill-in-and-even-out-the-light"> Fill in and even out the light</h3><p> Before making any adjustments to the brightness or exposure, be sure to correct any lens vignetting. (This is when the corners of the image are a bit darker and is especially common with wide-angle lenses.) Lightroom offers lens profiles that will automatically take into account your lens&#39;s optics and make automatic corrections; just make sure that <strong>Enable Profile Corrections</strong> is checked in the Lens Corrections panel.</p><p> And if you don&#39;t like Lightroom&#39;s automatic adjustments, you can always head into the <strong>Manual</strong> tab and use the sliders to achieve the effect you envisioned.</p><p> Once your corners are corrected, use a Brush to correct the exposure in bright or dark areas. This is your time to dodge and burn. I find that erring on the side of overexposure lends a more natural feel to the space. I recommend pushing the overall exposure up slowly, and when it feels too bright, start pulling back.</p><p> You can also lighten dark areas slightly with the <strong>Shadows</strong> slider in the Basic panel. However, be careful not to lighten the shadows so much that you bring out grain (noise) or that the image looks fake. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="perform-color-corrections"> Perform color corrections</h3><p> Adjust the overall color temperature as needed. If you like a warmer effect, as I do, aim for warmth, not obvious yellow.</p><p> Also, bump up the <strong>Vibrance</strong> slider a bit instead of messing with the <strong>Saturation</strong> slider. Added Saturation can quickly make a photo look too fake, while Vibrance is a more subtle tool that helps give the color a little extra kick. Again, play with the sliders on these settings; seeing what your eye is comfortable with will go a long way toward honing your color-correcting skills. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Interiors4.jpg?ssl=1" alt="Interiors4" title="Interiors4.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by Natalia Roberts </figcaption></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="adjust-the-clarity-and-sharpness"> Adjust the clarity and sharpness</h3><p> Boost the Clarity slider, but do it slowly. Clarity is a great way to polish up a photo without going overboard on contrast, plus it gives the photo an overall crisp look. Depending on the image, you may want to simultaneously play with decreasing the Blacks slider a bit, too.</p><p> You may also want to add a bit of sharpening (in the <strong>Details</strong> panel). Be careful not to push the <strong>Amount</strong> slider too far, however; you want an image that looks detailed, not an image that&#39;s full of unpleasant haloing. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="clean-up-the-scene-with-cloning-and-healing"> Clean up the scene with cloning and healing</h3><p> Use your editing program&#39;s healing tools to remove any dust spots or other anomalies that may have gotten onto the photo.</p><p> Lightroom offers a few options: Clone, Heal, and Content-Aware REmove. Healing is a great option when correcting small spots, as it will have a softer blend to it, but I like to use the Clone tool to remove any glares or reflections. You can also use it to remove address numbers if needed.</p><p> By the way, while I typically use Lightroom for editing photos, my personal preference for cloning is Photoshop&#39;s Stamp tool. It seems to allow for more control over the brush itself, therefore making it easier to clone in a way that looks natural. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="interior-architectural-photography-tips-final-words"> Interior architectural photography tips: final words</h2><p> Shooting interiors often comes with difficulties, and getting good at interior photography isn&#39;t always easy.</p><p> However, with the tips I shared above plus some practice, you&#39;ll be capturing stunning photos in no time at all! Just remember that you should never rush your images. One of the great things about architectural photography is that your subject will never move, so you have time to really slow down and deliberately refine each shot.</p><p> Now over to you:</p><p> <em>Which tips do you plan to use first?

Why is this necessary, when other programs, including Photoshop, don&#39;t use previews at all?</p><p> It has to do with Lightroom&#39;s unique form of image editing, which is referred to as <em>non-destructive</em> . You see, when you edit images in Lightroom – for instance, when you boost the exposure or increase the sharpening – the software doesn&#39;t change the pixels of your photos directly. Instead, Lightroom stores a record of these edits in its own database. And each time you view a photo, Lightroom accesses the database record for that file, then serves up a <em>preview</em> with all your edits.</p><p> In other words, no matter how heavily you edit a photo, Lightroom leaves the original file unchanged. It uses <em>previews</em> to display the adjustments. Then, when you export an image, you get an entirely new file with all the edits baked in. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="lightroom-previews-in-the-library-module"> Lightroom previews in the Library module</h2><p> The Lightroom Library module uses previews to display your photos so that you can view, zoom, rate, and flag them.</p><p> Note that there are several types of previews you can build in the Library, and each one offers slightly different functionality:</p><ul><li> Minimal previews</li><li> Embedded &amp; Sidecar previews</li><li> Standard previews</li><li> 1:1 previews</li></ul><p> There&#39;s also a fifth type of preview, Smart Previews, which I discuss elsewhere in the article.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-224247" style="width:441px"><span class="space" style="width:441px; padding-top:66.89%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="441" height="295" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/lightroom-previews-2.jpg?resize=441%2C295&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom preview options upon importing" class="wp-image-224247" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/lightroom-previews-2.jpg?w=441&amp;ssl=1 441w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/lightroom-previews-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/lightroom-previews-2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/lightroom-previews-2.jpg?resize=436%2C293&amp;ssl=1 436w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="minimal-previews"> Minimal previews</h3><p> Minimal previews are the smallest previews Lightroom offers.</p><p> Using Minimal previews – as opposed to the other options on the list – will save space, and Lightroom can add minimal previews <em>fast</em> (they actually come straight from the original image file). But the results won&#39;t be high quality.</p><p> So if you need to import hundreds of photos and you&#39;re in a rush, Minimal previews might make sense. Later on, as you view and edit your images, Lightroom will then spend time creating larger previews.</p><p> Unfortunately, creating larger previews eats up processing power. So while Minimal previews may allow for quicker imports in the beginning, if you want to view your photos at the highest-possible quality without lag, consider using a different preview type. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="embedded-sidecar-previews"> Embedded &amp; Sidecar previews</h3><p> Like Minimal previews, Lightroom&#39;s Embedded &amp; Sidecar previews come directly from the original image file. They&#39;re bigger than Minimal previews, but they&#39;re not <em>much</em> bigger, so they&#39;re quick and easy to add to the catalog.</p><p> But Embedded &amp; Sidecar previews aren&#39;t sufficient for closer viewing or editing. If you tell Lightroom to use Embedded previews, and then you browse through the Library module or you try to edit images in the Develop module, you&#39;ll notice delays as Lightroom builds its own better-quality previews (see the section on standard previews,以下）。</p><p> As with Minimal previews, Embedded &amp; Sidecar previews are helpful when you&#39;re looking to quickly import your photos, but they&#39;re not ideal if you plan to spend significant time browsing, organizing, and editing your files.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="standard-previews"> Standard previews</h3><p> Standard previews are designed for everyday Lightroom use. They look good, they offer a beautiful rendering of an image, and they&#39;re not as big as 1:1 previews (featured below).</p><p> Lightroom takes longer to build Standard previews than it does to add Minimal previews or Embedded &amp; Sidecar previews. This is because Lightroom makes its Standard previews from scratch rather than pulling them from the original image file.</p><p> Note that, if you feel your Standard previews are taking up too much space, or you simply want Lightroom to build them faster, you can adjust their size in the Catalog Settings window. I&#39;d recommend picking the <strong>Auto</strong> option, which tells Lightroom to build previews that match your monitor resolution, though if you&#39;re running low on hard drive space, you can always choose a lower-resolution option as needed:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-126676" style="width:658px"><span class="space" style="width:658px; padding-top:69%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="658" height="454" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-2.jpg?resize=658%2C454&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom catalog settings" class="wp-image-126676" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-2.jpg?w=658&amp;ssl=1 658w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-2.jpg?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-2.jpg?resize=600%2C414&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Standard previews are great, especially if you&#39;re planning on simply viewing your photos in Lightroom. The only problem is that Standard previews aren&#39;t designed for zooming in for close-up views; if you start with a Standard preview, then zoom in, Lightroom is forced to build a 1:1 preview, which can cause lag.</p><p> And speaking of 1:1 previews:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="previews"> 1:1 previews</h3><p> 1:1 previews are Lightroom&#39;s highest-quality option for image viewing because they&#39;re full-sized previews that let you zoom into 100%. They also take the longest to build.</p><p> In other words, if you tell Lightroom to build 1:1 previews, it&#39;ll take a <em>long</em> time – but when browsing photos afterward, you can zoom in with zero delay.</p><p> Another drawback to 1:1 previews is that they take up a lot of hard drive space. Lightroom handles this by discarding the preview file after a set amount of time. The default is 30 days, but you can change that in the Catalog settings if need be:</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-126677" style="width:658px"><span class="space" style="width:658px; padding-top:69%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="658" height="454" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-3.jpg?resize=658%2C454&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom previews" class="wp-image-126677" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-3.jpg?w=658&amp;ssl=1 658w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-3.jpg?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-3.jpg?resize=600%2C414&amp;ssl=1 600w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> If you like to pixel peep, then it probably does make sense to generate 1:1 previews in advance. That way, you don&#39;t have to wait while Lightroom makes the files.

Lightroom renders high-quality previews that let you see the result of actions such as <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learn-how-to-use-the-sharpening-tools-in-lightroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharpening</a> , <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-avoid-and-reduce-noise-in-your-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noise reduction</a> , and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/11-steps-basic-portrait-editing-lightroom-beginners-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portrait retouching</a> .</p><p> Note that Develop module previews are cached rather than saved in a preview file; otherwise, Lightroom would need to generate a new preview each time you made an adjustment, which would rapidly eat up most of your hard drive space.</p><p> Now, creating 1:1 previews in the Library module makes no difference to the speed at which Lightroom renders previews in the Develop module. <span style="font-size: revert; color: initial;">But if a Smart Preview exists for a photo, Lightroom uses it instead of rendering a Develop module preview – in either of the following situations:</span></p><ol><li> The hard drive containing the original photo file is disconnected from the computer.</li><li> You have Lightroom CC 2015.7 or Lightroom 6.7 or later, the hard drive containing the original photo file is connected to the computer, and you have the <strong>Use Smart Previews instead of Originals for image editing</strong> preference enabled in Preferences (see below). Note that if you zoom into 1:1, Lightroom will stop using the Smart Preview and will render a full-size preview instead.</li></ol><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-126681" style="width:768px"><span class="space" style="width:768px; padding-top:84.11%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="768" height="646" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-7.jpg?resize=768%2C646&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lightroom previews" class="wp-image-126681" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-7.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-7.jpg?resize=300%2C252&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-7.jpg?resize=600%2C505&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lightroom-previews-7.jpg?resize=717%2C603&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Smart Previews are smaller than full-size previews, so Lightroom can run faster when Smart Previews are used in the Develop module. The speed increase can be quite significant. If you don&#39;t frequently zoom into your photos at 100% magnification, then the benefits of preferentially using Smart Previews are considerable. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="which-lightroom-previews-should-you-use"> Which Lightroom previews should you use?</h2><p> Lightroom previews are somewhat confusing, especially for beginners. So I&#39;ll make it easy by sharing hard-and-fast recommendations for different situations:</p><p> When you import images into Lightroom, choose either Standard or 1:1 previews. If you intend to zoom into your images while viewing them in the Library module, you definitely want to pick 1:1 previews. Otherwise, pick Standard.</p><p> If you frequently edit images while traveling, also tick the <strong>Build Smart Previews</strong> option in the Develop module. And if you rarely zoom in to 100% when editing, select the <strong>Use Smart Previews instead of Originals for image editing</strong> option in your Lightroom preferences.</p><p> Now over to you:</p><p> <em>Which previews do you plan to use?

(In other words: No matter your requirements, we&#39;ve got you covered!)</p><p> So if you&#39;re ready to find the perfect camera, then let&#39;s dive right in, starting with our top choice:</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="sony-ac-ii"> 1.

Expect outstanding low-light capabilities for interior architecture and nighttime street shots as well as amazing autofocus performance when capturing travel portraits and action scenes. Plus, if you like to do a mix of photo and video shooting while exploring distant countries, you&#39;ll love the beautiful 4K/60p video.</p><p> The in-body image stabilization ensures sharper handheld shots when working at slower shutter speeds, such as when shooting at restaurants and in churches (where tripod use is often restricted), and the camera also includes access to a tremendous line of travel photography lenses. My biggest gripe is the lower-resolution electronic viewfinder, which is on par with the old a7C as well as the Sony a7 III. But it&#39;s still highly usable, and for serious travel shooters looking for top-notch image quality in a compact body, the a7C II is a stellar pick.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="pros">优点</h3><ul><li>Ultra-compact body</li><li> Excellent 33 MP full-frame sensor</li><li> Amazing low-light performance</li><li> In-body image stabilization</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="cons">缺点</h3><ul><li>2.36M-dot electronic viewfinder</li><li> Somewhat pricey</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="nikon-z-fc"> 2.

It offers surprisingly great value, too; at the time of writing, you&#39;ll pay just $900 for the camera body (though you will need to buy a lens separately).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pros">优点</h3><ul><li>Excellent lens lineup from the affordable XC lenses to enthusiast and professional XF lenses</li><li> Stunning image quality with a range of JPEG film simulations</li><li> Many amazing features</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cons">缺点</h3><ul><li>Not as robust as Fujifilm&#39;s higher-end models</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-sony-rx100-vii"> 4.

It&#39;s waterproof up to 49 ft (15 m), and it boasts several nifty underwater modes, including a microscope mode that can focus on objects 0.39 in (1 cm) away.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pros">优点</h3><ul><li>Super tough</li><li>袖珍的</li><li>价格实惠</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cons">缺点</h3><ul><li>Only 12 megapixels</li><li> More suited to adventurers than enthusiast photographers</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-fujifilm-x100v"> 11. <span class="dPS-amended-link">Fujifilm X100V</span></h2><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><span class="responsive-image wp-image-207530" style="width:1400px"><span class="space" style="width:1400px; padding-top:61.43%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1400" height="860" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fujifilmx100v.jpg?resize=1400%2C860&#038;ssl=1" alt="Best camera travel photography" class="wp-image-207530" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fujifilmx100v.jpg?w=1400&amp;ssl=1 1400w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fujifilmx100v.jpg?resize=300%2C184&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fujifilmx100v.jpg?resize=600%2C369&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fujifilmx100v.jpg?resize=768%2C472&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fujifilmx100v.jpg?resize=717%2C440&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> The best compact camera ever?</figcaption></figure></div><p> I&#39;m a huge fan of the Fujifilm X100 series cameras (I&#39;ve owned three of the five models released over the last decade).

Other useful features include its leaf shutter (good for photographing in quieter places like <a aria-label="museums (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/7-tips-photographing-museums-galleries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">museums</a> and <a aria-label="churches (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-tips-for-photographing-the-churches-of-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">churches</a> ) as well as a built-in <a aria-label="neutral density filter (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/neutral-density-filters-landscape-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">neutral density filter</a> (perfect for beautiful <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/8-steps-to-great-long-exposure-landscapes/" target="_blank" aria-label="long-exposure landscapes (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">long-exposure landscapes</a> and <a aria-label="wide-aperture shots (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">wide-aperture shots</a> in bright light). And of course, you get a range of stunning JPEG film simulations that are ready to go as soon as you turn on the camera.</p><p> While the entire X100 series is great, note that the latest model, the X100V, does have an important improvement over its predecessors: it&#39;s weather-resistant.

I didn&#39;t know what I was doing <em>at all</em> , but everyone told me that my camera&#39;s Auto mode should be avoided at all costs. As a result, I dove right into YouTube tutorials and online articles about how to get away from the dreaded Auto mode setting on my camera. After all, no serious photographer would be caught dead using Automatic…right?</p><p> Years later, I can confidently tell you that the truth isn&#39;t so black and white. Auto mode, while often derided by online commenters and popular YouTube photographers, is not the scourge upon modern photography that some people claim. While it might not be the best way to get the precise picture you want, and while learning to shoot manually is a rewarding and hugely beneficial way to increase your skills as a photographer, there is nothing inherently wrong with using Auto.</p><p> In fact, Auto mode comes with some clear benefits. In this article, I explain what Auto mode is and explore its major advantages. I also share a handful of photo ideas that work exceptionally well when your camera is set to Auto.</p><p> By the time you&#39;re done reading, you&#39;ll hopefully understand why you shouldn&#39;t feel so bad if you set your expensive camera to that familiar green Auto setting! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="what-is-auto-mode-in-photography"> What is Auto mode in photography?</h2><p> Auto mode works exactly the way it sounds: It gives your camera complete control over its various settings, including the <a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> , the <a aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> , the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> , the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/choosing-a-focus-mode/" target="_blank" aria-label="autofocus mode (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">autofocus mode</a> , and even the flash.</p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-115115 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-115115" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/use-auto-mode-feather.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Auto mode photography" class="wp-image-115115" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/use-auto-mode-feather.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/use-auto-mode-feather.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/use-auto-mode-feather.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/use-auto-mode-feather.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/use-auto-mode-feather.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Therefore, with your camera set to Auto mode, your camera does all the heavy lifting, while you simply point and shoot.</p><p> Many advanced photographers criticize Auto mode, primarily because it prevents you from carefully selecting the settings that you need to achieve specific artistic results.

For the most part, therefore, shooting in Auto will give you a well-exposed picture that will suit your needs. The downside is that your camera might make frustrating choices when picking the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO (and if there&#39;s not enough light, you will likely see the pop-up flash rear its ugly head).</p><p> But if you don&#39;t mind the creative decisions your camera makes or you just don&#39;t feel like learning the complexities of the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/mastering-the-exposure-triangle-for-newbies/" target="_blank" aria-label="exposure triangle (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">exposure triangle</a> , then, by all means, go ahead and shoot in Auto mode.

However, even experienced photographers can get a bit overwhelmed when there is so much going on – and for casual photographers, it&#39;s even worse.</p><p> It&#39;s times like these when Auto mode can be your best friend. Don&#39;t feel embarrassed about using it; instead, openly embrace that comfortable setting! Auto will help you get the shots you want <em>without</em> feeling overwhelmed. And if your camera takes care of its settings, it frees you up to focus on what really matters: the moment itself. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="auto-will-stop-you-from-missing-critical-shots"> 3.

Instead of worrying about the ISO, trying to figure out the shutter speed to use, or wondering if you need to use the flash, you don&#39;t have to think deeply when using Auto mode; it&#39;ll take care of all these settings (and more) for you.</p><p> The trade-off, as I mentioned above, is that the results might not be exactly what you wanted. But at least you&#39;ll walk away with some nice pictures while <em>also</em> having the freedom to talk to other people, take in the scene, and be present in the moment. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="auto-can-help-you-understand-your-camera"> 4.

It&#39;s almost like getting a movie and watching the behind-the-scenes bonus features or listening to the director&#39;s commentary because it gives you a sense of the creative decisions that were made to get the final result.</p><p> One quick tip: If you want to get more serious about shooting in Manual mode or one of the semi-automatic modes on your camera, try shooting in Auto, then use the EXIF data to manually replicate the shot. Then experiment by tweaking the exposure settings; that way, you can see how adjusting these values affects the final image.</p><p>不过要小心！ The more you play around with your camera&#39;s settings, the more you&#39;ll become interested in the much larger world of photographic settings – and you&#39;ll soon understand how to creatively control your camera in ways you might have never thought possible!</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-121236" style="width:750px"><span class="space" style="width:750px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/use-auto-mode-steeple.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Auto mode photography" class="wp-image-121236" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/use-auto-mode-steeple.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/use-auto-mode-steeple.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/use-auto-mode-steeple.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/use-auto-mode-steeple.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/use-auto-mode-steeple.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> </figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="images-you-can-capture-using-auto-mode"> Images you can capture using Auto mode</h2><p> As I&#39;ve emphasized throughout this article, Auto mode can be a great way to enjoy the art of photography without getting bogged down in the technical details.

However, you have to use the right approach!</p><p> First, make sure you shoot when the light is right. You see, the harsh afternoon light is rarely the best time to photograph plants, landscapes, or wildlife. The light is intense, the shadows are harsh, and the resulting images will often look drab and poorly exposed.</p><p> Try taking nature photos during golden hour, instead! (Here, I&#39;m talking about the hour or two after sunrise and before sunset.) The warm light will look much more pleasing, and the low sun will produce a much more even effect. Even on Auto Mode, you&#39;ll likely be happy with how your photos turn out!</p><p> One more tip is to get in close to fill the frame; many nature subjects feature all sorts of intricate details that even your kit lens is likely capable of capturing! Here are just a few sample nature shots, all of which were taken with my camera set to Auto: </p><div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-173141 is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-173141" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Golden hour flower photo on auto mode" class="wp-image-173141" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> This photo was taken about an hour before sunset.

A mouthwatering food photo</h3><p> Many bloggers purchase an expensive camera and are disappointed with the results. But is it possible to take a decent food photo on Auto? In my experience, yes! You just have to use a thoughtful approach.</p><p> You see, the key to a good food photo is light. In general, you want bright but diffused lighting, and you want it to come from beside or behind the food to bring out the texture. (A window is a great light source when photographing food!)</p><p> It can be a little tricky to get perfect, but if you adjust your angle and take a handful of shots, you&#39;ll generally get a good result! If the light is relatively weak – as is often the case when photographing in a restaurant or on a kitchen counter – you may want to use a tripod to ensure that your shot turns out sharp.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-173803" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:100%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1500" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/302.jpg?resize=1500%2C1500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Auto mode image" class="wp-image-173803" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/302.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/302.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/302.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/302.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/302.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/302.jpg?resize=717%2C717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/302.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by Matt Murray </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="reasons-to-use-auto-mode-final-words"> Reasons to use Auto mode: final words</h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-258821" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/automatic-mode-camera-26.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Photography in Auto mode" class="wp-image-258821" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/automatic-mode-camera-26.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/automatic-mode-camera-26.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/automatic-mode-camera-26.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/automatic-mode-camera-26.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/automatic-mode-camera-26.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/automatic-mode-camera-26.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> There&#39;s a stigma attached to photographing in Auto mode, and some folks may think you are less of a photographer if that&#39;s all you use.

These failures often stem from common mistakes that, while easily overlooked, have a significant impact on the outcome of your photographs. Recognizing and avoiding these errors early on can drastically improve the quality of your images – and that&#39;s where this article comes in!</p><p> Below, I share the most common wildlife photography mistakes, and I also explain the changes you should make so you can ensure that you never (or, at least, rarely!) miss that perfect shot.</p><p> Ready to elevate your shooting?让我们开始吧！</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="not-doing-your-research">1. Not doing your research</h2><p> Wild animals can be hard to find, and they&#39;re not always where you want them to be. Before you can photograph them, you have to learn a few things about how to find them – otherwise, you&#39;ll come home with an empty memory card.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="know-your-animals"> Know your animals</h3><p> What type of animals live around you? Before you go out shooting, find out who they are, what they eat, when they sleep, and where they like to relax in between. If you&#39;re photographing deer, for instance, research which are found in your area and the habitat that they prefer. It&#39;s also important to know how animals might react if, and when, they feel threatened – will they fight or flee?</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-65129" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tree-frog.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="American Green Tree Frog by Anne McKinnell" class="wp-image-65129" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tree-frog.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tree-frog.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tree-frog.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by Anne McKinnell </figcaption></figure></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="know-the-season"> Know the season</h3><p> Some animals will be much more active at different times of year – particularly during autumn, as they look for food for winter, and in the spring, when some animals come out of hibernation. Pay attention to the different seasons, and consider whether your target subjects will be active when you plan to head out with your camera.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="camp-out">露营</h3><p>I don&#39;t mean overnight (unless you&#39;re into that), but it&#39;s often a very effective practice to find a popular area – probably somewhere with a source of water, food, shade or shelter – where animals like to congregate. Set your camera up on a tripod nearby, and disguise yourself among some trees or brush (some photographers go so far as to buy, or build, a blind to hide their presence).</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="be-patient">要有耐心</h3><p>Animals work on their own schedule, so don&#39;t try to fit a shooting session in between other appointments. Great photos take time, and you must allow nature to unfold at its own pace. Many animals are easily frightened, so being quiet, still, and inconspicuous will help put them at ease.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="shooting-unsafely"> 2. Shooting unsafely</h2><p> We don&#39;t call it “wildlife” for nothing – the biggest mistake you can make is accidentally getting mauled. Animals are not adjusted to polite society and can be pretty rough customers if you catch them at the wrong time or in the wrong way. They spend most of their waking lives foraging for food, and a spat over a meal can turn ugly fast. Never get in the way of lunch (unless you want to take its place!).</p><p> Don&#39;t approach a wild animal directly, and if they see you, avoid looking them in the eye, as this is usually a sign of aggression. If you need to get closer, keep low and move in a broad zig-zag pattern to avoid frightening the animal.</p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-65126" style="width:600px"><span class="space" style="width:600px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/baby-alligator.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Baby Aligator by Anne McKinnell" class="wp-image-65126" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/baby-alligator.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/baby-alligator.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/baby-alligator.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by Anne McKinnell</figcaption></figure></div><p> Be aware of when mating season (or “rutting season”) is for the type of animal you&#39;ll be photographing. Male mammals are full of testosterone at this time of year and can be aggressive, violent, and very dangerous. Avoid photographing at these times. Similarly, find out when animals are likely to be giving birth and raising their young. We all know how risky it can be to get between a mama bear and her cubs!</p><p> Whenever you&#39;re dealing with wildlife, always remember that any creature can be dangerous when provoked, and it&#39;s very important to treat animals and their habitat with the utmost care and respect. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="using-insufficiently-powerful-gear"> 3. Using insufficiently powerful gear</h2><p> The gear you use in wildlife photography can make or break your ability to capture those fleeting moments in nature. Beginners face the dilemma of choosing between affordability and performance, and often purchase less capable equipment as a result. This compromise can result in frustration and dissatisfaction, because here&#39;s the deal: wildlife photography, more than almost any other genre, requires a significant investment in gear for the best results.</p><p> Selecting a camera that combines durability with high performance is crucial, especially if you plan to shoot in challenging weather conditions. A camera with fast autofocus and a high-speed burst mode is indispensable for wildlife photography. Being able to shoot at 8 frames per second or higher allows you to capture sequences of movements, ensuring you don&#39;t miss the peak action shots.</p><p> Similarly, the choice of lens is critical. A lens with a minimum focal length of 300mm is essential for most wildlife photography, while longer focal lengths like 400mm or more are ideal if you want to capture smaller or more distant subjects.</p><p> The speed at which a lens can focus is almost as important as its focal length; if the autofocus is ponderously slow, you&#39;ll struggle mightily to capture breathtaking action. Additionally, a lens that offers a wide maximum aperture, such as f/2.8 or f/4, can be a game-changer in low-light conditions, allowing for faster shutter speeds and reducing the risk of motion blur. Finally, as with cameras, durability is another factor; the equipment needs to withstand the rigors of outdoor photography! </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="failing-to-think-about-the-light"> 4. Failing to think about the light</h2><p> Light plays a pivotal role in photography, and this is equally true when shooting wildlife. The quality of light can dramatically affect the outcome of your images, influencing not just the exposure but also the mood and feel of the photograph. Many beginner wildlife photographers are tempted to venture out at midday, attracted by the brightness of the sun. However, this can lead to images with harsh shadows and overblown highlights, robbing the scene of its natural beauty and depth.</p><p> The golden hours, just after sunrise and before sunset, are renowned among professional wildlife shooters for a reason. During these times, the sun&#39;s lower position in the sky casts a soft, warm glow that can create extraordinary effects. Plus, wildlife tends to be more active during these hours, offering photographers the chance to capture dynamic shots in the best possible light.</p><p> Paying attention to the direction of the light is equally important. Frontlight, achieved by positioning yourself so that your shadow points towards the subject, can provide even illumination. This lighting direction is especially effective for highlighting details, making it a go-to choice for many wildlife photographers.</p><p> Of course, you can capture great wildlife shots in any light, but when you&#39;re just starting out, frontlight is a great pick. And no matter how you proceed, understanding and utilizing the nuances of light can elevate your wildlife photography from good to great!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="capturing-blurry-images">5. Capturing blurry images</h2><p> Blur comes in many forms. For instance, your entire image can be <a title="5 Tips for Getting Sharper Images" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-tips-to-for-getting-sharper-images/">blurry due to camera shake</a> , a problem that is magnified by the longer focal lengths needed for wildlife photography.</p><p> In landscape photography, using a tripod is a good technique to prevent camera shake, but a tripod is not as practical when photographing wildlife. Wildlife photography requires a more active shooting style – you&#39;ll be moving around constantly – so unless you are using a lens that is too big to hold comfortably, forget the tripod. Also, because the animals are always in motion, you&#39;ll need a fast shutter speed anyway. That leads me to the first method to combat camera shake blur: using a very fast shutter speed.</p><p> In landscape photography, you normally use a shutter speed that is at least 1/focal length of your lens. But usually that isn&#39;t going to be fast enough when photographing wildlife because the animals are always in motion (even when they appear to be standing still). To avoid disappointment, you&#39;ll need to use a much faster shutter speed to freeze both your own motion and the motion of the animal.</p><p> Here is my rule of thumb when photographing wildlife: if the animal appears to be still, use a shutter speed of 1/500s. And if the animal is moving, you&#39;ll have to adjust the shutter speed based on their speed. I suggest a minimum of 1/1000s (faster if the animal is moving at ultra-high speeds). </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-163111 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-163111" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-02.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="2 - 7 Mistakes to Avoid When Photographing Wildlife" class="wp-image-163111" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-02.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-02.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-02.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-02.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-02.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-02.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Leopard, Wilpattu National Park, Sri Lanka</figcaption></figure></div><p> Using a lens with image stabilization will also help prevent blur due to camera shake. Additionally, as I mentioned in a previous section, a lens with a wide maximum aperture, say f/2.8 or f/4, will let more light in, allowing you to use a faster shutter speed. Relatedly, a camera with impressive high-ISO performance will let you boost the ISO without significantly degrading the image quality. All of these options will enable you to make faster exposures with better results. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-163112 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-163112" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-03.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="3 - 7 Mistakes to Avoid When Photographing Wildlife" class="wp-image-163112" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-03.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-03.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-03.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-03.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-03.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-03.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Murlough Bay, Antrim Coast, Northern Ireland</figcaption></figure></div><p> A second type of blur is focus blur. This results from your camera being unable to focus, probably because your subject was moving and the AF motor got confused. Some cameras and lenses have superior autofocus systems to others, but regardless of what you have, you can get the best results by setting your camera to its continuous focus mode, usually called AF-C (Nikon) or AI Servo (Canon). This setting will allow you to track the subject&#39;s movement in the frame and focus more quickly and accurately.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="not-being-prepared"> 6.

For ultimate performance, you can buy a battery grip that fits on your camera. This holds two batteries at the same time for maximum speed. </p><div class="wp-block-image wp-image-163114 size-full is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-163114" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:66.67%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-05.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="5 - 7 Mistakes to Avoid When Photographing Wildlife" class="wp-image-163114" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-05.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-05.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-05.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-05.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-05.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Wildlife-05.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Green bea eater, Udawalawe National Park, Sri Lanka </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="not-getting-close-enough"> 7.

Because of this, many wildlife photos have more wilderness than wildlife, with the animal becoming a tiny speck in its environment.</p><p> This can be effective in some situations, but for the most part you want the animal to be large enough in the frame to see the detail in its eyes. This is where a good telephoto lens can really help you out. Using a long focal length (over 300mm) will allow you to keep your distance while still filling the frame.</p><p> You might also consider different shooting approaches; for instance, if you can determine an animal&#39;s behavior in advance, you can sometimes lie in wait until it comes close enough for a frame-filling photo. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="common-wildlife-photography-mistakes-final-words"> Common wildlife photography mistakes: final words</h2><p> Wildlife photography requires patience, skill, the right equipment, and more.

But successfully <em>capturing</em> the perfect decisive moment is difficult – and without a careful strategy, it&#39;s often impossible.</p><p> I&#39;ve been doing <a aria-label="street photography (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/ultimate-guide-street-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">street photography</a> for years, and over time, I&#39;ve developed a handful of tricks and techniques that&#39;ll increase your chances of nailing that decisive moment. Below, I share those tips – and I promise: If you follow my advice and you spend enough time out in the street, then you&#39;ll create plenty of decisive-moment style photos.</p><p>让我们开始吧！ </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="become-quicker-with-your-camera"> 1. Become quicker with your camera </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Dog-Days.jpg?ssl=1" alt="decisive moment street photography" title="Dog Days.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> While slow, deliberate photography is often relaxing, the street is <em>not</em> a place where you can slack off and take all the time in the world to grab a shot. There is no second chance to catch candid scenes. A decisive moment can last for five, three, or just one second and then be gone forever.</p><p> <em>If you don&#39;t catch it in time, you&#39;ll lose it for eternity.</em></p><p> Street photography is a two-step process. Yes, you must be able to spot potential scenes of interest as they occur, but you must also raise your camera, dial in the <a aria-label="right settings (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-street-photography-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">right settings</a> , and press the shutter button. If you&#39;re not intimately familiar with your gear, then you&#39;ll fail – no matter your decisive-moment instincts.</p><p> So spend some time learning the ins and outs of your equipment. Make sure you&#39;re aware of all necessary camera settings and how to adjust them on the fly. Know the best methods for acquiring focus (I&#39;d encourage you to try <a aria-label="zone focusing (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/ultimate-guide-to-zone-focusing-for-candid-street-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">zone focusing</a> ), know how to change your <a aria-label="shutter speed (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">shutter speed</a> , <a aria-label="aperture (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">aperture</a> , and <a aria-label="ISO (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">ISO</a> without looking, and know how to adjust your camera&#39;s <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/burst-mode/" target="_blank" aria-label="burst mode speeds (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">burst mode speeds</a> .</p><p> That way, when you see a decisive moment occurring, you can instantly lift your camera to your eye and hit that shutter button! </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/decisive-moment-street-photography-01.jpg?ssl=1" alt="decisive moment street photography" title="decisive-moment-street-photography-01.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="when-possible-get-set-up-in-advance"> 2. When possible, get set up in advance</h2><p> While you can capture decisive-moment style shots with any camera, for the best results, you&#39;ll want to use the <em>right</em> camera, and you&#39;ll also want to be sure that it&#39;s set up correctly.</p><p> The best decisive-moment cameras are quick, with virtually no shutter lag at all. You&#39;ll also need to get used to timing your shutter actuations. This can be done with practice, by repeatedly photographing moving objects, such as passing cars or bikes, until you&#39;ve completely gotten the feel of the timing, and speed of the shutter release. This is vital, as the coordination between your eye, the shutter release, and the camera needs to be instinctive, to achieve the split second timing that&#39;s needed.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-258787" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:54.07%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="811" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/decisive-moment-street-photography-1.jpg?resize=1500%2C811&#038;ssl=1" alt="Decisive moment street photography" class="wp-image-258787" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/decisive-moment-street-photography-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/decisive-moment-street-photography-1.jpg?resize=300%2C162&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/decisive-moment-street-photography-1.jpg?resize=600%2C324&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/decisive-moment-street-photography-1.jpg?resize=768%2C415&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/decisive-moment-street-photography-1.jpg?resize=160%2C88&amp;ssl=1 160w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/decisive-moment-street-photography-1.jpg?resize=717%2C388&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> You might find that <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/buyers-guide-prime-lenses-vs-zoom-lenses/">shooting with a prime lens is faster</a> , as well. Using a zoom will inevitably waste precious seconds zooming in and out; it&#39;s often quicker to just physically <em>move</em> . You might also find that the focus on a prime lenses is a bit quicker, and that you compose better with a prime attached to the camera, rather than a zoom.</p><p> As far as camera settings are concerned, again, it&#39;s all about anticipation. Set up the camera, wait, and shoot. Often this will mean using a number of auto controls – try using auto ISO, auto white balance, and generally shoot in Aperture Priority mode. For fast-paced street photography, the moment is far more important than your choice of depth of field, and even having the camera on Program mode is okay. It&#39;s all about emotion and expression, timing and anticipation, and the fewer distractions you have to achieve this goal, the better. If you are a manual shooter, then setting the exposure in advance is critical.</p><p> Finally, it&#39;s also worth mentioning, that having a camera that writes to the memory card reasonably quickly is important too. You&#39;ll likely need to fire off several shots relatively rapidly, and waiting for the camera to write the card is a pain. Often buying faster, higher-quality cards is the answer!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="get-in-the-zone"> 3. Get in the zone</h2><p> The best way to capture decisive moments is to spot interesting scenes <em>as they&#39;re occurring</em> (predicting them in advance is even better!). But to do this with consistency, you need to have the right mindset.</p><p> Specifically, you must be <em>focused</em> . You&#39;ve got to cast out your attention and keep your head on the swivel, looking around for opportunities. Just walking in a good location while thinking about work or home life won&#39;t land you the money shots. To absorb the chaotic environment and notice decisive moments, you need to concentrate.</p><p> I&#39;d encourage you to pause before you step out onto the streets. Take a deep breath, and wipe away any distracting thoughts. Then, when you walk out the door, you&#39;ll be ready to capture beautiful moments as they appear.</p><p> By the way, there are a lot of distractions in the modern world. If you have the option, turn off your phone before you shoot and leave your gadgets and gizmos (such as your smartwatch) at home. Remember: The more focused you are, the better you&#39;ll do! </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/decisive-moment-street-photography-02.jpg?ssl=1" alt="decisive moment street photography" title="decisive-moment-street-photography-02.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Also, don&#39;t get too distracted by your <a aria-label="street photography camera (opens in a new tab)" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-camera-for-street-photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">street photography camera</a> . It&#39;s a tool that helps you capture your vision, nothing more. You don&#39;t need to look at every image you take, and you don&#39;t need to spend long seconds agonizing over each setting (see the previous tip!). If this becomes an issue, try using a film camera. The minimalism may help you get in the zone. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-be-afraid-to-do-some-pre-planning"> 4. Don&#39;t be afraid to do some pre-planning</h2><p> As you head out, think about where the type of pictures you want to capture, and consider where they&#39;re most likely to happen. It&#39;s often a bad idea to randomly go out looking for photographs, especially when you&#39;re starting out; you really have to put yourself in the best situation, at the best time, to increase your chances of getting the pictures you&#39;re after. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/004.jpg?ssl=1" alt="004" title="004.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by Andrew Hind</figcaption></figure></div><p> For instance, you&#39;ll probably want to head out in the middle of the day, maybe on a weekend, when the streets are more likely to be filled with people. There will be many more interactions, and your chances of success are higher. It all begins with deciding exactly what type of pictures you want, and where the most likely place are that you will get them.</p><p> Once you are in place, pre-visualizing the types of shots you want will give you focus and purpose. If you&#39;re photographing at an outdoor market, for example, how about setting yourself the task of photographing human connections, maybe as people are chatting, handing over money or goods, etc? Or how about looking for interesting juxtapositions between shop window displays and people standing or passing in front of them?</p><p> This may all sound rather prescriptive, but by setting yourself some parameters, you&#39;ll get your creative juices flowing, focus your attention, and increase your chances of success. There&#39;s nothing worse than not knowing what you want and randomly taking pictures just waiting for something to happen.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="overcome-your-fear"> 5. Overcome your fear</h2><p> Once you spot the perfect scene, you&#39;ll need to translate it into a photograph – but if you&#39;re afraid to get close or to raise the camera to your eye, you&#39;ll find your creative freedom restricted. (And if you&#39;re <em>deeply</em> afraid, you may struggle to see interesting moments in the first place. Not good!)</p><p> In other words, if you want to be a great decisive moment photographer, you <em>must</em> <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/7-steps-to-get-over-your-fear-of-street-photography/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">get over your anxiety</a> . There&#39;s no need to be afraid of strangers! Thanks to my years of experience, I can assure you that nothing truly bad will happen to you – as long as you use common sense. Don&#39;t go around flashing people in dangerous areas, and you&#39;ll do just fine.</p><p> In reality, you may occasionally have someone ask you to delete a picture.差不多就这样了。 And as long as you shoot in a bigger city, even that won&#39;t happen very often. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/decisive-moment-street-photography-03.jpg?ssl=1" alt="decisive moment street photography" title="decisive-moment-street-photography-03.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Honestly, fear of the streets is mostly irrational. It&#39;s your mind playing tricks on you! At the same time, everyone feels uncomfortable when they first start out on the street. We&#39;re all conditioned to avoid invading the private space of others. But the best street photographers get past this discomfort, and they reach a point where they can shoot without feeling intense anxiety.</p><p> To overcome your fear, I&#39;d recommend asking everyone you pass for a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tips-create-great-street-portraits/" target="_blank" aria-label="street portrait (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">street portrait</a> . Most people will be relaxed, and you&#39;ll eventually get rejected – which will show you that <em>it isn&#39;t the end of the world</em> .合理？ </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="perfect-your-compositional-skills"> 6. Perfect your compositional skills</h2><p> The decisive moment is all about composition – so if you don&#39;t have strong compositional instincts, you&#39;ll struggle to notice the best scenes <em>even if they&#39;re right in front of your eyes</em> .</p><p> Plus, it&#39;s important that you learn how to quickly position yourself and frame the scene for the best result, both of which rely heavily on composition. </p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/decisive-moment-street-photography-04.jpg?ssl=1" alt="decisive moment street photography" title="decisive-moment-street-photography-04.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> In my experience, a huge number of images are ruined because the composition is slightly off – images that would&#39;ve otherwise turned out amazing. I know that street photography is often seen as a genre of freedom. But when it comes to aesthetics, there are certain arrangements that look more pleasant than others.</p><p> If you&#39;re relatively unfamiliar with composition, then I&#39;d encourage you to start with the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/" target="_blank" aria-label="rule of thirds (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">rule of thirds</a> . It&#39;ll help you position your main subjects in a way that appears both balanced and dynamic.</p><p> I&#39;d also suggest using <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-leading-lines-for-better-compositions/" target="_blank" aria-label="leading lines (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">leading lines</a> ; a line or two that points toward your subject will guide the viewer&#39;s eye in the right direction. And if you want to <em>really</em> take your compositions to the next level, try incorporating layers into your images. If you can combine an interesting foreground subject with an interesting background scene, your images will turn out so much better.</p><p> Pro tip: Find some street photographers you like and study their images. Ask yourself: What makes this composition compelling? How did the photographer balance objects throughout the frame? Did they use the rule of thirds? Leading lines? The golden ratio? Over time, you&#39;ll start to internalize these different compositional guidelines, and you&#39;ll get better and better at applying them when you&#39;re out shooting.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="work-the-scene"> 7. Work the scene</h2><p> The master of decisive-moment street photography, Henri Cartier-Bresson, almost always took several exposures of the same scene or moment. He very rarely got the shot in one take!</p><p> This means that you need to take a number of frames in fairly quick succession – not on continuous (burst) shooting mode, but close enough together to record subtly different expressions, juxtapositions of people in the frame, and changes of angle and composition.</p><p> You should aim to keep moving: try the shot a little to the left, then the right, maybe a step forward or back, or a little higher or lower. Photographing when an interesting scene appears should tire you out, and you should always be in motion. You can then go through the different frames once you&#39;re back home and select the strongest image. </p><div class="wp-block-image is-style-with-caption"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/005.jpg?ssl=1" alt="005" title="005.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Image by Andrew Hind </figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="be-unobtrusive"> 8. Be unobtrusive</h2><p> The best street photography shots tend to come from remaining invisible, which is why I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a particularly good approach to stalk your subject from behind a huge 400mm lens!</p><p> Instead, it&#39;s much better to use something smaller and less intrusive, to be closer to the subject and more involved in what&#39;s going on. Consequently people will behave in a much more natural and relaxed way in front of you and your camera.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"> <span class="responsive-image wp-image-258788" style="width:1500px"><span class="space" style="width:1500px; padding-top:75%"></span><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1125" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/decisive-moment-street-photography-3.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="Decisive moment street photography" class="wp-image-258788" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/decisive-moment-street-photography-3.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/decisive-moment-street-photography-3.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/decisive-moment-street-photography-3.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/decisive-moment-street-photography-3.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/decisive-moment-street-photography-3.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></figure></div><p> Sometimes, people will notice what you&#39;re doing, and it&#39;s important to remain as non-threatening as possible. This can be as simple as smiling, looking relaxed, keeping your body language open and friendly, and just being respectful of people&#39;s personal space. Yes, you&#39;re an observer, but you have to observe from a position of being emotionally and physically involved. You&#39;ll gain much more acceptance from your subjects, and even if someone does notice your camera, the pictures will be more authentic and natural.</p><p> That&#39;s not to say that your presence should influence the scene in any way; it&#39;s just that you have to be accepted to be able to photograph people behaving naturally. If your subjects notice you and then do a pose for the camera or just seize up, you won&#39;t get good images.</p><p> A great way of making this work is to move in and out of the scene really quickly – essentially this means waiting for a scene to unfold a little distance from you. As an interesting moment is about to happen, walk toward the scene, camera ready to go. Very quickly, shoot as you are close to the action, then continue to walk out of the scene. If you combine this with unobtrusive body language, you can remain essentially invisible.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="get-inspired"> 9. Get inspired </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/decisive-moment-street-photography-05-1.jpg?ssl=1" alt="decisive moment street photography" title="decisive-moment-street-photography-05.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> If you don&#39;t already look at street photography on a regular basis, start doing it right away. Follow photographers on Instagram, set aside time to look at websites, buy some photobooks – just make sure you&#39;re spending lots of time contemplating the best work in the genre.</p><p> Because the more you look at great street photos – especially those street photos that rely on decisive moments – the better you&#39;ll get at identifying the perfect scenes and opportunities when you&#39;re out with your camera.</p><p> Plus, looking at the work of other photographers will offer lots of powerful inspiration. You&#39;ll feel more excited to hit the streets, and you may discover ideas for photos that you would&#39;ve never considered otherwise.</p><p> By the way: The right mood can also help you capture interesting photos. So don&#39;t feel like you must <em>only</em> look at pictures; you can also listen to music, watch your favorite movie, or read a good book. As long as it helps you be more creative, it&#39;s fair game!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="persevere"> 10. Persevere </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/decisive-moment-street-photography-06.jpg?ssl=1" alt="decisive moment street photography" title="decisive-moment-street-photography-06.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> Street photography is a lot of fun, but it&#39;s <em>not</em> a discipline that&#39;ll offer a quick and low-effort path to great photos. While you can certainly manage to capture beautiful decisive moment shots when you&#39;re just starting out, it often takes months and years of work before you can regularly capture stunning images.</p><p> So if you&#39;re struggling to get what you want, don&#39;t give up. Know that results will come eventually. You just need to practice.</p><p> To accelerate the learning curve, spend plenty of time looking at other photos (as emphasized in previous tips!). And consider forming a group of other photographers who have similar goals. If you can walk the street with other street shooters – especially those with more experience – you&#39;ll start to see the world from a new perspective. You&#39;ll notice photo opportunities that you would never think of otherwise!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="dont-chimp"> 11.

If you&#39;ve just captured one shot, you&#39;ll often be tempted, during this time, to take a look at the screen (ie, chimp). And that&#39;s when the best scene of all will appear and disappear! (This is what I call the chimping effect.)</p><p> Many, many times, I&#39;ve taken an image, had a quick look down at the screen on the back of the camera, only to realize that I just missed something better.</p><p> So don&#39;t look at the screen. Keep your camera ready, and always wait – even if you think you&#39;ve got the shot.</p><p> Relatedly, you will often miss great shots when you are tired and have given up. You need to keep going and going – I know that the longer I shoot, the more high quality images I will get. I also know that by having a complete break for five minutes or so every hour, I am able to keep quick and alert for longer. It&#39;s amazing to consider how, when I give up on a scene, something interesting often seems to just appear!</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="stay-curious"> 12. Stay curious </h2><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/decisive-moment-street-photography-07.jpg?ssl=1" alt="decisive moment street photography" title="decisive-moment-street-photography-07.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div><p> However you approach decisive moment street photography, don&#39;t lose interest in your environment and in humankind. Cultivate your curiosity, embrace your inner tourist, and look for scenes that might normally seem boring.</p><p> If you&#39;re struggling to find subjects to shoot, think back to the last time you were on vacation. Didn&#39;t <em>everything</em> seem so interesting? The most mundane places offer lots of opportunities if you have the right mindset. A restaurant, a car, an old door; these might seem boring to a longtime resident, but to a photographer with the right mindset, they offer dozens of outstanding photos!</p><p> One more tip: Don&#39;t ever restrict your shooting. It&#39;s better to shoot too much than too little! Digital storage is cheap, and missing a decisive moment can be deeply frustrating. So keep your finger on the shutter button, and be ready to shoot at a moment&#39;s notice. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" class="wp-block-heading" data-section id="decisive-moment-street-photography-final-words"> Decisive moment street photography: final words</h2><p> Now that you&#39;ve finished this article, you&#39;re ready to capture some decisive moments.</p><p> So remember the tips I&#39;ve shared.

Introduce a Human Element:</strong> Incorporating a person in your landscape photo instantly establishes scale. It helps the viewer relate to the enormity of the surroundings, whether it&#39;s towering mountains or expansive plains.</p><p> <strong>2. Use Familiar Objects:</strong> No people around? Use other familiar objects like vehicles, animals, or buildings to offer a sense of scale. A car on a vast mountain road, for instance, can dramatically highlight the scene&#39;s magnitude.</p><p> <strong>3. Layering and Foreground Elements:</strong> Creating layers in your image, with a strong foreground element, adds depth and a sense of scale. This technique allows viewers to visually traverse from the foreground to the distant background, understanding the space between.</p><p> <strong>4. Use Wide Lenses:</strong> Wide-angle lenses capture more of a scene, emphasizing its vastness. Combining a wide lens with a foreground element exaggerates the perspective, enhancing the sense of scale.</p><p> <strong>5. Capture Atmospheric Perspective:</strong> This phenomenon, where distant objects appear lighter and less saturated, adds a sense of depth and vastness. Scenes with atmospheric perspective, like fading mountain layers, emphasize the grand scale.</p><p> <strong>6. Play with Shadows and Light:</strong> Utilizing the interplay of light and shadow, especially during golden hours, adds dimension. Long shadows can illustrate the enormity of elements like trees or mountains.</p><p> <strong>7. Use Leading Lines:</strong> Leading lines, such as rivers or roads, guide the viewer&#39;s eye and illustrate the scale of the landscape. They create a visual journey from the foreground to the horizon.</p><p> <strong>8. Drones and Aerial Photography:</strong> Drones offer a unique bird&#39;s-eye perspective, revealing landscape proportions and patterns unseen from the ground. This fresh viewpoint can showcase scale in an extraordinary way.</p><p> <strong>Implementing Scale:</strong> When out shooting landscapes, remember these techniques to add a compelling sense of scale to your photographs. It&#39;s about providing context and reference points to turn flat images into captivating stories of grandeur.</p><p><strong>如从前：</strong></p><p> <strong>Make sure you include the hashtags #dPSWeeklyChallenge and #dPSScale in your post, here in the comments or over on social media.
