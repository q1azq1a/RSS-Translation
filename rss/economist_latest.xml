edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">原则上有一个解决方案，即热泵。它们的工作原理就像一台反向冰箱，从外部收集热量，将其集中，然后通过管道输送到建筑物中。<small>欧盟</small>希望到 2030 年用热泵取代住宅楼内 6800 万个燃气锅炉和 1800 万个燃油锅炉中的三分之一。这可能意味着石油和天然气产生的住宅总排放量将下降 28%，而且随着越来越多的人使用热泵，这一数字应该会上升。为这些泵提供动力的电力来自低碳来源。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但雄心勃勃的目标也存在问题。与锅炉相比，热泵价格昂贵，通常是化石燃料锅炉的两倍或三倍。另一个原因是，由于它们将冷却水泵送到散热器，因此它们在隔热良好的新建筑中效果最佳。据估计，欧洲大约 60% 的住房存量未达到要求的标准，需要进行大量且昂贵的翻修工作才能使其适应要求。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">还有另一个缺点。尽管从环境角度来看，低碳电力驱动的热泵无疑比化石燃料锅炉更好，但它们并不完全是绿色的。大多数住宅模型都含有对环境有害的气体，欧洲立法者准备将其取缔。重新设计机器以使其在没有它们的情况下工作可能意味着安装它们的延迟。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在一些地方，热泵政治已经变得脾气暴躁。德国法律计划从明年开始禁止在家庭中安装新的燃气锅炉。交叉选民的强烈反对在该国联合政府中引发了一场争吵，直到六月份这些规则被废除。 9 月 8 日，在我们发表这篇文章后，德国立法者预计将通过该规则的淡化版本。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">热身</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">热泵的工作原理是利用空气中的环境热量或埋在地下或水下的一系列管道中的热量来加热管道网络中的制冷剂。这会将制冷剂从液体变成气体。然后气体被压缩，温度升高。产生的热气体被泵送通过热交换器，在那里加热用于为建筑物供暖的水或空气。当气体冷却时，它会回到液态，准备重复这个过程。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">由于热泵只是移动现有的热量，而不是自己产生热量，因此它们的效率非常高。有些型号的效率高达 400% 或更高，这意味着泵每消耗一千瓦的电力，就可以向房屋输送四千瓦的热量。现代燃气锅炉通过燃烧产生热量，效率可以达到 90% 左右，但物理定律不允许其超过 100%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管热泵在低至 -25°C 的温度下工作，但在冬季，从空气中收集的热量较少，其效率较低。但热泵往往会产生加热至 55°C 左右的水。这比大多数燃气锅炉的温度要低，大多数燃气锅炉的温度可能在 75°C 左右。这意味着在旧建筑上安装热泵通常需要额外的隔热层、更大的散热器甚至地暖，所有这些都是破坏性的且昂贵的。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure

edweubf1">图片：迈克·哈达德</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">大多数现代热泵使用氢氟碳化合物（ <small>HFC</small> ）作为制冷剂。它们在适当的温度下从液体转变为气体，并且可以携带大量的热量。但<small>氢氟碳</small>化合物也是强效温室气体，其改变气候的能力可能比主要的人造温室气体二氧化碳高数千倍。热泵和其他设备（例如某些类型的制冷和空调系统）中<small>HFC</small>的泄漏约占<small>欧盟</small>温室气体排放总量的 2.5%，与欧洲航空旅行造成的排放量相差不远。地区。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">丙烷和丙烷配件</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">考虑到这一点，<small>欧盟</small>原计划今年夏天对新规则进行最后修改，要求到 2027 年用更清洁的替代品取代<small>HFC</small> 。但讨论已经破裂。在德国和荷兰的支持下，一方热衷于逐步淘汰这一项目。另一个国家在一些东欧国家和一些热泵制造商的支持下，希望将最后期限推迟到 2030 年代。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">还存在其他制冷剂。化学工业开发了一类称为氢氟烯烃 ( <small>HFO</small> ) 的化学品。这些温室气体的威力不如<small>氢氟碳化合物</small>，但仍比二氧化碳威力更大。但包括丹麦、德国、荷兰、挪威和瑞典在内的一些国家也希望限制<small>重油</small>，因为研究表明它们可能会污染雨水。因此，许多热泵制造商转向所谓的天然制冷剂，这种制冷剂的全球变暖潜力最低。其中一些早在合成物质开发出来之前就已用于制冷。它们包括氨，甚至二氧化碳本身。但在住宅热泵中取代<small>HFC</small>的领先者是丙烷。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">丙烷的全球变暖效应仅比二氧化碳强一点点。在热泵中使用它的问题是，与<small>HFC</small>不同，它是易燃的。它也无味，这就是为什么当丙烷用作燃料时，它会发出“臭鸡蛋”的气味，这样如果泄漏就很容易被发现。这在热泵中是不可能的，因为产生气味的化学物质会干扰制冷过程。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">因此，丙烷驱动的泵适用额外的规则。如果将丙烷泵送到建筑物内，如在室内安装热交换设备的“分体系统”中，则系统中的气体量限制为 150 克，约为<small>HFC</small>中通常使用的制冷剂量的五分之一模型。如果使用更多的气体，则必须安装额外的安全功能，例如泄漏传感器和自动通风系统。这使得成本更高，安装也更加繁琐，尤其是在不太适合该技术的老建筑中。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">根据欧洲热泵协会的说法（尽管并非所有成员似乎都同意），快速逐步淘汰<small>氢氟碳化合物</small>将“踩下热泵部署的刹车”。它认为，更宽松的时间表将使该行业有更多时间来开发基于丙烷的系统，这些系统可以更容易地安装在更多种类的家庭中。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 40 多名科学家组成的小组向欧洲立法者提交的一份论文表示，推迟行动是没有必要的。他们指出，20 世纪 90 年代，冰箱行业花了三到五年的时间才转向使用异丁烷等清洁气体。 （该行业首选的制冷剂氯氟烃在这十年中被逐步淘汰，因为它们对臭氧层造成损害。）该论文认为，热泵制造商未能做到的是减少加热制冷剂的量。泵包含，因为这对于不可燃的<small>HFC</small>来说并不重要。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">不管他们的贸易机构怎么说，包括菲斯曼和罗伯特博世这两家德国公司以及日本三菱电机在内的许多生产商已经推出了丙烷热泵。它们往往是安装在室外的大型“整体”系统，任何逸出的气体都可以快速且无害地扩散到空气中。 Viessman 表示，除了环保优势之外，丙烷还可以更轻松地生产可提供 70°C 水温（燃气锅炉产生的温度）的热泵。在许多情况下，这可以消除更换散热器或安装地暖的需要，从而节省大量资金。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">许多房产，尤其是公寓，可能缺乏足够的外部空间来建造整体建筑。因此，公司正在研究可以使用少量丙烷的分体式系统。他们得到了德国弗莱堡弗劳恩霍夫太阳能系统研究所的莉娜·施纳贝尔 (Lena Schnabel) 和她的同事的帮助。 Schnabel 博士的团队测试了多种设计，其中包括一种仅需要 146 克丙烷的设计。这是通过重新设计和优化泵的大部分重要部件（例如压缩机、热交换器和管道）以及原型零件的使用来实现的。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">施纳贝尔博士乐观地认为，在未来几年内，含有少量丙烷的新设计将意味着可以用安全、环保并产生相似温度的热泵直接取代公寓内的燃气锅炉。 。热源可以是公共热源，位于建筑物的屋顶或埋在地下室，为数十个单独的室内设备供电。不过，甚至有人讨论要提高 150 克的限制，施纳贝尔博士表示，“为了安全起见，尽可能少地使用制冷剂确实有意义”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果此类设备能够完善，那么热泵的许多缺点就可以消除。它们不仅本身会成为更环保的机器，而且也会变得更容易、更便宜地安装在旧建筑中。这将有助于平息围绕他们的争论。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Sep 2023 21:57:08

月的第一次总统辩论到选举日，“基本上没有白天和黑夜”。他现在是一名记者，曾为吉米·卡特的竞选活动工作过。唐纳德·特朗普如果赢得共和党提名（这似乎是有可能的），他将不得不将这一艰苦的努力与他在四项刑事审判中作为被告的角色结合起来。他总共面临 91 项重罪指控，从伪造商业记录到密谋诈骗国家。他的审判可能会在选举日之前安排。到目前为止，否认所有指控的特朗普先生已经调和了被告和候选人的角色，让他的竞选活动主要围绕针对他的案件进行。他声称自己是政治迫害的受害者，以此赢得共和党的支持。如果特朗普与民主党总统候选人乔·拜登对峙，大多数美国选民是否会同意目前还不确定。法庭上的揭露很可能会影响这场竞选。这些是等待前总统的起诉。</p><p

e190yofl0">他们所指控的罪行各不相同：一些被称为“假选举人”的被告据说向国会提交了虚假文件，声称特朗普赢得了佐治亚州。据称还有人向该州官员呼吁，敦促他们推翻拜登的胜利。据称还有其他人骚扰选举工作人员并窃取投票数据。威利斯女士声称特朗普先生统一并激励了他们的非法行为。此案的核心将是 2021 年 1 月的一个电话：时任总统在电话中敦促佐治亚州国务卿布拉德·拉芬斯佩格“找到 11,780 票”——这正是他赢得该州所需的数字。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><b>选举干扰</b></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><i>司法管辖区：联邦（华盛顿特区）</i></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><i>审判日期：2024年3月4日</i></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">杰克·史密斯的起诉书指控特朗普试图窃取 2020 年总统选举结果，这是针对这位前总统的最严重的案件。史密斯先生虽然是由美国司法部长梅里克·加兰任命的，但却是一名独立的特别检察官。这种地位应该确保他没有政治议程，尽管特朗普的支持者当然不接受这一点。今年8月1日，史密斯先生指控特朗普密谋欺骗美国、阻碍官方程序（国会对选举团投票有利于拜登的认证）并密谋剥夺美国人计票的权利。起诉书指控特朗普在亚利桑那州、佐治亚州、密歇根州、内华达州、新墨西哥州、宾夕法尼亚州和威斯康星州操纵假选举人；依靠司法部和副总统迈克·彭斯来实施他的“犯罪计划”；并利用 2021 年 1 月 6 日国会大厦的暴力事件鼓励立法者推迟投票认证。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在质疑这些指控时，特朗普的律师可能会援引第一修正案的言论自由权。起诉书一开始就承认这一权利，以及特朗普对选举结果提出正式质疑的权利。但它继续声称，他的谎言创造了不信任的基础，他的犯罪阴谋就建立在这个基础上。 </p><div

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">他们声称，前总统知道保留和泄露秘密文件是严重犯罪；他将它们藏在不安全的地方，并拒绝交出它们的命令；他还吹嘘其中的内容。起诉书称，这些文件被装在特朗普居住的佛罗里达州海湖庄园的多个地点。其中包括舞厅、淋浴间和储藏室，公众可以从俱乐部的泳池露台进入。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs

Jean Carroll) 进行性虐待以及后来对她的诽谤负责。 9 月 6 日，一名法官在第二次诽谤审判中裁定特朗普须承担责任，部分原因是他 5 月份在<small>CNN</small>市政厅对卡罗尔女士发表了令人厌恶的评论。陪审团将于 2024 年 1 月 15 日对损害赔偿做出裁决。第一次民事审判并没有影响支持特朗普的选民。犯罪行为的全面影响还有待观察。到目前为止，他们提高了他在共和党人中的受欢迎程度。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Sep 2023 20:59:36 GMT</pubDate><guid

path ahead for China’s Belt and Road Initiative]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>习近平</span>2013 年 9 月 7 日在哈萨克斯坦发表的讲话中<small>几乎没有</small>暗示，他正在考虑在中国数千亿美元的贷款和投资的刺激下，在世界范围内掀起一场混凝土浇筑热潮。没有人预料到该项目将成为他外交政策的一个决定性特征以及中国崛起为全球大国的戏剧性象征。习近平谈到沿着古老的“丝绸之路”建设连接中国和欧洲的“经济带”。他呼吁改善基础设施并减少贸易壁垒。如果他有一个宏伟的计划，那么领导就会埋藏在对历史和哈萨克诗歌的沉思中。西方震惊了。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">中国即将大张旗鼓地庆祝该项目十周年。它将宣传“一带一路”倡议（该计划最终<small>为人所知</small>），作为给世界的礼物，创造了巨大的经济利益。中国声称，“一带一路”带来的经济增长已为<small>“一带一路”</small><small>沿线</small>国家创造了42万个就业岗位，4000万人摆脱了贫困。美国及其许多盟友认为， <small>“一带一路”</small>倡议远没有那么温和：它是一种政治工具，旨在压制外国对习近平铁腕统治的批评，并为那些让其他国家背负沉重债务的中国企业提供支持。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在富裕国家中，中国的<small>“一带一路”</small>庆祝活动无助于缓解焦虑。其中的亮点将是定于 10 月在北京举行的“一带一路”论坛。世界领导人已被邀请，但预计西方国家不会出席。最重要的客人将是俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京。他与习近平一起出席，将突显西方许多人所看到的<small>“一带一路”</small>面纱背后的真相：中国试图兜售另一种发展模式，避开民主，为独裁者创造一个安全的世界。在该活动的筹备过程中，中国一直在努力留住已签署该计划的<small>七国集团</small>成员：意大利。其副总理安东尼奥·塔贾尼刚刚访问北京并传达了一个信息：他的国家可能会退出。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">预计 9 月 9 日至 10 日在德里举行的 20<small>国集团</small>会议将面临更多阻力。总统乔·拜登将提出另一种愿景，即通过加强世界银行和<small>国际货币基金组织</small>的作用来帮助较贫穷的国家。他的国家安全顾问杰克·沙利文表示，这些机构“建立在并继续体现<small>美国的</small>领导地位”。他补充说，这些将在对抗中国“强制性和不可持续的贷款”方面提供“最大的效益”。由于不明原因，预计习近平将不会参加这次聚会。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">当<small>“一带一路”倡议</small>启动时，人们几乎没有意识到中国和西方之间即将在公路、铁路、港口和管道建设等听起来很无辜的事情上展开斗争。习近平在哈萨克斯坦的讲话几乎没有引起人们的注意。近一个月后，他在印度尼西亚发表了另一篇演讲，呼吁建设“21世纪海上丝绸之路”。直到第二年，习近平才开始用一个朗朗上口的缩写来形容这两个想法——“一带一路”。一些西方官员确实对此感到畏缩：对于开始出现的涉及数十个国家的庞大而复杂的计划来说，这个词听起来过于以中国为中心且过于简单化。所以中国调整了外国人的名字（不是中文）。 2015年，它成为<small>“一带一路”</small> 。 </p><div class="css-0 eitqf4z0"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="1280" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 834px, 95vw"

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">那是在中国和西方之间本已紧张且不信任的关系开始急剧恶化之前。唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 直到 2017 年才成为美国总统，对中国发动贸易战，这场贸易战将成为美国针对中国改变全球规范行为的更广泛行动的一部分。四年前，欧盟开始称中国为“系统性竞争对手”。对新疆穆斯林的大规模拘禁和香港对异见的全面镇压仍是未来的事情。即使在西方，中国也敞开了大门。<small>欧盟</small>27个成员国中有18个签署了<small>“一带一路”</small>倡议。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其中之一是希腊，该国在2009年遭受了经济崩溃。中国已经就位。 2008年，中国国有航运巨头<small>中远</small>集团达成协议，租赁位于雅典郊区的中国主要港口比雷埃夫斯的两个集装箱码头。 2016年，希腊在<small>欧盟</small>和<small>国际货币基金组织</small>的金融救助者的压力下采取了进一步措施，要求其通过国有资产私有化来筹集资金。它同意将整个工厂51%的股份出售给<small>中远集团</small>。欧洲港口首次由中国公司控制。 2021 年，它又购买了 16% 的股份。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">中国取得了胜利。其官员称比雷埃夫斯为“<small>一带</small>一路”在欧洲的“龙头”。习近平在2019年访问后表示，该港口证明“<small>一带一路”</small> “不是口号、不是故事，而是成功的实践和光辉的现实”。这确实令人印象深刻。<small>中远集团</small>介入之初，比雷埃夫斯港在全球集装箱港口中排名第93位。现在它已跻身前 40 名。中国制造的巨型蓝色起重机从船上卸下集装箱，在<small>中远集团</small>成立之前，这些集装箱对于港口来说太大了，无法搬运。自从该公司抵达并开始大规模升级以来，比雷埃夫斯港的集装箱装卸能力已增长了四倍多。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但如果中国希望获得一个重要港口的控制权将使其在<small>欧盟</small>和<small>北约</small>成员国中获得持久的政治影响力，那么它可能会失望。在授予<small>中远集团</small>控制权后，希腊阻止<small>欧盟</small>发表攻击中国在南海行为及其人权记录的声明。然而，一个更加亲美的政府在 2019 年上台。“希腊人不再将中国视为其经济的救世主。事实上，民意调查显示希腊公众越来越目中无人，”华盛顿智库卡内基国际和平基金会 2021 年的一份报告称。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">近年来，欧洲各地对中国的态度发生了很大变化。<small>欧盟</small>加强了对外国投资可能存在的安全风险的审查。欧洲只有少数大型<small>“一带一路”</small>项目。其中之一是由中国贷款资助的匈牙利和塞尔维亚之间正在建设的高速铁路线。中国最终希望将其与比雷埃夫斯港连接起来，但北马其顿和希腊仍在考虑如何推进其路段。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">中国在非洲的影响力要广泛得多。早在<small>“一带一路”</small>倡议提出之前，中国就已经是该地区的重要参与者。该计划推动了中国对从铁路到港口等非洲大型基础设施项目的参与。撒哈拉以南非洲吸收了中国<small>“一带一路”</small>贷款的很大一部分。但随着各国负债累累，许多贷款都变成了坏账。对于中国来说，非洲已经成为一个金融泥潭。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">为谁设下的陷阱？</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">中国的银行愿意放贷，但也很精明。大部分信贷是按照商业条款授予的。这些银行一直抵制西方通过注销部分贷款来帮助非洲国家的呼吁。但今年六月，中国与其他外国政府债权人一起与赞比亚就如何重组数十亿美元的债务达成协议，其中大部分欠中国。那是一个转变。中国通常更愿意通过秘密双边会谈来解决此类问题。尽管如此，它还是不同意理发。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一些西方官员抱怨说，中国一直在设置“债务陷阱”，以诱骗粗心的<small>“一带</small>一路”贷款接受者：其想法是，当借款人违约时，中国可以获取重要基础设施所有权等让步。一个据称的例子是，在斯里兰卡政府陷入债务困境后，一家中国公司于 2017 年收购了中国在斯里兰卡建造的港口汉班托塔 (Hambantota)。但几乎没有证据表明那里或其他地方有人故意设置陷阱。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">相反，中国的银行一直在没有对风险进行适当评估的情况下放贷，从而让自己陷入困境。现在，他们更愿意让借款人维持生计，而不是让他们陷入困境。根据美国研究组织 AidData 的一份报告，2016 年至 2021 年间，他们提供了 1850 亿美元的救助贷款。报告称，2010年，中国海外贷款中只有不到5%用于支持陷入困境的借款国。到 2022 年，这一数字已上升至 60%。中国的银行对此类贷款也持相对强硬的态度。 AidData 在 3 月份撰文表示，<small>国际货币基金组织</small>救援贷款的利息通常为 2%。中国人的平均税率是5%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">中国可能正在吸取教训。美国另一家研究公司荣鼎集团(Rhodium Group)的数据显示，中国的对外贷款在2016年达到顶峰后已经有所下降。 “在经历了备受瞩目的失误之后，中国的大型银行正在重新评估其贷款行为，”报告称。 2020年，中国向非洲政府提供的贷款不到20亿美元。这是自 2004 年以来的最低金额。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">巴基斯坦也出现了类似的情况，巴基斯坦是一个亲密盟友，一家<small>“一带一路”</small>旗舰企业曾讨论在道路升级和发电厂等大型项目上支出高达 600 亿美元（尽管只有约一半已落实）。它被称为中巴经济走廊 ( <small>CPEC</small> )，旨在刺激越过山区边境直至西南 1,500 多公里处的瓜达尔港的贸易。中国自2013年起开始管理瓜达尔港，但该港口的发展与比雷埃夫斯港的成功没有任何关系。它一直受到武装暴力和巴基斯坦政治冲突的困扰。该国与<small>中巴经济</small>走廊相关的大量借贷助长了债务危机。它一直在向<small>国际货币基金组织</small>和中国寻求帮助。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但中国仍然坚持<small>中巴经济走廊的</small>想法。对于周边国家来说， <small>“一带一路”倡议</small>具有更重要的意义。中国将其在基础设施建设方面的帮助视为安全保障和商业机会，在某些情况下为其能源进口提供替代陆路路线，绕过马六甲海峡，而马六甲海峡是美国可以扼杀的咽喉要道。就巴基斯坦而言，中国希望获得多重红利。它认为，繁荣的巴基斯坦可以制衡中国的竞争对手印度。它不太可能煽动可能蔓延到邻国新疆的暴力极端主义。西方安全专家推测瓜达尔可能成为中国海军基地（尽管有传言，但没有确凿证据表明中国正在那里建造海军基地）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在世界部分地区， <small>“一带一路”倡议</small>将变得不那么大胆和鲁莽。但出于安全和经济原因，中国将继续在自己的后院推行这一想法。伦敦智库国际战略研究所（ <small>IISS</small> ）表示，东南亚将成为特别关注的焦点。报告称，对中国来说，“没有一个地区比这更具战略重要性”。在与西方关系日益紧张的情况下，中国越来越关注其经济安全。该智库表示，“它希望利用<small>‘一带一路’</small>为其商品创造替代市场，并在供应链中创造替代环节”，特别是为中国的高科技产品。东南亚国家对这些连锁店至关重要。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">正在取得进展。 2021年，中国完成了一条耗资近60亿美元的高速铁路线的建设，将中国昆明市与亚洲最贫穷国家之一的老挝首都万象连接起来。老挝 422 公里的路段穿过山脉，这些山脉上仍散布着越南战争中未爆炸的美国炸弹。近一半的轨道位于隧道中。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">四月，乘客开始使用该线路。从万象到中国边境的旅程曾经是颠簸一整天的车程，现在只需 3.5 小时即可顺利行驶。老挝农民已开始种植榴莲等高价值作物，通过火车销往中国。北京小报<i>《环球时报》</i>最近的头条新闻称，“<small>美国</small>在老挝投下炸弹，中国修建铁路”。这是<small>“一带一路</small>”信息中反复出现的一个特点：中国是仁慈的，美国是恶霸。这在老挝的一些人中引起了共鸣。老挝国立大学的普佩·基菲拉冯 (Phouphet Kyophilavong) 表示，中国是“我们可以学习的老大哥”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但民意调查显示，在中国附近的国家，公众对中国的影响力更加警惕，他们认为中国的影响力正在增长。在万象的谈话中，老挝分析人士经常批评政府未能从中国项目中获取更多利益。他们表示，老挝在偿债上花费太多，以至于忽视了教育等关键需求。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">老挝负债累累。截至 2022 年底，中国欠外国贷款人 105 亿美元，相当于其<small>GDP</small>的 84%。大约一半的钱是从中国借来的。去年，老挝的外汇储备大幅下降，以至于难以购买燃料。信用评级机构警告称，该公司已接近违约。中国允许老挝推迟偿还债务。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">中国将中老铁路视为更长铁路网的其中一站，希望该铁路网最终将昆明与新加坡连接起来。对于中国来说，这条线路的成功并不取决于老挝750万人口如何使用它。更重要的是在更富裕的泰国铺设铁路，泰国的人口数量是泰国的十倍。这项工作正在进行中，尽管在整个地区完成该项目将受到泰国和马来西亚混乱的政治、项目条款的艰难谈判（老挝相对轻松）以及一些当地立法者对与老挝走得太近的警惕的困扰。中国。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">辨别<small>“一带一路”</small>倡议的真正含义可能很困难。它经常被与马歇尔计划相比较，马歇尔计划是美国在第二次世界大战后为重建欧洲提供的资金。但事实并非如此。 <small>“一带一路”倡议</small>活动涉及援助的很少。事实上，许多<small>“一带一路”</small>国家都相对富裕。全球已有超过 150 家企业签署了该计划。其中约一半被世界银行标记为中上收入或高收入国家。丝绸之路语言具有误导性。加入没有地域限制。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但它可能如何演变正变得越来越清楚。 In 2015 China said the <small>BRI</small> would also create a “digital silk road”, a fancy way of describing the pursuit of business abroad by Chinese companies—state and private—in industries such as telecommunications and cloud computing. The West, especially America, worries that China aims to capture markets with its low-priced, cutting-edge technologies in ways that could threaten Western security and intrude on personal freedoms. America&#39;s tech battle against China is in part a response to such fears.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As countries recover from debt shocks and China struggles with weaker growth at home, <small>BRI</small> language is becoming more cautious. In 2021 Mr Xi called for a new phase emphasising “small but beautiful” projects. These would have higher standards and better returns, involving industries like green energy and digital infrastructure. China would stop building coal-fired power plants abroad, he said. Even during the pandemic, China&#39;s greenfield investments in digital technology abroad steadily increased, says the <small>IISS</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In state media, a slew of new ideas proposed by Mr Xi have begun to vie with the <small>BRI</small> for attention. The Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilisation Initiative are concepts rather than plans for action, but with strong implicit messages: China&#39;s development model is better for poorer countries than Western templates stressing human rights, Western military alliances threaten world peace and criticism of Chinese communism amounts to a racist attack on China&#39;s ancient culture.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the <small>BRI</small> is far from being abandoned. In the build-up to next month&#39;s summit in Beijing, a message is being pushed by China&#39;s official media. It is that the scheme is Mr Xi&#39;s cherished project. As an obvious tribute to him, the Communist Party agreed in 2017 to enshrine the task of pursuing the <small>BRI</small> into its charter, thus making it a heresy to doubt it. Reports on state television show Mr Xi visiting projects around the world, as if delivering China&#39;s wealth in person. An article in August praised him for “opening up a &#39;happy road&#39; that benefits all countries”. The <small>BRI</small> , in other words, has plenty of political life left in it. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Sep 2023 20:45:53 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/9bnficufkfno9c9ls5a7ph1vbdc4dnkh</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/china/2023/09/06/the-path-ahead-for-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative </item><item><title><![CDATA[America’s Supreme Court should adopt new ethics standards]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>N</span> <small>ext TERM</small> will be agonising for the Supreme Court. Some combination of voters and courts will determine whether Donald Trump becomes president again and whether he goes to prison. President Joe Biden&#39;s son has a case before the courts. Dozens of states have changed their voting laws since 2020 and the nine justices on the Supreme Court may be asked to look at them. If the presidential election in 2024 is close, the court may have to step in and adjudicate. With so much at stake, America needs a Supreme Court that is broadly seen as legitimate and, ideally, impartial. Regrettably, trust in the court is at its lowest point since pollsters began asking about it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This is partly because of polarisation. Supreme Court nominations are a knife-fight in the Senate: there is no longer even a pretence that confirming a justice should be above party politics. Four of the nine justices were nominated by the candidates who will probably contest next year&#39;s presidential election. Thanks to brass-knuckle politics, lifetime tenure and quirks of fate, such as the timing of a liberal justice&#39;s death, three were nominated by Mr Trump. He refers to them as “my judges”, as if they worked for him, which they do not. Meanwhile many left-leaning Americans are outraged at recent rulings on abortion and racial preferences. All this has undermined faith in the court, and much of it is beyond the justices&#39; control.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What they can control is their own ethical standards. On this, some have fallen short. Harlan Crow, a Republican donor, bought a house from Clarence Thomas, flew him on a private jet, took him on cruises and paid private-school tuition for his great-nephew. Justice Thomas decided he did not need to disclose any of this, because Mr Crow is a friend—and the justices were not required to declare such hospitality. Neither did Samuel Alito divulge a ride he took on a private jet that was paid for by another Republican donor. When this was discovered by <i>ProPublica</i> , an <small>NGO</small> , Justice Alito complained that no reasonable person could accuse him of having flouted the rules.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is fine for justices to have rich friends. Yet they also have a duty to the institution they serve. The most common accusation levelled at them is that they are partisans. They deny it, but the charge is easier to make when conservative justices nominated by Republican presidents holiday with conservative donors to Republican candidates and then appear to want to sweep it under their robes.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Most federal employees are barred from accepting any gift worth over $20. Members of the Supreme Court, by contrast, largely self-regulate. And lifetime tenure, which we have argued should be scrapped, fosters a sense of entitlement.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Last year Congress passed a law requiring more transparency about financial disclosures. It is too weak: under it, Justices Alito and Thomas can still decide what is reasonable for Justices Alito and Thomas to do. The same goes for the liberal justices, who have sometimes fallen short—though Sonia Sotomayor&#39;s paid-for trips to various law schools sound less fun than Justice Thomas&#39;s jaunts. That needs to be fixed before the court finds itself entangled in contentious political cases next year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Democrats no longer have majorities in both houses of Congress, so further reform is unlikely to come through legislation. New standards will therefore have to be adopted by the court voluntarily. These should not be discretionary, but transparent and binding. That would be in the court&#39;s interest because voters may otherwise conclude that some justices are less interested in the law than what they can get out of it. Now, of all times, America needs a court that is spotless and seen to be. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Sep 2023 19:15:58 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/4qhghbtf4os0kthm1knlf1bvaf4g5q3o</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/06/americas-supreme-court-should-adopt-new-ethics-standards </item><item><title><![CDATA[Can YIMBYs ease the global housing crunch?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>F</span> <small>LANNERY ASSOCIATES</small> did not even have a website until the end of August. But a lawsuit involving the firm, first filed in a federal court in May, has uncovered the huge extent of its land holdings in Solano County, which lies around 60 miles (97km) north-east of San Francisco in California. The suit revealed that Flannery had committed to buying 140 properties for a total of more than $800m and was paying well over the market odds: as much as $15,000 per acre, for land valued to tax authorities for as little as a tenth of that. The entire scheme spans 50,000 acres, an area far larger than that of San Francisco proper.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Who would be willing to pay so much for seemingly so little? On August 25th the <i>New York Times</i> revealed that the formerly anonymous owners of Flannery Associates include almost a dozen Silicon Valley moguls. Among them are Michael Moritz, former head of Sequoia Capital, a huge venture-capital firm, and Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, a networking app. Though none of the land is currently zoned for housing, the plan, apparently, is to build a town from scratch. Its new website is branded “California Forever”, with architectural drawings of families eating in sunny Mediterranean-style plazas. This constitutes “a vision”, says Brian Brokaw of Flannery Associates.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nowhere in the world is the failure to build enough housing clearer than in the San Francisco Bay Area. The overriding reason why boils down to Nimbyism, or “Not in My Backyard”, the tendency of locals to resist new development. A growing movement is trying to fix that. The secretive plans for a new city in Solano County are just one of the more outlandish strands of Yimbyism—a growing movement that says yes, not no, to development.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>Yimby</small> s argue that housing shortages are caused largely by laws that control who can build what and where. Zoning and planning laws, they say, are so strict that building new housing is in many places completely illegal, and in almost all it is slow, difficult and expensive. In the past decade or so, Yimbyism has spread from a minority pursuit of economists and a few dedicated activists into a plausible political movement of its own, with thousands of members and chapters spreading across countries including America, Australia, Britain and New Zealand.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Not everyone agrees on everything. <small>YIMBY</small> s range from libertarian-leaning tech types through to self-described socialists, such as John Bauters. He is the bicycle-riding mayor of the tiny Californian city of Emeryville, who allows development because it gives him more rich people to tax. Yet all share one belief: more housing needs to be built, especially in the biggest and costliest cities.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> House of straw</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In recent decades house prices have outstripped income growth across the developed world. The reasons for this are numerous. Interest rates affect how much buyers can afford, as does income growth. Population changes, culture and demography all have an impact on demand, as do bank regulation, lending practices and the like. But underlying it all is basic economic logic: where demand outpaces the supply of new homes, prices tend to rise. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC412.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">According to data collated by Jim Gleeson, a researcher at the Greater London Authority, since the millennium the number of homes in English-speaking countries is lower relative to populations than elsewhere in the rich world, and growing more slowly, too. Between 2000 and 2020, the number of homes for every 100 people rose in Britain from 43 to 44. In America it went from 41 to 42, and in Australia from 40 to 41. In New Zealand population growth outpaced construction, and the number of homes per 100 residents fell slightly, to 38. In France by contrast, the figure was already 50 in 2000, and had risen to 55 by 2020; in Germany it went from 47 to 52, and in Japan from 42 to 49 (see chart 1).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What explains this? In most markets, higher prices stimulate supply. When demand for cars increases, carmakers open more factories. But all rich countries regulate construction, for good reason. Whereas a car can be manufactured and then transported almost anywhere, land is an inherently scarce resource, and for the most part housing is only valuable when it is near jobs, public services and infrastructure. Few people want to live right next door to a sewage plant; lots want to live near a large park. Planning is meant to take such things into account. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRC479.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Because jobs move, a stable ratio of housing to people across a country can mask a growing shortage in the hottest local economies. In places like California and London, wages are far higher than elsewhere in America and Britain, and have risen faster in the past decade. But for workers who do not own property, the gains are eaten up by higher rents (see chart 2). Findings published in January by the National Bureau of Economic Research show that for workers with degrees, although living in a big coastal American city comes with a substantial wage premium, a higher cost of living means that overall they are about as well off as if they lived in a poorer city. Lower-skilled workers are much worse off, which means they move out to make space.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> House of sticks</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> California&#39;s <small>Yimby</small> s point to a broken system. The state&#39;s population is shrinking even as California generates huge numbers of well-paying jobs. Consider that the median monthly rent of a one-bedroom apartment in the city of San Francisco is $3,007, or 63%, of what the median American adult working full time makes before taxes. And yet, so far this year, the Bay Area has issued permits to build only 4,500 new units of housing—scarcely more, relative to its population, than Detroit, the shrunken former powerhouse of the Midwest. Austin in Texas, with roughly half of the Bay Area&#39;s population, has issued some 20,000.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> California has tried to control development since at least the 1970s. Scott Wiener, a state senator who represents San Francisco, says that with housing in the state “the rules get made up as you go along”. The process “takes years and years and is so chaotic it ultimately mutilates or kills the project entirely”. Mr Wiener was among the first <small>Yimby</small> politicians and crafted a new state law, <small>SB35</small> , which passed not long after he took office in 2017.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>SB35</small> encourages more development by forcing reluctant city governments to comply with state-led targets. These have existed for decades in order to facilitate new housing. For San Francisco (the city, not the entire metro area), the legal target is 82,000 homes by 2031. The number of homes that have actually been built to date means that the target looks wildly out of reach. Other laws passed by Mr Wiener and his allies have extended rights to homeowners to build “accessory dwelling units”, or granny flats, and have restricted mandates that force developers to provide masses of free parking in new buildings.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At the higher levels of politics at least, Yimbyism is now practically mainstream in California. “Pro-housing policies are pro-job policies,” tweeted London Breed, San Francisco&#39;s mayor, in July. Gavin Newsom, the state&#39;s governor, promised to build 3.5m homes in a speech for his election campaign. Across the state such politicians are engaged in an increasingly pitched legislative battle with local politicians, such as city council members and the leaders of suburbs, who are generally determined not to build more.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yimbyism abounds elsewhere, too. In New York this year Kathy Hochul, the state governor, (unsuccessfully) proposed a radical “upzoning”, approving a greater density of housing in a particular area. She argued that it would allow the construction of 800,000 more homes over a decade, primarily by letting more apartments be built around railway stations in New York City&#39;s suburbs. In Canada Pierre Poilievre, who leads the opposition Conservative Party, wants the federal government to be able to force municipalities to allow more housing construction. Both major political parties in Britain say they want more houses built, no doubt mindful of an election expected next year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet constructing housing remains extremely tricky. The problem, says Brian Hanlon, a co-founder of California <small>Yimby,</small> a pro-housing pressure group, is that “we are all inheritors of this English town-planning system, which is disastrous”. In Britain the first extensive regulation of landowners&#39; rights to build on their property was introduced with the Town Planning Act in 1909 and then expanded dramatically in 1947 with the Town and Country Planning Act. In America “zoning” laws were passed in most urban areas in the 1920s and 1930s. “When Ireland got independence, we practically copied everything Great Britain did,” says Robert Tolan, a housing economist in Dublin. That included Ireland&#39;s own version of the planning act in 1963. New Zealand got its Town and Country Planning Act, named after the British one, in 1953.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In many English-speaking countries, inspired by Victorian worries about “slums”, planning laws tended to prioritise detached houses. For urban planners, such as Ebenezer Howard, density was seen as akin to crowding. In packed industrial hotspots, “downzoning” and slum clearance were used to flatten cities and spread them out by force. The writer George Orwell was sceptical of the proceedings: “If people are going to live in large towns at all they must learn to live on top of one another,” he declared. But he reckoned that many workers in Britain did not “take kindly to flats”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Today far fewer citizens of English-speaking countries live in flats than elsewhere. In England 80% of people now dwell in houses, and just 4% in flats in buildings taller than three storeys. In France 44% of people live in apartments, as opposed to houses. In cities including Dublin, Los Angeles and Sydney, sprawl is running out of road. At the densities allowed by law, almost all of the land within a reasonable commute of city centres has already been “built out”. Instead, new subdivisions are built in separate towns, perhaps 50 or 60 miles away from the core, with residents typically facing punishing commutes by car to work. (In Britain these workers typically leap over the “green belts” around cities within which construction is mostly illegal.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In San Francisco construction cost on average around $440 per square foot last summer (a figure far higher than elsewhere in America). But homes sold for roughly twice that. In southern England an acre of agricultural land might cost as much as £15,000 ($19,000). An acre with planning permission is worth at least 60 times that. What this means is that giving permission to developers to build creates vast amounts of value by the stroke of a pen. And yet it doesn&#39;t happen, largely because, through the planning system, local residents and political groups are generally able to block any development. Rules intended to regulate development, such as environmental reviews, design consultations, parking requirements and so on, in fact serve the purpose of stopping it. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="1383" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_IRD002.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Ryan Gillett</span></figcaption></figure></div><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> House of bricks</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nimbyism has plenty of origins. Most obviously, homeowners want to protect the value of their properties. Allowing the construction of individual detached houses only on large lots—a type of zoning—is an effective way to stop poor people from moving into wealthy neighbourhoods. In America there were racist motives behind the adoption of zoning and behind its tightening in the 1960s and 1970s.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nowadays, people are more likely to fear that new housing will worsen traffic, or that their views will be spoiled, or that new neighbours will be annoying, or that public services will not expand to meet extra demand. This all creates strong incentives for existing residents to organise against new development. By contrast, the people who would live in homes that are not yet built do not get a say.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even most <small>Yimby</small> s do not argue that developers ought to have an untrammelled right to build anything, anywhere. In the decades after the second world war entire neighbourhoods were demolished by overzealous planners in a host of countries. But the pendulum has since swung too far the other way. In 2021 in Bethnal Green in east London, 291 homes were blocked by the High Court in part to save a mulberry tree. In Washington, <small>DC</small> ,<small> </small>earlier this year a surface car park built in the 1960s was ruled to be an integral part of a historic bank, making any plans to build on it subject to tough additional scrutiny. In Dublin, Ireland, in January a development of nearly 1,600 homes was blocked by the High Court for a variety of reasons. But it was noted that the move protected a pair of “striking brick arches” from demolition.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> David Broockman, a San Francisco <small>Yimby</small> who happens to be a political scientist at Berkeley, suggests that Nimbyism often wins despite the huge benefits of building. That is because a project&#39;s interested parties squabble over how to share the value created by allowing it. Some want it to be used to subsidise affordable housing; some want environmental protections; some want prettier buildings; some want tax. “Every group is asking for too much,” says Mr Broockman. The end result is that nothing gets done and everybody is worse off, he concludes.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Is Yimbyism able to help? Housing construction has risen in California in recent years: more homes were built in the state last year than in any since 2008. Some of this is thanks to modest <small>Yimby</small> reforms. In the Los Angeles area, there has been a boom in the construction of accessory dwelling units. Typically, these are built in the garden of an existing house. Statewide, around 60,000 have been permitted since 2017 and in 2022 they made up one in seven of all homes constructed; most of them have been put up in the Los Angeles area.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Overall construction is still far too low to make California truly affordable again, however. The big question is whether recent reforms can induce more. In May, Emeryville, home of the socialist bicycle-riding mayor, was designated by the state of California as one of just 22 cities out of 482 to be officially “pro-housing”, meaning it plans to substantially exceed its mandated targets for construction. The city, which is wedged in between Berkeley and Oakland, about half an hour from downtown San Francisco, proposes to allow the construction of 3,687 new homes over the next eight years. That is roughly one new unit for every two existing units. But many other places are fighting their legal requirements to plan for more housing.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What is clear is that allowing construction does reduce rents. Activists point to one place where it has already had a measurable and large effect. In 2016 New Zealand&#39;s parliament passed a sweeping upzoning of the city of Auckland. The result, says Ryan Greenaway-McGrevy, an economist at the University of Auckland who has analysed the data, was a big increase in building. The number of new homes that got permission to be built went up from 2,500 to 15,000 between 2010 and 2021. Of course, like many other countries, New Zealand was dealing with the effects of the global financial crisis back in 2010. But all over the city, smart blocks of flats that can fit many inhabitants have quickly replaced fading 1960s detached houses. Homeowners have seen the value of their land go up, as it can now be redeveloped. But the cost of renting a single home has fallen, unlike in the rest of New Zealand.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It will take a lot to undo decades of undersupply. In Britain a study published this year by the Centre for Cities, a think-tank, estimates that the country is short of 4.3m homes relative to the number built in other European countries. A study in 2015 of America put the annual cost of restricted development in America&#39;s biggest cities at more than 9% of <small>GDP</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But as the costs rise, so too do the potential benefits of building. Whether Silicon Valley&#39;s richest tech investors can take advantage of that remains to be seen. Already the existing residents of Solano County are preparing to push back against “California Forever”. More politicians should follow the example of Mr Bauters in Emeryville. He just wishes that everyone would spend less time talking and more time building. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Sep 2023 19:11:55 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/8ervd8t1hpi4r2877llb0l57qf0mkm3k</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/09/06/can-yimbys-ease-the-global-housing-crunch </item><item><title><![CDATA[How the Pentagon assesses Ukraine’s progress]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>A</span> <small>FTER THREE</small> months of achingly slow progress, Ukraine&#39;s counter-offensive is gaining <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/09/01/ukraines-counter-offensive-is-speeding-up">some momentum</a> . Near the southern village of Robotyne, Ukrainian troops have pierced the first of Russia&#39;s three defensive lines. They are now attacking the second. “Had we had this conversation two weeks ago, I would have been slightly more pessimistic,” says Trent Maul, the director of analysis for America&#39;s Defence Intelligence Agency ( <small>DIA</small> ). “Their breakthrough on that second defensive belt…is actually pretty considerable.” Can Ukraine breach it, and the third line beyond, before shells become scarce and winter beckons?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Maul, whose <small>DIA</small> office on the Potomac river periodically shakes as <i>Marine One</i> , the presidential helicopter, shuttles to and fro from its heliport next door, is charged with answering such questions. The job of his agency, which is less well known than the <small>CIA</small> , is to take the military measure of America&#39;s foes. That often requires quantitative judgments: the range of an Iranian missile or <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/09/26/china-now-has-the-worlds-largest-fleet-alarming-its-pacific-rival">the size of China&#39;s fleet</a> . An annual <small>DIA</small> report, “Soviet Military Power”, was read avidly during the cold war. But intangibles are just as important. Mr Maul singles out the will to fight—and candidly acknowledges that his agency got it wrong in Iraq in 2014 and Afghanistan in 2021, where American-built armies <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/08/15/the-talibans-terrifying-triumph-in-afghanistan">crumbled almost overnight</a> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “We thought the Afghans would fight until the end of the calendar year and try to have a heroic defence of Kabul,” says Mr Maul. Instead, “they basically folded pretty quickly.” That experience, along with the evaporation of the Iraqi army in the face of the Islamic State group, led <small>DIA</small> to “over-correct” when judging how Ukraine would fare when Russia invaded last year. “We had a similar thought that they were just overwhelmed on paper.” It has proved a teachable moment. Mr Maul brandishes a 40-page “tradecraft note”, published this January, which re-examines how the agency measures a country&#39;s will to fight.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The paper emphasises how national factors—for instance, Volodymyr Zelensky&#39;s insistence on staying in Kyiv, compared with Ashraf Ghani&#39;s decision to flee Kabul—can affect the battlefield. It points to the importance of leadership on the front lines, an army&#39;s esprit de corps, the strength of its command and control, and whether it enjoys sustained logistical and medical support. Such things were neglected because of the presumption that Ukraine&#39;s leadership would be outmatched and defeated quickly. It is to guard against that sort of error that <small>DIA</small> analysts now fill out a detailed worksheet to help them think through these factors and how they can interact in unexpected ways.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This methodology is crucial when it comes to assessing the coming weeks in Ukraine. Mr Maul says that the <small>DIA</small> will be watching for signs that Russia can keep up the flow of artillery ammunition to the front lines and maintain leadership at the local level. He concedes that American and Ukrainian officials failed to appreciate the depth of Russia&#39;s defences and how difficult it would be for Ukraine to “smash through” them with armour. Ukrainian generals have told the <i>Guardian</i> newspaper that 80% of Russia&#39;s effort went into building its first and second lines. But Mr Maul cautions that the bulk of Russia&#39;s reinforcements remain at the third.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In recent weeks American officials have privately sniped at Ukrainian commanders over their military strategy—in particular the decision to deploy experienced units in the east around Bakhmut rather than on the key axis in the south. Mr Maul is more tactful. “It&#39;s open to debate whether the Ukrainians have deployed the sort of tactics that you would hope would have made more aggressive gains in a shorter time,” he offers. More important are two critical variables: Ukraine&#39;s stockpile of ammunition, vital for sustaining the artillery barrages that enable progress, and the weather, which becomes wetter in the autumn.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One Biden administration official says that Ukraine has around six to seven weeks of combat left before its offensive culminates. There are private disagreements over how much progress can be made in that time. Some reckon that Ukraine&#39;s army, having thrown in most of its reserves prior to breaking the second line, and taking heavy casualties attempting to breach it, is unlikely to get far. “If you look at the battlefield in five years&#39; time, it could look broadly similar,” says a senior American intelligence official, emphasising that the quality of both Russian and Ukrainian forces is declining over time.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Maul is somewhat less gloomy. He notes that Sergei Surovokin, the Russian general who built the defensive lines, and Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose Wagner Group mercenaries achieved Russia&#39;s most tangible gains of the past year, are both off the battlefield—the former sacked and the latter dead in a plane crash. Mr Maul, choosing his words with care, says that Ukraine&#39;s recent successes are “significant” and give its forces a “realistic possibility”—intel-speak for 40-50% probability—of breaking the remaining Russian lines by the end of the year. But he warns that limited ammunition and worsening weather will make this “very difficult”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Attention is already turning to the next fighting season. Even without a breakthrough this year, the <small>dia</small> is moderately confident that if Ukraine can widen the salient around Robotyne, hold its positions and keep ammo flowing in, it will be well placed for a fresh push in 2024. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Sep 2023 19:04:56 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/3rvvr90ov9s0ci9l1qha5grcv6u7kmqk</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/06/how-the-pentagon-assesses-ukraines-progress </item><item><title><![CDATA[Heat pumps show how hard decarbonisation will be]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>hey hang</small> off the walls of utility rooms, nestle inside kitchen cupboards and hunker down in cellars. Gas and oil boilers and furnaces have been making homes more comfortable for decades. Their adoption during the 20th century heralded the dawn of central heating and on-demand hot water and put an end to the days of shovelling coal. But if the goal of decarbonisation is to be met, these boilers must go.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Thirteen European countries plan to phase fossil fuels out of building heating, and air-source heat pumps have emerged as the best alternative. These extract ambient heat from the outside air, even when the temperature is below freezing, and concentrate it to warm inside spaces. Heat pumps are far more efficient than boilers, in terms of the amount of energy used per unit of heat generated.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Lately, however, they have become a symbol of the obstacles that await as countries try to decarbonise. Until recently, green policies had seldom required private citizens to roll up their sleeves and make big disruptive, changes to their lives. Now, they are starting to, and many people do not like it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The annoying thing about heat pumps is that you cannot simply swap a gas boiler out for a pump—at least not yet. Heat pumps are larger than gas boilers, require outside space and, for the 60% of European properties that are old and leaky, their installation must be accompanied by additional insulation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In Britain knowing whom to trust on the best green heating design for your home is hard enough to discourage all but the most determined and wealthy eco-warriors. Owners of older houses face difficult choices like lifting up all their floorboards and lining their inside walls with thick insulation, or wrapping their homes in a much thicker layer of external insulation, which may not be allowed by local planning rules. All this can quickly become costly, disruptive—and politically toxic. A plan in Germany to ban gas- and oil-boiler installations as early as next year, for instance, was abandoned after a public outcry.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">该怎么办？ Although heat pumps that are an easy swap for boilers are eventually likely to come on to the market, households cannot even then be entirely spared from disruption. The least governments can do is make adoption as easy as possible. Although grants are available in some countries, their administration is often sluggish and should be sped up. A target cannot be enforced if there are not enough skilled workers to retrofit homes; they will need to be trained. The clash between planning regulations and green rules, which makes householders feel helpless, must be resolved.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Germany&#39;s watered-down rules, which are due to be passed in parliament later this week, wisely give households more time, and also ask local authorities to be involved in their administration. They will give large and small municipalities until 2026 or 2028, respectively, to draw up transition plans, which can allow for greener heating that does not involve heat pumps. Municipalities know their local housing stock better than central governments do, and they make the planning decisions that often clash with the demands of retrofitting. They must start favouring the planet more and <small>nimby</small> s less.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This episode contains a lesson for governments. Decarbonisation on the scale required to avert planetary calamity will be painful. Voters will often object; and may sometimes sack green-friendly governments. So it is crucial that policies are designed to reduce emissions as efficiently as possible, with incentives designed wherever possible to persuade rather than coerce. Even with the best-crafted policies, however, there will be more backlashes. Governments must prepare. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Sep 2023 18:43:14 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/lt5383tct05p0rolp2o5ms2q9qjpse67</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/06/heat-pumps-show-how-hard-decarbonisation-will-be </item><item><title><![CDATA[Animals can be tracked by simply swabbing leaves]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>B</span> <small>iological fieldwork</small> can mean trips to exotic places. But the work itself can be tedious, especially when you are trying to track down elusive subjects. The most common method is to send a few eager graduate students armed with camera traps and several weeks of spare time. But perhaps not for much longer. A paper published in <i>Current Biology</i> , whose lead authors are Christina Lynggaard at the University of Copenhagen and Jan Gogarten at the Helmholtz Institute for One Health in Germany, suggests an easier method: simply swabbing nearby leaves for <small>DNA</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>DNA</small> in question is called “environmental <small>DNA</small> ” (e <small>DNA</small> for short). It refers to all the genetic information that animals shed as they go about their daily business: breathing, urinating, moving around, or interacting with their environment in any way. In recent years gene-sequencing technology has become quick and sensitive enough to pick out genetic sequences from particular animals—including humans—from this ubiquitous e <small>DNA</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One way of doing so is simply to blow air through filters, then analyse them to see which critters live in the vicinity. Aware of that technique, Drs Gogarten and Lynggaard wondered if there might be a simpler approach. Air-sampling systems can take days to do their work. Maintenance must be done, and filters must be changed. But given that e <small>DNA</small> is literally blowing around ecosystems, the researchers wondered if it might be collecting on leaves.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The leaves of many plants are waxy and somewhat sticky. The researchers theorised that e <small>DNA</small> might end up stuck to leaves and that it could subsequently be collected by swabbing them. They tested their theory in the dense rainforests of Kibale National Park, in Uganda. Using simple cotton swabs, and wearing masks and gloves to prevent contaminating the samples with their own <small>DNA</small> , they visited three areas of the park and collected eight swabs at each site, then took them back to Copenhagen for analysis.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The swabs revealed the presence of 26 birds, 24 mammals, one amphibian and one fish, with each swab containing <small>DNA</small> from eight animals on average. More than half the samples were good enough to work out the precise species they came from. The smallest (weighing just 19 grams) was the reclusive Stella wood mouse. The largest was the 3.8-tonne African elephant. The fish turned out to be a catfish that the researchers suspect was eaten by a bird, which then defecated some fishy <small>DNA</small> onto the leaves.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Swabbing for animals, then, seems to work. Moreover it is cheap, easy and fast. Graduate students will have to be content spending less time specimen-hunting in far-flung parts of the world.</p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Sep 2023 18:30:53 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/ch03knl675oqh6ruisk291i88r7l18up</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/09/06/animals-can-be-tracked-by-simply-swabbing-leaves </item><item><title><![CDATA[Plants don’t have ears. But they can still detect sound]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>I</span> <small>n 1986</small> , <small>when</small> he was a mere prince, King Charles, Britain&#39;s eco-minded monarch, told a television interviewer that it was important to talk to one&#39;s plants. He was widely mocked. But that piece of princely wisdom seems to have been ahead of its time, for there is now plenty of evidence that plants can detect sound, react to it, and even, perhaps, produce it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Scientists have been experimenting with playing sounds to plants since at least the 1960s, during which time they have been exposed to everything from Beethoven to Michael Jackson. Over the years, evidence that this sort of thing can have an effect has been growing. One paper, published in 2018, claimed that an Asian shrub known as the telegraph plant grew substantially larger leaves when exposed to 56 days of Buddhist chants—but not if it was exposed to Western pop music, or silence. <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/plants-are-adversely-affected-by-the-racket-of-urban-traffic/21807602">Another</a> , published last year, found that marigolds and sage plants exposed to the noise of traffic from a busy motorway suffered stunted growth, and produced a range of stress compounds.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Other research, much of it done in China, reports that certain frequencies, played in acoustically controlled environments like greenhouses, can affect seed germination and even boost crop yields. And plants can make noises, too, albeit not deliberately. Earlier this year a group of researchers at Tel Aviv University published an article in <i>Cell Press</i> , reporting that several species of plants emitted different noises in response to different stresses—although not at the sorts of frequencies that humans can hear.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> If all that sounds strange, perhaps it should not. After all, sound carries useful information about an organism&#39;s environment. From an evolutionary point of view, there is no reason to expect that information to be exploited only by animals.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> I&#39;m picking up bad vibrations</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Plants have been evolving alongside the insects that pollinate them and eat them for hundreds of millions of years. With that in mind, Heidi Appel, a botanist now at the University of Toledo, and Reginald Cocroft, an entomologist at the University of Missouri, wondered if plants might be sensitive to the sounds made by the animals with which they most often interact. The researchers recorded the vibrations made by certain species of caterpillar as they chewed on leaves. These vibrations are not powerful enough to produce sound waves in the air. But they are able to travel across leaves and branches, and even to neighbouring plants if their foliage touches.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The researchers then exposed Thale cress—the plant biologist&#39;s version of the laboratory mouse—to the recorded vibrations while no caterpillars were actually present. Later, they put real caterpillars on the plants to see if exposure had led them to prepare for an insect attack. The results were striking. Leaves that had been exposed had significantly higher levels of defensive chemicals like glucosinolates and anthocyanins, making them much harder for the caterpillars to eat. Leaves on control plants that had not been exposed to vibrations showed no such response. Other sorts of vibration—caused by the wind, for instance, or other insects that do not eat leaves—had no effect.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Dr Appel and Dr Cocroft published their findings in 2014. They have since been replicated many times in both cress and the tobacco plant, another common lab organism, and with a variety of caterpillars. While the vibrations created by different insects chewing on different leaves vary, the plants in question are consistently able to recognise them as a threat and defend themselves accordingly.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In 2019 the researchers took a closer look at what exactly was going on, biochemically speaking, with the plants exposed to the chewing sounds. Many of the chemicals released to cope with insect attacks turned out to be the same as those that are produced to better endure cold weather. Drs Appel and Cocroft propose that both situations activate similar signalling pathways associated with stress.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The research may have practical consequences, too. “Drones armed with speakers and the right audio files could warn crops to act when pests are detected but not yet widespread,” says Dr Cocroft. Unlike chemical pesticides, sound waves leave no toxic residue. With the help of weather forecasts, the system could even be used to prepare crops for cold snaps.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> If it makes evolutionary sense that some plants are able to eavesdrop on insects, then it would make just as much sense if others were able to “hear” a noisy resource that all plants rely upon: water. In 2017 Monica Gagliano, an ecologist at the University of Western Australia, published evidence suggesting that they can.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Dr Gagliano knew from previous work that plants&#39; roots are sensitive to even minute amounts of water in soil, and will aggressively follow moisture gradients. But seeds seemed to be able to send roots to nearby water even when the soil in the immediate vicinity was dry. Dr Gagliano hypothesised that the roots might be detecting groundwater by sound, and tested her theory on pea plants.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The plants were grown in pots with forked bases, which could be filled with either dry or damp soil. As expected, roots proved very sensitive to the presence of moisture, and readily grew towards it. Then Dr Gagliano added a twist. Some forks were surrounded by plastic pipes full of water, creating watery noises but remaining inaccessible to the roots. When the alternative was a tube full of dry soil, those noises proved just as enticing to the growing roots as water itself. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt="A pot plant with wired earphones tangled on it" width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_STD004.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_STD004.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_STD004.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_STD004.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_STD004.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_STD004.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_STD004.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_STD004.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_STD004.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_STD004.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_STD004.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_STD004.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_STD004.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_STD004.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_STD004.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_STD004.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_STD004.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Caroline Péron</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Fascinated, Dr Gagliano and her colleagues placed small speakers at the bases of some tubes and played either a recorded sound of water, white noise, or nothing. Intriguingly, the plants seemed able to tell that they were being duped. Even when the alternative was parched soil, almost all chose to grow away from the speaker. They could only be persuaded to grow towards a speaker when forced to choose between two, in which case they chose the one playing watery noises. Dr Gagliano suspects—but cannot yet prove—that the small magnets found in the speakers are responsible for such discerning behaviour. A few older papers have suggested that plants can detect magnetic fields.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Still, the findings suggest that, in the absence of soil moisture, pea plants can detect the sound of water in pipes and follow it to its source. That too could prove to be valuable information. Plant roots are a big cause of damage to sewer systems all over the world. In Germany, the annual cost of root removal and associated pipe repair is around €28m ($tktkm). The assumption had been that it was leaks that attracted the roots. Dr Gagliano&#39;s results suggest that even watertight pipes might still come under attack. The solution, she says, might be to invest in pipes that are silent as water runs through them.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> A cry for help</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> And while plants are able to detect sounds, some also produce them, albeit unintentionally. This was demonstrated in April by the team at Tel Aviv University. Lilach Hadany, the team&#39;s leader, knew that plants could sometimes be made to vibrate. This can happen when they do not have enough water. That causes air bubbles to form in the xylem, a specialised tissue that transports water from a plant&#39;s roots to its leaves. When those bubbles collapse, they transmit small shock waves into the surrounding tissues. Previous work had shown that those vibrations could be measured with devices stuck to the plants themselves. Dr Hadany wondered whether they might be audible from farther away.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> So the researchers put tomato and tobacco plants inside a microphone-lined box. Half had been watered, while half had been left parched. The researchers repeated the experiment with another set of plants, half of which had their stems cut, and half of which were left undamaged.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The microphones picked up very little sound from healthy plants. But those lacking water, or which had been cut, made a fair bit of noise, albeit at frequencies too high for humans to hear. Different stresses produced different kinds of sound. When the recordings were fed to a machine-learning algorithm, it was able to tell the sounds emitted from thirsty plants from those from the damaged ones.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> When the experiment was repeated in a noisy greenhouse, Dr Hadany found that microphones could still detect the sounds from 10cm away. Experiments on cacti, corn, grapevines and wheat produced similar results, as did tomato plants suffering from an infection of mosaic virus, a common pathogen that can damage yields.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Farmers monitor the health of their crops by eye. (Mosaic virus, for instance, is so named because of the mottled pattern produced on the leaves of suffering plants.) That can be hard to do properly over an entire field. But if plants are broadcasting auditory indicators of distress, then wiring a field with microphones might help farmers keep an ear out for trouble.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That plants live in a world full of sound is no longer in doubt. But plenty of questions remain. One is the effect of human civilisation. It is well known that the din of city life makes bird calls harder to hear, forcing the animals to sing more loudly. Since trickling water, hungry caterpillars and suffering plants are all very quiet, it seems worth investigating whether plants face similar problems. Researchers might even apply to King Charles for funding. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Sep 2023 18:29:30 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/9o7ktnroae8b59el91icr8o779ml4hjg</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/09/06/plants-dont-have-ears-but-they-can-still-detect-sound </item><item><title><![CDATA[Women are not the same as men.

The back-to-school feeling has been palpable in Brussels as thousands of Eurocrats return from the 27 member states to get the <small>EU</small> show back on the road. After much air-kissing and a few long lunches, the prospects for the months ahead are addressed, starting with European elections ahead of next year&#39;s summer holidays. Before then, the bloc will have much to keep it busy, such as how to police artificial intelligence, push ahead with plans to admit new members, or increase its budget to keep money flowing to Ukraine. On September 13th a grandiloquent “State of the Union” speech by the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will dispel any memories of beaches and sunny getaways from those who still harbour them.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> An organisational quirk dating back to the <small>EU</small> ’s earliest days is meant to help smooth the continent back into action: the rotating presidency. Every six months, a new country is put in charge of running vast swathes of the bloc&#39;s business. Spain took over the honours from Sweden on July 1st; until the end of the year its ministers and diplomats will chair most meetings of their peers. Few expect “ <small>EU</small> presidencies” (technically the presidency of the Council of the European Union, one of its three main bodies) to achieve much during the summer break. Alas, even now Spain&#39;s ability to manage the bloc&#39;s business is in doubt. Inconclusive elections in July mean all its ministers are in “acting” mode, and focused on the political imbroglio at home, not to mention their careers. Foreign-ministry types who run much of the presidency business remain in place, but lack political direction as fresh elections loom. Pedro Sánchez, the (acting) prime minister, was meant to lay out Spain&#39;s priorities as holders of the <small>EU</small> presidency to the European Parliament in July. That has been pushed back to October.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Presidencies used to be more visible until a new <small>EU</small> treaty in 2009 curtailed their reach. The biggest change was that the summit meetings of European leaders are no longer chaired by national leaders taking turns, but by a permanent “president” (the job title is used liberally in Brussels). Still, holding the mantle gives each country plenty of behind-the-scenes sway. Lots of ministerial meetings are still held in presidency countries, giving diplomats home advantage. More broadly, whoever chairs a meeting can often decide what goes on the agenda—and what gets left off. A savvy minister can discern what “consensus” emerged from a flaming row, skewing policies this way or that. A misfiring presidency can thus hold back <small>EU</small> business for months.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Denizens of the Brussels bubble have a sinking feeling that several such misfiring presidencies may now be afoot. After Spain it will be the turn of Belgium, which takes over on January 1st next year. One of the <small>EU</small> ’s founding members, it has plenty of experience of running the bloc&#39;s agenda. But it will hold the role just as its own campaign for national elections culminates on June 9th—the same date as pan-European elections. Like Spain&#39;s, its presidency risks descending into showboating by politicians. Its last presidency, in 2010, marked the start of a 541-day period when the country operated without a government. A repeat could well be likely after the polls close.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Worse is to come. In July 2024 Hungary will inherit the mantle. Few national leaders are blessed with two turns at the helm of a presidency, now separated by thirteen-and-a-half years. Unluckily for the <small>EU</small> , that includes Viktor Orban, its current <i>bête noire</i> . Expect the Hungarian leader to use his perch to liven up Brussels with barmy speeches in defence of Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine, along with plenty of culture-war trolling. The nightmare might extend into 2025, when Poland takes over. If the ruling Law and Justice party prevails at the polls next month, it will have its own feuds to feed with Brussels. More <small>EU</small> -bashing awaits.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such a run should raise the question of whether the rotating presidency is fit for purpose. Its fans think giving each country responsibility for <small>EU</small> business makes them feel a sense of ownership of the bloc&#39;s agenda. Training hundreds of officials to master every <small>EU</small> dossier deepens understanding of how the club works in national capitals. Instead of a monolithic Brussels machine setting priorities, countries can bring focus to pet causes. The Spanish presidency has played up Europe&#39;s links with Latin America, Estonia can be trusted to bang on about digital services, and so on. A programme of cultural events set by each presidency livens up Brussels—flamenco one month, a <i>moules-frites</i> festival the next.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The 13.5 year itch</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the downsides are all too obvious. Some countries are simply too small, or diplomatically under-resourced, to handle the job: who wants a meeting of fisheries bods chaired by a minister of landlocked Luxembourg? Putting new people in charge every six months is a recipe for sapping momentum. The shifting allocation of a bully pulpit makes Europe look not so much diverse as befuddled. Politicians keen to take credit for stuff—yes, they exist—rush through dossiers to show what they have “achieved”. Germany in 2020 rammed through a big investment agreement with China, unveiled on December 30th. By spring it had fizzled.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The solution is in plain sight. Finance ministers of euro-zone countries have already opted out of the rotating circus system, electing one of their own members to chair meetings for two-and-a-half years (with the job title of “president”, of course). Other forums of ministers and diplomats should follow suit. This would empty the rotating presidencies of all but their ceremonial elements. The <small>EU</small> is about to embark on a review of how it operates ahead of potentially letting lots of new members join in the coming decade. Some ideas likely to come up, such as dropping national vetoes in more areas, will prove contentious. Ending the travelling circus that is the rotating presidency should not be. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Sep 2023 17:58:12 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/piqddo46o3i56f5pod62nac94qj7d6p0</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/09/06/the-eus-rotating-presidency-should-be-scrapped</item></channel></rss>
