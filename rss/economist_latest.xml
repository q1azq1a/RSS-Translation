edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">截至去年底，对华直接投资累计存量近3.5万亿美元。但今年第三季度，发生了一些引人注目的事情。 <small>FDI</small>流量自 1998 年开始提供季度数据以来首次出现负值（见图 1）。外国投资者通过汇回利润、偿还公司内部贷款和资产出售等方式，从该国撤出的资金多于投入的资金。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这种逆转可能反映了外国对中国经济前景和政策制定的失望。尽管该国今年很可能会实现 5% 的官方增长目标，但根据<small>国际货币基金组织</small>的最新预测，以美元计算的经济增长可能会萎缩。中国政府对covid-19大流行的专横反应、对科技公司的监管打压以及对贝恩、凯盛和明茨等外国尽职调查公司的调查，令许多投资者感到不安。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">地缘政治竞争的加剧也无济于事。外国投资者在本国和东道国寻找既具有商业吸引力又具有政治吸引力的机会变得越来越困难。中国美国商会在 3 月份发布的一项对其会员的调查中发现，24% 的会员正在考虑将制造业迁出中国或已经开始这样做，而去年这一比例仅为 14%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但三季度的大幅反转或许也反映出了技术面的考量。由于美国利率居高不下，而中国利率下降，跨国公司有动力将闲置资金转移出中国，并解除向其子公司提供的任何可以用中国资金替代的贷款。研究公司凯投宏观的朱利安·埃文斯-普里查德指出：“许多公司现在可以在中国以更便宜的价格借款，而且几乎所有公司都可以通过将资金转移到海外来获得更高的财务储备回报。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">因此，利率差距和地缘政治鸿沟的结合损害了某种全球化。但它可能有助于另一种方式：接受中国的货币人民币（或“红背”，有时在国外被称为“Redback”）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">中国央行在上个月的一份报告中指出，相对于其他大型经济体，人民币借贷成本已经下降。结果，今年前 8 个月，外国公司在中国发行了价值 1060 亿元人民币（合 150 亿美元）的人民币计价“熊猫债券”，与 2022 年同期相比增长了 58%。据支付信息公司<small>Swift</small>称，9 月份人民币超越欧元，成为贸易融资中第二受欢迎的货币，占贷款的 6%。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t

发布了一份关于中国海外贷款的详尽新报告，该报告还显示了政府所有的贷款机构在向低收入和中等收入国家提供贷款时如何从美元转向“战略支点”（参见图2）。人民币新承诺份额从2013年的6%飙升至2021年的50%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其中许多贷款是中国央行向陷入债务困境的国家提供的。然后，受援国就能够使用人民币偿还中国债权人和国际货币基金组织<small>的债务</small>，保留其稀缺的美元储备以满足其他需求。 AidData报告的作者想知道，中国统治者是否看到了“一箭多雕”的机会——防止违约并同时鼓励人民币在国际上使用。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">毕竟，根据伦敦大学学院的萨利姆·巴哈吉和伦敦经济学院的里卡多·雷斯的研究，以人民币借款的国家更有可能使用人民币进行国际支付。四十个经济体现已与中国央行签署互换协议，要求中国央行暂时将人民币兑换成等值的对方货币。他们发现，签署这样的协议将使人民币在一国国际支付中的份额增加1.3个百分点。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国和欧洲对俄罗斯的制裁也给人民币带来了帮助。埃文斯-普里查德指出，事实上，中国大陆与世界其他地区一半以上的交易现在都是以本国货币结算的。在先行省份广东，这一比例更高，今年前三季度已超过54%。广东的工人从来没有让米奇抱过红鼻子。但该省至少说服了一些外国人接受红背金。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p

addiction]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>没有</span><small>任何传统是</small>神圣的——即使是“不给糖就捣蛋”。在最近的万圣节庆祝活动中，许多美国人转向“不给糖就吃树干”。孩子们不再在附近的街道上挨家挨户地挨家挨户地走来走去，而是在停车场的汽车之间穿梭，从敞开的靴子里收集糖果，靴子上布满了巨大的蜘蛛和可怕的食尸鬼。这是长期以来事实的最新证明：汽车对美国人的生活有着非常严格的控制。美国比任何其他大国都更加依赖汽车，平均每个家庭大约拥有两辆车。这反过来又与许多弊病有关：肥胖、污染、郊区扩张等等。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管存在这些恐怖，但越来越多的美国人选择住在郊区，让自己过上汽车定义的生活。人口普查数据显示，经过几十年的稳定增长，现在一半多一点的美国人口居住在“郊区”。这似乎是精英观点（汽车和郊区很糟糕）与大众偏好（人们非常喜欢它们）的典型案例。对于许多人来说，郊区的主要吸引力是较低的住房成本和更高的安全性。然而，最近的研究揭示了汽车如何成为这个方程式的重要组成部分，使美国郊区变得令人印象深刻的高效和公平。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">从方便开始。众所周知，美国城市是为汽车而设计的，这一过程始于 20 年代 T 型车。以汽车为中心的城市设计在全国占据主导地位，包括宽阔的道路、充足的高速公路通道和充足的停车位。其他国家在不同程度上复制了这一模式。然而美国已经最接近完美了。在世界银行支持下的 8 月发表的一篇论文中，一组经济学家研究了 152 个国家的道路速度。毫不奇怪，富裕国家超过贫穷国家。在富裕国家中，美国遥遥领先：其交通速度比<small>经合组织</small>俱乐部中大多数富裕国家的其他成员快约 27%。全球最快的 20 个城市中，有 19 个位于美国。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这并不是说美国的道路本身就更好。相反，速度证明了美国对郊区和郊区小城镇的热爱。与其他<small>经合组织</small>国家相比，美国城市人口少24%，面积多72%，大型道路多67%。所有这些都使驾驶员能够快速行驶。任何经历过交通拥堵的人都知道，美国人口最稠密的城市纽约是一个异类。但美国大部分郊区更类似于堪萨斯州威奇托和北卡罗来纳州格林斯伯勒，那里的司机很少遇到拥堵。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">行驶速度缩短了距离。如今城市规划者中的一个流行概念是“15分钟城市”，其目标是建设让人们步行或骑自行车在15分钟内到达工作、学校和娱乐场所的社区。许多美国人可能根本看不到这项创新的必要性，因为他们已经在 15 分钟车程的城市里生活了很长时间，也就是说，他们开车出行。对于郊区居民来说，大多数生活必需品——杂货、学校、餐馆、公园、医生等等——都只需很短的车程即可到达。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">汽车的普及还有另一个鲜为人知的好处。耶鲁大学的卢卡斯·康威尔及其同事最近进行的一项研究考察了美国和欧洲的城市地区。他们计算了“可达性区域”，定义为可以轻松到达市中心的区域。尽管欧洲城市有更好的公共交通，但美国城市总体上更容易到达。考虑距市中心 15-30 分钟路程的无障碍区域的大小。如果使用公共交通，美国的平均面积为 34 平方公里，而欧洲的平均面积为 63 平方公里。如果使用私家车，差异就更加明显：美国为 1,160 平方公里，而欧洲为 430 平方公里。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">正如进入美国市中心更容易一样，离开它们也更容易。随着时间的推移，市中心的活力逐渐减弱，人们在一天结束时逃离办公室，前往遥远的家中。然而，有一种更积极的方式来看待这一现象：正是这种交通便利性，让这个国家相当广阔的地区能够拥有更大的住宅和更安静的街道。智库布鲁金斯学会的威廉·弗雷在对 2020 年人口普查的分析中表明，多年来郊区变得更加多样化。 1990 年，大约 20% 的郊区居民是非白人。 2000 年这一比例升至 30%，2020 年升至 45%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">并不是说汽车是万能的。拥有或租用一台设备需要花费大量金钱，对于工作穷人来说是一个特别大的负担。因此，在美国城市，人们常常听到对糟糕的公共交通状况的哀叹。然而，这种普遍看法虽然普遍存在，但并不完全准确。即使道路主要是为私家车建造的，但它也是一种共享资源，可以被视为公共汽车的“轨道”。康威尔先生和他的同事在他们的研究中得出结论，美国的公共交通出人意料地有效：遥远郊区和市中心之间的公共交通选择在美国和欧洲大致相当。尽管美国可以采取更多措施来改善城市核心区的公交服务，但关键是，为汽车设计的城市也可以支持公共交通。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">电机喇叭</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">今天，有些事情正在不断变化。年轻的美国人开车越来越少。更多城市正在建设适合步行的社区。纽约可能很快就会引入拥堵费。简而言之，我们可以想象一个对汽车不那么依赖的美国。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但与此同时，covid-19 改变了人们的生活方式，这可能有利于车辆。人们冒险进入办公室的次数越来越少。这减少了公共交通的需求和收入，同时减少了道路拥堵，从而让驾驶员感到更加舒适。如果远程工作的兴起使家庭越来越深入郊区，那么汽车将变得更加不可或缺。这一切将如何摆脱？考虑到汽车在美国人生活中的根深蒂固，“不带行李箱就处理”的做法可能会继续存在。 <span

e190yofl0"><small>产业政策的倡导者</small><span>长期以来</span>一直认为制造业拥有特殊的力量。行业需求带动技术进步；它生产的产品必须通过全球市场的检验，从而提高效率。有些人则更进一步。当国家变得更加富裕时，随着企业寻求降低劳动力成本，制造业就会转移到海外。他们说，这证明关税和补贴是合理的，以保护制造业和促进增长。 “让事情变得重要”，奥伦·卡斯 (Oren Cass) 最近在《<i>华尔街日报》</i>上发表的一篇专栏文章中说道。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">问题是，近来，制造业的力量似乎已经消失。 10月26日公布的数据显示，美国第三季度<small>GDP</small>按年率计算增长4.9%。目前，近 80% 的产出由服务业构成，但鉴于其所谓的实力，人们可能预计制造业至少会发挥自己的作用。事实上，制造业劳动生产率按年率计算下降了0.2%，这意味着增长的推动力是由服务业推动的。更糟糕的是，自 2011 年以来，制造业的生产率一直在长期下降，这是现有数据十年来的首次下降（见图 1）。一些经济学家认为，这可能也是美国历史上的第一次这样的下跌。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">是什么促成了这一逆转？卡斯先生最喜欢的解释——贸易政策——可以被驳回。 2000 年代初期，美国制造业就业人数急剧下降，部分原因是中国融入全球贸易。一些人认为，引发外包热潮的“中国冲击”也降低了美国企业投资的动力，导致生产率下降。然而，直到 2011 年，生产率一直在增长。此外，随后主要是国内且不受贸易影响的子行业（包括水泥和混凝土生产）的生产率也出现下降。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">前几十年的顺利进展提供了更好的线索。在 20 世纪 90 年代和 2000 年代，制造业生产率飙升，其中计算机和电子产品（尤其是半导体芯片）的生产处于领先地位。收益似乎在 2010 年代初期，在更广泛的问题出现时达到顶峰。总而言之，自 2011 年以来制造业整体放缓的三分之一以上是由计算机和电子产品造成的。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，计算机问题并不是问题的全部。耐用制造业（包括大多数科技产品）和非耐用制造业（包括香烟和衣服等产品）的生产率都下降了。从机械到纺织，19 个制造业子行业中有 14 个行业在 2010 年代出现了下滑。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">也许所有这些计算机都没有得到很好的利用。美国可能是一个技术超级大国，但在现实世界中使用技术方面，它落后于其他国家。根据智囊团信息技术与创新基金会的数据，在每名工人使用机器人方面，中国在 15 个国家中排名第七。世界领先者韩国的人均机器人使用量是其三倍多。在对平均工资进行调整后（较富裕的国家往往更先进），美国排名第 11 位。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但与其他行业相比，2010 年代初美国制造商对技术的采用是否发生了重大变化尚不清楚。事实上，证据指向相反的方向。正如芝加哥大学的查德·西弗森 (Chad Syverson) 指出的那样，制造业资本与劳动力比率的增长实际上比整个私营部门略快。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果投资没有大幅下降，那么支付的股息一定会减少。在制造业中，容易实现的目标可能会更容易被采摘。这一观点得到了以下事实的支持：发达国家的工业生产率增长已经放缓，尽管幅度没有美国那么大（见图 2）。美国表现不佳的额外表现更难以解释。经济学家抛出了大量的假设。众所周知，美国的反垄断执法比其他国家宽松。也许制造业尤其需要审查。也许当机器人出现时，美国制造业更加先进，因此获益较少。一些人甚至认为，由于美国的软件和互联网行业利润丰厚，人才已从老行业转移。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">事情会改变吗？产业政策倡导者希望美国对芯片生产和绿色技术的补贴将带来制造业的复兴。这个想法是通过吸引企业和投资聚集到特定地区来提高生产力，就像中国深圳利用其经济特区的地位成为令人印象深刻的制造业中心一样。机器人或人工智能的突破可能会推动事情向前发展，就像 1995 年至 2004 年信息技术导致生产力激增一样。不过，目前这还只是猜测。美国制造业需要一切能得到的帮助。

e190yofl0"><span>美联储</span><small>的</small>加息给赌场带来了痛苦：内华达州人比任何其他州的人都更多地在谷歌上搜索如何归还汽车。然而，尽管他们的痛苦很剧烈，但并不是独一无二的。在美国各地，9 月份拖欠付款至少 60 天的高风险汽车借款人比例达到 6.1%，为 30 年来的最高水平（尽管仅比 2019 年高一点）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这给一个不起眼但日益重要的机构：信用合作社带来了麻烦。毕竟，在 covid-19 大流行期间借钱买车的美国人中有三分之一是从这样的组织借钱的。由于投资陷入困境以及监管机构要求更大的缓冲，该行业目前正在面临自身的流动性紧缩。美国有 4,700 多家信用合作社，为会员提供优厚的存款利率和贷款条件，并且以非营利为基础运营——这种方式在低利率时代赢得了储户的青睐。总而言之，他们现在持有的存款价值超过传统银行存款的 10%。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px"

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">为了应对当前的困难，信用合作社被迫打破其商业模式，并且比银行更缓慢地提高存款利率（见图表）。尽管他们通常受益于这样一个事实：成员往往与政府官僚机构或大学等机构有联系，都是耐心类型，但耐心现在正在受到考验。截至 7 月份的一年中，信用合作社的平均存款下降了 3.5%，这对于自 20 世纪 70 年代以来几乎持续增长的行业来说是一个不受欢迎的趋势。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管存款利率缓慢提高，但其他地方的信用合作社却表现出较少的限制。截至 7 月份的一年中，未偿还贷款增长了 12%，而且增长并未放缓。工会储蓄的五分之一用于贷款超过存款的机构，这一比例高于 2021 年初的 80%，这意味着它们需要更大的流动性来确保安全。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">事实上，监管机构正在监控该行业的流动性。今年上半年只有四个工会倒闭——与最近的趋势一致——总体资产负债表看起来很健康。然而，也存在一些令人担忧的变化。由于工会试图满足贷款需求，现金和现金等价物占资产的比例已从大流行期间达到的高点下降了一半。尽管合作社也面临更高的利率，但它们仍在承担债务：他们的借款现在相当于资产的 6%，高于过去十年的平均 3.5%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这导致信用合作社寻求其他资金来源，包括出售贷款。互助保险公司 TruStage 的史蒂夫·里克 (Steve Rick) 指出，通常情况下，他们会相互进行交易。但该行业的现状是，很少有合作社有现金购买其他人的贷款。因此，一些人转向资产支持证券市场，在这个市场中，他们可以将汽车贷款预先换成现金，同时从资产负债表上转移信用风险。不幸的是，他们只能在特别恶劣的条件下这样做。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">自 2017 年以来，信用合作社已在此类市场筹集了 28 亿美元，其中约 16 亿美元是在过去六个月筹集的。这意味着成本大幅增加，因此表明在未来几个月内会员的存款利率几乎不可能得到更好的提高。就像内华达州的车主一样，许多人最终可能只是走开。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><i>如需对经济、金融和市场重大事件进行更多专家分析，请订阅我们的每周订阅时事通讯<a

e190yofl0"><span>过去</span><small>一个月</small>，美国外交官一直在努力阻止中东分裂。自从哈马斯袭击以色列并以色列进行报复以来，他们游说耶路撒冷允许援助进入加沙，穿梭于海湾各国首都与阿拉伯领导人会面，并在安曼和开罗停留，请求以色列邻国帮助难民和伤者。美国国务卿安东尼·布林肯看上去有些疲惫。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">迄今为止，避免了地区战争。但除此之外，美国政策制定者的众多航班却没有什么可展示的，令人沮丧。很少有人逃出加沙，食品和药品供应不足，该地区国家仍然不愿讨论战争可能如何结束，特别是哈马斯之后可能会发生什么。布林肯先生于 11 月 5 日结束了对该地区的第二次访问，之后强调“所有这一切都在进行中”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">几十年来，美国的经济实力一直是其外交的基石。战争开始时，人们希望经济回报能够说服埃及接纳加沙难民，并从约旦和黎巴嫩获得更多合作。这三个国家都在金融崩溃的边缘摇摇欲坠——他们需要帮助。问题是华盛顿不再拥有补偿政府所需的工具；当然不是因为那些可能让自己的人民感到不安的事情，比如被视为通过对以色列软化或接纳难民而放弃巴勒斯坦人的事业。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">近几十年来，美国在中东的外交发生了变化。这个超级大国曾经被指责过于顽固并试图通过<small>国际货币基金组织的</small>计划来控制其他政府。从那时起，<small>国际货币基金组织的</small>救助变得更加普遍，而且附加条件也更少。美国的贷款已转化为价值数十亿美元的援助。 1991年，美国及其盟国持有埃及一半的外债；今天华盛顿却没有。战前，该国官员更喜欢谈论减贫，而不是地缘政治优惠。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国转变的背后是希望繁荣能够稳定约旦君主制和埃及独裁政权等盟友，并提高因阿富汗和伊拉克战争而受到重创的自身声誉。然而，经济增长却几乎没有实现。中东是世界上一些最陷入困境的经济体的所在地。黎巴嫩已陷入崩溃边缘：政府在 2020 年拖欠债务，且缺乏与债权人谈判所需的政治稳定性。目前通货膨胀率已超过100%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其他人的表现也好不到哪里去。约旦的失业率高于过去 25 年来的任何时候（除了 covid-19 大流行期间），并且该国依靠美国和<small>国际货币基金组织</small>的支持来避免违约。同样，自去年的外汇紧缩以来，埃及也一直在违约的边缘徘徊。由于该国拒绝解散由武装部队经营的亏损企业，国际货币基金组织在过去十年中的三起独立<small>救助</small>计划均陷入停滞。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">行军令</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这种黯淡的景象对美国来说是一个问题，不仅因为它代表了其援助政策的失败。该国曾经可以通过免除债务来换取优惠，就像 1991 年为感谢埃及卷入海湾战争而做的那样。 1994年，当约旦与以色列谈判和平条约时，侯赛因国王向比尔·克林顿总统提出的第一个要求就是免除债务。现在美国没有任何贷款可以原谅。此外，在金融动荡开始时，留在埃及和黎巴嫩的少数美国投资者和公司就收拾行李了。因此，官员们在影响商业方面也无能为力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">另一种选择是美国提供真正大量的援助，作为大交易的一方。然而，这样的一揽子计划不可避免地会在华盛顿面临可怕的政治反对。与此同时，任何通过威胁停止对埃及和约旦的援助来促成合作的尝试都是不可信的。在埃及，美国的大部分资金都花在了军队上，考虑到安全局势，玩弄游戏就显得太重要了。在约旦，更多现金直接进入政府预算，但这被广泛视为对该国收容的数十万巴勒斯坦和叙利亚难民的补偿。两国的政策制定者都认为，他们有权获得赠款，作为维持与以色列和平和控制其人民的公平报酬。 “我们接受赠款是因为它们可以保持平衡，”一位人士说道。 “[美国人]我说话就是为了知道这一点。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">黎巴嫩现在从美国获得的主要是人道主义援助，截至 6 月份的一年内达到了 9200 万美元。这些资金绕过政府金库，直接流向民众，这意味着它们提供的财务杠杆很小，而且该国政府非常脆弱，无法讨价还价。真主党是一个民兵兼社会运动，控制着该国的大片地区，拥有自己的银行，并集结了数万名军队，向以色列发射火箭弹。由于美国将该组织列为恐怖组织，官员们很难向其提供经济好处。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">由于无法诱使盟友采取良好行为，美国的金融外交官必须致力于惩罚不良行为。美国现在在全球实施的制裁数量是二十年前的十倍。自 10 月 7 日以来，其财政部已经实施了两轮限制，涵盖从伊朗国家到土耳其建筑公司的所有领域。不幸的是，加沙最紧迫的问题，例如提供人道主义援助和难民安全，无法通过制裁来解决，而且哈马斯的财政非常不透明，无法抵制美国的措施。该组织的许多金融家在土耳其找到了避风港——据报道，该国总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安在最近出访期间拒绝了布林肯的会面请求。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p

e190yofl0">它加速了阿鲁纳恰尔邦、阿萨姆邦、曼尼普尔邦、梅加拉亚邦、米佐拉姆邦、那加兰邦、锡金和特里普拉邦的基础设施项目（见地图）。它改善了与孟加拉国的关系，并试图限制中国（中国声称拥有阿鲁纳恰尔邦主权）制造麻烦的能力。这些努力似乎取得了成功——直到五月曼尼普尔邦爆发种族冲突。这导致 200 多人死亡、7 万人流离失所，国家分裂为两个民族。面对这场危机，莫迪的东北方针有何立场？</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">首先要了解这是多么令人畏惧。该地区有 5000 万人口，属于数十个民族，讲 200 多种语言，信仰多种宗教。许多人，包括数十个激进组织，都相处不好。英国殖民者和印度人早期干预的伤疤是他们冲突的根源。英国划定的国家边界使部落地区变得杂乱无章。一些社区从中央政府手中夺取的特权——这里是就业配额，那里是土地安置——激怒了他们的邻居。曼尼普尔邦的冲突就是由这样的一场竞争引发的。德里政府有时会进行残酷干预。 1966年，时任印度总理英迪拉·甘地下令对艾藻尔市（位于现在的米佐拉姆邦）进行空袭，以平息分裂主义起义。也许并不奇怪，许多东北人对印度没有什么忠诚感。其他印度人往往用怀疑的眼光看待他们。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最近几届政府试图通过缔造和平和发展来吸引该地区。然而，随着印度经济增速的加快，东北部地区与其他地区之间的差距也在扩大。该地区占<small>GDP</small>的比重从 1991 年的 3.1% 下降到 2011 年的 2.6%。莫迪先生自 2014 年上台以来一直在寻求解决这个问题。 His government speeded up infrastructure projects, improved relations with some ethnic groups and ordered administrators to make the north-east more “Indian”. The pace of road construction more than doubled during the first five years of his tenure; the total length of national highways in the region is approaching 16,000km, up from 8,500 in 2014. It has 17 civilian airports, compared with nine a decade ago. The current union budget includes 59bn rupees ($700m) for development in the north-east, twice the previous year&#39;s allocation. The region&#39;s share of <small>GDP</small> was up to 2.8% in 2022.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This has brought major improvements. The Bogibeel bridge has also given Arunachalis access to Assam&#39;s stronger economy. “For the first time we are getting tourists from mainland India,” says Komnga Karlo, a local leader in Arunachal. Meghalaya is trying to use better connections to boost ecotourism and fruit exports. “They&#39;ve done very well on infrastructure,” says Subir Bhaumik, a journalist who has reported on the north-east since the early 1980s and is otherwise no fan of Mr Modi.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Better ties with Bangladesh, long a refuge for north-eastern militants, have also helped. On November 1st Mr Modi and his Bangladeshi counterpart, Sheikh Hasina, reopened a railway link between Tripura and Bangladesh, which had been dormant for seven decades, and a connecting line to Bangladesh&#39;s Mongla port. This will improve port access for both India and Nepal.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such progress has helped the <small>BJP</small> make big political inroads in the region. The Hindu nationalists won power in Assam in 2016, ending 15 years of rule by the Congress party. They won in Manipur in 2017 and 2022, Tripura in 2018 and 2023, Arunachal Pradesh in 2019, and have joined governing coalitions in Meghalaya and Nagaland. Yet the flare-up in Manipur illustrates the limits of the <small>BJP&#39;</small> s approach.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The conflict pits the state&#39;s dominant Meitei community, which is mostly Hindu and accounts for 51% of Manipuris, against the poorer and mostly Christian Kuki minority, concentrated in the state&#39;s hilly periphery. It was sparked in May by plans to give Meiteis access to affirmative action and other measures reserved for Kukis. Yet the <small>BJP,</small> which invariably views communal relations through its Hindu-majoritarian lens, has hyped up the conflict&#39;s religious element, backing the Meiteis and casting the Kukis as criminals and insurgents. This has made a bad situation much worse.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Manipur&#39;s recent economic progress, for which the <small>BJP</small> had made great claims, has been undone. The picturesque green state has been torn between its Meitei-controlled valley and the Kuki-controlled hills, with armed police manning checkpoints in between. Nearly 5,000 houses and hundreds of temples and churches have been burned. With many fields and markets in effect inaccessible—including to the many thousands huddled in over 300 refugee camps—local agriculture is in crisis. The state&#39;s budding services economy is also at a standstill, the government having shut down the mobile internet, at least until November 13th. And the violence continues. On October 31st a police officer was shot dead near the border with Myanmar.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “The Indian state has been very confident about the development of the region, but this kind of thing can undo it quickly,” says Rakhee Bhattacharjee of the North East studies centre at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. Indeed, the crisis shows not only how fragile the region is, but how patchy are the <small>BJP</small> ’s strengths. Its economic plans are robust. But a party that rose by sowing discord between Hindus and Muslims makes a poor peacemaker.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Not a peripheral issue</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>bjp</small> also has weak state-level leaders, a flipside of Mr Modi&#39;s charismatic leadership, exemplified by its hapless chief minister in Manipur, N. Biren Singh. This is by no means, as its opponents claim, a total indictment of the government&#39;s north-eastern strategy. It has already had striking success and promises more. But it is a reminder that India&#39;s progress under Mr Modi is liable to be fraught. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 10:13:58 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/thpq1235m9v6htc7ejh0shakqvep1l95</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/11/09/can-narendra-modi-complete-indias-state-building-project </item><item><title><![CDATA[How artificial intelligence will transform fame]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>C</span> <small>omputers have</small> spent decades disrupting humdrum jobs. Now <a href="https://www.economist.com/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence ( <small>AI</small> )</a> is coming for the most glamorous ones. Hollywood has been at a standstill for half the year, until studios agreed on November 8th to offer striking stars protection from robotic rivals. Living artists were nudged down this week&#39;s music charts by a dead <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/11/02/a-new-beatles-track-is-surprisingly-soulful">Beatle</a> , resurrected by <small>AI</small> . Actors like Scarlett Johansson and authors like John Grisham are suing tech firms over the unauthorised use of their image and words.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Stars may worry that <small>AI</small> is stealing their work and giving less talented performers the skills to snatch their audience. In fact, the famous folk complaining the loudest about the new technology are the ones who stand to benefit the most. Far from diluting star power, <small>AI</small> will make the biggest celebrities bigger than ever, by allowing them to be in all markets, in all formats, at all times. Put your hands together—or insert your earplugs if you prefer—for the rise of the omnistar.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This is not the first time that technology has changed the rules of the fame game. People began to talk of stars in the 18th century, after the spread of reading made it possible to be truly famous within your lifetime. Film and radio initially seemed like a threat to stars, who worried that their live performances would be devalued. In fact, those technologies ushered in the era of the superstar, a term that caught on in the 1920s. A similar panic greeted the invention of television (and led to the last big Hollywood strike, in 1960). But again, the new tech made the famous even more so, bringing them into every living room. By the 1960s people were talking of megastars.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As <small>AI</small> -generated content floods into the entertainment business, the hardworking folk of Malibu are worrying once more that their fame will be diluted—and again, the outcome is likely to be the opposite. One of the paradoxes of the internet age is that, even as uploads to YouTube, TikTok and the like have created a vast “long tail” of user-made content, the biggest hits by the biggest artists have become even bigger. The number of musicians earning over $1,000 a year in royalties on Spotify has more than doubled in the past six years, but the number earning over $10ma year has quintupled. Even as niche content thrives—sea shanties, whistling and all kinds of eccentricities—Taylor Swift is marching through the most lucrative concert tour in history. It is the mid-ranking artists who have suffered.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Similar patterns hold across <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/09/now-ai-can-write-sing-and-act-is-it-still-possible-to-be-a-star">entertainment</a> . The number of feature films released each year has doubled in the past two decades, but the biggest blockbusters have simultaneously doubled their share of the total box office. A tide of self-published books has not eroded the sales of star writers. In a sea of choice audiences rely more on recommendations, both algorithmic and human, which funnel them towards the most popular content. <small>AI</small> promises even more choice, and thus even higher search costs for audiences, who will continue to gravitate to the handful of stars at the top.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>AI</small> will give these megastars the ability to be truly omnipresent for their fans. <small>AI</small> -powered dubbing is already allowing actors and podcasters to speak to foreign audiences instantly and in their own voice. It will soon be standard for video to be edited so that their lips match the new language, too. In-demand actors may get more work because <small>AI</small> removes the perennial Hollywood problem of crowded schedules, allowing stars to perform alongside each other while not being together at all. Digital Botox will increase actors&#39; shelf-life and even enable them to perform posthumously. Disney has acquired the rights to the voice of James Earl Jones, 92, so that Darth Vader can scare children for generations to come.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Everything, everywhere, all at once</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Stars will also be able to perform for fans in formats that are only beginning to emerge. The <small>ABBA</small> avatars that sell out a London arena seven times a week, and the celebrity-voiced chatbots recently launched by Meta, are just a taste of the ways in which the biggest stars will be able to satisfy—and monetise—their fans.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These opportunities come with strings attached. Artists are right to worry about copyright, which must be protected if <small>AI</small> is not to become a legalised form of piracy. Past technologies were no different: the printing press led to the first copyright laws in the 18th century; royalty payments were rejigged in the 1960s to compensate big-screen actors whose work was shown on <small>TV</small> ; the musical free-for-all unleashed by companies like Napster at the turn of the century eventually gave way to deals between streamers and record companies. Content creators have legitimate questions about permission and payment (we declare an interest here). Until those are answered, <small>AI</small> will be a legal Wild West.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The bigger question is how the age of the omnistar will suit audiences. The risk is boredom. <small>AI</small> is brilliant at remixing and regurgitating old material, but less good at generating the pulse-racing, spine-tingling stuff that is, for now, a human speciality. <small>AI</small> output may nonetheless appeal to film studios, record labels and other creative middlemen, who prefer to minimise risk by sticking to tried-and-tested ideas. Hollywood already favours franchises over new work: witness the rash of sequels and reboots at the box office. <small>AI</small> will let studios apply the same principle to actors. A de-aged Luke Skywalker stars in Disney&#39;s latest “Star Wars” spin-off. At present, audiences are wowed by such trickery. They may grow tired of it long before “Fast and Furious 94”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet the entertainment market is strongly self-correcting. Audiences have the power to turn a hot property into a has-been in an instant, as stars are all too aware. And even as <small>AI</small> -powered entertainment grows, consumers still seem to relish human drama. Sport, perhaps the most <small>AI-</small> proof, flesh-and-bones spectacle there is, has seen its value to media companies soar in recent years (meanwhile, no one watches computer-powered chess, though its best players could beat any human). Moreover, <small>AI</small> will make entertainment&#39;s long tail even longer, with deeper niches and more personalised content. In the <small>AI</small> age, audiences will face heavy bombardment from a handful of omnistars, from Taylor Swift to Darth Vader. But it will be easier than ever for them to change the channel. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>For subscribers only: to see how we design each week&#39;s cover, sign up to our weekly <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/cover-story">Cover Story newsletter</a> .</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 10:08:25 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/phig1p4g2174upm62qplfn648tevpik7</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/09/how-artificial-intelligence-will-transform-fame </item><item><title><![CDATA[How scary is China?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>W</span> <small>hen</small> <small>Joe Biden</small> meets Xi Jinping in San Francisco next week, the stakes will be high. Fighting in the Middle East threatens to become another theatre for great-power rivalry, with America backing Israel, and China (along with Russia) deepening links to Iran. In the South China Sea, China is harassing Philippine ships and flying its planes dangerously close to American ones. Next year will test Sino-American relations even more. In January a candidate despised by Beijing may win Taiwan&#39;s presidential election. For most of the year, the race for the White House will be a cacophony of China-bashing.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> America&#39;s anti-China fervour is partly an overcorrection for its previous complacency about the economic, military and ideological threat the autocratic giant poses. The danger from China is real, and there are many areas where Mr Biden&#39;s administration should stand up to its Communist rulers. But there is also a risk that America&#39;s view of Chinese power slides into caricature, triggering confrontations and, at worst, an avoidable conflict. Even without war, that rush would incur huge economic costs, split America from its allies and undermine the values that make it strong. Instead, America needs a sober assessment not just of China&#39;s strengths, but also of its weaknesses.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What are those weaknesses? Among the least understood are its military shortcomings, which we describe in a special report on the <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023-11-11">People&#39;s Liberation Army ( <small>pla</small> )</a> . After decades of modernisation, it is formidable—terrifying, even. With 2m personnel and an annual budget of $225bn, it has the world&#39;s biggest army and navy and a vast missile force. By 2030 it could have 1,000 nuclear warheads. Mr Xi has ordered it to be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027, say America&#39;s spies. And the <small>pla</small> projects force more widely, too. It intimidates China&#39;s neighbours in the South China Sea and skirmishes with India. It has a base in Africa and is seeking one in the Middle East.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet look more closely and the problems leap out. Drilled for decades on Soviet and then Russian military dogma, the <small>PLA</small> is trying to absorb the lessons from Ukraine and to co-ordinate “joint” operations between services, which would be key to any successful invasion of Taiwan. Recruitment is hard. Despite the efforts of films such as “Wolf Warrior” to glamorise dreary military careers with mediocre pay, the <small>pla</small> struggles to hire skilled people, from fighter pilots to engineers. It has almost no experience of combat—Mr Xi calls this “the peace disease”. Its most deadly engagement in the past four decades or so was massacring its own citizens around Tiananmen Square in 1989.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Although China has made technological leaps, from hypersonic missiles to stealth fighters, its military-industrial complex trails behind in areas such as engines for aircraft and ships, and still relies on some foreign parts. American embargoes on semiconductors and components could make it harder to catch up with the global technological frontier. Despite Mr Xi&#39;s endless purges, corruption appears to be pervasive. It may explain why General Li Shangfu was sacked as China&#39;s defence minister this year after only a few months in the job.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China&#39;s military frailties exist alongside its better-known economic ones. A property crunch and the Communist Party&#39;s growing hostility towards the private sector and foreign capital are impeding growth. China&#39;s <small>gdp</small> will increase by 5.4% this year and by only 3.5% in 2028, says the <small>imf</small> . Investment by multinational firms into China turned negative in the third quarter, for the first time since records began in 1998. China&#39;s $18trn economy is big. But despite its much larger population, its <small>gdp</small> is unlikely to exceed America&#39;s by much or at all by mid-century.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Behind China&#39;s military and economic weaknesses lies a third, and deeper problem: Mr Xi&#39;s dominance of an authoritarian system that no longer allows serious internal policy debate. Decision-making is deteriorating as a result. Economic technocrats have been sidelined by loyalists. By one estimate, <small>pla</small> troops spend a quarter of their time on political education, poring over such inspiring works as “Xi Jinping Thought on Strengthening the Military”. Mr Xi&#39;s ideology is that the party, led by him, should command all things, always.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Personalised rule is bad for China—and perilous for the world. Lacking sound advice, Mr Xi might miscalculate, as Vladimir Putin did on Ukraine. However, he may be deterred by the knowledge that if he invades Taiwan but fails to conquer it, he could lose power. One thing is clear: despite periodic and welcome bouts of constructive diplomacy, such as recently resumed ministerial contacts with America, Mr Xi&#39;s commitment to undermining liberal values globally will not diminish.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> How should America respond? Judiciously. Trying to cripple China&#39;s economy by isolating it could cut global <small>gdp</small> by 7%, reckons the <small>imf.</small> Closing America&#39;s borders to Chinese talent would count as self-sabotage. Any excessively hawkish policy risks dividing America&#39;s network of alliances. Worst of all, too rapid an American military escalation could provoke a disastrous war if Mr Xi mistakes it for the prelude to American aggression, or worries that unifying Taiwan with the mainland—peacefully or by force—will only grow harder should he continue to bide his time.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> From complacency to confrontation to calibration</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Instead, America needs to calibrate its China policy for the long run. Regarding the economy, that means openness, not isolation. <i>The Economist</i> supports limited controls on exports of technology with possible military applications, but not the broad embrace of tariffs and industrial policy that began under President Donald Trump and has continued under Mr Biden. To maintain its economic and technological edge, America should stay open for business—unlike China.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Militarily, America should seek deterrence but not domination. The Biden administration has rightly sold more arms to Taiwan, built up forces in Asia and renewed defence alliances there. But America should avoid a nuclear arms race or being seen to support formal independence for Taiwan. Dealing with China requires a realistic view of its capabilities. The good news is that its weaknesses and Mr Xi&#39;s mistakes give the West time to counter the threat it poses. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>For subscribers only: to see how we design each week&#39;s cover, sign up to our weekly <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/cover-story">Cover Story newsletter</a> .</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 09:56:58 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/udc8p3bnp3jujtabiit8tjm884v9ans2</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/09/how-scary-is-china </item><item><title><![CDATA[Now AI can write, sing and act, is it still possible to be a star?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>N</span> <small>oisy crowds</small> of beautiful people gathered outside Hollywood&#39;s film studios every weekday for the past six months, shouting slogans and marching in the sun. America&#39;s screenwriters and actors were striking, in part over fears that artificial intelligence ( <small>AI</small> ) will soon be writing scripts or even bagging roles. “You go for a job and they <i>scan</i> you,” said a background actress, who worried that her face will be used over and over in crowd scenes. The technology is “disgusting”, said another, who considered its use “an infringement of yourself, of your career”. The deal actors struck on November 8th to end their strike included protections from their artificial rivals.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Five thousand miles away another animated crowd can regularly be found chattering about <small>AI</small> , usually in gloomier weather but brighter spirits. Outside a purpose-built stadium in east London, giddy groups of all ages, some in fancy dress, gather seven times a week to watch <small>ABBA</small> Voyage, a performance in which a septuagenarian pop group plays an energetic 90-minute set via virtual avatars, generated with the help of <small>AI</small> . The show, launched in 2022, played to 1m people in its first year and still almost sells out on most nights, bringing in a reported $2ma week while <small>ABBA</small> ’s four members put their feet up.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Will <small>AI</small> leave talent impoverished, as Hollywood&#39;s protesting actors and writers fear, or further enrich them, as <small>ABBA</small> has found? It is easy to see why stars are nervous. Over the years technology has automated away many routine jobs in entertainment, but the creative work at the heart of the business has been protected. No longer. Generative <small>AI</small> is hoovering up copyrighted work and churning out remixed literature, music and video of all varieties, increasingly competing with humans in quality and already far outpacing them in quantity. In a world of infinite <small>AI</small> -generated content, is it even possible to be a star?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The talent are mobilising unions, lawyers and politicians to protect themselves. Hollywood&#39;s screenwriters, who ended their five-month strike in September, won a promise from studios to employ a minimum number of human writers on films and <small>TV</small> shows. The studios have retained the right to use <small>AI</small> to generate or polish scripts, but the <small>AI</small> will not be recognised as an author, so human writers&#39; royalties will not be diluted. Writers, for their part, have kept the right to use <small>AI</small> in their own work. (Although they dislike it, many consider <small>AI</small> “the best writing partner they&#39;ve ever had”, concedes a Hollywood agent.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The details of the actors&#39; deal with studios and streaming services had not been released as <i>The Economist</i> went to press, but the Screen Actors Guild, their union, said that it included “unprecedented provisions for consent and compensation that will protect members from the threat of <small>AI</small> ”. This is likely to mean that actors will at least be notified and paid if their likeness or voice is to be digitally reanimated.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> I sue, I sue, I sue, I sue, I sue</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The stars&#39; second line of defence is legal. A group of authors including John Grisham (of “The Firm” and dozens more thrillers) and George RR Martin (of “Game of Thrones”) have filed a class-action lawsuit against Open <small>AI</small> , the Microsoft-backed company behind Chat <small>GPT</small> , arguing that it ingested their work without permission or payment. Another complaint by parties including Universal Music Group, the world&#39;s biggest record company, accuses Anthropic, an Amazon- and Google-backed <small>AI</small> firm, of doing something similar with song lyrics. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC344.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC344.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC344.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC344.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC344.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC344.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC344.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC344.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC344.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC344.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC344.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC344.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC344.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC344.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC344.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC344.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC344.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The tech firms argue that “training” an <small>AI</small> model on copyrighted work amounts to fair use. In the words of Matthew Sag of Emory University, <small>AI</small> does not copy a book “like a scribe in a monastery” so much as learn from it like a student. Pieces of training data, whether novels or songs, usually play such a small role in the model&#39;s output as to be barely traceable. But not always. “If you say, &#39;Write in the style of Dan Brown [of “The Da Vinci Code”],&#39; of course it will pull from Dan Brown&#39;s books,” declares Mary Rasenberger, head of the Authors Guild, which represents writers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As the courts grind into action, governments are also getting involved. On October 30th Joe Biden, America&#39;s president, issued an executive order setting out basic rules for <small>AI</small> development. The <small>US</small> Copyright Office is running an inquiry into <small>AI</small> , which will close to comments later this month.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is a risk that governments will compete to create the most “permissive” regulatory environment, to attract <small>AI</small> firms, warns a music-industry insider. Others, citing past waves of tech-driven disruption, see room for compromise. When music-streaming arrived, “We got very defensive, and only defensive,” admits another senior record-company executive. It took a decade for the labels to realise that the technology was good for business, and do a deal with the streaming platforms. Negotiations with <small>AI</small> companies will take less than half that time, he predicts. “It&#39;s co-existence that&#39;s required.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> When the law is settled, who will win and lose from the technology? On the face of it, the biggest stars seem most vulnerable. <small>AI</small> helps ordinary people narrow the gap with the most gifted. Less glamorous industries have already witnessed this. In April a working paper by Erik Brynjolfsson of Stanford University and others found that novice customer-support agents were 35% more productive when given access to a chatbot, whereas experienced agents hardly benefited.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Something similar is happening in show business. Even before <small>AI</small> , tools like autotune were helping ordinary mortals to sound more like their idols. The next generation of technology promises to make such features more powerful. TikTok&#39;s parent company, ByteDance, is trialling an app called Ripple which takes any melody that users sing into their phone and turns it into a polished song. Boomy, an American startup, lets amateur composers generate original tunes with a few clicks and upload them to earn royalties on streaming platforms such as Spotify.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Frumpy actors can vie with gorgeous ones thanks to the digital facelifts of tools such as Vanity <small>AI</small> , which are used in productions like “Stranger Things” and “The Walking Dead” to make actors look prettier or scarier, as required. Dull writers can get inspiration from apps such as Sudowrite, which suggests new ideas and edits. It bills itself pithily as “the non-judgmental, always-there-to-read-one-more-draft, never-runs-out-of-ideas-even-at-3am <small>AI</small> writing partner you always wanted”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Not much <small>AI</small> -made work is good, let alone dazzling enough to compete with the stars at the top of the talent tree. But it is starting to have an impact through sheer scale. Boomy claims to have generated nearly 18m songs (for comparison, Spotify&#39;s entire catalogue is a little over 100m). Spotify now adds more than 100,000 new tracks every day, many of them <small>AI</small> -made. Sir Lucian Grainge, the head of Universal Music, has warned that real music could drown in a “sea of noise” as streaming platforms fill up with amateur tracks. Professional artists&#39; share of listening is indeed sinking. In 2017 artists signed to record labels accounted for 87% of the streams on Spotify. Last year their share was only 75%. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_FBC350.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>AI</small> struggles to make real hits, but is good at churning out the kind of music that people have on in the background while working or going to sleep. Those tracks are played for long hours and so earn big returns under the payment model used by streamers. Some in the industry suspect that the streaming platforms welcome the rise of amateur artists, who have less bargaining power than the big labels. The idea that streamers might nudge listeners towards this content is “absolutely a concern”, says another record-company executive. He thinks the only thing stopping them is the risk of annoying listeners. The streamers retort that it is hardly in their interest to promote bad music. Earlier this year Spotify purged lots of <small>AI</small> -made songs and is said to be rejigging its rules to make low-quality wallpaper music less profitable; Deezer and Tidal, two smaller rivals, have taken similar measures.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The publishing world has similar complaints. Producing entire books by <small>AI</small> is so quick and easy that, in September, Amazon banned authors from self-publishing more than three e-books a day on its Kindle platform and required publishers to clearly label books by robot writers. Most <small>AI</small> texts are full of cliché and waffle (which makes them competitive in the management genre, an agent quips). But some are taking sales away from human authors by deception: the Authors Guild has spotted a tendency for <small>AI</small> -made biographies to land just before real memoirs are published, for instance. “Click farms” have also been deployed to manipulate Amazon&#39;s rankings. The guild says that, at one point this summer, 40 of the top 100 young-adult romance books on Kindle were <small>AI</small> -written.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The winner makes it all</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet far from sinking in this sea of <small>AI</small> -made entertainment, the biggest stars of all seem to be more buoyant than ever. As record labels worry about robot composers, Taylor Swift is halfway through what will probably be the highest-earning concert tour in history, with projected sales of $1.4bn or more (no previous tour has breached $1bn). An accompanying film has made an additional $230m at the box office. Colleen Hoover, a writer of romantic young-adult fiction, crushed the robot writers last year to bag eight places on the top-25 bestseller list in America, selling 14m copies, according to <i>Publishers Weekly</i> , a trade title.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One of the paradoxes of the internet age is that, amid an explosion in online content on platforms from YouTube to TikTok, fans have flocked as never before to the biggest acts. It has been a good time to be an amateur creator, but an even better time to be a superstar. Data from Spotify show that between 2017 and 2022, as the platform was flooded with tens of millions of amateur tracks, the number of artists making at least $1,000 a year in royalties increased by 155%. At the same time, the number making $5m or more increased by 165%, and the handful of headliners making $10m or more increased by 425% (see chart 1 on previous page). Those who have done least well are middling-to-big artists, who face more competition from entertainment&#39;s long tail but have been unable to break into the elite group at the top.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Similar patterns can be seen across the entertainment world. Better and cheaper technology has democratised filmmaking. The number of movies released each year in America more than doubled during the first two decades of the 21st century, but the audience-share of the biggest blockbusters has grown, not shrunk. In 2019 (the last year before the pandemic) America&#39;s five biggest films took a quarter of the domestic box office, nearly double the share they took in the less crowded market of 2000 (see chart 2). Meanwhile, the ten bestselling authors have accounted for a steady 2-3% of book sales in Britain over the past decade, according to Nielsen, a data company, even though 2m more books are self-published each year.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Lay all your likes on me</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Hits will persist in an infinite-content world,” argues Doug Shapiro, a former media executive. The bewildering variety makes it hard for consumers to pick, so they rely more on recommendations, whether from friends or algorithms. Rather than browse, people seek out what they have already heard of, says Ms Rasenberger of the Authors Guild. “Known writers are selling. And everyone else is having a much harder time.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>AI</small> also helps superstars shine brighter by creating opportunities for their admirers to become superfans. Followers of a music act used to express themselves chiefly through “records, <small>T</small> -shirts and mix-tapes”, says an industry executive. Now the internet offers “mix-tapes on steroids”. Fans can duet with their idols or dance to their music on social media. Games like “Fortnite” have provided a venue for interactive experiences: Ariana Grande held a concert-game hybrid on the platform in 2021, attracting 27m participants.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>AI</small> -powered technology promises to allow the biggest stars to be in even more places, gratifying even more fans. The producers of <small>ABBA</small> Voyage are in talks to bring the show to cities in North America, South-East Asia and Australasia, according to Per Sundin, head of Pophouse, a Swedish entertainment company that is the biggest investor in the enterprise. Other artists have been in touch, looking to “cement and elevate their legacies” with similar shows, he says. “We now have a proven template.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Stars do not need to build their own arena like <small>ABBA</small> to use <small>ai</small> to be in more places at once. Spotify is working with Open <small>AI</small> to translate podcasts into different languages, allowing broadcasters to be heard in more markets, in their own voice. Other firms such as HeyGen provide dubbing services for video, using <small>AI</small> to change the movement of the actor&#39;s lips to match what they are saying. HeyGen recently created a viral video of Ms Swift appearing to speak fluent Chinese. Such platforms can adapt content in other ways, too, for instance by toning down strong language for a broader audience. Technology like this will allow stars to reach more viewers—and presents a problem to the lowlier actors who specialise in dubbing.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Stars are also using <small>ai</small> to travel in time. John Lennon re-entered the charts on November 2nd with “Now and Then”, old recordings of his voice having been salvaged using <small>AI</small> . (“I hope someone does this to all my crap demos after I&#39;m dead—make them into hit songs,” said his late fellow Beatle, George Harrison, of an earlier attempt to resurrect Lennon&#39;s work.) James Earl Jones, who is 92 and first voiced Darth Vader almost 50 years ago, has sold Disney the right to replicate his gravelly tones artificially. A virtual Darth appeared in Disney&#39;s “Obi-Wan Kenobi” last year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some artists are experimenting with licensing their voice or image more widely. In April Grimes, a Canadian singer, invited amateur composers to clone her voice for use in their songs, provided they share any royalties with her. In September Meta launched 28 chatbot characters, played by celebrities. Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton and Charlie D&#39;Amelio are among the <small>B</small> -listers to be botified, with one reportedly being paid $5m over two years. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta&#39;s boss, invites stars to “build an <small>AI</small> version of yourself…to help people fulfil this desire to interact with you and your desire to build a community.” </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20221111_FBD003.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20221111_FBD003.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20221111_FBD003.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20221111_FBD003.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20221111_FBD003.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20221111_FBD003.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20221111_FBD003.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20221111_FBD003.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20221111_FBD003.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20221111_FBD003.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20221111_FBD003.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20221111_FBD003.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20221111_FBD003.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20221111_FBD003.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20221111_FBD003.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20221111_FBD003.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20221111_FBD003.jpg"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: Simon Bailley / Sepia</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>A</small> -listers remain wary: “Their voice is their career,” says a record executive. But even if they do not license their voice or likeness, others may still borrow them. A company called Socialdraft sells $5 “prompts” to make chatbots take on the personality of celebrities ranging from Tom Cruise to Josef Stalin, who do not appear to have given their permission. It is named in a legal complaint by a group of authors including Mr Grisham, whom it also impersonates. (Socialdraft denies wrongdoing. Antonio Evans, its chief executive, says, “The interplay between <small>AI</small> , copyright and individual rights is a thrilling narrative we are all part of.”)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some unauthorised clones have become hits. In April an anonymous amateur composer released a song called “Heart On My Sleeve”, using the <small>AI</small> -replicated voices of two rappers, Drake and The Weeknd. The song was streamed 20m times before Universal, which represents the two artists, demanded it be taken down.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The track caused alarm, but it also demonstrated how cloning can work in artists&#39; favour. Analysis by Will Page, author of “Pivot” and a former chief economist at Spotify, suggests that being cloned can help stars sell genuine music. He calculates that after David Guetta, a French <small>DJ</small> , posted a clip of an <small>AI</small> -generated rap in the style of Eminem in February, streams of real Eminem tracks rose by about a fifth.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet antipathy to <small>AI</small> remains fierce. A group of actors, writers and directors has set up an outfit called Credo23 to certify films and <small>TV</small> shows made without <small>AI</small> (it has yet to take off). Many singers, burned by digital piracy in the past, are also hostile. Sir Cliff Richard, an 83-year-old crooner, recently declared that his singing “didn&#39;t use artificial insemination”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Others fear that <small>AI</small> will simply make entertainment derivative and boring. Three-quarters of Americans tell YouGov, a pollster, that they worry <small>AI</small> will sap human creativity. The process of ingesting everything and then spitting out an average may lead to a stylistic and conceptual regression to the mean, says a literary agent, who sees similarities with the algorithms on social media that help propagate the most pedestrian views. Sir Lucian, at Universal, has said that <small>AI</small> “will always lack the essential spark that drives the most talented artists to do their best work, which is intention”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Everything depends on whether audiences embrace artificial performances. “Is the next generation of moviegoers going to want to see a different actor in James Bond, as an example? Or are they going to want to see Sean Connery come back?” asks a Hollywood agent. <small>AI</small> -generated performances may prove to be most successful for the biggest stars, whose uncritical superfans cannot get enough of them. As Liam Gallagher, a former Oasis frontman and John Lennon devotee, replied when asked on social media what he thought of the remastered “Now and Then”: “The Beatles could shit in my hand bag I&#39;d still hide my polo mints in there.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 09:56:28 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/eoqrkuic0pt1gnnakeumo1cgj5dodaid</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/09/now-ai-can-write-sing-and-act-is-it-still-possible-to-be-a-star </item><item><title><![CDATA[India is in the midst of an unusual IPO boom]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>I</span> <small>nvestors looking</small> to cash in on India&#39;s growth have typically focused their attention either on the sprawling conglomerates run by the country&#39;s tycoons or the buzzy tech firms transforming the way Indians shop, learn or move around. How, then, to explain the excitement over Cello World, a 61-year-old company of middling size that listed its shares on the two local bourses on November 6th? It produces the “tiffin” boxes Indians use to carry their lunch to school or work, along with inexpensive pens and moulded furniture—hardly exciting stuff. Yet on the first day of trading its shares soared by 29%, sending its market value above $2bn. That is nearly 60 times the net profit it made in the last fiscal year. Its initial public offering ( <small>IPO</small> ) was roughly 40 times oversubscribed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Cello World does not have bold plans for reinvesting the $230m raised in the offering; all of it will go back to the family that controls the firm, which still owns 81% of the equity. Nor is the business unique. At the end of last month another company making pens, Flair Writing Industries, received approval for its <small>IPO</small> . Several furniture companies are lined up to offer shares in the near future, too. Cello World is, in short, rather boring.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Few venture capitalists would line up for a stake in such a business. Foreign portfolio managers, many of whom have settled on a strategy of entering India through slivers of holdings in the country&#39;s mightiest conglomerates, would probably pass it over, too. Recent months, however, have shown that one of the most appealing corners of the Indian economy may be the companies like Cello World, which are benefiting from the country&#39;s growth story without trying to write it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Beginning late last year, valuations in India&#39;s private markets collapsed as investors lost patience with loss-making startups such as <small>OYO,</small> a hotel chain, and Byju&#39;s, an online-learning business. Public markets sagged, too. Shares in Delhivery, a logistics startup that listed to much fanfare early in 2022, tumbled. In January this year a report by Hindenburg, a short-seller, into the accounting practices of the business empire of Gautam Adani, an Indian tycoon, rocked the confidence of foreign investors and brought attention to the anaemic profitability of a number of the country&#39;s conglomerates. (The Adani Group denied any wrongdoing.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The first hint of a shift in mood came in April with the listing of Mankind Pharma, a manufacturer of condoms and pregnancy tests. The firm lured investors with its steady revenue growth, from roughly $750m in 2020 to $1bn in 2022, and healthy profits. It quickly became apparent that attractive opportunities abounded in ordinary areas of an economy experiencing extraordinary growth. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_WBC335.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_WBC335.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_WBC335.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_WBC335.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_WBC335.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_WBC335.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_WBC335.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_WBC335.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_WBC335.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_WBC335.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_WBC335.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_WBC335.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_WBC335.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_WBC335.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_WBC335.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_WBC335.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231111_WBC335.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A flood of listings followed. As of early November, 194 companies had gone public this year, up from 144 for all of 2022 (see chart). Jefferies, an investment bank, calculates that 72% of recent Indian <small>IPO</small> s have been at least ten times oversubscribed. Alongside consumer-goods companies like Cello World and Mankind Pharma, investors also snapped up the shares of newly listed companies in other usually uninspiring industries, such as construction, chemicals, steel and electrical components. Though not at the technological frontier, many of these firms are benefiting from the Indian government&#39;s efforts to bolster the domestic manufacturing sector (at China&#39;s expense) and improve the country&#39;s infrastructure. RR Kabel, a maker of cables that listed in September, is one such firm. On November 6th it reported that profits in its quarter from July to September had doubled year on year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The listings boom shows no signs of slowing down. A further 29 applications for public offerings have been approved by India&#39;s securities regulator, and an additional 46 are currently under consideration. Among the companies in the process of offering shares are a producer of sledgehammers and a maker of car parts. All hope to go public before India&#39;s general elections next May. Nipun Goel of <small>IIFL</small> Securities, an investment bank that helped finance many of this year&#39;s listings, notes that the pipeline of <small>IPO</small> s for the next 12 to 24 months is looking strong; he is betting that the boom could continue for five to seven years. Indeed in October, in anticipation of all this, his firm moved to new offices with three times the space. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><i>要掌握商业和技术领域最重大的新闻，请订阅我们的每周订阅者<a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-bottom-line">简讯“底线”</a> 。</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 09:09:47 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/a43avvni1f4je9n0gh30l6ri50ddi3lv</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/09/india-is-in-the-midst-of-an-unusual-ipo-boom</item></channel></rss>
