e190yofl0"><span>不久前</span>，随着富裕国家的利率徘徊在接近于零的<small>水平</small>，经济学家们争论其下行趋势是否是数十年、数百年或数千年趋势的产物。现在最紧迫的问题是它们将保持高位多久。 10月18日，包含长期利率预期、2021年时还低于1%的十年期国债收益率触及4.9%，为2007年以来的最高水平。当天，30年期国债收益率突破5% 。美国银行分析师上个月宣布利率“正脱离 5000 年来的低点”时，听起来可能有点喘不过气来。但这确实是经济学家、投资者和任何在偿还债务时处于不舒服境地的人的感受，因为几乎每个人都预计利率将永远处于低位。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608"

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">利率将“在更长时间内保持较高水平”的信念正在全世界蔓延。 2021年欧元区出现负利率；现在德国必须支付近3%的利率才能借贷十年。英国的债券收益率几乎与美国一样高。即使是日本，其明显的永久性低利率被视为世界其他地区的先兆，也面临着债券收益率的上行压力（见图1）。人们越来越多地押注中国央行将不得不在 2024 年加息，这是自 2007 年以来的首次。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果市场是正确的，一个新时代就会开始，其后果将是深远的。家庭和公司将不得不支付更多费用才能借贷。金融体系将不得不适应痛苦的新现实。政府将发现他们必须转移更多的税收收入来支付累积债务的利息。许多投资者现在预测的长期走高的情况是一个潜在的有毒组合。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">从实体经济入手。过去一年的令人惊讶的事情之一是世界经济（尤其是美国经济）面对利率上升的弹性。 10月26日消息，美国第三季度<small>GDP</small>年化增长率为4.9%。由于covid-19大流行的封锁和刺激支付，家庭积累的超额储蓄支撑了消费者支出。许多公司在利率较低时发行了长期债务，因此如今仍然享有较低的融资成本。美国公司今年的净利息支付实际上有所下降，因为他们手头现金赚取的利息增长速度快于偿债成本。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这些保护性缓冲将持续一段时间。 9月份，统计人员上调了对疫情期间积累的储蓄的估计，此前这些储蓄看起来正处于耗尽的边缘。现在看来，美国家庭仍然持有约 1 万美元的多余现金，相当于个人年总收入的近 5%。更高的利率也需要时间来减缓企业的发展速度。高盛银行估计，只有 16% 的美国企业债务将在未来几年内到期。再融资将使债务总额的平均利率从今年的 4.2% 提高到 2025 年的 4.5%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，并非所有公司都能适应更高的利率。尽管经济蓬勃发展，美国规模较小的企业的债务通常比大企业更早到期，但它们仍面临压力。在该地区和欧洲，经济增长疲软，企业破产数量不断增加（见图 2）。在一些经济体中，企业更容易受到利率上升的影响：截至 2021 年底，西班牙和意大利企业债务的中位期限分别仅为 2.6 年和 2.1 年。在瑞典，公司债务占<small>GDP</small>的比例高达 155%，令人瞠目结舌，截至 3 月份的一年里，公司未偿还银行贷款的平均实际利率从 1.5% 上升至 3.9%，而且目前还会更高。 9月份企业破产数量比去年同期增加14%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果利率达到永久较高的水平，即使是长期债务最终也会开始让企业付出高昂的代价。这将是痛苦的，因为在 2010 年代，企业大量借贷：美国的非金融企业在这十年间发行了净 4.1 万亿美元的债务，同时通过股息和回购收回了净 3.2 万亿美元的股本。根据<small>国际货币基金组织</small>的数据，在整个发达经济体中，企业债务约占<small>GDP</small>的 93%，而 2000 年代中期这一比例还不到 80%。如果利率在较长时间内保持较高水平，这种借贷热潮可能需要停止。因此，长期去杠杆化可能会抑制 2020 年代的投资，就像低增长抑制 2010 年代的投资一样。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">家就是受伤的地方</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">家庭最终也会发现更高的利率会产生影响。在美国和一些欧洲国家，抵押贷款利率可以固定数十年，这样只要借款人不搬家，就可以免受利率上涨的影响。但房价可能会下跌，因为它们主要依赖于重新借贷的买家，因此面临更高的成本。 10月18日，数据提供商《抵押贷款新闻日报》报道称，美国30年期固定利率抵押贷款平均利率自2000年以来首次达到8%。因此，购买美国房产所需的月付款中位数抵押贷款占房产价值 90% 的房屋现在占平均收入的近 60%，高于 2021 年 7 月的 33%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">房地产市场能够维持这样的比率令人难以置信。根据国际清算银行的数据，从 2022 年初到 2023 年第二季度，12 个发达经济体的实际房价下跌了 10%。如果利率遵循市场暗示的路径，实际房价预计将再下跌 14%。到2025年底。在利率稳定在略高于当前水平的情况下，实际房价从峰谷到谷底的跌幅将达到35%。相比之下，全球金融危机导致的下降为13%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">接下来，考虑提高利率对金融部门的影响。交易员经常开玩笑说，利率会上升，直到出现问题。 2023 年春天，有件事发生了：银行。他们拥有大量政府债券，这些债券随着利率上升而贬值。十年期国债收益率从 2021 年底的 1.5% 跃升至一年后的 3.5% 左右，导致国债广泛指数的价值下跌约 10%。这给美国银行造成了超过 6000 亿美元的损失，其中最脆弱的——硅谷银行和第一共和银行——遭遇挤兑并倒闭。美联储最终以美国国债的面值而非市场价值向银行提供贷款，缓解了银行资产负债表的压力，从而避免了这场危机。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但在一个更高、更长久的世界里，危机可能会卷土重来。美联储新贷款计划下的最后一笔贷款将于三月份发放。即使延长期限，银行也可能发现自己无力支付美联储贷款的利息（与现行的短期利率类似，因此一直在稳步上升）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">当利率上升时，不仅仅是国债的市值下降。任何在中长期期限内支付固定回报的贷款或多或少都会遵循相同的模式。 Erica Jiang、Gregor Matvos、Tomasz Piskorski 和 Amit Seru 等经济学家进行了一项分析，按照 3 月份的市场价格对美国银行的所有资产进行了估值，然后进行测试，看看如果它们的一半或全部资产被没有保险的储户提取了他们的储蓄。他们发现，即使在不那么灾难性的情况下，约有 200 家左右的银行（总资产达 3000 亿美元）也可能资不抵债。另两位经济学家马克·弗兰纳里 (Mark Flannery) 和索林·索雷斯库 (Sorin Sorescu) 撰写的另一篇论文得出结论：“如果所有未入账损失都充分反映在银行资产负债表中，那么大约一半的银行（持有大约一半的银行资产）将无法满足最低监管资本要求要求。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">自3月份以来，债券指数又下跌了5%。蒋女士和她的合著者重复了他们的分析。他们发现，未实现损失略有上升，但现在主要集中在较大的银行。 3 月份，这些损失为 2.2 万亿美元，其中只有约 30% 发生在被监管机构标记为“具有系统重要性”的银行。现在有 2.5万亿美元的未实现损失，其中约三分之二是在此类银行。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">金融脆弱性还有其他来源。商业地产贷款约占银行资产的十分之一，而由于利率上升和入住率下降，办公楼的价值已经暴跌。一些业主只是将钥匙交给贷方。更重要的是，近年来，大量贷款已从银行转移到其他类型的金融机构，例如养老基金和保险公司。作为大型银行，他们之前从未经历过利率上升的周期。尽管分散风险原则上是有帮助的，但这也意味着更多的公司面临潜在的损失。 </p><div

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最后，考虑政府的脆弱性。全球金融危机后，富裕国家的公共债务飙升至 1946 年以来的最高水平。自疫情大流行以来，相对于<small>GDP 的债务</small>规模比拿破仑战争以来的任何时候都要高（见图 3）。这些巨额债务的可持续性不仅取决于利率，还取决于这些利率与经济增长的比较。在低利率时代，人们流行这样一种观点：如果<small>GDP 的</small>增长速度快于利息的增长速度，那么政府的债务与<small>GDP 的</small>比率可能会下降，即使它重新借贷来支付利息。它甚至可以继续借入更多资金来为额外支出提供资金，同时保持债务与<small>国内生产总值的</small>比率稳定。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 10月，<small>国际货币基金组织</small>预测，尽管最近利率有所上升，但2023年至2028年期间，发达经济体的经济增长率将继续超过其政府为其债务支付的利率，平均高出1.4个百分点。原因是政府和企业一样，通过发行长期债务在一定程度上锁定了低利率。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，无论如何，债务与<small>国内生产总值的</small>比率大多会上升，因为许多政府继续存在过度赤字。美国尤其放肆借贷：据智库负责任联邦预算委员会称，剔除会计扭曲，去年美国赤字占<small>GDP</small>的7.5%。如此高的赤字通常只在战争或灾难性衰退期间才会出现。根据<small>国际货币基金组织</small>的预测<i>，《经济学人》</i>计算了发达经济体为保持债务稳定所需进行的财政调整。除德国和日本外，每个大型发达经济体都需要勒紧裤腰带，以阻止债务与<small>GDP</small>之比进一步上升。美国必须将其基本预算赤字（即不包括债务利息的赤字）每年削减<small>GDP</small>的 2.4%。考虑到应对人口老龄化、气候危机和不断加剧的地缘政治紧张局势所需的额外支出，这种节俭的做法尤其困难——<small>国际货币基金组织</small>估计，所有这些问题的年度支出将占富裕国家<small>GDP</small>的 7.5% 左右。国家。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">更重要的是，在一个更高、更长期的世界里，政府和公司一样，最终必须进行再融资。目前，十年期国债收益率高于大多数富裕经济体长期增长的合理估计。这意味着可能需要更多地勒紧裤腰带来阻止债务上升。很难回避这样的结论：根据目前的增长预测，长期较高的增长将迫使各国政府陷入另一轮痛苦的预算平衡，就像欧洲在 2010 年代所经历的那样。如果金融业的动荡引发昂贵的救助，财政前景将变得更加黯淡。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">总有应对的办法</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">世界经济能否应对企业去杠杆化、房价下跌、银行动荡和财政节俭等问题？令人惊讶的是，答案或许是——如果利率上涨的原因正确的话。经济学家通常认为，从长期来看，利率是由世界储蓄意愿和投资意愿之间的平衡决定的。在其他条件相同的情况下，更多的储蓄会降低所谓的“自然”利率；更多的投资会推高它。对于2010年代的最低利率，最流行的解释是人口老龄化为退休储蓄了更多的钱，而长期增长前景平淡削弱了企业扩张的欲望——这种现象有时被称为“长期停滞”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">为了使利率永久改变，这种前景必须改变。其可能的原因之一是对经济更快增长的预期，这或许是由人工智能 ( <small>ai</small> ) 的最新进展推动的。从长远来看，增长和利率密切相关。当人们的收入随着时间的推移而增加时，他们的储蓄需求就会减少。公司期望更高的销售额，因此更加热衷于投资。央行必须保持较高的利率以防止经济过热。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">说对<small>人工智能的</small>乐观情绪正在推高债券收益率似乎有些牵强。但这可以解释为什么长期走高的前景并未导致股市大幅下跌。从理论上讲，较高的债券收益率应该会降低公司未来收益的价值，这对科技公司的影响最为严重，因为它们往往会承诺明天会出现堵塞。事实上，随着对<small>人工智能</small>的乐观情绪蔓延，微软和英伟达等大型科技公司的价值已经飙升。尽管债券收益率（<small>以及</small>用于贴现未来利润的利率）现在要高得多，但它们不断上涨的价值使<small>标准普尔</small>500 指数的周期性调整市盈率保持在大流行前的水平左右。美国第三季度的强劲增长并不是由异常的就业繁荣推动的；而是由非同寻常的就业繁荣推动的。事实上，劳动力市场正在降温。如果增长数字准确，那么生产率一定有所提高。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608"

e190yofl0">从生产力增长解释更高利率的角度来看，新时代可能是一个幸福的时代。随着偿债成本的上升，家庭的实际收入将增加，企业的收入将增加，金融机构的违约率将降低，政府将征收更多的税收。资本的良性竞争甚至可能带来其本身的好处。一些经济学家长期以来怀疑2010年代的低利率时代导致经济活力减弱。 “对于效率相对低下的公司来说，维持生存很容易，因此没有太多的创造性破坏，”<small>麻省理工学院</small>的克里斯汀·福布斯说。在一个以更快增长为基础的高利率世界中，将会有充足的活力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">可惜的是，利率上升还有一个更令人担忧的解释：政府债务增长如此之大，以至于吸干了世界剩余储蓄，让私营部门争夺残羹剩饭。短期来看，许多交易员将债券收益率上升归咎于大流行以来的大量债务发行以及央行大规模债券购买的取消。经济学家经常对现有债券易手的重要性嗤之以鼻，但他们确实认为未偿债务存量的规模很重要。哈佛大学的拉里·萨默斯 (Larry Summers) 和时任英格兰银行的卢卡斯·雷切尔 (Lukasz Rachel) 在 2019 年提出的一条经验法则是，从长远来看，债务与<small>GDP</small>之比增加 10 个百分点将使利率提高 0.35 个百分点，而赤字每增加一个百分点，利率就会提高类似的幅度。这意味着挥霍无度的政府造成了今天的高利率。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果政府债务是“长期走高”的罪魁祸首，那么世界经济将不得不应对利率上升，但增长却没有任何相应的刺激。那会很痛苦。彼得森国际经济研究所的莫里斯·奥布斯特菲尔德表示：“你不能真正认为赤字会继续推高利率，而且会继续不受抑制。”有点债务危机。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">除了财政危机，紧张局势还能如何化解？一种可能性是，持续的高通胀可能会侵蚀政府债务的实际价值，就像过去经济危机之后的情况一样。在这种情况下，尽管名义利率可能会在较长时间内保持较高水平，但实际利率不会上升那么多。公司和政府将在高利率下生存，因为他们的现金收入将很强劲。相对于他们今天预期的高实际收益率，债券持有人将受到挤压。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">另一种可能性是，高利率导致世界经济陷入衰退，进而导致央行降息。根据这一论点，10 月 23 日，潘兴广场资本 (Pershing Square Capital) 的比尔·阿克曼 (Bill Ackman) 宣布，他的基金不再押注利率将持续上升，从而压低国债价值。他写道：“世界上存在太多风险，无法以目前的长期利率继续做空债券。” “经济放缓速度比最近数据显示的要快。”如果他是对的，更高的水平可能不会持续太久。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 09:59:34 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

world economy is defying gravity. That cannot last]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>尽管</span><small>战争</small>愈演愈烈、地缘政治气候愈发黯淡，但世界经济仍是令人难以抑制的欢呼之源。仅在一年前，所有人都同意高利率将很快导致经济衰退。现在，连乐观主义者也感到困惑了。美国经济第三季度强劲增长，年化增长率高达 4.9%，令人惊叹。在世界各地，通货膨胀正在下降，失业率大多保持在低水平，大型央行可能已经停止了货币紧缩。遭受房地产危机打击的中国看起来可能会受益于适度的刺激措施。然而不幸的是，这种美好的欢呼并不能持续下去。今天的增长基础看起来不稳定。放眼望去，威胁比比皆是。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">不可抑制的经济鼓励人们押注利率虽然不再快速上升，但也不会大幅下降。过去一周，欧洲央行和美联储维持利率稳定；在我们于 11 月 2 日发布此消息后不久，预计英格兰银行也会效仿。长期债券收益率相应大幅上升。美国政府现在必须支付 5% 的利率才能借款 30 年，而在大流行性衰退最严重时，利率仅为 1.2%。即使以低利率闻名的经济体也出现了大幅增长。不久前，德国的借贷成本为负；目前其十年期债券收益率接近3%。日本央行<a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/02/how-japan-poses-a-threat-to-the-global-financial-system">几乎放弃了</a>将十年期借贷成本固定在 1% 的承诺。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">包括美国财政部长珍妮特·耶伦在内的一些人表示，利率上升是一件好事——反映了世界经济的健康状况。事实上，它们是危险的来源。由于较高的利率可能会持续下去，今天的经济政策将会失败，它们所促进的增长也将会失败。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">要了解为什么今天的良性状况无法持续下去，请考虑一下为什么美国经济尤其是表现好于预期的一个原因。其消费者一直在花费他们在大流行期间通过施舍和呆在家里积累的现金。预计这些超额储蓄现在已经耗尽。但最近的数据显示，家庭仍剩下 1 万亿美元，这解释了为什么他们可以从收入中节省的储蓄比 2010 年代的任何时候都少。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">当这些过剩的储蓄缓冲被耗尽时，高利率将开始产生影响，迫使消费者减少支出。而且，正如我们的简报所<a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/02/markets-think-interest-rates-could-stay-high-for-a-decade-or-more">解释的</a>那样，如果利率长期保持较高水平，世界经济将开始出现问题。在欧洲和美国，企业破产率已经上升。即使是通过发行长期债务锁定低利率的公司，最终也将不得不面临更高的融资成本。房价将会下跌，至少在经过通胀调整后的情况下，因为抵押贷款价格上涨，房价将会下跌。持有长期证券的银行（这些证券得到了包括美联储在内的短期贷款的支持）将不得不筹集资金或进行合并，以填补因利率上升而造成的资产负债表漏洞。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">财政慷慨加剧了世界经济的“糖热”。在一个更高、更长久的世界里，它看起来也是不可持续的。根据国际货币基金组织<small>的数据</small>，到 2023 年，英国、法国、意大利和日本的赤字都可能达到<small>GDP</small>的 5% 左右。截至 9 月份的 12 个月内，美国的赤字达到惊人的 2 万亿美元，调整后占<small>GDP</small>的 7.5%会计扭曲——大约是 2022 年中期预期的两倍。在失业率较低的时期，这种借贷行为的鲁莽程度令人瞠目结舌。总而言之，发达国家的政府债务占国内<small>生产总值</small>的比例现在比拿破仑战争之后的任何时候都要高。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">当利率较低时，即使巨额债务也是可控的。现在利率上升，利息支出正在耗尽预算。因此，长期走高可能会让政府与通胀目标制央行行长对立。耶伦女士已经觉得有必要辩称，美国国债没有风险溢价，而美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔则坚称，美联储永远不会通过降息和让通胀飙升来缓解政府预算的压力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">无论鲍威尔说什么，长期走高的时代都会导致投资者质疑政府保持低通胀和偿还债务的承诺。<small>欧洲央行</small>持有的债券已经开始偏向其默认支持的意大利政府债务——在高利率的世界里，这项任务变得更加困难。即使去年日本政府债券收益率仅为 0.8%，日本预算的 8% 仍用于支付利息。想象一下，如果收益率达到德国相对较低的水平，将会面临怎样的压力。一些政府将因此继续勒紧裤腰带。但这样做可能会带来经济痛苦。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这些压力让人很难想象世界经济如何能够同时实现市场目前所期望的许多目标：避免衰退、低通胀、巨额债务和高利率。更有可能的是，长期较高的时代会导致经济疲软，让央行官员在通胀不飙升的情况下降息，从而自取灭亡。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">更有希望的可能性是，生产率的大幅增长，或许要归功于生成式人工智能（ <small>AI</small> ）。由此带来的收入和收入的增加将使更高的利率变得可以承受。事实上，11 月 2 日公布的数据预计将显示美国第三季度的衡量生产率大幅上升。<small>人工智能</small>进一步提高生产率的潜力或许可以解释为什么长期上涨尚未刺破股市。如果不是微软、英伟达等七家科技公司估值不断上升，今年美国股市<small>标普</small>500指数就会下跌。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">别往下看</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，与这一希望背道而驰的是，世界正面临生产力增长的威胁。唐纳德·特朗普誓言，如果他重返白宫，将实施新关税。政府越来越多地用产业政策扭曲市场。随着人口老龄化、绿色能源转型的召唤以及世界各地的冲突需要更多的国防支出，国家支出在经济中所占的比例正在不断增长。面对这一切，任何押注世界经济能够继续发展的人都是在豪赌。 <span

e190yofl0"><span>淋病</span><small>是</small><small>一种</small>古老的疾病。 《利未记》提到了一种传染性疾病，涉及持续射精和勃起疼痛。仅仅 2500 年后，也就是 20 世纪中叶，抗生素的发现才让人们的生活得到缓解。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但或许不会持续太久。几十年来接触抗生素导致导致这种疾病的细菌<i>淋病奈瑟</i>菌产生了耐药性。随着市场上几乎没有新的抗生素上市，这种细菌再次占据了上风。许多国家都有治疗失败的报告。它现在被世界卫生组织指定为“优先”病原体。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 11月1日，新抗生素佐利氟达星临床试验取得成功的消息令人欣喜。该药物抑制一种称为 II 型拓扑异构酶的酶，该酶对细菌繁殖至关重要。然而，比佐利氟达星如何发挥作用更有趣的是它是如何产生的。大多数药物是由私营公司开发的。 Zoliflodacin 是在美国政府和全球抗生素研究与开发伙伴关系 ( <small>GARDP</small> ) 的协助下创建的，该伙伴关系是一个非营利组织，由大型慈善机构 Wellcome Trust 和瑞士日内瓦州等多个组织资助。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>GARDP</small>与美国制药公司 Innoviva Specialty Therapeutics 合作。该公司负责早期开发，并正在引导该药物在美国食品和药物管理局注册。美国国家过敏和传染病研究所指导其完成第二阶段试验，检查新药是否有效。 <small>GARDP</small>支持该药物通过后续更大规模的 3 期试验，这是药物批准使用之前的最后阶段。它的支持使得这些试验能够根据公共卫生目标进行定制，例如将妇女、青少年和<small>艾滋病毒</small>感染者等高危患者纳入试验。 <small>GARDP</small>也在处理许可事宜，希望这将使佐利氟达星变得便宜且广泛使用。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>GARDP</small>发言人 Duncan Graham-Rowe 表示，这种合作关系可以增加新抗生素的供应。 （另一个非营利组织<small>CARB</small> - <small>X</small>也在做类似的工作。）近几十年来新药的缺乏主要反映了激励措施不力。为了延缓耐药性的产生，需要储备新的抗生素，直到真正需要它们为止。但搁置数年的药物在商业上没有吸引力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">各国政府试图通过保证价格和即使不使用药物也每年支付等想法来解决这个问题。国营制药公司也已被讨论。要证明<small>GARDP</small>已经找到了成功的配方，需要的不仅仅是唑利氟达星。但迹象是好的：它正在开发其他四种抗生素，其中一种用于复杂的尿路感染，而且更多的抗生素正在开发中。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p

<small>AI</small>和波士顿的 Ver <small>AI</small>目前还处于起步阶段，墨尔本的 SensOre 和布里斯班的 OreFox 也是如此。但至少有一条更大的鱼——澳大利亚-英国公司——力拓集团——也很热衷。他们正在收集大量地质、地球化学和地球物理数据来输入软件模型。他们希望这些能够发现模式并推断出在何处埋设新地雷。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs

House) 希望他们的一些魔力能够发挥作用。他的公司将来自世界各地的档案数据重新格式化为机器可用的形式，其中许多是纸质的，其中一些可以追溯到 19 世纪。这使得它能够绘制整个地球表面感兴趣区域的地图。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其中一些地图用于训练该公司的<small>人工智能</small>模型。其他方法则用于测试该软件的有效性，方法是检查该软件在以前从未见过的地图上预测已知矿床的效果。 If it passes, it can be let loose on under-explored places of interest, generating leads for KoBold&#39;s geologists.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Earth <small>AI</small> , led by Roman Teslyuk, SensOre, led by Richard Taylor, and OreFox, led by Warwick Anderson, have taken similar approaches, but have concentrated on Australia, which has particularly rich public geological records. Ver <small>AI</small> , led by Yair Frastai, focuses on the western bits of North and South America, home to eight of the world&#39;s ten biggest copper mines.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Dr House is especially proud of his <small>AI</small> ’s ability to predict the shapes and distributions of subterranean plutonic intrusions. These are bodies of igneous rock, often ore-bearing, that have risen as liquid magma from Earth&#39;s interior but solidified before they reached the surface. They can be detected from the surface via magnetic anomalies which suggest that a particular group of rocks formed at a different time from its surroundings, a standard practice in the industry. But KoBold&#39;s <small>AI</small> is able to make more accurate predictions of the shapes of these intrusions, and so suggest the most effective places to drill.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> And with success. Last year, KoBold announced its discovery of a rich deposit of chalcocite, a sulphide of copper, in Zambia. Earth <small>AI</small> , meanwhile, has to its credit a big find of molybdenum (an important component of specialist steels) in New South Wales. Ver <small>AI</small> has found ore containing copper, gold and silver in Chile and Peru. SensOre has found a large source of lithium in Western Australia. And OreFox&#39;s technology has turned up a potential gold mine in Victoria, plus several promising copper prospects.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Rio Tinto is building what Russell Eley, its head of exploration data science, calls a “virtual core shed”. This will bring together details of the many rock-core samples the firm has collected over the years. Software will then search these for patterns that will assist the interpretation of new cores, and tell geologists the best places to drill next.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Dr House observes that 99% of exploration projects fail to turn into actual mines. <small>AI</small> therefore has plenty of room to improve things. It may also help with a more subtle problem. By greatly expanding the volume of rock which can be searched, it will enable new strikes in familiar, well-governed countries, lessening the need to rely on what Mr Taylor diplomatically calls “exotic jurisdictions” for future supplies. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 20:25:04 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/lf01uur1c8a3e123nerecqbo4hqbb0c9</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/11/01/could-ai-help-find-valuable-mineral-deposits </item><item><title><![CDATA[Lab-grown models of embryos increasingly resemble the real thing]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>he traditional</small> way to make an embryo is to combine a sperm cell with an egg, often after dinner and a bottle of wine. But a new way may be around the corner. In recent years scientists have discovered that they can persuade stem cells—those with the ability to transform into many other sorts of cells—to form structures that look and behave very much <a href="https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2023/11/01/how-stem-cell-embryo-models-could-advance-reproductive-science">like embryos</a> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Embryoids”, as such creations are called, can help with the study of embryology and pregnancy, and how they can go wrong. Some of the facsimiles look strikingly real. In 2022 two teams, one led by Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz, who works at the California Institute of Technology and the University of Cambridge, and another by Jacob Hanna at the Weizmann Institute of Science, in Israel, published papers describing mouse embryoids with <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/08/31/mouse-embryoids-can-now-be-grown-from-stem-cells">rudimentary guts, brains and beating hearts</a> . In June Dr Zernicka-Goetz published a paper describing a human embryoid designed to mimic the earliest stages of development, shortly after a real embryo would have implanted into its mother&#39;s womb.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That second study was controversial, with some other scientists dubious that it represented as much of an advance as its authors claimed. But the state of the art is moving fast enough that some think embryoids may soon become hard to distinguish from the embryos they are meant to model. In many ways, that would be a good thing: the more accurate a model, the more useful it is. Human embryoids could shed light on developmental heart defects or diseases like spina bifida, and boost the success rates of in-vitro fertilisation ( <small>IVF</small> ).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But research on embryos—which, after all, have the potential to develop into human beings—is strictly regulated. Many countries ban the use in research of human embryos that are more than 14 days old, and researchers in countries without such laws usually adhere to the same standard voluntarily. The more similar embryoids become to the real thing, the harder it becomes to avoid the question of whether they should be subject to similar rules.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A natural embryo begins with a single fertilised egg. To make an embryoid scientists grow a mix of different stem cells derived from embryos or, sometimes, from adult organisms. They may tweak the molecular signals between the cells and which of their genes are active. Within days, embryo-like structures appear.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Embryoids are desirable partly because real embryos are scarce: the main source is leftovers from <small>IVF</small> treatment. They are also hard to grow. That makes it tricky to run large-scale experiments. Embryoids offer a less ethically fraught alternative.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> A rose by any other name</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One example of their benefits is the study of implantation, the process by which an embryo implants into the womb. It is here that most pregnancy losses happen. But the reasons were almost impossible to study in detail before the advent of embryoids. “You cannot go through the body of the mother to see the development of this embryo,” says Dr Zernicka-Goetz.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Embryoids—specifically, a type called a blastoid—offer the next-best thing. First created by Nicolas Rivron at the Austrian Academy of Sciences, they resemble an embryo at the blastocyst stage, just before implantation. In humans implantation happens around day seven and in mice, around day four. Each blastoid consists of a hollow ball of cells that would, in a real embryo, go on to become part of the placenta. Attached to the inner wall is a smaller ball that would, in other circumstances, develop into the fetus. By rolling blastoids across uterine tissue in a dish, Dr Rivron&#39;s team found that they only stick when they are oriented so that this inner mass is closest to the womb tissue.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That implies the inner mass sends signals to the outer cells, instructing them to stick to the womb. Dr Rivron thinks he has identified those signals, and plans to publish his results soon. He hopes to help explain why so many embryos fail to attach. That might, in turn, improve the success rates of <small>IVF</small> , which in America is only about 35%. Blastoids have made such discoveries much easier, says Dr Rivron. He has started a company, Dawn Bio, which uses blastoids to screen drug candidates that might be useful in fertility treatment.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Other embryoids try to capture what embryos look like after implantation. The most advanced are made with mouse stem cells, such as the brain-and-heart models described above, which represent day eight in mouse development. Dr Hanna holds the record for human embryoids. In a paper published in September he and his colleagues described embryoids that mimic the development of human embryos between days eight and 14. He is keen to try to push things further, perhaps to day 35. At that point, his embryoids, like the mouse ones, would be starting to develop organs.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Dr Hanna believes that could make them a source of medically useful cells. They might, for instance, provide stem cells that could in turn be turned into bone marrow for transplant in leukaemia patients. If the stem cells used to create the embryoid were taken from the patient, then the marrow would be genetically identical to the patient&#39;s own. That would remove the risk of immune rejection, and the need for immune-suppressing drugs.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Convincing the embryoids to develop still further might open up truly mind-bending possibilities. From day 50 or so, the embryoids would have gonads. That might mean, one day, that women struggling to get pregnant could be given a brand new, freshly baked set of their own eggs. (Dr Hanna&#39;s company, Renewal Bio, is pursuing such goals.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> No one knows when—or even if—these goals might be achieved. Naomi Moris, a developmental biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in London, agrees that Dr Hanna&#39;s 14-day-old embryoids look the part. But she does not think they yet qualify as full replacements. For one thing, Dr Hanna&#39;s embryoids never go through a blastocyst-like stage. That missing link prevents them from attaching to a natural womb, and might impose limits on how long they can carry on developing in a dish.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Still, the fact that such goals are being pursued at all has convinced some scientists that the time to think about regulation is now. Dr Moris has proposed a new legal definition for embryos that would be based on their potential to develop into a fetus, a developmental stage that begins eight weeks after fertilisation and lasts until birth. In many countries human embryos are legally ill-defined. Dr Moris hopes her proposal would make clear that an embryoid could qualify as an embryo—if it had the same developmental potential.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Working out if they do, though, might be tricky. The only way to know for certain whether an embryoid could develop into a fetus would be to try it and see—though such an experiment might risk violating the law if it were successful. Instead Dr Moris and her colleagues, including Dr Rivron, have suggested a two-part test that would make at least a compelling argument that embryoids had closed the gap.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The first step would be to check just how closely human embryoids track the developmental trajectory of real embryos. The second would be to push animal embryoids as far as possible, ideally to the point of producing live, fertile offspring. Such a process might start with mice before moving on to pigs or monkeys. If such long-developing embryoids look biochemically similar to the human state-of-the-art, caution would be warranted.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Dr Moris reckons that, within two to five years, someone will have produced animal embryoids that can reach the fetal stage. In April, Chinese researchers transplanted monkey blastoids into surrogate animals, producing pregnancies that lasted for up to 20 days. And there is always the chance that someone goes rogue. In 2018 He Jiankui, a Chinese researcher, announced that he had created gene-edited human babies. He was jailed, and widely condemned. But it is not inconceivable that someone might try to push the boundaries in a similar way with embryoids.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Pushing the limits</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Amander Clark, the president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research, highlights another irony that could make regulation difficult. Since human embryos cannot be cultured for longer than 14 days, scientists do not have a detailed picture of how they develop afterwards. That would make it very difficult to tell if embryoids older than 14 days were behaving as they are supposed to. The only comparators are animal embryos and dissections of wombs surgically removed from pregnant women. In other words, the very rule meant to protect embryos means researchers could struggle to tell whether their alternatives were good enough—or so good they should be given legal protection in turn. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Clarification (November 1st 2023): An earlier version of this piece gave the impression that Dr Zernicka-Goetz was the first to publish work on advanced mouse embryoids.

One of his misadventures— <a href="https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2019/07/10/an-appeals-court-says-donald-trump-may-not-block-critics-on-twitter">blocking critics</a> from viewing or interacting with his posts on Twitter, the site since rebranded as <small>X</small> —led to a federal appeals-court ruling that his cold shoulder had violated the First Amendment. But before the <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/09/28/the-new-supreme-court-term-takes-aim-at-the-administrative-state">Supreme Court</a> could review that decision, <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/08/02/donald-trump-is-indicted-for-trying-to-steal-the-2020-election">Mr Trump lost</a> the 2020 election and <i>Knight Institute v Donald Trump</i> became moot.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> On October 31st two cases not involving the 45th president teed up the same question for the justices: when does an official&#39;s use of a personal social-media account become “state action” and thus subject to constitutional limits? Three hours of debate revealed the difficulty of distinguishing between personal use of Facebook and posts that are, in the terms of a precedent from 1982, “fairly attributable to the state”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In <i>O&#39;Connor-Ratcliff v Garnier,</i> a couple from Poway, a town near San Diego, sued two trustees of the school board for blocking them on Facebook and Twitter. The Garniers, who sent their children to school in the district, had irked the trustees by writing long, repetitive comments on their virtual pages. But they claimed that since the officials&#39; platforms were a forum for community discussion about school-board activities, their freedom of speech was unfairly curtailed when the officials blocked them. In July 2022 a unanimous panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, finding that the trustees had “cloaked” their accounts “with the authority of the state”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But a month earlier, in <i>Lindke v Freed,</i> a similarly shunned constituent in Port Huron, Michigan, failed to persuade a panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals that his banishment from the city manager&#39;s Facebook page was unconstitutional. The Sixth Circuit ruled that James Freed, the city manager, was not conducting official business on his personal Facebook page despite conversing with residents on policies related to the pandemic. His use of the account—which he opened years earlier as a college student to share pictures of his dog, details of takeout meals and struggles with a raccoon—was neither “pursuant to his actual or apparent duties” nor a direct exercise of “state authority”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As the nine justices prodded rival tests, they struggled to come up with an approach that lets civil employees express themselves in a personal capacity while also protecting constituents&#39; right to get access to information and challenge officials from the dog-catcher up to the president.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In defence of the Sixth Circuit&#39;s narrower test, Hashim Mooppan, the school board trustees&#39; lawyer, said that if Mr Trump had been tweeting himself—without help from a staffer—he would have been engaging in his right “to talk about the government in his individual capacity”. Justice Elena Kagan was sceptical. As president, Mr Trump was not just talking about his job but “doing…a lot of government” and “announcing policies” via Twitter, she said. To eject a citizen from that forum is “to cut a citizen off from part of the way that government works”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Two lawyers from the Department of Justice argued alongside Mr Mooppan and Victoria Ferres (Mr Freed&#39;s lawyer) to defend the officials&#39; right to free expression. The lawsuit forced Mr Freed to deactivate his Facebook account, Ms Ferres and Masha Hansford, the government lawyer, said. Finding state action in personal pages, Ms Hansford added, “imperils the freedom of a government official to speak as a public citizen on matters of public concern”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Attorneys representing the blocked constituents acknowledged that officials have a right to free speech. Allon Kedem, the Michigan critic&#39;s lawyer, said the city manager and other employees should have “ample room…to communicate in their personal capacities” but should not be able to “evade the constitution”. Pam Karlan, arguing for the Garniers, said the school-board members could have put up a disclaimer emphasising the personal nature of their accounts.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A majority of the court seemed to coalesce around a principle elicited by questions from Justice Brett Kavanaugh: merely reposting official business on a personal account does not count as state action. But Mr Kedem cited examples of when Mr Freed had broken news, including the city&#39;s decision to give residents a 30-day reprieve before shutting off their water for lack of payment. Mr Freed added, in response to a query, that those who recently had their water turned off would get it turned back on. Even if information like this was available elsewhere, Mr Kedem noted, the city manager&#39;s Facebook page was the most natural place to learn it: “There was essentially no other game in town.” If that becomes part of the court&#39;s ruling, public officials could erase constituents&#39; rude comments on their cat <small>GIF</small> s, but not block them from reading (or debating) rules on pet ownership. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 20:14:10 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/1ja4n0uglp99h0jph6nn0qgbrp43plil</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/11/01/when-can-american-officials-block-citizens-on-social-media </item><item><title><![CDATA[“King Lear” and the purpose of tragedy in dark times]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>M</span> <small>urder on the</small> television, agony on the radio; lies and hatred on the internet, plus snuff videos that you click on before realising your mistake. The planet is a boiling cauldron in which you are the complacent frog. When the real world feels like a charnel house, why spend an evening and a chunk of cash watching bodies pile up on stage?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> And in “King Lear”, <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/04/19/shakespeares-first-folio-assembled-the-worlds-greatest-literature">Shakespeare</a> piles them high. “That&#39;s but a trifle here,” a character says of another&#39;s demise during the final die-in.<b> </b>But the play—and Sir Kenneth Branagh&#39;s ingenious new production in London—make a powerful case for subjecting yourself to <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/03/19/how-shakespeares-plays-reflect-americas-preoccupations">tragic art</a> , even at a time of surround-sound horror.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These days “King Lear” is performed less often than “Hamlet”, with its startlingly acute psychology, or “Othello” and <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/starry-new-productions-show-macbeth-is-the-tragedy-for-our-times/21806303">“Macbeth”</a> , with their overtly modern themes of race, misogyny and the corrupting effects of power. Critics have frequently regarded “Lear” as a triumph of philosophical poetry but impractical as a play. There is just too much of it, and too much in it: too many ideas and emotions, too many stories and, above all, too much desolation and despair.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The evil characters destroy one another, but they take the good down with them. Love kills; man is nothing but a “poor, bare, forked animal”. Throughout the 18th century this bleakness seemed so shocking, even immoral, that “Lear” was staged with a revised happy ending. Audiences still struggle with emotional overload. A decade ago, at another vaunted production in London, people sniggered when they were meant to weep.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Sir Kenneth, a British <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/01/21/belfast-offers-a-jarringly-comfy-depiction-of-the-troubles">actor and director</a> , stars in and directs the version that opened at the Wyndham&#39;s Theatre on October 31st. (It goes to the Shed in New York in 2024.) Part of his response to the play&#39;s scale is to cut lots of it. Running with no interval for ice-cream and gossip, this is two hours of neat tragedy—set, boldly, in Neolithic Britain. Wearing animal skins and wielding spears, the cast hulks around a stark set that recalls Stonehenge, their faces intermittently looming on the stones in un-Neolithic projections. Above them hangs an orb resembling both a planet and an eyeball, which sometimes seems to bleed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Here the power struggle that follows Lear&#39;s division of his kingdom is less a clash of armies than a scrap for a bauble in the mud. Yet the absence of pomp also makes the family drama at the story&#39;s heart seem movingly intimate and familiar. Captured by his foes, arms bound behind his back, Sir Kenneth&#39;s Lear uses his beard to dry the tears of his beloved daughter Cordelia (Jessica Revell). Soon he heaves her corpse onto the stage, howling in grief; this time, nobody laughed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> They chuckled at other moments though, as Sir Kenneth judiciously keeps and hones the funny bits to help the philosophy go down. It is not just the humour of absurdist madness and slapstick torment that hovers between pathos and ridicule, often called the “comedy of the grotesque”. There is also the comedy of charismatic devilment and gullibility, of champion wordplay and some of Shakespeare&#39;s most colourful insults.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As for the purpose of tragedy: Edgar (Doug Colling) implies one as he drags his blind and suicidal father Gloucester (Joseph Kloska) across ancient Britain. “Men must endure/Their going hence, even as their coming hither,” he preaches. “Ripeness is all.” Life, in other words, is an endurance test. It follows that, for viewers, tragic art is a kind of practice in grinning and bearing it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> We have had quite enough practice in that, today&#39;s punters may think; and a homily on stoicism makes a priggish sort of moral. Edgar&#39;s conclusion, however, is not the play&#39;s. The rationale it offers for its spectacle of pain is more than a lesson in patience, more even than the sense of solidarity in suffering that acting as fine as Sir Kenneth&#39;s can provide.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “King Lear” is full of audiences: characters who witness folly, misery or cruelty and must choose what to do about them. Some weigh their interests and join in. Some wring their hands. A few resist, such as the heroic servant who objects as Cornwall (a sinister Hughie O&#39;Donnell) rips out Gloucester&#39;s eyes in a spasm of bloodlust and impunity.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is hard to imagine yourself as Lear, even one as denuded as Sir Kenneth&#39;s. But maybe you could, just about, be like the unheralded minor figures who opt to act instead of merely watching. “O, you are men of stones,” the king cries at the close, demanding greater compassion for injustice from the surviving characters—and from the audience, too. Don&#39;t just sit there, the play urges. Do something. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <b>Read more from Back Story, our column on culture:<br></b> <i><a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/12/david-beckhams-guide-to-celebrity">David Beckham&#39;s guide to celebrity</a> (Oct 12th)<br></i> <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/article71888-prod.ece">“ <i>Cat Person”, an internet-breaking short story, is back as a film</i></a> <i>(Oct 5th)</i> <i><a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/article70379-prod.ece"><br>Donald Trump and the dramatic power of not turning up</a> (Sep 21st)</i></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Also: How the Back Story column <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/08/20/the-back-story-of-back-story">got its name</a> .</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 19:19:13 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/9iun0e2knlmnodafoc7bn4jnthhh4l4r</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/11/01/king-lear-and-the-purpose-of-tragedy-in-dark-times </item><item><title><![CDATA[Can America’s weapons-makers adapt to 21st-century warfare?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>A</span> <small>RMING UNCLE SAM</small> is a great business. America&#39;s latest defence budget earmarks $170bn for procurement and $145bn for research and development ( <small>R</small> &amp; <small>D</small> ), most of which ends up with the handful of “prime” contractors, which deal directly with the Department of Defence ( <small>D</small> o <small>D</small> ). So will some of the $44bn in American military aid to Ukraine and a chunk of the extra defence spending by America&#39;s European allies, which account for 5-10% of the primes&#39; sales. Although those sums do not increase at the same rate as, say, corporate <small>IT</small> expenditure, leaving less room for spectacular gains, arms manufacturers are also shielded from eye-watering losses by huge, decades-long contracts.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Thanks to a big shake-up at the end of the cold war, the industry is also highly concentrated. At a meeting in 1993, dubbed the “last supper”, William Perry, then President Bill Clinton&#39;s deputy defence secretary, told industry bosses that excess capacity was no longer appropriate and that consolidation was in order. As a result, the ranks of the primes have thinned from more than 50 in 1950s America to six. The number of suppliers of satellites has declined from eight to four, of fixed-wing aircraft from eight to three and of tactical missiles from 13 to three. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC229.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC229.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC229.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC229.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC229.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC229.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC229.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC229.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC229.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC229.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC229.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC229.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC229.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC229.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC229.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC229.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC229.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Guaranteed custom and weak competition have helped American armsmakers&#39; shares comfortably outperform the broader stockmarket over the past 50 years. A paper published by the <small>D</small> o <small>D</small> in April found that between 2000 and 2019 defence contractors did better than civilian ones in terms of shareholder returns, return on assets and return on equity, among other financial measures. An increasingly unstable world means more money going to the armed forces—and to their suppliers. Total shareholder returns, including dividends, at primes such as General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman rose when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th (see chart 1).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This cosy oligopoly is now being challenged on two fronts. One is technological. As the tank battles on Ukrainian plains and in Gazan streets show, “metal on the ground” remains important. So do missiles, artillery shells and fighter jets. But both conflicts also illustrate that modern combat relies increasingly on smaller and simpler tactical kit, as well as communications, sensors, software and data. The second challenge is the Pentagon&#39;s efforts to extract greater value for money from the military-industrial complex.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Both developments undercut the primes&#39; big competitive advantages: their ability to build bulky kit and to navigate the mind-boggling procurement process. Cost-effective innovations, such as the Pentagon&#39;s recently announced project “Replicator”, which aims to get swarms of small drones in the air, <small>ASAP</small> , require agile engineering for which the defence giants “are not innately organised”, as Kearney, a consultancy, delicately puts it. If they are to thrive in the new era, they will have to rediscover some of the innovative ways that helped them shape Silicon Valley in the decades after the second world war. So far, though, they are finding this difficult.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is easy to see why the primes (and their investors) like the current setup. The <small>D</small> o <small>D</small> reimburses the primes&#39; <small>R</small> &amp; <small>D</small> expenses, and adds 10-15% on top of that. This “cost plus” approach spares the companies from funnelling lots of their own capital into risky projects, which offers security but reduces the incentive to deliver things on time and on budget. The project to build the <small>F</small> -35 fighter jet, which has accounted for more than a quarter of Lockheed&#39;s revenues in the past three years, started life in the 1990s. It is running around a decade late and will cost American taxpayers up to $2trn over the lifetime of the aircraft.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Once in production, newly developed large kit is sold at a fixed price, often for decades. The <small>B</small> -21 stealth bomber currently in development by Northrop Grumman will cost the Pentagon more than $200bn for 100 planes delivered over 30 years. The Columbia Class nuclear-submarine programme made by a subsidiary of General Dynamics will sail from the early 2030s until at least 2085.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Past their prime</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Pentagon&#39;s patience with this time-honoured business model is wearing thin. Last year&#39;s national-defence strategy summed it up succinctly: “too slow and too focused on acquiring systems not designed to address the most critical challenges we now face”. Instead, it wants to “reward rapid experimentation, acquisition and fielding”. This is forcing the primes to think about how they could build fresh functionality atop their existing platforms, by adding new software, modules, payloads and the like, and to create production processes which can be modified to accommodate innovations.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As Lockheed Martin&#39;s chief executive, Jim Taiclet, recently acknowledged, soldiers expect seamless integration of sensors, weapons and systems for battle management such as joint all-domain command and control ( <small>JADC</small> 2), a new concept for sharing data between platforms, services and theatres. Contracting, building and continuously updating such systems will be a struggle for firms that have hitherto produced huge bits of hardware slowly and which, in the words of Steve Grundman of the Atlantic Council, a think-tank, are not “digital natives”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The primes face another problem. The technology the Pentagon has in mind is not inherently military, observes Mikhail Grinberg of Renaissance Strategic Advisors, a consultancy. Most of the defence giants do have civilian divisions—large ones in the case of Boeing, General Dynamics and Raytheon. But the Pentagon&#39;s growing appetite for dual-use technologies means more competition from civilian industry, which is constantly devising new equipment, materials, manufacturing processes and software that could be used for military as well as peaceful ends.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In 2020 General Motors won a contract to supply infantry vehicles. The carmaker has now teamed up with the American arm of Rheinmetall, a German weapons firm, in a deal to furnish military trucks. Other challengers are trying to muscle their way into the military-industrial complex, drawn by the <small>D</small> o <small>D</small> ’s appetite for more diverse systems. Palantir, founded in 2003 to help avert more attacks like that of September 11th 2001, makes civilian and military software that processes the vast amounts of data that modern life and warfare throw up. Elon Musk&#39;s Space <small>X</small> sends payloads, including military ones, into orbit and is being paid by the <small>D</small> o <small>D</small> to provide internet access to Ukrainian forces in their fight against Russian invaders. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC224.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC224.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC224.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC224.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC224.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC224.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC224.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC224.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC224.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC224.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC224.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC224.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC224.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC224.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC224.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC224.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_WBC224.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Big tech is getting in on the action, too. Amazon, Google and Microsoft have targeted defence and security as promising markets, says Mr Grundman. Military procurement is a rare business large enough to make a difference to the tech titans&#39; top lines, which are counted in the hundreds of billions of dollars. The trio, along with Oracle, a smaller maker of business software, are already sharing a $9bn cloud-computing contract with the Pentagon. Microsoft also supplies the army with augmented-reality goggles in a deal that could eventually be worth $22bn.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Pentagon&#39;s new approach is also attracting upstart rivals. Anduril, a firm founded in 2017 solely to serve military needs, has developed Lattice, a general-purpose software platform that can be swiftly updated and adapted to solve new problems. The company also makes a short-range drone called the Ghost, which can be operated by a couple of soldiers. Recognising that to win business quickly it needs to be vertically integrated, it has acquired a manufacturer of rocket engines and is developing an underwater autonomous vessel for the Australian navy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The wannabe primes and their financial backers still bemoan the barriers to new entrants. Brian Schimpf, Anduril&#39;s boss, says that when working with the <small>D</small> o <small>D</small> you get “punched in the face every day”. SpaceX and Palantir both had to fight court battles just to be able to contest military contracts. In June Palantir signed an open letter with 11 other companies, including Anduril, and investors, imploring the Pentagon to remove obstacles to smaller contractors. The letter, which drew on proposals from the Atlantic Council, condemned “antiquated methods” that “drastically limited” access to commercial innovation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As the national-security strategy shows, the <small>D</small> o <small>D</small> seems keen to move away from procurement antiquity, for example by shifting more risk onto contractors through fixed-price, rather than cost-plus, development contracts. Such developments are causing palpitations among the primes. Boeing&#39;s recent financial travails are partly a result of catastrophically underbidding in fixed-price contracts for the <small>KC</small> -46 tanker and Air Force One, which ferries around American presidents.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In contrast, Anduril has dispensed with the crutch of cost-plus of its own accord, and is investing its own capital to make what it thinks the <small>D</small> o <small>D</small> will need. By clinging on to the old model, the primes may be depriving America of the 21st-century defence industry it needs. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Economist&#39;s <i><a href="https://www.economist.com/military-terms-a-to-z">A to Z of military terms</a> explains modern warfare in plain English</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 18:59:12 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/qighd6r7dnnntc0dckojandi723r10p9</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/01/can-americas-weapons-makers-adapt-to-21st-century-warfare</item><item><title><![CDATA[Ukraine’s top general on the breakthrough he needs to beat Russia]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><aside class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis">Ukraine war</a></i></p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>F</span> <small>IVE MONTHS</small> into its counter-offensive, Ukraine has managed to advance by just 17 kilometres. Russia fought for ten months around Bakhmut in the east “to take a town six by six kilometres”. Sharing his first comprehensive assessment of the campaign with <i>The Economist</i> in an interview this week, Ukraine&#39;s commander-in-chief, General Valery Zaluzhny, says the battlefield reminds him of the great conflict of a century ago. “Just like in the first world war we have reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate,” he says. The general concludes that it would take a massive technological leap to break <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/09/21/ukraine-faces-a-long-war-a-change-of-course-is-needed">the deadlock</a> . “There will most likely be no deep and beautiful breakthrough.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The course of the counter-offensive has undermined Western hopes that Ukraine could use it to demonstrate that the war is unwinnable—and thus change Vladimir Putin&#39;s calculations, forcing the Russian president to negotiate. It has also undercut General Zaluzhny&#39;s assumption that he could stop Russia by bleeding its troops. “That was my mistake. Russia has lost at least 150,000 dead. In any other country such casualties would have stopped the war.” But not in Russia, where life is cheap and where Mr Putin&#39;s reference points are in the first and second world wars in which Russia lost tens of millions.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> An army of Ukraine&#39;s standard ought to have been able to move at a speed of 30km a day as it breached Russian defensive lines. “If you look at <small>NATO</small> ’s text books and at the maths which we did [in planning the counter-offensive], four months should have been enough time for us to have reached Crimea, to have fought in Crimea, to return from Crimea and to have gone back in and out again,” General Zaluzhny says sardonically. Instead he watched his troops and equipment get stuck in minefields on the approaches to Bakhmut in the east, his Western-supplied equipment getting pummelled by Russian artillery and drones. The same story unfolded on the offensive&#39;s main thrust, in the south, where newly formed and inexperienced brigades, despite being equipped with modern Western kit, immediately ran into trouble.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “First I thought there was something wrong with our commanders, so I changed some of them. Then I thought maybe our soldiers are not fit for purpose, so I moved soldiers in some brigades,” says General Zaluzhny. When those changes failed to make a difference, the commander told his staff to dig out a book he once saw as a student in a military academy in Ukraine. Its title was “Breaching Fortified Defence Lines”. It was published in 1941 by a Soviet major-general, PS Smirnov, who analysed the battles of the first world war. “And before I got even halfway through it, I realised that is exactly where we are because just like then, the level of our technological development today has put both us and our enemies in a stupor.” </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_EUM951.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_EUM951.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_EUM951.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_EUM951.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_EUM951.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_EUM951.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_EUM951.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_EUM951.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_EUM951.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_EUM951.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_EUM951.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_EUM951.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_EUM951.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_EUM951.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_EUM951.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_EUM951.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20231104_EUM951.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"> <span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">image: The Economist</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That thesis, he says, was borne out as he went to the front line in Avdiivka, also in the east, where Russia has recently advanced by a few hundred metres over several weeks by throwing in two of its armies. “On our monitor screens the day I was there we saw 140 Russian machines ablaze—destroyed within four hours of coming within firing range of our artillery.” Those fleeing were chased by “first-person-view” drones, remote-controlled and carrying explosive charges that their operators simply crash into the enemy. The same picture unfolds when Ukrainian troops try to advance. General Zaluzhny describes a battlefield in which modern sensors can identify any concentration of forces, and modern precision weapons can destroy it. “The simple fact is that we see everything the enemy is doing and they see everything we are doing. In order for us to break this deadlock we need something new, like the gunpowder which the Chinese invented and which we are still using to kill each other,” he says.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This time, however, the decisive factor will be not a single new invention, but a combination of all the technical solutions that already exist, he says. In an article written for <i>The Economist</i> by General Zaluzhny ( <a href="https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/11/01/the-commander-in-chief-of-ukraines-armed-forces-on-how-to-win-the-war">see here</a> ), as well as in a full-length essay shared with the newspaper, he urges innovation in drones, electronic warfare, anti-artillery capabilities and de-mining equipment, including new robotic solutions. “We need to ride the power embedded in new technologies,” says the general.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Western allies have been overly cautious in supplying Ukraine with their latest technology and more powerful weapons. Joe Biden, America&#39;s president, set objectives at the start of Russia&#39;s invasion: to ensure that Ukraine was not defeated and that America was not dragged into confrontation with Russia. This means that arms supplied by the West have been sufficient in sustaining Ukraine in the war, but not enough to allow it to win. General Zaluzhny is not complaining: “They are not obliged to give us anything, and we are grateful for what we have got, but I am simply stating the facts.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But by holding back the supply of long-range missile systems and tanks, the West allowed Russia to regroup and build up its defences in the aftermath of a sudden breakthrough in Kharkiv region in the north and in Kherson in the south late in 2022. “These systems were most relevant to us last year, but they only arrived this year,” he says. Similarly, <small>F</small> -16 jets, due next year, are now less helpful, suggests the general, in part because Russia has improved its air defences: an experimental version of the <small>S</small> -400 missile system can reach beyond the city of Dnipro, he warns.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet the delay in arms deliveries, though frustrating, is not the main cause of Ukraine&#39;s predicament, according to General Zaluzhny. “It is important to understand that this war cannot be won with the weapons of the past generation and outdated methods,” he insists. “They will inevitably lead to delay and, as a consequence, defeat.” It is, instead, technology that will be decisive, he argues. The general is enthused by recent conversations with Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of Google, and stressed the decisive role of drones, and of electronic warfare which can prevent them from flying.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> General Zaluzhny&#39;s assessment is sobering: there is no sign that a revolutionary technological breakthrough, whether in drones or in electronic warfare, is around the corner. And <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/29/trenches-and-tech-on-ukraines-southern-front">technology</a> has its limits. Even in the first world war, the arrival of tanks, in 1917, was not sufficient to break the deadlock on the battlefield: it took a suite of technologies, and more than a decade of tactical innovation, to produce the German blitzkrieg in May 1940. The implication is that Ukraine is stuck in a long war—one in which he acknowledges Russia has the advantage. Nevertheless, he insists that Ukraine has no choice but to keep the initiative by remaining on the offensive, even if it only moves by a few metres a day.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Crimea, he believes, remains Mr Putin&#39;s greatest vulnerability. It is the linchpin of his imperial restoration project, and his legitimacy rests on having brought it back to Russia. Over the past few months, Ukraine has taken the war into the peninsula Mr Putin annexed in 2014 and which remains critical to the logistics of his war. “It must know that it is part of Ukraine and that this war is happening there.” On October 30th Ukraine struck Crimea with American-supplied long-range <small>ATACMS</small> missiles for the first time.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> General Zaluzhny is desperately trying to prevent the war from settling into the trenches. “The biggest risk of an attritional trench war is that it can drag on for years and wear down the Ukrainian state,” he says. In the first world war, mutinies interfered before technology could make a difference. Four empires collapsed and a revolution broke out in Russia.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A collapse in Ukrainian morale and Western support is precisely what Mr Putin is counting on. There is no question in General Zaluzhny&#39;s mind that a long war favours Russia, a country with a population three times and an economy ten times the size of Ukraine&#39;s. “Let&#39;s be honest, it&#39;s a feudal state where the cheapest resource is human life. And for us…the most expensive thing we have is our people,” he says. For now, General Zaluzhny says, he has enough soldiers. But the longer the war goes on, the harder it will be to sustain. “We need to look for this solution, we need to find this gunpowder, quickly master it and use it for a speedy victory. Because sooner or later we are going to find that we simply don&#39;t have enough people to fight.” <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <b>Read a more detailed <a href="https://infographics.economist.com/2023/ExternalContent/ZALUZHNYI_FULL_VERSION.pdf">new essay</a> by General Zaluzhny on this topic.</b></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 18:28:29 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/rno5q4jbi1qhlif7dbv8thfgmeei1qt8</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/11/01/ukraines-top-general-on-the-breakthrough-he-needs-to-beat-russia</item></channel></rss>
