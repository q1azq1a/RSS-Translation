data-caps="initial">“</span>一个人有<small>多少个</small>细胞？”这听起来像是来自书呆子酒吧测验的问题。这也是一个深刻的哲学探究。一个答案是大约 37trn。在一个体重 70 公斤的典型成年人中，这是一个数字，可以追溯到使那个人存在的受精卵。</p><p class="article__body-text">不过，从另一个角度来看，你会得到一个大约两倍大的数字。这增加了古细菌、细菌、真菌和原生生物细胞，它们占据了口腔、肠道、皮肤、肺部以及人体几乎所有其他表面、角落和缝隙。这些细胞仅占人体体重的 0.3% 左右。但总的来说，它们比“正常的”人类细胞小得多，它们的数量几乎相同。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">人类拥有这种伴随的微生物组并不是新闻。这也不是新闻，虽然这些额外的细胞中有一些只是乘客，但其他细胞是积极有益的。不同物种亲密合作地生活在一起的共生理念可以追溯到 19 世纪。然而，一开始只是一个有限的异常案例列表，现在已经逐渐发展到几乎每个多细胞生物——甚至一些单细胞生物——都有共生体的地步。</p><p class="article__body-text">这向一些生物学家表明，“范式转变”的时机已经成熟——这是科学家看待世界的新方式。他们说，要摒弃植物和动物“拥有微生物组”的旧观念，而要接受植物和动物都只是一个统一的元有机体的一部分的观念，这些元有机体的组成部分相互协调进化。同样，这些公共生物也有一个名字：holobionts。</p><h2>整体思维</h2><p class="article__body-text">伦敦帝国理工学院 Leverhulme Holobiont 中心的负责人 Thomas Bell 是这种思维方式的信徒之一，该中心于 1 月成立。范式转变有很多原因。但在这种情况下帮助打破平衡的是一种称为宏基因组学的技术。贝尔博士和他的同事们计划将其应用于范围广泛的已知和潜在的全息生物。</p><p class="article__body-text">宏基因组学同时分析样本中所有事物的基因组——无论是土壤、水、落叶还是植物或动物的混合部分。在它发明之前，试图弄清楚这些样本中存在哪些微生物是很棘手的。很少有细菌适合在实验室中培养，实际上，许多细菌对科学来说是不可见的。如今，您可以通过宏基因组工厂运行您想要提及的任何生物体的相关提取物——如果您这样做，它很可能会显示为全生物。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">贝尔博士和他的同事们正在特别关注昆虫、两栖动物和植物。除了是真核生物——这意味着它们的细胞具有适当的细胞核并包含称为细胞器的复杂结构——从进化的角度来看，它们几乎没有共同点。每个群体都被选中进行研究，因为将其成员视为全生物而不是个体生物具有启发性。</p><p class="article__body-text">在昆虫中，中心从树皮甲虫和蜜蜂开始。树皮甲虫的全生物特性因一些进化出称为 mycangia 的特殊结构而得到强调，该结构携带真菌孢子。孢子长出称为菌丝的细卷须，使它们能够消化木材。这会释放甲虫可以代谢的营养物质。但是，如果这些真菌（其中一种最著名的真菌会导致荷兰榆树病）失控，它们就会毁掉整片森林。</p><p class="article__body-text">与此同时，蜜蜂是重要的传粉者，这种行为可能导致蜂巢通过其成员访问的花朵交换微生物组。一些蜜蜂种群也表现出承受压力的迹象，可能是由于使用了杀虫剂。贝尔博士的几位同事怀疑对此的解释不在于全生物的动物部分，而在于其微生物部分。</p><p class="article__body-text">两栖动物在名单上是因为许多两栖动物面临被称为壶菌的皮肤真菌灭绝的威胁，这种真菌是人类从亚洲家园传播开来的。与伦敦动物园的研究人员一起，该中心的科学家们正在研究两栖动物皮肤微生物组的多样性，以及这是否可以使元生物对壶菌感染产生免疫力。</p><p class="article__body-text">植物发现自己处于该中心的十字准线，因为大多数植物都伴随着细菌和真菌的“根际”，这些细菌和真菌附着在甚至穿透它们的根部。根际的生化途径增加了整个全生物可用的营养物质范围。根际由全生物植物成分合成的碳水化合物和其他营养物质维持。</p><h2>有益的联盟</h2><p class="article__body-text">像贝尔博士这样的工作意味着全生物作为一个有意义的类别的想法正在流行（见图表）。但要完全接受它，就需要对其进行分解和定义。正如斯沃斯莫尔学院的发育生物学家斯科特吉尔伯特所说，“[全生物]的概念挑战并试图取代单基因个体的概念，其基本身份在发育过程中产生，由免疫系统维持，并被选择通过进化。”这是一个很大的要求。 </p><div

alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text">一个可能的绊脚石是个体的连续性。对于传统分类的生物，父母和后代之间的联系是显而易见的。对于假定的全生物来说，它可能不那么重要。全息生物不是从单个受精卵中生长出来的，而是必须组装起来的。有时，组件在父母和后代之间传递。例如，人类出生时肠道内就已经存在一些微生物。他们在混乱的分娩过程中捡起其他人，更多的是从他们的母乳中。在这些情况下，很容易看出全生物的各个组成部分如何共同进化成一个单一的功能单元。</p><p class="article__body-text">植物倾向于横向结合——与已经生活在它们发芽的土壤中的微生物结成联盟。这可能被认为削弱了由此产生的联盟作为单一进化单位的情况。事实上，斯坦福大学进化生物学家 Joan Roughgarden 的计算表明，水平传播也支持共同进化，从而支持真正的全息生物的出现。</p><p class="article__body-text">一项表明她是正确的证据来自德克萨斯大学奥斯汀分校的生物学家 Thomas Juenger 对柳枝稷的研究。如果植物及其根际是进化单位，那么它们可能会收集一个“核心”微生物组，该微生物组在植物中的特定基因的鼓励下存在。柳枝稷在北美有三个基因不同的种群。通过比较这些及其相关的根际，Juenger 博士展示了植物基因（尤其是与免疫系统相关的基因）与哪些细菌在由此产生的根际中繁衍生息之间的关系。</p><p class="article__body-text">有时，就像树皮甲虫及其肌细胞一样，即使不进行遗传分析，主要宿主和微生物组的进化整合也是显而易见的。 <i>Mastotermes darwiniensis</i>是一种澳大利亚白蚁，它依靠肠道微生物将它吃掉的坚硬木材分解成分子，而全生物的动物部分可以代谢这些分子。 <i>Mixotricha paradoxa</i>是其中一种纤维消化成分，它本身就是原生生物（一种单细胞真核生物）和四种细菌的复合体。美国生物学家林恩·马古利斯 (Lynn Margulis) 于 1991 年创造了全生物一词，称这种生物为“拥有五个基因组的野兽”。 </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">蚜虫同样令人着迷。该组的所有成员都携带<i>Buchnera</i>属的细菌，这是一种在其他地方不为人知的品种。在一段可追溯到大约 2 亿年前的关系中， <i>Buchnera</i>生活在称为细菌细胞的专门蚜虫细胞内。这些细菌是如此被宠爱，以至于它们已经摆脱了它们开始时的大部分基因，依靠它们的动物伙伴来填补生化空白。作为交换，它们合成昆虫无法为自己制造的氨基酸。 </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><meta itemprop="url"

class="article__body-text">故事也没有就此结束。许多蚜虫在它们的细菌细胞中携带另一种虫子， <i>Hamiltonella defensa</i> 。这些小动物，也依<i>赖布赫内拉</i>提供氨基酸，杀死寄生蜂的幼虫，否则这些寄生蜂会活活吃掉蚜虫。但是，反过来，只有在存在一种称为<small>APSE</small>的病毒时才会发生这种情况——APSE 是全生物层次结构中比喻性更小的跳蚤。</p><p class="article__body-text">所有这一切都让人想起最极端的全生物实验案例：称为线粒体和叶绿体的细胞器。线粒体通过代谢葡萄糖产生能量，存在于所有真核生物中。叶绿体参与光合作用，仅限于藻类和植物。两者都是以前自由生活的细菌的远房后代，这些细菌在 10 亿多年前开始与现在称为家的细胞发生关系。 （正是这两个案例导致 Margulis 创造了全生物这个词。）</p></div><h2>全息人</h2><p class="article__body-text">展示的不同程度的亲密关系——从表面乘客到重要的细胞成分——确实提出了一个问题，即“全生物”一词的边界到底在哪里。但是生物学充满了既模糊又有用的概念（“物种”就是其中之一）。也许这个概念最重要的工作是提醒生物学家永远不要忽视微生物组在他们试图理解的任何现象中可能发挥的作用。例如，昆虫抗药性进化的研究通常涉及昆虫自身的基因组。但被称为豆虫的害虫对杀虫剂杀螟松的抗性是由生活在它们内脏中的<i>伯克霍尔德</i>氏菌属细菌赋予的——如果你想对抗这种抗性，这是重要的知识。</p><p class="article__body-text">全生物的微生物部分甚至赋予它们更奇怪的力量。例如，某些细菌对磁场敏感。研究人员怀疑，有些人可能已经与海龟和鸟类等生物结成联盟，使这些以动物为基础的集体能够利用地球的磁场来导航。更熟悉的是，狗（以及鬣狗和其他有肛门腺的食肉动物）的全息生物特性使它们能够通过气味标记进行交流。它们以这种方式沉积的气味是由细菌将分泌物降解到这些腺体中产生的。</p><p class="article__body-text">研究得最好的动物全生物是<i>智人</i>。在拓扑学上，人是一个环面——中间有一个洞的三维物体。有问题的洞是消化道。几乎这个环面的整个表面都是微生物的家园，尽管不同的部分有不同的居民。到目前为止，它们中数量最多的生活在下肠道。</p><p class="article__body-text">这些肠道微生物通过将纤维状植物聚合物分解成其他 37trn 细胞可以代谢的更小分子，以与白蚁相同的方式（尽管程度不同）扩展了人类全生物的消化能力。但它们也会产生许多其他分子，其中一些分子会向全生物的动物细胞发送信号。此外，这些细胞通常会返回信号。</p><p class="article__body-text">这种信号似乎对神经系统的某些部分特别有影响。肠道细菌分泌的分子包括血清素、 <small>GABA</small>和儿茶酚胺。所有这些都是神经递质，在神经细胞之间传递冲动的化学物质。因此，微生物组是肠脑轴不可或缺的一部分，是体内最大神经细胞群（中枢神经系统）和第二大神经细胞群（肠神经系统）之间持续不断的神经交流。</p><p class="article__body-text">宿主和微生物组之间的第三大相互作用涉及免疫系统。这通过防止微生物组的任何特定部分发生骚乱来促成使整个节目继续进行的交易——这项任务至少与抵御传染病一样重要。作为回报，均衡的微生物群通过防止致病菌在肠道中繁殖来帮助免疫系统。</p><p class="article__body-text">因此，肠道微生物组与人类全生物的哺乳动物部分深度整合——当这种整合出现问题时可以看出这一点。众所周知，生态失调至少与肥胖、糖尿病、高血压、动脉粥样硬化、哮喘、炎症性肠病、某些肝病、各种癌症、自闭症、帕金森病和抑郁症有关，并且在许多情况下可能助长这些疾病.这不是一个详尽的列表。</p><p class="article__body-text">以这种方式超越 37trn 哺乳动物细胞可以在医学上取得成果。例如，以植物为主的饮食会助长纤维溶解细菌，而富含肉类的饮食则有利于那些以脂肪和蛋白质为食的细菌。因此，植物性饮食会产生丁酸和丙酸等分子，这些分子已知可以调节炎症和其他免疫系统功能。以肉类为基础的食物会产生支链脂肪酸、酚类和吲哚，这些物质会产生一系列不良影响，包括成为心血管健康不良的危险因素。</p><h2>用全息电子学修理东西</h2><p class="article__body-text">作物育种者也开始认真对待全息生物的概念。位于马萨诸塞州波士顿的 Indigo Ag 的现场代理人在干旱和虫害等事件的农田中识别罕见的幸存者，并将这些植物送去研究。假设这些幸存者有一些特别之处。 Indigo 的基本猜测是这种特殊的东西通常存在于根际。</p><p class="article__body-text">秉承这一想法，该公司发现了——现在已经上市——根际昆虫，它们赋予棉花、玉米、大豆和小麦耐旱性；提高玉米、大豆和小麦的抗真菌性；防范线虫侵袭；从土壤中释放磷和钾；通过将大气中的氮转化为硝酸盐等分子来“固定”大气中的氮，植物可以利用硝酸盐来制造氨基酸，这是蛋白质的组成部分。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">另一家公司，加利福尼亚州伯克利的 Pivot Bio，正专注于固氮。 Pivot 的研究人员对两种固氮细菌的基因进行了编辑，使它们即使在土壤中已经存在大量固氮细菌的情况下也能继续工作，并且产生比平时更多的固定氮。当与玉米等作物一起种植时，这些虫子的混合物为每株幼苗提供了一个即时的、固氮的根际。这可以减少五分之一的肥料使用。</p><p class="article__body-text">威斯康星大学麦迪逊分校的 Jean-Michel Ané 是 Pivot 的科学顾问，他还有另外两个固氮想法。其一，观察豆科植物长出特殊的根瘤来容纳固氮菌，就是重塑谷物（主要针对水稻）的根，使其长出类似的根瘤。他和他的同事们已经确定了两个豆科基因，当它们移植到杨树（一种常见的实验植物）时，它们也会导致它们长出根瘤。</p><p class="article__body-text"> Ané 博士的另一个想法是基于不寻常的玉米和高粱品种，这些品种的气生根会分泌一种凝胶，固氮细菌喜欢在其中生存。然后这种凝胶滴落到地面，固定的氮被植物的根部吸收。以玉米为例，他和他的同事已经成功地将携带这种特性的植物与商业品种杂交，现在已经进入第五代携带它的植物。</p><p class="article__body-text">牛和其他牲畜也受到审查。它们类似白蚁的消化系统每年产生超过 1 亿吨甲烷，约占人类温室气体排放量的 6%。可以通过在牛饲料中添加两种物质中的任何一种来抑制这些细菌——一种叫做 3-硝基氧丙醇的化学物质，或者一种叫做<i>Asparagopsis</i> <i>taxiformis</i>的海藻。事实上，添加<i>A. taxiformis</i>不仅可以抑制甲烷排放，还可以提高饲料转化为牛奶或肉类的转化率。</p><p class="article__body-text">环保主义者也看到了将有机体视为全生物的希望。这就是贝尔博士研究两栖动物的动机。不过，其他人正在寻求帮助整个生态系统。森林和珊瑚礁都对温度敏感，因此受到全球变暖的威胁。将它们的成员视为全生物可能会让生态学家帮助它们进行调整。</p><p class="article__body-text">与 Indigo 的研究人员一样，威斯康星大学麦迪逊分校的 Cassandra Allsup、Isabelle George 和 Richard Lankau 一直在研究土壤微生物。他们在家乡和南部伊利诺伊州的森林中进行了采样。他们测试了在该跨度的北部和南部附近生长的各种物种的幼苗，这两个物种相距 5.8 度纬度，他们发现那些生长在接种了来自气候相似地点的细菌的土壤中的幼苗比那些接种了来自不同地区的虫子的土壤中的幼苗生长得更快。尽管给整片森林接种疫苗不切实际，但他们希望对用于当地再造林项目的苗圃种植的树苗进行处理可能有助于这些树木的生存。</p><p class="article__body-text">与人类一样，珊瑚是一种研究得特别透彻的元生物。它们吸引游客的颜色来自被称为虫黄藻的光合作用原生生物，它们生活在固着动物的特殊细胞内，负责分泌构成珊瑚头的石灰石——正是这些为全生物提供了大部分营养。</p><p class="article__body-text">这种安排的一个弱点是，如果虫黄藻变得太热，它们的光合作用机制就会失控，产生称为自由基的有毒富氧分子。然后珊瑚动物将它们排出体外，这种现象称为白化。如果情况及时恢复正常，可能会发生重新定殖。但是，漂白时间过长的珊瑚将会死亡。</p><p class="article__body-text">有些人试图通过修补系统动物部分的基因来灌输对温度升高的抵抗力。但是澳大利亚墨尔本大学的 Madeleine van Oppen 和沙特阿拉伯阿卜杜拉国王大学的 Raquel Peixoto 在不同的项目中寻找对虫黄藻或同为全生物一部分的许多细菌中的一些进行微调。</p><p class="article__body-text">这种生态系统工程代表了大规模的全息思维。它是否会带来成果还有待观察。但它正在发生的事实无疑证明了一个想法的时机已经到来。 <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 14 Jun 2023 17:37:34

100,000 美元。不过，现在<i>《自然通讯》</i>杂志上的一篇论文表明，一次注射就可以提供一种廉价、安全且持久的方法来为猫绝育。</p><p class="article__body-text">所涉及的技术是基因疗法，通常通过改良病毒将基因带入生物体内，以实现某些额外功能。这在人类中获得了发展势头，截至今年 2 月，美国食品和药物管理局批准了七种不同的基因疗法。大多数旨在针对罕见的遗传疾病，包括血友病 B，其中突变会导致血液凝固问题。</p><p class="article__body-text">哈佛大学的分子生物学家戴维·佩平 (David Pépin) 开始意识到，同样的技术也可用于诱导避孕。他的实验室正在研究一种鲜为人知的生殖激素，称为<small>AMH</small> （抗苗勒管激素），这种激素是由哺乳动物中容纳未成熟卵细胞的卵泡产生的。这些卵泡在卵巢内生长直到破裂，将它们的物质释放到输卵管中并进行潜在的受精。更成熟的卵泡会产生<small>AMH</small> ，以减缓留在卵巢中的卵子的生长。这种激素就像一个红色的交通灯，以确保成熟卵子的流动不会太快。</p><p class="article__body-text"> Pépin 博士得出结论，说服哺乳动物产生高于正常水平的<small>AMH——</small>通过插入正确类型的基因——可能会加强这种制动信号并完全停止卵泡的产生。在啮齿动物身上取得初步成功后，他与辛辛那提动物园和植物园的比尔·斯旺森 (Bill Swanson) 联手在猫身上测试这个想法。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp

年，研究人员向六只猫注射了一种无害病毒，该病毒含有猫科动物<small>AMH</small>基因的合成拷贝，另外三只对照组猫只注射了该病毒。他们选择的病毒能够将其有效载荷直接传递给猫的肌肉细胞。这些电池之所以理想，有两个原因。首先，肌肉细胞非常适合将<small>AMH</small>等激素泵入血液，然后进入全身器官，包括卵巢。</p><p class="article__body-text">其次，肌肉细胞在动物的一生中既不会死亡也不会分裂成两半。这确保了他们拥有的新基因不会随着时间的推移而消失——这对于永久绝育至关重要。这对于 Pépin 博士采用的交付机制尤为重要。虽然动物的大部分基因都包含在细胞核内的<small>DNA</small>链中，但<small>AMH</small>基因漂浮在细胞质中。尽管它位于非正统的位置，但它仍然能够指导细胞产生激素。</p><p class="article__body-text">所有九只猫——以美国总统夫人的名字命名——随后在两年的时间里对它们的粪便进行了监测，以便检查它们的生殖激素水平。为了确保正确的猫与正确的粪便相匹配，每只猫都被喂食带有不同颜色染料的食物，或者，对于一些非常棒的个体，喂食闪闪发光的食物。八个月后，然后在 20 个月后，将雄猫引入生活区，以便评估雌猫的繁殖模式。</p><p class="article__body-text">虽然三只对照猫（米歇尔、南希和罗莎琳）排卵并怀孕了，但注射了携带基因病毒的六只猫（贝蒂、多莉、杰奎琳、阿比盖尔、芭芭拉和玛丽）却没有。每个人的<small>AMH</small>水平比接受治疗前高出一千倍。四个甚至拒绝尝试繁殖，而仍然接受这个想法的两个没有怀孕。 “这些猫无法繁殖，”斯旺森博士总结道。</p><p class="article__body-text">虽然猫和啮齿动物的确切机制并不相同，但高水平的<small>AMH</small>似乎对这两个物种都有避孕作用。 Pépin 博士希望<small>AMH</small>也能成为人类避孕的有用目标——尽管是一种具有暂时效果的药丸，而不是永久性注射剂。目前，最常见的激素避孕药是复方避孕药，它含有雌激素和孕激素。这些限制了导致卵泡成熟的激素的释放，并使子宫入口处的粘液变稠，从而阻止精子通过。</p><p class="article__body-text">但是全身都有雌激素和孕激素受体，而不仅仅是在生殖系统中。合成激素也会影响这些。这是避孕药产生许多副作用的原因之一，包括情绪波动、恶心和头痛。人类的<small>AMH</small>受体更具特异性，主要存在于生殖系统中。因此，希望以<small>amh</small>为目标的避孕药可能具有更少的副作用。 <span

<small>ISHI SUNAK</small>梦想英国成为<small>人工智能</small>超级大国。总理表示，由于<small>GPT</small> -4 等大型语言模型的成功，这项技术成为全球关注的主题，可以释放经济增长并改善僵化的公共服务。如今，与<small>人工智能</small>相关的公告从唐宁街涌出，评论员跟不上。 3 月，英国财政大臣杰里米·亨特 (Jeremy Hunt) 发誓要在五年内花费 10 亿英镑（13 亿美元）用于人工智能和超级计算。 5 月，苏纳克先生在伦敦会见了领先的<small>人工智能</small>公司的老板。 6月7日，拜登在华盛顿拜访拜登时表示，英国将于今年秋天举办“首届全球人工智能峰会”。</p><p class="article__body-text">他最广泛的抱负是正确的。<small>人工智能</small>具有巨大的潜力，而英国拥有可以帮助它繁荣发展的优势。该国可以说是除中国和美国之外创办一家新技术公司的最重要地点。它是重要的<small>AI</small>机构的所在地，最著名的是位于伦敦的美国科技巨头 Alphabet 旗下的<small>AI</small>研究实验室 DeepMind 和生成式<small>AI</small>初创公司 Stability <small>AI</small> 。它的优秀大学培养出热衷于<small>AI</small>的有能力的毕业生。在伦敦，它也拥有吸引投资者和高技能移民的全球吸引力城市。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp

class="article__body-text">但是，尽管出于对这一重大新事物的所有善意热情，苏纳克先生的政府尚未面对现实：巨大的障碍仍然阻碍英国走向<small>人工智能的</small>成功之路。<small>人工智能</small>系统由三个要素构成：计算、干净的数据集以及知道如何大量处理这两者的人的工作。反过来，一个成功的行业需要正确的监管。英国在所有这些领域都面临着严重的困难需要克服，尤其是在前两个领域。</p><p class="article__body-text">最紧迫的问题是过度“计算”，<small>人工智能</small>研究人员使用这个术语来指代训练新型<small>人工智能</small>模型所需的重要基础设施、大量计算能力。三大云计算公司——亚马逊、谷歌、微软——都没有构建大型、先进的图形处理单元 ( <small>GPU</small> ) 集群，以便在英国进行大规模计算。这在一定程度上是因为英国的国内市场较小，而且无法进入家门口的大型市场。</p><p class="article__body-text">该国最有希望的<small>人工智能</small>公司 DeepMind 的命运说明了计算问题。 2014 年被谷歌（现为 Alphabet）收购时，它拥有大约 80 名员工，全部在伦敦。根据社交网站 LinkedIn 上显示的信息，如今它的规模要大得多，超过 15% 的员工在美国，大部分在 Alphabet 的总部。 - 媒体平台。对于 DeepMind 的创始人之一戴米斯·哈萨比斯 (Demis Hassabis) 而言，仅靠国内资源不可能实现这种增长：将其出售给谷歌的最紧迫原因是迫切需要访问用于训练 DeepMind 模型的计算能力。如今，DeepMind 在俄克拉荷马州训练其模型。大约十年前，DeepMind 面临的问题今天依然存在。遗憾的是，几乎没有采取任何措施来解决这一短缺问题。缺乏计算能力仍然是<small>人工智能</small>发展的最大问题，也是赢得苏纳克先生梦想的更广泛经济利益的最大问题。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J

亿英镑购买一台超级计算机，可能在爱丁堡并行计算中心，“因为<small>人工智能</small>需要计算能力”。 <small>EPCC</small>在科学研究超级计算方面确实是世界一流的。但是，可悲的是，并非所有这些马力都是平等的。新计算机要到 2026 年才能准备就绪，而且该中心在构建用于训练大型<small>AI</small>模型的<small>GPU</small>集群方面没有经验。虽然亚马逊、谷歌和微软（也称为超大规模应用程序）提供的云集群会定期更新最新的芯片，但相比之下， <small>EPCC</small>将只能使用它现在可以获得的任何<small>GPU</small> 。然后它将与他们一起生活到 2031 年，届时其资金将耗尽。那是<small>人工智能</small>时代的永恒。</p><h2>有马力的野兽</h2><p class="article__body-text">负责<small>EPCC</small>的著名计算机科学家马克·帕森斯 (Mark Parsons) 说超级计算机和<small>GPU</small>集群是越来越相似的野兽是正确的，但即使是他也承认政府计划有缺点。 “超大规模开发者以不断更新他们的<small>GPU</small>为荣，”他承认，并补充说这样做的成本太高，其他人无法匹敌。其他人则不太礼貌。一位了解所需数据、计算和技能组合的人脉广泛的技术人员表示，政府声称爱丁堡的一台功能强大的计算机将解决英国的计算问题是“近乎不诚实的”。</p><p class="article__body-text">存在另一种选择：租用计算。没有公司或政府机构被完全排除在使用<small>人工智能</small>之外。任何人（至少在全球芯片短缺最终缓解时）都可以在用于训练模型的云超级计算机上租用时间。任何人都可以下载 Common Crawl，这是一个用于训练<small>GPT</small> -4 的互联网级数据库，并开始训练模型。任何人都可以使用<small>GPT</small> -4 或许多优秀的开源模型来生成文本或代码。</p><p class="article__body-text"> “计算不像石油，”这位技术人员指出。 “你可以打电话给亚马逊并租用它。金钱可以完美连续地解决这个问题。这不是那种如果你不买就得不到的神奇东西，”他说。有些公司正是这样做的。 Stability 的老板 Emad Mostaque 说，他在伦敦的公司在亚马逊上训练模型<!-- -->例如，基于俄亥俄州和弗吉尼亚州的计算集群。</p><p class="article__body-text">问题在于 Stability 的行为更多的是例外而不是规则。很多时候，出于政治、国家安全、隐私或其他原因，英国官员或公司要求他们的数据留在国内。例如，国防部和<small>NHS</small>都不会将敏感数据上传到外国云。一家拥有多项公共部门合同的大型科技公司的老板描述了向超大规模企业“屈膝”，乞求在英国获得计算能力。他在荷兰或爱尔兰获得了<small>GPU</small>时间。但如果没有本地<small>GPU</small> ，他就无法帮助他的政府客户根据他们独特的数据集训练或运行<small>AI</small>模型。</p><p class="article__body-text">数据的敏感性也不是在国外租用计算的唯一缺点。在家里靠近计算机会带来真正的好处。<small>人工智能</small>工程师和公司通过定期试验获得专业知识。寻求创新的技术人员需要亲身实践的时间。 “A country generates large benefits beyond access from having technology assets physically located there. &#39;Learning by doing&#39; and the compounding of process knowledge is key to having a vibrant deep tech ecosystem and the high value jobs and companies that come with it,” says Matt Clifford, chair of the Advanced Research and Invention Agency, a government skunkworks that helps to fund research in tech. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The most ambitious progress, therefore, depends on getting hyperscalers to set up <small>GPU</small> clusters in Britain. So how to do that? In the first instance, says one tech boss, Mr Sunak should know better what to ask for. He could start by launching a “global lobbying unit” to press for Amazon, Google or Microsoft to set up shop. The government should consider what hyperscalers would need to build in Britain.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Building entire new datacentres is not necessary. Instead Amazon, Google or Microsoft could replace servers in their existing (older style) British-based centres with ones that include the new chips produced by Nvidia, ideally the latest <small>A</small> 100 or <small>H</small> 100 models. Obtaining those chips may be the biggest problem in the short term, given a global supply crunch.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Another challenge would be ensuring sufficient supplies of electricity, at low enough cost (and ideally green), because training <small>AI</small> models devours a lot of power. Such tasks don&#39;t look insurmountable, even if there would not be a quick fix. (Though it is hard to imagine it would take longer than building Mr Hunt&#39;s supercomputer). In the meantime Britain will have to limit itself to using foreign compute. </p><figure><meta itemprop="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1383/896/90/media-assets/image/20230617_BRD002.jpg"> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><img loading="lazy" width="1383" height="896" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1383/896/90/media-assets/image/20230617_BRD002.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/130/90/media-assets/image/20230617_BRD002.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/194/90/media-assets/image/20230617_BRD002.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/259/90/media-assets/image/20230617_BRD002.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/389/90/media-assets/image/20230617_BRD002.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/415/90/media-assets/image/20230617_BRD002.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/518/90/media-assets/image/20230617_BRD002.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/648/90/media-assets/image/20230617_BRD002.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/829/90/media-assets/image/20230617_BRD002.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> The longer the delay, however, the lower the chances of success. Without hyperscale <small>GPU</small> clusters, another set of British companies misses out: those attempting to supply picks and shovels in the <small>AI</small> boom. Nigel Toon, the boss of Graphcore, a young British company in Bristol which makes <small>AI</small> chips, notes that his American competitors have great advantages that he lacks in selling their products to local big stacks of compute.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Unsurprisingly, he also wants the new supercomputer in Edinburgh to favour British suppliers like his firm. The hour grows late, though. Sequoia, one of Graphcore&#39;s biggest investors, wrote down the value of its stake to zero in April. Meta, another American tech giant, has already scooped up some of the Graphcore team. The Bristol firm has plenty of cash in the bank, but desperately needs to get its chips into data centres.</p><p class="article__body-text"> After the difficulty of the compute desert, the other challenges look more manageable. One priority is improving the datasets available for <small>AI</small> developers. Those generated by public agencies should be the most appealing raw material for those working on <small>AI</small> . Unfortunately, they are too often a mess, including those within the <small>NHS</small> . Data to do with welfare are no better. Officials say that the computer systems running the Department of Work and Pensions are so feeble, for example, that six months are needed to adjust recipients&#39; benefits for inflation. Trying to build Benefits <small>GPT</small> atop a creaking 20th-century infrastructure looks like a fool&#39;s errand.</p><p class="article__body-text"> At least cleaning up the valuable datasets is within the control of the government. Officials could also look for benefits from generating new ones. “States don&#39;t leverage their only advantage: the sovereign right to produce data about things companies don&#39;t have,” says Benjamin Bratton, who has written a book on the state&#39;s relationship with tech. He observes that states have the means to “produce models of their societies”, but Britain&#39;s government (like most) lags behind tech companies in being able to model its own people&#39;s behaviour, the country&#39;s environment and resources.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The <small>NHS</small> is particularly ripe for a data retrofit, though the road to doing this is littered with the bodies of politicians and companies who tried and failed. <small>NHS IT</small> , an effort to centralise medical records that was launched in 2002, ate up at least £10bn before it was quietly dumped in 2011. New companies are popping up, attempting to solve the problem in a bitesize manner. At least one new startup wants to be paid to clean up government datasets, to make them useful for training <small>AI</small> models and to improve the more mundane services those data flows allow.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The last £100m of Mr Hunt&#39;s £1bn on <small>AI</small> may help with this. It is to be spent through a new Foundation Model Task-force. The outfit will focus both on finding ways to train big models for the public sector and on making “strategic investments in the full <small>AI</small> stack,” says an official. That is encouraging, even if the amount of money available is small; training a single large model once could eat up much of the funds Mr Hunt has set aside. “Sovereigns have the most interesting leverage on data, for sure,” says the official. The Task Force may direct some of money to kick-starting a data-hygiene industry, something for which there has not, to date, been a business model.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Making all of this happen in turn requires having enough skilled people around: British universities produce lots but, given the huge draw of Silicon Valley, there is also a steady flow of techies across the Atlantic. And as talent flows West, it takes its intellectual property along. “The reality is that the number of people who have seen <small>GPU</small> s melt because of 24/7 training jobs is very small,” says Nathan Beinich of Air Street Capital, a London <small>VC</small> firm. “Certainly they don&#39;t work for the government, and they can&#39;t be hired by the government to do a deal with the cloud vendors. These are the guys who know how it works.”</p><h2> Neither Wild West nor rabbit hole</h2><p class="article__body-text"> One step to better retaining talent (as well as attracting investors) is to get the regulation of <small>AI</small> right. This means avoiding the path that the European Union is expected to follow, with ever-expanding swathes of horizontal rules, ones that cut across sectors, on how <small>AI</small> can be used safely. Britain&#39;s existing sector-by-sector common-law approach, which would regulate different industries differently, looks like a better bet. Given global anxieties about the power and impact of <small>AI</small> ,<!-- --> “there&#39;s an opportunity for Britain to move quickly and establish itself as a pragmatic place,” says the tech boss who is struggling to access compute. Mr Sunak&#39;s summit in the autumn should be a good place to start. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> “I do buy the Sunak picture,” says the tech boss. “In keeping with common law. You have these context-specific regulators. You don&#39;t have broad cross-sectoral statutory regulations. The <small>EU</small> is not going to do it; it has disappeared down the <small>EU</small> rabbit hole and is going to be down there for a couple of years. The <small>US</small> is going to be the Wild West. Britain is the one place that&#39;s going to combine that concern around ethics of models and their application with a deep pragmatism and openness to innovation. We have courts and regulators that are globally respected.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Achieving more of this, and faster, also requires having more people in positions of power who understand computation. “We lack competence and confidence at the heart of government,” says one adviser. “The people who run compute policy in the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology really just don&#39;t understand it. They don&#39;t understand the difference between general and specific computing.” Hence the trumpeting of a supercomputer built by computer-science researchers as an answer to the country&#39;s <small>AI</small> woes.</p><p class="article__body-text"> For an example of what savvy techies with official support can do, look to the United Arab Emirates. Its government-backed Technology Innovation Institute used Amazon&#39;s cloud to train an open-source large language model called Falcon which is competitive with the best models trained by American companies, such as Open <small>AI</small> . <small>TII</small> grants access to its compute to people with new ideas for training models and starting companies. Every nerd in the world has taken notice, and many now contribute their brain power to a project whose benefits—such as attracting computer graduates to work on <small>AI</small> projects—broadly accrue to the <small>UAE</small> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> The closest thing Britain has to this is Stability, the startup whose models generate photorealistic images. Its open source Stable Diffusion model produces pictures which have driven the internet into a frenzy (think fake pictures of Donald Trump&#39;s arrest, or the pope in a Balenciaga jacket). But the gravity of America&#39;s tech scene is exerting itself on Stability. The firm started in London but the majority of its employees are now in America, according to LinkedIn data. American backers provided all of its most recent funding. Mr Sunak&#39;s route to British <small>AI</small> superpowerdom will not run along paths where the most promising companies add most of their jobs overseas. There is much to be done to make Britain more attractive, but the race has already begun and, for now, Britain lags. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 14 Jun 2023 16:55:45 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/pq125j8bicu2mhsvnqquqo7v77e83uo1</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/06/14/how-to-make-britains-ai-dreams-reality </item><item><title><![CDATA[How much is a human head?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Hand surgeons practice surgery techniques on donor hands from cadavers." fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BRP501.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BRP501.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BRP501.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BRP501.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BRP501.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BRP501.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BRP501.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BRP501.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BRP501.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BRP501.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 48en16">.css-48en16{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}</style><!-- --> <span class="css-48en16 e16qazw91">image: Alamy</span> </figcaption></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">A</span> <small>human head</small> will set you back about $640. An arm is less: that costs roughly $430. A leg, by contrast, is $1,600; while a torso costs around $2,000. A hand, however, is a mere $300. Postage and packaging, as so often online, add considerably to the cost of these American imports—at times to the tune of thousands of dollars. And not wholly without reason, for transporting fresh-frozen corpses can be tricky: they need a lot of ice. They can defrost at awkward moments. They can puzzle customs officials. But overall, human body parts come surprisingly cheap: getting an arm and a leg rarely costs an arm and a leg.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There exists a surprisingly lively international trade in dead human bodies for medical dissection. This trade is rarely discussed and relatively lightly regulated: there is no one head, or body, that directly oversees the imports of heads and bodies. This trade is also important, for it allows doctors to practise on real, dead humans before they practise on real, live ones.

A combination of sanctity and squeamishness meant dissection was forbidden in Britain until the 16th century, while an early attempt by two Edinburgh-based entrepreneurs, William Burke and William Hare, to invigorate the market in corpses (by killing people) merely sullied the reputation of anatomists. If death remains a taboo then the remains of the dead are even more of one. This is not, says Peter Dangerfield, the president of the British Association of Clinical Anatomists, “the sort of thing you&#39;d talk about over…dinner in the evening over a glass of wine”. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Which is a pity, as cutting up corpses matters. It is not essential to use dead bodies to teach medical students: computer generated anatomical simulations exist. But for all the digital brilliance there are still things that flesh and blood can do that computers cannot—such as making medics faint. Looking at a model “isn&#39;t quite the same as seeing the real thing in front of you”, says Professor Dangerfield. Corpses offer more muted emotions, too. To hold a human skull in your hands is, Hamlet-like, to be underwhelmed rather than awed. A head, emptied of human, is surprisingly small; you will have eaten from more substantial cereal bowls.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Bodies help with practical considerations as well as emotional ones. Textbooks tend to offer anatomy that is just that: textbook. Similarly, computer models, like the human kind, tend to have square jaws, broad shoulders and impressively toothy grins. Reality is much messier, and the visible variation on humans is as nothing compared with what lies beneath. Textbooks will tell you that there are three branches coming off the aorta but, says Claire Smith, head of anatomy at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, it is “really common to see four [or] to see two branches”. To do their job well, surgeons need to be aware of such variations in viscera.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The demand for bodies, then, is there—but in many countries it is not matched by supply. Around 1,300 donors (anatomists are careful to call the bodies “donors” rather than “cadavers”) are accepted each year in Britain. But not all that are donated can be used. Bodies might be rejected for many reasons, including being <small>HIV</small> positive; being too thin; too tall; too fat or having an open wound (embalming fluid pours out). At other times, demand can simply be too sudden to meet: finding 20 human heads in a hurry is hard.</p><h2> The invisible hand</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Which is where the international trade comes in. What determines whether a country is a net importer of body parts (like Britain) or exporter (like America) is chiefly what form of consent it allows. Britain allows only first-person consent, by which someone may donate their own body to science while of sound mind. America allows second-person consent, through which someone—or the state—can donate a deceased person on their behalf; in some places, dead prisoners can legally be used.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Second-person consent has its advantages. Give up a relative and you save on funeral fees (the cost of dying, like the cost of living, has risen) and also on bother, for such companies are slick operators. “If you are calling for a patient or a loved one that has passed away…” says a softly-spoken American voice message of one bodybroker, “please press &#39;one&#39; now.” Technically, such companies do not sell bodies; they merely charge (high) fees for procuring, handling and shipping them. But to use them is, for British doctors “a last-resort sort of situation” says Professor Dangerfield. Until recently, they had little alternative. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> That is changing. At the end of an underwhelming looking corridor in Nottingham City Hospital, behind a clinical white door, is a large white room. Its temperature is a refreshingly cool 18°C; its smell is cleanly chemical; its air hums quietly with the sound of refrigeration. It might be a commercial kitchen—but on a steel tray, beneath a shroud-like covering, lies a body. And in the freezers around its walls are human legs, arms, heads and torsos.</p><p class="article__body-text"> This is the National Repository Centre, created in 2011 by a Scottish shoulder surgeon, Angus Wallace, because he was “unhappy about…the principle of buying body parts from other countries”. After a slow start (people were “very cautious”) he eventually obtained the support of his hospital—and a relationship with a local frozen food delivery company (“Obviously they weren&#39;t allowed to transport body parts at the same time.”) The pioneering Repository is the result.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Practically, what the Repository does is similar to American firms: it stores bodies, en masse, for surgeons who need them. The cost of British parts is (depending on currency movements) slightly lower than American ones: a head is £500; a leg £650. Just as in America, the cost of each part generally depends on its size: parts tend to be costed by the kilo rather than by any more emotional evaluation. A leg is pricier because it is bigger, says Steve Gill, an intensive-care consultant and the current head of the Repository.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But legally, and arguably ethically, Nottingham is different. The Repository (unlike American firms) is not for profit and all its donors are just that—willing, first-person benefactors. Like America, it does not technically sell body parts. Instead, it merely loans them: when surgeons have finished with the parts they are sent back to Nottingham; each body is gathered together, cremated and given a committal service. And its transport costs are startlingly small by comparison: tens of pounds rather than thousands.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Speak to British medical professionals and they explain that they prefer to use the Repository because it feels more ethical. Yet there remains a hint of hard-headed commercialism. Another reason that British surgeons instantly preferred his Repository was, as Professor Wallace points out, because “we were cheaper”. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 14 Jun 2023 16:13:20 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/8ciqd3rbobdnjp2t9b6ofv887jt8v2v5</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/06/14/how-much-is-a-human-head </item><item><title><![CDATA[How do languages with grammatical gender handle non-binary people?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Trans rights activists gathered to demonstrate during a ''Trans Day of Vengeance'' in Hollywood, California." fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_BLP503.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_BLP503.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_BLP503.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_BLP503.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_BLP503.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_BLP503.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_BLP503.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_BLP503.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_BLP503.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_BLP503.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">W</span> <small>HAT ARE YOUR</small> pronouns? In English, the most common answers are “he” or “she”. But a growing number of people identify as neither male nor female, and ask to be <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/01/20/personal-pronouns-are-changing-fast">referred to with novel pronouns</a> . “They” is by far the <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2017/04/01/english-has-a-traditional-solution-to-gender-neutral-pronouns">most common</a> of these. In English, the linguistic adjustments required to accommodate non-binary people are relatively limited. For gendered languages, gender-neutral options are a bigger problem. How do these languages handle the issue?</p><p class="article__body-text"> Movements to make gendered languages less sexist have <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/01/18/the-hopeless-struggle-to-make-german-gender-neutral">existed for years</a> . Many languages have a “default masculine”, where a generic (say) student or professor is given masculine gender and mixed groups are referred to with masculine adjectives. Efforts to promote change in different countries are sparking opposition from linguistic conservatives. Berlin&#39;s mayor recently said he would refuse to sign documents using new plural endings designed to include both women and men. Germany&#39;s main opposition leader has claimed that such language is driving voters to the far right. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The push to accommodate non-binary people has in some cases piggybacked on these earlier campaigns for gender neutrality. Nearly all European languages (descended from a common ancestor) have two or three genders, and the “neuter” gender is not normally used for humans. French uses the interpunct, a kind of floating dot, to insert the feminine ending into the generic masculine: <i>prêt·e·s</i> means “ready”, and is intended to include both men and women and, presumably, those who identify as neither. But it is pronounced identically to prêts, the masculine word. As in German, no easy alternative has emerged.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Spanish activists have found a more elegant fix. They use -e endings on nouns and adjectives, in contrast to the usual -o (masculine) and -a (feminine); the pronoun elle resembles <i>él</i> (he) and <i>ella</i> (she) and is used by some non-binary people. In Swedish <i>han</i> (he) and <i>hon</i> (she) have been joined by <i>hen</i> . It serves for both non-binary people and as the gender-neutral pronoun in sentences like “If a customer has a complaint <i>they</i> should put it in writing.” It was coined decades ago, but came to prominence after it was used in a children&#39;s book in 2012. Data show that in 2018 it was about one-hundredth as frequent as <i>han</i> and <i>hon</i> put together, on an upward trend from previous years.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some languages have a head start when it comes to accommodating non-binary people. Many—including Estonian, Chinese and Hungarian—have one word that means both “he” and “she”. Still, there can be wrinkles. In Mandarin the word tā is written using different characters for “he” (他) and “she” (她). They differ in the “radical” element, the part of the character that carries the general area of meaning: “he” has a “person” radical, while “she” has a “woman” radical. Some non-binary people have begun using a roman-alphabet TA or X in place of that radical, next to the remainder of the character. Others have tried to craft new Chinese-style characters. But the People&#39;s Republic, which has little time for transgender rights, is cold to any such ideas. If linguistic accommodations for non-binary people are to catch on, they must be used by large numbers of people, such that they become commonplace—and it helps a great deal if they are easy to say. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 14 Jun 2023 15:29:35 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/8fjurno4faies84hl1u818595ch3lde8</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/06/14/how-do-languages-with-grammatical-gender-handle-non-binary-people </item><item><title><![CDATA[“The Full Monty” gang are back]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Robert Carlyle, Steve Huison, Hugo Speer, Paul Barberin The Full Monty film." fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP506.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP506.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP506.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP506.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP506.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP506.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP506.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP506.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP506.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP506.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 48en16">.css-48en16{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}</style><!-- --> <span class="css-48en16 e16qazw91">image: REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">U</span> <small>nemployment, attempted</small> suicide, sexual dysfunction, the impending repossession of a sunbed: in “The Full Monty” all manner of woes inspired six former steelworkers to strip to their birthday suits for a raucous paying audience.

At the same time the mood is much grimmer than the original&#39;s, and not only because everyone keeps their clothes on. The film had decay and despair but also the gentleness of a fable. Here, beneath the antics and confectionary, the wider world is desolate. The school&#39;s ceilings leak. Hospitals are creaking. The welfare system is a cruel obstacle course. People go hungry. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> As a result, the tone whiplashes between doleful and cute, the comedy veering from whimsical to screwball to macabre. Dramatic tension suffers. For all the post-Thatcher political consciousness, the real battle in 1997 was between the six men and themselves. Several almost pulled out of the striptease because of their neuroses, psychological or anatomical. Baring all became, for them, a sort of gaudy apotheosis.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In the new series, the antagonist is the pitiless, skinflint state, a foe you can dodge and bait but not defeat. The clock the men race is the tick-tock of mortality. “Tomorrow&#39;s another day. Might be shit too,” Gaz tells Des, expressing the limit of the drama&#39;s optimism, “but at least shit in a different way.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> As for the thongs and Velcro-seamed trousers: this show knows it can&#39;t dance in the same dole queue twice, and doesn&#39;t try to. Nods to the gyrations of yore are sparing; only one scene comes close to reprising the old routine, and then in circumstances bleak enough for <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2011/09/24/man-of-words">Beckett</a> . Instead it updates and amplifies the politics and deepens the characters.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Does it work? It grows on you. And there is a brave kind of integrity in this approach to making a sequel. Most sequels run on nostalgia, peddling the dual pleasures of a gauzily revisited past and a sense of progress and resolution. Boldly, “The Full Monty” offers little of either. The past is past and, even with the crutches of friendship and gallows humour, the present is scarcely a remedy. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 14 Jun 2023 15:07:53 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/akqd7usp673dis16fm6e6eiapg2jlflj</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/06/14/the-full-monty-gang-are-back </item><item><title><![CDATA[Cormac McCarthy was the great novelist of the American West]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP507.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP507.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP507.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP507.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP507.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP507.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP507.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP507.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP507.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_CUP507.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 48en16">.css-48en16{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}</style><!-- --> <span class="css-48en16 e16qazw91">image: Getty Images</span> </figcaption></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">W</span> <small>ILLIAM FAULKNER</small> is the bard of the American South. Saul Bellow is the supreme chronicler of Chicago. New York is contested territory. For a long time, Wallace Stegner could have laid claim to the West. But that was before Cormac McCarthy hit his stride.</p><p class="article__body-text"> To understand the <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/12/05/dreams-of-el-dorado-is-a-rollicking-flawed-history-of-america">American West</a> , you need to know the land and its beautiful, terrifying expanse, as Stegner did. But in his fiction Mr McCarthy, who died on June 13th at the age of 89, grasped and dramatised another essential truth: that the West was won with violence. The saga of the region&#39;s piecemeal incorporation into America involved bravery, gumption and careful planning—but also decades of brutal, intimate bloodshed. It haunts every strip mall and stylish restaurant and housing development from Kansas City to Los Angeles and beyond. This was Mr McCarthy&#39;s subject: the reality and implacability of cruelty and conflict. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The great theme of his career is all the more striking because this was not his native territory. He was born in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1933 with the first name Charles. At some point he changed it to Cormac, supposedly in honour of an Irish ruler, and he grew up mostly in Knoxville, Tennessee. His early novels—“The Orchard Keeper” (published in 1965), “Child of God” and “Suttree”—were deeply Faulknerian: arch, self-referential and largely plotless.</p><p class="article__body-text"> He gained fame with his “Border trilogy”: “All the Pretty Horses” (1992), “The Crossing” and “Cities of the Plain”. Like all his fiction these were demanding stories, but they won him a wider readership, especially “All the Pretty Horses”. Elegant and well plotted, it was made into a film starring Matt Damon and Penélope Cruz at the start of their careers. The best book in the trilogy was the last. It was austere, bloody and hopeless, as the West had been for those on the losing end of its conquest.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The best film adaptation of Mr McCarthy&#39;s work was the Coen brothers&#39; version of “No Country for Old Men”, a slim, propulsive, noirish novel published in 2005. A wonderful film that was true to the author&#39;s vision, it featured commanding performances from Josh Brolin as the foolish hero; Javier Bardem as his psychopathic nemesis; and Tommy Lee Jones, who imbues the sheriff of the story with a world-redeeming, plain-spoken goodness. Published in 2006, and recounting the plight of a father and son in a post-apocalyptic world, <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2013/05/17/cormac-mccarthys-bleak-road">“The Road”</a> won a Pulitzer prize and also became a film.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But Mr McCarthy&#39;s best novel—and arguably the best work of fiction written in English in the past 50 years—was “Blood Meridian”. Its narrator, “the kid”, joins a gang of Apache hunters who are hired to collect scalps at $100 apiece. Despite his deeds the kid, like Mr Jones&#39;s sheriff, has a stubborn decency, though it proves no match for his milieu. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Mr McCarthy based the book in part on the real-life Glanton Gang, scalp-hunters who haunted what is now Sonora, New Mexico, and bits of Arizona. It features one of literature&#39;s most pitiless and vibrant depictions of vice, in the form of a quasi-mythical character, fat and hairless, who becomes the novel&#39;s amoral centre. Its plot is relentlessly violent, the language almost biblical. Finishing it takes determination; at times it seems perversely intent on persuading readers to give up. The baroque descriptions of gore include a tree with dead babies hanging from the branches and a head split open “to the thrapple”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Persist: “Blood Meridian” makes art out of man&#39;s inhumanity to man. To read it is to know what not to do and how not to live, but also to confront an aspect of the past that all Americans inherit. It is not exactly redemptive; rather it bears witness. Mr McCarthy does not look away. He never did.</p><p class="article__body-text"> He lived a deeply unliterary life in the south-west, preferring the company of scientists to authors. He gave few interviews and appeared uninterested in fame (though the daring of his books suggests a fierce ambition). If his <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/17/cormac-mccarthy-returns-with-two-new-novels">last two novels</a> , published in 2022, were too abstract and psychological for some, they were also works of striking vibrancy and originality from an author who was nearly 90. In his mature prose Mr McCarthy was wholly himself, original and distinctive. For a novelist there is no higher praise. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 14 Jun 2023 14:38:24 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/timqlo1440hp1vdcsli01b6knq9g9eps</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/06/14/cormac-mccarthy-was-the-great-novelist-of-the-american-west </item><item><title><![CDATA[A selection of novels to read this spring]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="A free beach library at the Black Sea resort of Albena in Bulgaria." fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 48en16">.css-48en16{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}</style><!-- --> <span class="css-48en16 e16qazw91">image: Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></section><p class="article__body-text"> <b>Birnam Wood</b> .

Birnam Wood is a witchy guerrilla gardening group run by Mira Bunting, a charismatic horticulturist, and her sidekick, Shelley Noakes. For years the group has cultivated small plots of urban land in Christchurch, New Zealand. Their equipment is salvaged and they barter what they grow. Mira works full time for the collective. Her ambition is for it to make “radical, widespread and lasting social change”. When an area of rich arable land is abandoned, Mira senses that Birnam Wood may have found its playground. But someone else is interested: Robert Lemoine, an American tycoon with a calculating mind and a preternaturally calm exterior. “Birnam Wood” is distinguished by its character studies: Ms Catton, who won the Booker prize in 2013 for “ <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2014/02/24/lit-up-by-the-luminaries">The Luminaries</a> ”, skewers anti-capitalist activists with the same relish she exhibits in chewing up the billionaire class. <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/03/09/in-birnam-wood-eleanor-catton-returns-with-a-thriller">Read our full review</a> . </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> <b>Chlorine</b> .

But for Ren Yu, the teenage narrator of “Chlorine”, such tales misunderstand their otherworldly powers. Ren should know, since she insists she is a mermaid herself. “Mermaids are not born. We are made,” she announces. A straight-A student, star swimmer and immigrant misfit, she longs to escape her human body. Her swimming coach is lecherous and her emotionally aloof mother shows her love through cut-up fruit and high expectations. Her father is back in China, having buckled under the weight of learning English. Ms Song is good on the growing pains of young adulthood. This is a book that enlivens its coming-of-age yarn with a touch of mystery and a twist of myth. “Outwardly, I studied,” says Ren. “Inwardly, I sought the weightlessness of water, to be as liberated as the aquatic beings in my imagination.” <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/03/23/the-narrator-of-chlorine-longs-to-escape-her-human-body">Read our full review</a> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>The Five Sorrowful Mysteries of Andy Africa.</b> By Stephen Buoro. <i>Bloomsbury; 313 pages; £16.99</i></p><p class="article__body-text"> “Life in Africa is a long prayer,” reckons the hero of Stephen Buoro&#39;s debut novel. On the road, people pray that they will avoid accidents; if they crash, they pray the hospitals will be functioning. Their prayers mostly go unanswered, but still they pray. Andy Africa is a 15-year-old semi-believing Christian boy from the mainly Muslim north-west of Nigeria. His devoted Mama has brought him up on her own, making ends meet by running a small photography studio opposite the local brothel. He spends his days with his “droogs”, Slim and Morocca. He philosophises about black power and mathematics and fantasises about white girls. Temptation comes in the form of Eileen, a preacher&#39;s niece. The course of true love does not run smooth. Mr Buoro is a writer of imagination and flair and Andy Africa is an unforgettable character: an old soul, goofy and generous, who dreams his evanescent dreams while battling his friends&#39; joshing and his own longings. <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/04/05/wit-and-wisdom-in-the-five-sorrowful-mysteries-of-andy-africa">Read our full review</a> . </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> <b>A History of Burning.</b> By Janika Oza. <i>Grand Central Publishing; 400 pages; $29.

Pirbhai&#39;s life in India ends when, at 13, he is tricked and taken to Kenya and forced into servitude. One morning he is tasked with burning down the huts of a village—an act that will haunt him throughout his life. Pirbhai marries another Indian in Kenya, and the pair move to Uganda and start a family. Their eldest daughter, Latika, works as a journalist, reporting on the feverish state of the nation. Then <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/02/29/two-exhibitions-explore-dark-moments-in-ugandas-past">Idi Amin</a> seizes power and declares that “Asians have milked the cow but did not feed it.” The family flees to Canada but Latika opts to stay behind. Ms Oza&#39;s own family was expelled by Amin. She dramatises this moment of history in a series of well-drawn scenes that convey terror, injustice and brutality. Pirbhai&#39;s son pithily sums up the predicament: “Too Indian for Africa, too African for India.” <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/11/janika-ozas-debut-novel-charts-the-indian-diasporas-struggles">Read our full review</a> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>The Guest.</b> By Emma Cline. <i>Random House; 304 pages; $28.

Alex is not just down on her luck; she is completely out of options. Her work as an escort is not proving lucrative. She has been kicked out of her shared flat for stealing. Simon, an older man, offers salvation in the form of a stay in his beach house for the summer. But Alex is unable to make the good times last. High on painkillers, she crashes Simon&#39;s car. She is soon cast out of this home, too. She survives by adapting to the opportunities presented to her. She ingratiates herself first with a group of partygoers, then a kindly housekeeper, then a troubled teenage boy. By the end of the novel, Alex&#39;s sense of self has been eroded entirely. “Maybe she was the ghost she had always imagined herself to be,” Ms Cline writes. “Maybe it was a relief.” <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/18/in-emma-clines-new-novel-a-young-woman-loses-control-of-her-life">Read our full review</a> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>Tomás Nevinson.</b> By Javier Marías. <i>Translated by Margaret Jull Costa. Knopf; 656 pages; $32.50. Hamish Hamilton; £22.00</i></p><p class="article__body-text"> When Javier Marías died in 2022 he left a richly beguiling and original body of work. The Spanish author&#39;s final book revisits characters from “ <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2018/09/07/a-magical-novel-about-michelangelo">Berta Isla</a> ”, published in 2017. Tomás Nevinson&#39;s days in the British Secret Service are over. Back in Madrid, the half-English, half-Spanish former spy is trying to rebuild his life. But his old handler, Bertram Tupra, tempts him with one last assignment. His mission requires Tomás to go undercover and find out which of three women is a terrorist with ETA, a Basque separatist group. He watches the women for clues that might betray past crimes. But then Tupra, impatient for results, changes the rules. Those who prefer their espionage thrillers lean may be put off by this hulking tome. But “Tomás Nevinson” is a different kind of spy novel. It unfolds in meandering yet mesmerising sentences. The author&#39;s trademark literary allusions, historical references and philosophical debates all feature. Seamlessly translated by Margaret Jull Costa, this final work is a stimulating drama by a master of his craft. <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/25/in-javier-mariass-final-novel-an-agent-confronts-his-conscience">Read our full review</a> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> <i>Read a <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2023/03/10/a-selection-of-novels-to-read-this-spring" data-tegid="ub0v4vrnh99ck3sif8v3ilh1s9avfnlq">selection of novels</a> published at the beginning of 2023.</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 14 Jun 2023 14:18:36 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/mvhkmpossrgfau5lri21q1f9452afvvl</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2023/06/14/a-selection-of-novels-to-read-this-spring </item><item><title><![CDATA[The great global baby bust is under way]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-phnw8u ex4i8i00"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img theme="[object Object]" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 1440px) 700px, (min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 960px) 66vw, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/256/144/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/360/202/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/384/216/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/480/270/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/337/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/834/469/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/960/540/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1096/616/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/801/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/801/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></div><style data-emotion="css tati6o">.css-tati6o{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-4);font-weight:normal;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-upper);}.css-tati6o a{-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);display:block;}.css-tati6o a:hover,.css-tati6o a:hover .efv3iwx0{color:var(--ds-color-chicago-30);-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;}.css-tati6o a:focus,.css-tati6o a:focus .efv3iwx0{background-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-95);color:var(--ds-color-london-5);outline:none;-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;}.css-tati6o a:active,.css-tati6o a:active .efv3iwx0{color:var(--ds-color-chicago-30);}.css-tati6o a::before{bottom:0;content:'';display:block;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;right:0;text-indent:-999em;top:0;white-space:nowrap;z-index:1;}.css-tati6o+.e1dj3j7p0,.css-tati6o+style+.e1dj3j7p0{margin-top:0.5rem;}.e1wqg93o0 .css-tati6o+.e1dj3j7p0{margin-top:0;}</style><h3 class="css-tati6o eifj80y0"> <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/06/13/england-may-soon-become-the-worlds-best-cricket-team" data-analytics="more_from:headline_1">England may soon become the world&#39;s best cricket team</a> </h3><style data-emotion="css 1tj7b79">.css-1tj7b79{color:var(--ds-color-london-10);font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);max-width:43.75rem;font-size:1.125rem;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);}.e13odduf0 .css-1tj7b79{font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-2);}</style><p class="css-1tj7b79 e1dj3j7p0"> Winning the Ashes would propel them past India and Australia</p><p class="article__body-text"> <small><span data-caps="initial">“H</span> OW PARAMOUNT</small> the future is to the present, when one is surrounded by children,” wrote Charles Darwin in 1852, reflecting on his own parenthood.

Some long-running demographic trends are changing, too. Educated women have for decades<!-- --> tended to have fewer children. But fertility among the less educated is now falling. On a global level the link between national incomes and fertility rates has also weakened. India&#39;s fertility rate, for example, fell below 2.1 in 2020, despite a gross domestic product of less than $3,000 per person. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> All of this poses a huge <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/30/its-not-just-a-fiscal-fiasco-greying-economies-also-innovate-less">economic challenge</a> . In parts of the world where birth rates were already low, the shortfall of young employees, who are needed to subsidise the retired, will be felt keenly. In China, the number of workers aged between 21 and 30 has already declined from 232m in 2012, to 181m in 2021. By the mid-2050s the <small>UN</small> forecasts there will be fewer than 100m (see chart on the right). China&#39;s one-child—and later two-child—policy has contributed to the country&#39;s decline in young workers. Recent history has shown that it is much more difficult to raise fertility levels than it is to crush them in the first place. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 14 Jun 2023 11:10:55 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/4lvl65kpo3j7e23t9qlfivb5bnioksqo</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/06/14/the-great-global-baby-bust-is-under-way </item><item><title><![CDATA[A return to war has looming global economic consequences]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p class="article__body-text"> CONFLICT IN UKRAINE has cut short the “peace dividend” the world was reaping.

Joe Biden, America&#39;s president, is throwing a formal banquet for him at the White House. The leaders of the two chambers of Congress, not to be outdone, have invited him to address a joint session for the second time—an honour previously accorded only to the likes of Winston Churchill. The visit will, in the words of a gushing White House press release, “affirm the deep and close partnership between the United States and India”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In fact, the partnership between India and America has never been that deep or close. But America&#39;s leaders, both Republican and Democrat, would like it to be. They see India as an indispensable ally in their growing rivalry with China. After all, India recently became the world&#39;s most populous country. Its foreign policy has become more assertive and more hostile to China of late, even if it remains opposed to the idea of an American-led order. Its diaspora is the world&#39;s biggest, and also <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2023/06/12/indias-diaspora-is-bigger-and-more-influential-than-any-in-history">remarkably influential</a> . But India&#39;s allure as an ally also rests on the sense that its economy may finally be starting to fulfil its potential. It is already the world&#39;s fifth-biggest. Mr Modi has promised growth of a sort that would turn it into pillar of the world economy, on a par with America, China or the European Union. Despite the many failings of his government&#39;s economic management, it is not an implausible target. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> India&#39;s economy will boom, Mr Modi&#39;s lieutenants argue, because of its young workforce, his muscular industrial policy and the opportunities presented by Western firms&#39; sudden wariness of China. Many high-flying businessmen are persuaded. Tim Cook, Apple&#39;s boss, who has just opened its first store in India, declared to investors last month, “The dynamism in the market, the vibrancy, are unbelievable…India is at a tipping point.” Days later Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics firm, broke ground on a $500m factory in India. India&#39;s <small>GDP</small> grew by 6.1% in the first quarter, year-on-year. Investment as a share of <small>gdp</small> is at its highest for over a decade.</p><p class="article__body-text"> There is no shortage of sceptics. Some point to cronyism and protectionism, which hold the economy back; others complain that dodgy statistics exaggerate its growth. It was hit badly during the pandemic, causing enduring suffering among the poor. Westerners see Mr Modi&#39;s erosion of democratic norms and growing sectarianism as potential threats to growth. Chinese officials, meanwhile, think India is not authoritarian enough. In March your correspondent heard one tell an audience of global bosses that India&#39;s linguistic diversity, its layers of legislation and its poorly educated workers made it an unattractive place to do business.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But for India to become a pillar of the world economy, no miraculous improvement on all these scores is required. It just needs to keep growing at roughly its present pace. Goldman Sachs projects India&#39;s <small>GDP</small> will overtake the euro area&#39;s in 2051 and America&#39;s by 2075. That assumes a growth rate of 5.8% for the next five years, 4.6% in the 2030s and lower beyond.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Goldman&#39;s confidence rests partly on demography. Whereas the workforces of China and the <small>eu</small> will shrink as their populations age, India&#39;s will keep growing until the late 2040s, according to projections from the <small>oecd</small> , a club mostly of rich countries. The expanding supply of labour accounts for a full percentage point in Goldman&#39;s forecast for annual economic growth over the next five years. India will however, remain relatively poor. Even by 2075 its output per person will be 45% lower than China&#39;s and about 75% below America&#39;s. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> In 1700 India accounted for 24% of world <small>GDP</small> , more than China (this figure uses purchasing power parity; all others in this article use market exchange rates). It fell to a humiliating low of 1% in 1993 after a financial crisis. Since then it has grown relatively fast, a trend that has continued since Mr Modi&#39;s election in 2014. India now accounts for 3.6% of global <small>GDP</small> , the same as China in 2000. By 2028, the <small>IMF</small> forecasts, it will hit 4.2%, overtaking Germany and Japan. India&#39;s heft is rising in other ways, too: its stockmarket is the fourth biggest after those of America, China and Japan. Its exports of goods and services relative to its <small>GDP</small> are not far from the annual all-time high. They have grown by 73% over the past decade and as a result India&#39;s share of global exports has gone from 1.9% in 2012 to 2.4% in 2022.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Transport infrastructure has <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/03/13/india-is-getting-an-eye-wateringly-big-transport-upgrade">improved dramatically</a> under Mr Modi and his recent predecessors. Investment in it has more than tripled as a share of <small>GDP</small> compared with the mid-2010s. The length of the road network has increased by about 25% to 6m kilometres since 2014. The number of airports has doubled—and many of the new ones rival the slickest in the rich world. Digital infrastructure has also blossomed, with a total of 816m broadband connections as of last year and a range of state-sponsored digital services from e-banking to welfare payments that reach hundreds of millions of people. There is a big buildout of energy infrastructure, too: India will add more solar generating capacity in 2023 than anywhere else bar America and China, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.</p><p class="article__body-text"> India is unusually reliant on services for a developing economy: they account for about 40% of all exports. That makes India the world&#39;s seventh-largest exporter of services, accounting for 4.5% of the global total, up from 3.2% a decade ago. Its big tech-services firms have been on a growth spurt since the pandemic began, hiring eagerly and honing their software, which is sold around the world. Diaspora links to Silicon Valley help maintain the pace of innovation and support a nascent startup culture.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The catch is that the <small>IT</small> services industry, while earning a huge $200bn-odd in export revenues, directly employs a mere 5m or so people. Indeed, out of a total of over 900m people of working age in India, only roughly half participate in the labour force and perhaps 60m have formal jobs. One way to remedy this would be to create far more blue-collar employment by fostering manufacturing. This has been a preoccupation of Indian policymaking for three decades.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Modi&#39;s manufacturing push, under the slogan “Make in India”, aims to seize on Western firms&#39; desire to diversify their supply chains away from China. India&#39;s infrastructure has improved, it offers a sizeable domestic market and it is awash with potential workers. An <small>IMF</small> study published in April concluded that India would be one of the few places to benefit if supply chains are reforged on either side of the geopolitical divide. To that end, Mr Modi launched a $33bn subsidy scheme in 2020, using “production-linked incentives” ( <small>PLI</small> s), which reward firms in 14 industries, from pharmaceuticals to solar panels, if their sales reaches certain targets. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Some manufacturing is booming: exports of machinery, electronics and vehicles or parts have risen by 63% in the past five years and have become a fifth of the total. Apple now assembles 7% of its handsets in India, according to Bloomberg. India&#39;s domestic conglomerates, including Tata Group, are investing in electronics. Nonetheless, although <small>PLI</small> s have prompted plenty of announcements, actual capital deployed so far is probably below $10bn. One big project, a $19bn semiconductor plant in Gujarat, has stalled, according to some reports.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Manufacturing grew by only 4.5% year on year in the last quarter of 2022, and as a share of <small>GDP</small> , at 17%, is only a little above the average for the past decade. About a third of the increase in exports of goods by value since 2019 reflects India&#39;s growing purchases of Russian oil, some of which is refined and re-exported. Vietnam has captured more activity displaced from China than India, whose share of global goods exports has risen only marginally, to 1.8% in 2022 from 1.6% in 2012. In short, there is no big bang in manufacturing in India, although steady growth may continue.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Is this unusual pattern of growth sustainable? Elements of the formula are enduring, including an abundant workforce, strong elite education, an entrepreneurial culture and valuable links with an influential diaspora. Mr Modi is expected to win a third term in office next year. That will provide continuity in economic policymaking at the central level, especially for the infrastructure splurge. The closer relations with America that he is pursuing are also helpful for the economy. America, after all, is the buyer of many of India&#39;s exports of services. And with a relatively closed banking system India will continue to rely on Western networks for cross-border payments.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Meanwhile financial instability, a frequent plague in the past, seems less of a risk. The <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/05/11/indias-once-troubled-banks-are-generating-huge-profits">banking system</a> has been cleaned up and corporate debt is low. Like China, India has large reserves of foreign exchange. It also inhibits foreign investment in its banks and government-debt markets to diminish the risk of destabilising capital flight. An attack by short-sellers in January on <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/03/16/can-gautam-adani-ride-out-the-storm">Adani Group</a> , a well-connected conglomerate, revealed flaws in India&#39;s capital markets, such as opaque governance, but also a degree of resilience: they quickly shrugged off the episode.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But three big threats do loom. First, the boom in <small>IT</small> services could run out of steam. India&#39;s tech firms have access to a huge pool of skilled labour, and so have adopted a labour-intensive model. But new technology, including artificial intelligence, could undermine this strategy. In preparation, many are diversifying into new businesses, such as accounting and management consulting. Such non-tech services made up about a fifth of total services exports in the last quarter.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The second risk is that Mr Modi&#39;s promotion of domestic champions and erosion of institutions, including the courts, may begin to deter foreign investment. Many Chinese tech firms have been banned. Multinationals increasingly feel the need to strike deals with big domestic firms: Holcim, a European cement firm, sold its Indian arm to Adani; Meta invests in Reliance Industries, which has a large digital arm.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Fear of an uneven playing field may explain why gross inflows of foreign direct investment have slowed from a rough average of $7bn a month for the past few years to below $5bn in February and March. There are other signs of tentativeness from big foreign investors. We examined the exposure to India of the four global banks most active there, which often cater to multinationals. On average their exposure to India fell 11% in 2022 in dollar terms.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But India&#39;s government probably reckons that in the longer term it is big enough to draw Western firms, however warped the rules of the game. Their subsidiaries there have sales of almost a quarter of a trillion dollars. Over the past five years the profits of all multinationals in India rose by 80% to $56bn according to our analysis of central-bank data. That&#39;s enough to compensate for a lot of headaches.</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>The social contract</b></p><p class="article__body-text"> The final risk is that India&#39;s implicit strategy of “trickle-down” economics causes a popular backlash. Instead of manufacturing jobs, it relies on wealth from the relatively small amount of formal industry to flow through the economy to benefit a bigger share of the population, who are often poorly educated. This is not necessarily pie in the sky: as more housing is built for the well-off, for example, the construction industry is growing fast, drawing in unskilled workers. And part of Mr Modi&#39;s agenda has been to augment trickle-down economics. The government has forced hordes of tiny, previously unregistered firms to start paying tax, giving them an incentive to consolidate, formalise and invest. India&#39;s digital welfare schemes have made the provision of aid to the poor more consistent and efficient, and could be used to supplement incomes on a bigger scale.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Still, if the aspirations of India&#39;s vast army of the underemployed are not at least partially satisfied, India&#39;s growth is likely to suffer. Even if widespread social unrest is averted, it may be because politicians try to satisfy or deflect frustration in unhelpful ways. Mr Modi has combined economic modernisation with illiberalism and religious chauvinism. To placate the jobless, he and his successors might become even more repressive and sectarian. Public opinion could also turn against economic openness. And the Western countries to which India is drawing closer could be put off by such developments. India&#39;s economic rise is real, and probably durable, but not without its pitfalls. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 13 Jun 2023 21:51:25 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/3dmscpaqjmps4u6kigpuul99i01i8atq</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/06/13/america-is-courting-india-in-part-for-its-growing-economic-clout</item></channel></rss>
