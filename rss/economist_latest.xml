class="css-13k2iu7 e1e9ys590"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">了解有关以色列和哈马斯之间战争的更多信息：</p></aside><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>我的</span><small>以色列人倾向于</small>在战争时期团结起来。 10 月 7 日，统治该<a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/11/a-hamas-leader-refuses-to-admit-his-group-planned-to-kill-civilians">飞地</a>的伊斯兰运动哈马斯从加沙发动了可怕的<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/10/08/the-lessons-from-hamass-assault-on-israel">恐怖袭击</a>，正是在这个因本雅明·内塔尼亚胡右翼政府的司法改革而分裂了数月的国家中，促成了这种团结。 10 月 11 日，内塔尼亚胡同意与第二大反对党领袖本尼·甘茨组建紧急战时内阁。作为前国防部长和以色列武装部队指挥官，甘茨将为以色列政府提供重要的影响力，因为政府的部长很少有经历过此类冲突的经验。即使是领导该国在加沙经历了多次短暂冲突和战争的内塔尼亚胡先生也没有经历过<a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/11/brutal-urban-warfare-awaits-israels-army-in-gaza">如此规模的战争</a>。新内部内阁的组建将影响战斗的进程，并可能影响战斗停止后内塔尼亚胡先生的遭遇。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">甘茨先生将加入由内塔尼亚胡先生担任主席的小型五人紧急内阁。该组织的另一位核心成员是国防部长约夫·加兰特（Yoav Gallant）（今年早些时候，他因批评政府<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/02/15/israels-proposed-legal-reforms-are-a-dreadful-answer-to-a-real-problem">司法改革</a>而差点被解雇）。剩下的两个席位将由“观察员”占据，但实际上是参与者：以色列国防军另一位前指挥官加迪·艾森科特 (Gadi Eisenkot)；战略事务部长罗恩·德默（Ron Dermer）。这个将做出与战争有关的主要决定的内部内阁不包括去年内塔尼亚胡先生带入组建政府的联盟的任何<a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/29/israels-new-government-is-the-most-right-wing-ever">极右翼部长</a>。该组织拥有高水平的军事经验和专业精神，但考虑到以色列的愤怒程度，这并不一定意味着该组织会在加沙表现出军事克制，而以色列目前对加沙的地面入侵迫在眉睫。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">联合政府仍然有一个重大遗漏：前总理、反对派官方领导人亚伊尔·拉皮德(Yair Lapid)。尽管拉皮德在袭击发生后不久表示他将加入紧急政府，但他也表示“目前极端且功能失调的安全内阁”无法管理这场战争。这实质上是要求将内塔尼亚胡联盟中极右翼政党的领导人排除在外。内塔尼亚胡没有将他们驱逐出去，而是通过组建紧急内阁来回避这个问题。目前尚不清楚这种忽悠是否足以让拉皮德先生改变主意。但如果他这样做了，他将获得一个席位。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">内塔尼亚胡先生并不特别重视极右翼政党。犹太力量党领袖伊塔马尔·本-格维尔可能拥有国家安全部长的崇高头衔，但总理特意不让他参加大多数高层安全简报会。很少有以色列人，甚至是右翼人士，会因为本-格维尔先生和其他宗教或极端民族主义狂热分子在国家危机期间缺席军事决策而感到悲伤。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而内塔尼亚胡先生始终将自己的政治生存置于首位。即使在战争期间，他似乎仍在继续这样做，拒绝将极右翼政党踢出政府。本-格维尔先生仍然有能力在危险时刻制造麻烦。他仍然负责警察工作，并在最近几天加剧了与以色列阿拉伯人口的紧张关系。内塔尼亚胡先生不愿意背弃极右翼伙伴，因为如果他想在战后继续掌权并希望赢得另一次选举，他就需要他们的支持。支持内塔尼亚胡的媒体代理人辩称，内塔尼亚胡不能将财政部长兼极右宗教犹太复国主义党领袖贝扎莱尔·斯莫特里奇边缘化，因为斯莫特里奇的一些选民现在正在前线奋战。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">反对派领导人寻求组建联合政府，因为他们渴望抵消极右翼的影响，并为政府注入一些专业精神和经验。但他们也知道，加入内阁让内塔尼亚胡有机会摆脱导致以色列卷入这场战争的失败的部分责任。他们坚信，当清算到来时，他会抓住它。此外，他们担心自己在政府中的存在将使受污染的总理及其激进联盟合法化。以色列最终可能会进行政治重组，增加中间派政党的权重，减少极端主义政党的权重。但可能只有在内塔尼亚胡先生离开舞台后。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">他是以色列任职时间最长的总理，但无论他在漫长的公共生涯中为以色列取得了什么成就，他的遗产将永远被他任内发生的这些可怕事件这一事实所掩盖。他是战略概念的首席设计师，该概念的理念是，哈马斯在加沙构成的威胁可以通过建立高科技边境屏障来应对，而不是寻求长期解决方案和改善加沙的条件。这个想法在 10 月 7 日惨遭失败。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">历任总理都曾面临过军事失败。在每一个案例中——1973年赎罪日战争后的果尔达·梅厄、1982年黎巴嫩战争后的梅纳赫姆·贝京和2006年黎巴嫩战争后的埃胡德·奥尔默特——他们都在战争结束后两年内宣布辞职。当这场战争结束后，公众的愤怒浪潮席卷而来时，内塔奈胡先生可能会面临同样的命运。政治生涯结束的前景似乎几乎不可避免地会影响他现在的决策，而他将拼命地坚持下去。这使得那些加入他内阁的人试图迫使他关注国家安全而不是他的政治生存变得更加紧迫。

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最近，超级巨头的页岩油野心不断增强。六月，埃克森美孚的老板达伦·伍兹表示，他打算在五年内将页岩油产量翻一番。可能不需要那么长时间。 10 月 11 日，埃克森美孚表示将以 600 亿美元收购先锋公司，这是有史以来最大的石油合并之一。这笔交易将使埃克森美孚的国内石油产量立即增加近一倍，使其跃居美国生产商的榜首（见图表）。它还可能促使这个仍然分散的行业进行更多整合。它可能会再次使美国的沙莱曼成为世界上的秋千生产商。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">页岩油看起来比几年前更有利可图。对成本的关注消除了浪费行为并提高了运营效率。摩根大通银行估计，美国在勘探和生产上花费一美元（其中大部分是页岩油），如今的石油产量是 2014 年的两倍。页岩油逃逸到空气中后，大型运营商首先在监管机构的压力下，然后根据商业逻辑，开始回收这些物质并出售，因为甲烷是天然气的组成部分。能源咨询公司 Wood Mackenzie 的汤姆·埃拉科特 (Tom Ellacott) 表示，如今，美国页岩油的碳密集度低于传统油田，而且开发速度更快、成本更低。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最大的水力压裂公司也回应了华尔街的压力，要求增加回报而不是产量。这种新建立的资本纪律经受住了 2022 年 2 月俄罗斯入侵乌克兰后油价飙升的考验。当年晚些时候，先锋公司首席执行官斯科特·谢菲尔德 (Scott Sheffield) 坚称，他的公司将继续实行克制，“无论是 150 美元、200 美元还是 100 美元的石油” ”。资深能源经济学家菲利普·维勒格(Philip Verleger)表示，通过拒绝钻探，宝贝，钻探，大型页岩油公司在过去三年帮助支撑了油价。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">埃克森美孚与先锋的交易可能会改变这一点。正如维勒格先生指出的那样，埃克森美孚有一个明确的战略，即如果油价和预测利润足够高，就进行投资以提高产量。他们很可能是。能源分析公司 Rystad 的马修·伯恩斯坦 (Matthew Bernstein) 认为，该地区“还有 15-20 年的高质量钻探空间”。他认为，这可能会说服埃克森美孚提高产量。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">环保主义者可能会对这一前景感到畏缩。页岩长期以来一直是他们<i>最讨厌的东西，</i>部分原因是那些肮脏的甲烷排放。随着甲烷得到妥善管理，它可能成为满足持续增长的全球石油需求的最佳且最清洁的方法之一。就连致力于到 2050 年实现净零排放的官方预测机构国际能源署 (International Energy Agency) 也更倾向于页岩油等短期投资，而不是生产商被锁定数十年的长期项目。页岩油仍将是<i>黑色的</i>，但也许不再那么<i>令人讨厌</i>了。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 18:48:59 GMT</pubDate><guid

Labour Party embraces supply-side social democracy]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">本月在曼彻斯特<small>举行的集会上</small><span>，</span>保守党上演了玛格丽特·撒切尔最受欢迎的作品的剧目剧目。莉兹·特拉斯呼吁削减公司税。外交大臣詹姆斯·克莱弗利宣布他将访问福克兰群岛。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">本周，在利物浦举行的工党会议上，上演了一场更为微妙、更有趣的向撒切尔夫人致敬的活动。渴望成为英国第一位女财政部长的影子财政大臣雷切尔·里夫斯(Rachel Reeves)不仅承认欠英国第一位女首相的债务。这是因为工党承诺进行供给侧革命，以点燃陷入困境的经济。繁文缛节将被取消；公用事业受到震动；增长成为第一要务。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">那么，在某种程度上，是撒切尔夫人的观点。工党已经接受了西方中左翼政党中流行的一个想法。这个想法有多种名称：“现代供给侧经济学”、“生产主义”，或者用里夫斯女士的话说，“安全经济学”。智库公共政策研究所的乔治·迪布表示，这是一项恢复国家作为经济增长驱动力的努力。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这种版本的供给方经济学将传统上与自由市场右派（放松管制和创造性破坏）相关的工具和言论与左派对工业补贴、劳工权利和公共服务的强调融合在一起。它强调丰富的基础设施、能源和住房，以及稳定的政府来推动投资。旧的优先事项，例如工业的国家所有权和再分配，是次要问题。 “每一个新的增长时代都必须从扩大国家生产能力开始。这是一条铁律，”该党领袖凯尔·斯塔默爵士说道。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这也是一种政治需要。在 2025 年 1 月底之前举行的下一次选举中，该党将提供一些小额施舍，用于填补价值数十亿英镑的税收漏洞。但如果工党获胜，其选民、活动人士和工会支持者将希望获得更多——实际收入的迅速增长以及大量现金流入医院和学校。由于里夫斯女士不愿意将税收负担提高到超过战后最高水平（占国民收入的37%），也不愿意借钱用于日常支出，因此，经济增长的飞跃是在公共服务上增加支出的唯一途径。提高税收。 </p><div

1%。这并不容易。国际货币基金组织目前预测，未来五年人均<small>GDP</small>增长将不温不火；见图表。一位影子内阁部长表示，要真正发挥作用，工党必须赢得压倒性胜利，掌权十年，并比 1997 年的托尼·布莱尔爵士采取更快、更强硬的行动。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">议程上的第一个项目是英国僵化的计划体系。国家基础设施建设——铁路、发电厂和公路——的新规则手册将被制定。电池工厂和实验室等高价值私营部门项目的申请将获得快速处理。该党认为，通过设计现成的规划咨询、环境缓解措施以及对受开发影响的当地人的补偿形式，可以简化申请并减少诉讼。国家会决定，而不是讨价还价。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">该党声称可以在 2030 年之前使英国的能源供应完全脱碳。要做到这一点，就需要对老化的电网进行大规模、快速的扩张。工党表示，大约 2000 亿英镑的绿色能源项目处于悬而未决的状态，其中一些项目将在 15 年内提供并网服务。部分问题是建筑业缺乏竞争。里夫斯女士计划开放市场招标，包括由一家新的国有建筑商进行招标，并标准化布线和组件的采购。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">它在住房方面的野心要温和一些。它承诺利用现有法律鼓励议会建造更多房屋并重新指定低质量土地用于开发，从而实现政府每年建造 30 万套新房屋的目标。智囊团城市中心的安东尼·布雷奇表示，这是一个明智的短期解决方案，但要将住房从拖累因素转变为增长动力，需要立法和更深入的改革。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">随着该党刺激清洁能源制造业的补贴计划被削减，工党放松管制的意愿日益增强。里夫斯女士在 2021 年每年拨出 280 亿英镑的绿色补贴。这仍然是官方政策，但达到这一支出水平的目标已推迟到 2027 年；所有提到这笔钱的内容都是从利物浦的讲台演讲中删除的。相反，工党现在强调建立规模较小的 80 亿英镑“国家财富基金”，专门用于港口和工厂，旨在释放私人资本。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">供给方议程为一些旧的工党优先事项提供了新的智力工具。更好的儿童保育和医疗保健被重新定义为供应方干预措施，以提高劳动力参与度（尽管分析师对于<small>NHS</small>候补名单对经济不活跃的影响程度存在不同意见）。关于劳动力市场，里夫斯女士认为，有“大量的经济证据”表明工党禁止零工时合同和提高病假工资的政策将提高生产率。也许吧，但一个诞生于工会运动的政党无论如何都会想这么做。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">撒切尔夫人等了多年，她的改革才变成减税。凯尔爵士还警告说，英国的转型将面临漫长的艰辛，但他回避了一个更严峻的事实——他的供给方议程不会迅速提高工资或改变公共服务。即使稳定的政府和放松管制引发一波投资浪潮，增长的提速也需要数年时间才能实现。无论工党多么愿意相信改革仙女的魔力，该党仍将面临艰难的选择：英国人是否愿意缴纳更多的税以换取更好的服务。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，作为政治，供给侧社会民主主义可能会取得胜利。在一次会议早餐会上，影子商务大臣乔纳森·雷诺兹（Jonathan Reynolds）沉思道，全球中左翼似乎比右翼更有凝聚力，右翼已转向文化来掩盖深刻的经济分歧。撒切尔最喜欢的智库政策研究中心的负责人立即表示，保守党让工党偷走了他们的衣服，这是一种耻辱。另一位自由市场信徒亚当·斯密研究所认为基尔爵士的演讲“严肃、注重创新、积极”。哪里有不和谐，愿他带来和谐。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div>

e190yofl0">毫无疑问，北京值得庆祝。但在华盛顿，这个消息可能不太受欢迎。美国对中国的崛起，尤其是其不断增长的科技实力越来越感到沮丧。在前共和党总统唐纳德·特朗普和现任民主党总统乔·拜登的领导下，中国实施了关税、规则和补贴，旨在阻碍中国高科技企业，同时促进自身发展。中国对此进行了报复，对一些美国大型科技公司采取了行动。二十年前，政治家们支持全球化和自由贸易。当前，“脱钩”、国家安全、“友邻”成为热门话题。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">有意识的脱钩</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">学术界也不能幸免。两国的新规则和冷淡的政治使研究人员的合作变得更加困难。 8 月，美国同意将 1979 年签署的一项具有里程碑意义的科学合作协议临时延长六个月。几位美国政界人士希望完全废除该协议，他们在一封公开信中声称，通过与中国研究人员合作，美国正在“推动它自己的毁灭。” </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px"

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">应变可以在图中看到。 2020年，美国和中国研究人员共同撰写的论文数量首次下降。第二年，这是可获得的最新数据，该数字再次下降，尽管英国等其他一些国家的数字仍在上升。美国向中国学生和学者发放的签证数量也有所下降，降至 2015 年峰值的三分之一左右（见图 2）。无论是在科学上还是在政治上，两国都在分裂。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 1979年的《科学技术协议》是中美恢复外交关系后签署的第一个双边条约。几项具有里程碑意义的研究都属于它的范畴。 1983 年开始的一个长期项目跟踪了 285,000 名中国女性，帮助证明叶酸可以预防脊柱裂（一种罕见的先天缺陷）。如今，面粉、面包、麦片和其他主食中都添加了叶酸。鼓励孕妇多服用。流感研究方面的合作有助于预测每年哪些流感病毒株可能占主导地位，从而改进疫苗。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">即使是超级大国的竞争对手也同意医学研究是一件好事。但中国在计算、材料科学和<small>人工智能</small>等其他科学领域的进步让美国决策者感到不安。批评者认为，中国的科学受益于美国的学术透明度和专业知识，但中国并不总是回报这种恩惠。怀疑者还指出了中国的“军民融合”政策，即对民用研究成果进行仔细审查，以确定是否有任何有用的军事应用。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">中国反驳说，美国对国家安全的担忧导致美国大学不公平地针对中国研究人员。经常受到投诉的目标之一是司法部的“中国倡议”，该倡议于 2018 年至 2022 年期间启动，旨在调查涉嫌中国技术间谍活动的案件。但实际案例似乎很少。该倡议调查了至少 150 名华裔学者，但仅对少数人定罪。有些是针对较轻的罪行，例如拨款欺诈。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其中一些调查已成为公开的惨败，例如陈刚的案件，陈刚是一位著名的华裔机械工程师，现就职于麻省理工学院。陈博士于 2021 年被捕。在对他的所有指控被撤销之前，他休了一年学术假。其他研究人员被所在大学解雇，并发现自己被列入禁飞名单。学者们表示，这一举措引发了怀疑和不信任的气氛。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">与此同时，中国也有自己的国家安全担忧，这同样会阻碍合作。近年来出台的规则几乎禁止导出许多不同类型的数据。例如，官员已禁止非中国实体收集基因组数据。如果没有政府里的朋友，外国社会科学研究人员很少能获得经济和社会调查的机会。这些规则含糊不清，甚至让热衷于与海外同事合作的研究人员也不确定他们可以分享什么。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">关系的冷却将使双方的日子更加难过。中国学者会发现在美国大学获得经验更加困难，而美国大学在几乎每个学科的世界排名中仍然占据主导地位。由于中国现在本身就是一个科学强国，在多个领域拥有尖端研究人员，美国科学也将受到影响。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">数据提供商科睿唯安 (Clarivate) 跟踪学术信息的乔纳森·亚当斯 (Jonathan Adams) 表示，合作的好处是“显着的”，而且美国机构比中国机构受益略多。亚利桑那大学的 Jenny Lee 和 John Haupt 在 2020 年发表的一项研究发现，如果排除与中国科学家共同撰写的论文，2014 年至 2018 年美国科学与工程领域的出版物数量略有下降。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">把你们的聪明才智给我</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">美国在科学领域的领先地位至少部分是建立在其吸引世界顶尖人才的能力之上的。疫情爆发前，美国大学科学、技术、工程和数学专业的研究生中约有 16% 是中国人。今天的研究生往往会成为明天的教授。和陈博士一样，许多中国学生在完成学业后选择留在美国。美国领导人应该热衷于鼓励这一点。 <span

<span>“我们</span><small>需要</small>成为地球的好管家。但这并不意味着我需要放弃我的燃油汽车，转而使用来自中国的电池的电动汽车，”密歇根州共和党主席克里斯蒂娜·卡拉莫 (Kristina Karamo) 9 月 22 日表示。她警告说，美国民主党正试图“说服我们，如果我们不将权力集中在政府手中，地球就会灭亡。这似乎是达尔文进化论以来最大的骗局之一。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">人们很容易将卡拉莫女士视为无关紧要的怪人，但她并非无关紧要。她代表了一场正在世界各地加速发展的运动的极端派别：对亲气候政策的强烈抵制。其中一位更为人们所熟悉的啦啦队员可能会成为美国的下一任总统。 9 月 27 日，唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 表示：“你可以忠于美国劳工，也可以忠于环保疯子，但你不可能真正忠于两者……狡猾的乔（拜登）站在左翼疯子一边，他们会摧毁汽车制造业，就会摧毁我们的国家本身。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 9 月 20 日，英国首相里希·苏纳克 (Rishi Sunak) 宣布削弱净零排放目标，其中包括将禁止销售新汽油汽车的禁令推迟五年。两周前，德国启动了一项在未来几年内为新住宅安装绿色供暖的强制令。法国爆发了针对高油价的大规模抗议活动，有一天可能会选举玛丽娜·勒庞为总统，她对风电场表示遗憾，并认为能源转型应该“慢得多”。在美国，气候变化已成为文化战争的战场：在最近的共和党总统候选人辩论中，只有一位候选人承认人为气候变化是真实存在的。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这一切对于遏制全球碳排放来说是多么严重的障碍？英国谢菲尔德大学的迈克尔·雅各布斯看到了谨慎乐观的理由。作为世界上最大的排放国，中国了解脱碳的必要性，并正在大力投资太阳能和风能。第二大排放国美国在拜登的领导下实现了绿色转型。巴西解雇了一位砍伐雨林的总统；澳大利亚抛弃了一位溺爱煤炭的总理。近四分之一的排放量现在受到碳定价的影响。创新的步伐令人印象深刻。两年前，全球机构国际能源署估计，到 2050 年实现净零排放所需的近 50% 的减排量将来自尚未商业化的技术。 9月份，该公司称这一数字已降至35%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">政治暗流则不太令人放心。选民们意识到，重塑整个全球经济将具有破坏性。一些人（少数）质疑人为造成的气候变化正在发生。其他人反对为解决这个问题而采取的某些政策，因为它们给普通公民带来了成本，或者给他们过度紧张的日常生活增添了麻烦。有些人，尤其是老年人，根本不喜欢改变，尤其是当这意味着今天要大惊小怪，以换取他们可能无法活着看到的好处时。即使在那些认为需要采取行动的人中，对于谁应该承担这一负担也存在不同的看法。许多人宁愿它落在别人身上。

e190yofl0">在过去的野火烧焦的十年里，人们对气候变化危险的认识似乎有所提高。美国智库皮尤研究中心对12个富裕国家进行的民意调查显示，除韩国外，认为这是“重大威胁”的受访者比例均有所上升（韩国的比例本来就很高（见图1））。除以色列外，世界各地绝大多数人都同意这一描述。但这并不意味着他们愿意缴纳更多税收来帮助防止气候变化（见图2）。民意调查机构益普索(Ipsos)对29个国家进行的一项调查显示，只有30%的受访者表示愿意吐槽。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">排挤</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">也许最令人担忧的是，甚至在科学问题上也出现了党派分歧。在皮尤 2022 年调查的所有 14 个富裕国家中，政治右翼人士将气候变化视为主要威胁的可能性低于左翼人士（见下页图 3）。在澳大利亚、加拿大、德国、荷兰和瑞典，差距非常大：在 22 到 44 个百分点之间。在美国，这是令人瞠目结舌的 63 分。 YouGov 为<i>《经济学人》</i>进行的一项新民意调查发现，虽然 87% 的拜登选民认为气候变化是由人类活动引起的，但只有 21% 的特朗普选民同意这一观点。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt

（公众舆论在独裁国家也很重要，但这超出了本文的范围。）尤其是在富裕的民主国家，民粹主义政客加剧了气候分歧，他们对待真正的问题（例如成本和破坏）并夸大了它们，同时声称实施绿色政策的精英并不关心普通驾车者，因为他们骑自行车上班。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">民粹主义往往会以多种方式破坏有效的气候政策。首先，民粹主义者常常对专家持怀疑态度。卡拉莫女士表示，当人们说“相信专家”时，他们真正的意思是：“你太愚蠢了，无法对自己的生活做出决定。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">其次，民粹主义者对全球机构和外国人持怀疑态度。共和党总统候选人维韦克·拉马斯瓦米 (Vivek Ramaswamy) 表示：“我们向电动汽车制造商提供的每一项补贴实际上都是对（中国共产党）的补贴，因为我们对它们的依赖就像套在我们脖子上的绞索一样。”华盛顿<small>特区</small>美利坚大学的丹·菲奥里诺认为，这种态度不利于缓解气候变化，因为“气候政策既是经济政策的问题，也是外交关系的问题。” </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “他们说，购买电动汽车时最快乐的一天是驾驶它的前十分钟，然后，因为担心而感到恐慌。我到底该去哪里收取费用才能让这件事继续下去？恐慌！”他告诉密歇根州的工人。 “如果你想买一辆电动汽车，那绝对没问题……但我们不应该强迫消费者购买电动汽车……不存在公平过渡到生活方式终结这样的事情。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果特朗普在2024年连任，他将再次退出气候变化《巴黎协定》。他还将撤销有关甲烷排放等问题的行政命令。他可能无法废除拜登的大型气候法（被误导性地称为《减少通货膨胀法》），该法涉及巨额补贴，深受红州和蓝州接受者的欢迎。但他会任命可能阻碍其实施的官僚。民主党参议员埃德·马基表示，美国至少会在关键时刻停止在气候变化问题上发挥领导作用。 “你不能坐在高脚凳上宣扬节制。如果你作为一个国家不做正确的事，你就无法告诉其他国家做正确的事。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">类似的反对绿化的争论也在欧洲扎根。即使民粹主义政党不在政府中，他们也可以影响政府。在瑞典，只有 4% 的人认为气候变化“不是威胁”，但中右翼执政联盟在过去一年中仍多次削减化石燃料税。原因之一是，如果没有拥有20%议会席位的民粹主义瑞典民主党的支持，它就无法通过预算。民粹主义者想要更便宜的燃料。许多瑞典选民也是如此。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">瑞典 Facebook 群组“Fuel Rebellion”拥有 60 万名会员。该组织领导人之一佩德·布洛姆·博肯希尔姆 (Peder Blohm Bokenhielm) 表示，汽车“一直是他生活的重要组成部分”。他的父亲将美国野马和护卫舰进口到瑞典。他小时候的第一个词是“汽车”。他也有反对高燃油税的实际理由。 In a small Swedish village “there are no shops, and just two buses a day,” he says. “If you want to buy groceries, you need a car.” Charging points are not yet everywhere, and a car&#39;s range matters in a country where journeys are long and getting stranded in the snow is hazardous. And don&#39;t get people started on the cost of home-heating. Politicians who keep high fuel prices in place are “making it harder for people to live where they want to live”, Mr Bokenhielm says.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The right way?</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In Germany this year the hard-right Alternative for Germany ( <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> ) has risen in the polls—and did well in state elections on October 8th—by lambasting the energy policies of the ruling coalition, which includes the Green Party. It says they will “impoverish” the country. The <small>A</small> f <small>D</small> is ostracised by mainstream parties, but the centre-right borrows its talking-points.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The Greens hurt their own cause with a plan to make green home-heating almost mandatory before there were enough skilled installers to install heat pumps. Householders struggled to book tradesmen. The government backed down in September and extended the deadline—but the political damage had been done.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Now in Germany it is not just the hard right that bashes the Greens. Their rallies have been pelted with stones, eggs and insults. Martin Huber of the Christian Social Union ( <small>CSU</small> ), the main centre-right party in Bavaria, told <i>The Economist</i> that all the Greens do is make <i>Verbotsgesetze</i> (laws that forbid things). At a rally in Andechs, a pretty village 40km from Munich, the head of the <small>CSU</small> , Markus Söder, drew guffaws from a beered-up Oktoberfest crowd with a series of jabs. When the lights suddenly brightened he quipped: “So at least they are still sending us electricity from Berlin.” An elderly supporter said: “I heat my house with wood. How can I afford to change this, and why should I in my old age?”</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Not their cup of tea</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In Britain, the Conservative prime minister has adopted the main populist themes. In a speech last month, Mr Sunak stressed that he favours curbing emissions, but decried the way Britain&#39;s climate goals had been set “without any meaningful democratic debate about how we get there”. (His party has been in power since 2010.) He also lamented that green policies “will impose unacceptable costs”. He named specific, frightening sums. “For a family living in a terraced house in Darlington, the upfront cost [of a heat pump] could be around £10,000 ($12,200).”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> He vowed to scrap plans that have never seriously been considered: “taxes on eating meat…compulsory car-sharing [and] a government diktat to sort your rubbish into seven different bins”. And he played the nationalist card. “When our share of global emissions is less than 1%, how can it be right that British citizens are...told to sacrifice even more than others?” (Brits are less than 1% of the global population.)</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> “Rishi is playing with fire,” says Michael Grubb of University College London. Businesses crave predictable policies in order to plan for the long term. “Making climate change part of a culture war will undermine investor confidence.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> James Patterson of Utrecht University in the Netherlands argues that anti-green backlashes sometimes occur when environmentalists overreach; for example, by enacting policies so coercive that many people deem them illegitimate. This has happened in the Netherlands. A new populist party, the BoerBurgerBeweging (Farmer-Citizen Movement), shot to prominence when the government began to penalise farms emitting too much nitrogen.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Nitrogen is not a greenhouse gas; the problem is that big intensive Dutch farms produce enough of it (from fertiliser and cowpats) to threaten important nature reserves. The government wants to buy out farmers, leading to a reduction in the number of livestock of between a fifth and a half. Such bossiness has provoked rustic rage, with tractor protests and farms across the country flying the national flag upside down. The Farmer-Citizen Movement took 20% of the vote in provincial elections this year—in a country where only 2.2% of people farm. At a general election on November 22nd the more eco-friendly parties are expecting a thumping.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For the most part in developing countries, climate change is a less divisive topic in domestic politics than it is in rich ones. The elite discuss it—governments want to be compensated for the industrialised world&#39;s past emissions and to attract investment for the energy transition. But during elections in India or Africa the topic is barely mentioned.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> However, voters in developing countries are even more sensitive to rises in the cost of living than those in rich countries. So they often resist policies that they think will batter their budgets. Hence the difficulty of cutting fossil-fuel subsidies, which were a staggering $1.3trn (1.3% of global <small>GDP</small> ) in 2022, according to the <small>IMF</small> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such handouts are so popular that the harm they do to the environment is seldom motive enough for governments to get rid of them. Nigeria&#39;s new president, Bola Tinubu, scrapped a fuel subsidy this year not because it encouraged people to burn carbon, but because selling petrol at below-market prices was bankrupting the treasury. In 2022 it cost $10bn, leaving the state oil firm with nothing left for the federal government, of which it is usually the biggest bankroller. Abolishing the subsidy frees up billions for public services, with the happy side-effect of reducing emissions. However, there is pressure to reinstate it. As oil prices rise, some fear a subsidy will be quietly reintroduced.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Several middle-income countries, such as Indonesia and India, are burning more fossil fuels even as they try to reinvent themselves as green powers. India&#39;s government plans to triple renewable-electricity-generation capacity by the end of the decade. It has also declared a moratorium on new coal plants and aims to become a big producer of green hydrogen. This is good news, but seems to be driven at least as much by worries about energy security as climate change: last year&#39;s green-hydrogen strategy mentions a plan to be “energy independent” by 2047 before the target to achieve “net zero” by 2070. And despite the moratorium on new coal plants, Indian coal production grew by 14.8% last year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> National-security arguments can be a spur to green investment. Building wind farms can reduce dependence on energy imports, which is a point that many politicians emphasise. But if such arguments also spur governments to erect barriers to foreign inputs, it will make the energy transition more costly.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> From a green perspective, the big middle-income country that has improved the most in the past year is probably Brazil. Yet it, too, is complicated. Under President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who took office in January, deforestation in the Amazon in the first eight months of the year fell by a cumulative 48% compared with the same period in 2022, when his logger-loving predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, was in charge. However, Lula also supports a push by Petrobras, the state oil firm, to increase output from 2.9m barrels a day to 5.2m by 2030. And his green plans have met resistance. In Congress 347 out of 594 lawmakers belong to the agri-business caucus, whose members fret that greens block development. Congress has curbed the powers of the environment ministry.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Sowing discontent</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In most developing countries, net-zero targets are far in the future and voters have not yet been asked to make big sacrifices to reach them. For many, the harm wrought by climate change itself is a bigger worry. A massive 74% of Indians, for example, say they have experienced the effects of global warming, up from 50% in 2011, according to a survey by Yale University. “We&#39;ve lost crops because of extreme heat and rains and it has got worse in the past few years,” says Shiv Kumari, a farm labourer in Delhi whose fields were flooded this summer. Such trauma translates into greater support for green policies: 55% of Indians say India should reduce its emissions immediately without waiting for other countries to act, up from 36% in 2011.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Globally, innovation will eventually ease the grumbles that drive so much of the anti-climate backlash. “The clean is already cheaper than the dirty in many parts of the economy, and those parts will just get bigger and bigger,” says Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics. But it matters immensely how fast this happens. Many green technologies require hefty upfront investment, which is harder when interest rates are high. This particularly affects the poor world. “Look at Africa. If you pay 15% interest, wind and solar are not cheaper than fossil fuels for generating electricity, though they are cheaper at 7% or 8%,” says Professor Stern. He suggests supercharging multilateral lenders to crowd in other sources of finance. “The most unrealistic and dangerous thing of all would be to go slow,” he says. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 18:05:06 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/b06prptev1l4v7gag2jtec7qt3bj8prj</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/11/the-global-backlash-against-climate-policies-has-begun </item><item><title><![CDATA[America may soon be spending more on debt service than defence]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1y6lujj e1ey6m750"><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span>T</span> <small>HE BOND</small> market is sending a hopeful message about the strength of the American economy—and, perhaps, raising alarm about America&#39;s unsustainable finances. The news is coming via <a href="/finance-and-economics/2023/10/04/a-surge-in-global-bond-yields-threatens-trouble">surging rates</a> on long-term bonds. When the Federal Reserve started raising its benchmark federal-funds rate in March 2022, long-term interest rates rose with it. This continued fairly steadily until the end of last year, when rates flattened out. Then in May, to the surprise of many investors, long-term rates began climbing once more. They show no sign of slowing. On October 11th the yield on ten-year Treasury bonds hit 4.7%, near a 16-year high.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Because bond prices and yields are inversely related, this is bad for bond investors, who are suffering “the greatest bond bear market of all time”, according to Bank of America. But it is also bad for Uncle Sam. When bond yields rise, the cost of <a href="/leaders/2023/09/28/forget-the-shutdown-americas-real-fiscal-worry-is-rising-bond-yields">financing America&#39;s debt</a> —now $26trn and growing—also goes up. In the fiscal year ending on September 30th 2023, interest payments on America&#39;s debt totalled some $660bn, up from $475bn the previous year. As recently as May 2022 the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a non-partisan number-cruncher, had forecast such costs would be $442bn, or 33% lower. </p><figure class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"></figure><p class="article__body-text"> This would not be such a problem if America were putting its fiscal house in order. But estimates released on October 10th by the CBO show that the federal deficit ballooned to $2trn (7.6% of GDP) in the year to September 30th, up from $900bn (3.5%) the previous year. If interest rates and deficits do not come down, fiscal hawks warn, the cost of servicing America&#39;s debt could rocket, crowding out other spending. The CBO estimates that, even assuming a drop in rates, interest costs by 2028 will reach $1trn, or 3.1% of projected GDP—more than will be spent on defence.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Such figures should frighten policymakers in Washington. Even on a benign reading of the reason why interest rates have resumed rising—that the chances of imminent recession have fallen, causing the Fed to keep its benchmark higher for longer—interest payments as a share of GDP are likely to keep rising because of the widening deficit, despite the better prospects for growth. And on a less benign reading—that rising rates reflect fear about the scale of issuance of Treasury debt issuance and lack of appetite for such securities—there is all the more reason to worry.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Whatever the reason, equity investors see a silver lining. On October 9th, in remarks to the National Association for Business Economics, a trade association, Lorie Logan, president of the Dallas Fed, said that about half of the increase in long-term rates since July reflects a rise in the “term premium”, the extra return that investors demand to compensate them for locking up their money for longer periods. If long-term interest rates remain high, Ms Logan explained, further Fed tightening later this year may not be necessary. Shares promptly jumped. The stockmarket&#39;s concerns about America&#39;s fiscal health, at least, will wait for another day. <span>■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 18:02:51 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/4no4nr35hl2oc1cmtmii19n118ngi775</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/10/11/america-may-soon-be-spending-more-on-debt-service-than-defence </item><item><title><![CDATA[Young Americans are losing the southern accent]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>I</span> <small>S THE SOUTHERN</small> accent in decline? A recent study by four researchers from three universities, widely covered in the press, indicates that a prized and unique part of America&#39;s linguistic culture may be under threat. As the <i>Washington Post</i> put it, “The <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/united-states/2022/10/31/how-georgia-once-a-republican-stronghold-came-to-swing">Georgia</a> drawl is fading, y&#39;all.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <a href="https://www.economist.com/prospero/2015/01/29/the-last-acceptable-prejudice">Accent</a> shifts often accompany demographic ones. Americans began moving south in larger numbers in the 1960s. Southern cities boomed as a result. Naturally, people took their children along (including a young Johnson, who moved from Nebraska to Atlanta with his Georgian father and Wisconsin-born mother).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The study found that the southern accent is most common among baby-boomers, born from the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s, before the influx of migrants to the South ramped up. Among Generation X—people born from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s—the prevalence of southern sounds declines, as Georgia-born children socialised with transplants from northern cities like Boston and Chicago. The youngest Georgians, millennials and Generation Z, sound the least southern of all.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is not a single southern sound. Linguists broadly distinguish “inland” and “lowland” accents—inland speakers are more likely to say <i>raht</i> for <i>right</i> , for example—and note local particularities. These are the accents of southern whites, which the study focuses on, even though southern white and black English dialects share many features, from vocabulary (“y&#39;all” for the second-person plural, most famously) to grammar (eg, double negation: “I ain&#39;t got none”).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The famous drawl is largely a matter of the “southern vowel shift”. Linguists classify vowels primarily by where the tongue is in the mouth when they are pronounced: the tongue can be low or high, and forward or back. (The rounding of the lips changes the sound, too.) In the southern shift, the vowel in <i>kit</i> , elsewhere pronounced with the tongue slightly raised, becomes higher. It also becomes a “diphthong”, or two vowels rapidly sliding one to the other: <i>kee-it</i> . And a vowel shift like the southern one tends to affect several vowels, because a change in one may risk confusion if another, similar vowel does not change too. So southern-shifted <i>dress</i> sounds a bit more like <i>driss</i> , and so on, with many vowels becoming “higher”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the researchers found that younger Georgians&#39; vowels are heading in the other direction, taking part in a wider vowel change occurring in America. Speakers who reflect this shift tend to pronounce <i>cot</i> and <i>caught</i> as homophones, and so another chain reaction takes place, and the vowels in <i>kit</i> , <i>dress</i> and <i>trap</i> are lowered (towards <i>ket</i> , <i>drass</i> and <i>trop</i> , though not all the way there).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The southern drawl is the most emblematic American voice: many people imitating a stereotypical American will adopt a twangy southern accent, though it is far from America&#39;s most common. Nor is it ancient. The researchers found that speakers born around 1900 almost entirely lack the southern shift, which peaked two generations later. If you listen to a speaker born in 1894 (recorded for the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States and available online) you will hear a distinctive sound: certainly southern, but quite unlike the tones of a 70-year-old Georgian today.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In other words, the voice seen as totemic of the South—a region by reputation attached to its past—is newer than is assumed. There is no reason why it should be eternal. Yet the researchers do not suggest that the accent is on its deathbed: merely that fewer young southerners have it.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Paul Reed, a linguist at the University of Alabama, notes that other research finds the accent more robust in rural areas. Metro Atlanta is not all of Georgia (though its boom and sprawl continues, and sometimes seems to threaten to consume the whole state). If some features of “Georgianness” decline from the accent, he says, it is entirely possible others will arise to replace them.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> If the southern accent was fixin&#39; to disappear, that would be a pity. Fortunately that is not imminent. But a gentle shift of the southern accent could also be seen as a sign of how popular the South has become. Americans are <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/why-americans-are-rethinking-where-they-want-to-live/21806771">once again flocking</a> to the region. That is a happy phenomenon in a country bitterly divided by party, values and religion.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The South has long been unique in history and politics, as well as language. Its gradual integration with the rest of the country, as outsiders discover its <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2017/07/27/cooking-in-the-american-south">charms</a> and make a home there, can be a good thing, too.</p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 17:40:22 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/nq69iltfab4e3c2ta5n5jngi6r1tsfjq</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/11/young-americans-are-losing-the-southern-accent </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why do people sleep? And other unanswered questions]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-14046qw e1xfd4x10"> <b>Mapping the Darkness.</b> By Kenneth Miller. <i>Hachette Books; 432 pages; $32.50.

People do it, though often <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/09/08/which-countries-get-the-best-nights-sleep">less than they would like</a> to. Owls do it in the daytime. Even <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> , a primitive roundworm made up of a few thousand cells, does something that looks an awful lot like it. Sleep is an ancient, <a href="https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2002/12/19/and-so-to-bed">universal experience</a> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But partly because it is so commonplace, for a long time <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2018/08/30/nap-time-for-grown-ups-will-sleeping-pods-catch-on">sleep</a> was a subject that scientists had not woken up to. It is only in the past half-century or so that it has attracted the attention of dedicated researchers. A new book from Kenneth Miller, a science journalist, sets out to chronicle the field&#39;s short but fascinating history.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The book is organised around the life and hard work of four scientists. The patriarch of the field is Nathaniel Kleitman, whose presence looms largest. A Jewish man born in what is now Moldova, he emigrated to America in 1915, escaping Russian pogroms before setting up a pioneering sleep-research programme at the University of Chicago.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The early pages of the book, before there is much in the way of established science to describe, are the weakest. A good deal of time is spent on biographical details and pen portraits of the world through which Kleitman moved. But the story soon picks up. It roams from the discovery of rapid-eye-movement ( <small>REM</small> ) sleep and circadian rhythms—the biological clocks that govern humanity&#39;s days—to the effects of sleep deprivation (which can be fatal, at least in lab animals). It also probes the purpose, if any, of <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/17/sleep-and-songwriting-make-one-of-the-great-creative-partnerships">dreams</a> .</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Underlying it all is a sense of psychology&#39;s slow maturing as a science. <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2022/02/12/the-sleep-tech-industry-is-waking-up">New technologies</a> such as electroencephalographs, which monitor electrical activity in the brain, have offered practitioners the ability to study brains directly, rather than trying to infer what they are doing from the behaviour of their owners.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Mr Miller has a good eye for a great scientific story. One of Kleitman&#39;s best-known experiments involved spending 32 days in a dark cave as he worked to shed light on the limits of the body&#39;s inbuilt circadian clock. The author is happy to show research as it is really done, indignities and all.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One section describes a more modern, quantitative sort of circadian-rhythm research that took place in a purpose-built facility in a Bavarian village. The lab sported two apartments, with no window or clocks to clue their occupants into what was happening outside. Test subjects lived there for weeks, free to wake and doze whenever they liked—but never free from the rectal thermometers that were attached to wall sockets by long cables.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is a serious side, too. Shift work interferes with the body&#39;s internal clocks and <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2016/12/03/why-disrupted-body-clocks-trigger-liver-cancer">raises the risk</a> of illness, including heart disease and diabetes. Mr Miller explains medicine&#39;s slow recognition of sleep apnea, a common affliction, and the damage it can inflict. It is caused by the airway repeatedly collapsing during sleep. Sufferers endure hundreds of episodes of oxygen deprivation every night (the characteristic gasping and snorting comes when a bodily reflex forces sleepers to take a desperate breath of air).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> If left untreated, sleep apnea can lead to crippling exhaustion or worse. Mr Miller relates the case of a brother and sister who both suffered from the condition. The brother was eventually cured by having a small hole cut in his throat, but years of oxygen deprivation at night had caused irreversible brain damage in his sister.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Discoveries often lead to new questions in turn. That is why neat, tidy endings are hard to achieve in science books; this one is no different. Despite all the progress of the past 50 years, scientists are still unsure what sleep is for. The fact it is so widespread suggests it is vital. But why evolution would see fit to produce animals that must spend large amounts of their time insensate and unable to respond to threats is still a mystery researchers are trying to solve. For anyone curious about asking the right questions, however, Mr Miller&#39;s book is a good place to start. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 17:06:57 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/ncpn4u8rnja1rosjv40kkb5a90pvs7le</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/10/11/why-do-people-sleep-and-other-unanswered-questions </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Palestinian cause has been damaged by factionalism, argues a former prime minister]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>HE HAMAS-LED</small> attack on Israel was a case of the expected happening unexpectedly, and on an unprecedented scale. The preplanning was obvious, and the execution not only caught Israel off guard but disoriented it in ways it had arguably never experienced in the long history of the Arab-Israeli conflict.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> With Hamas eager to own the operation, much of the analysis has so far focused on its possible motives. To be sure, Hamas is a political movement, and speculation about its political motives and aspirations is understandable. But underlying its decision to escalate are a host of grievances, and not taking these seriously threatens to lead to much more disastrous consequences than have been seen so far.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Those and other grievances are not felt by Hamas alone; they are legitimate, widely held Palestinian grievances. For who, among Palestinians, can be expected to be indifferent to the hardship and indignity of living under a highly capricious and oppressive occupation that has only been getting more deeply entrenched under the heavy weight of Israel&#39;s expansionist colonial enterprise?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In addition to the rapid intensification in the de facto annexation of the West Bank since the beginning of this year, there has been a substantial rise in violence by Israeli settlers and acts of outright terrorism against Palestinian civilians, as well as unprecedented hate speech by Israeli officials. Worse, much of that went largely unpunished. Nor did it lead to any meaningful adverse consequences for Israel internationally.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As for Gaza—the tiny enclave that is home to 2.2m Palestinians—the talk about improving living conditions there after each of the previous five rounds of military escalation since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 merely ended up being largely that.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> More generally, Palestinians, not only in the West Bank and Gaza but throughout the world, have all but given up on the promise of statehood they thought might come with the so-called peace process three decades ago. This disillusionment has been reinforced by the normalisation agreements Israel concluded with four Arab countries in 2020, as well as by the growing realisation that the impending normalisation agreement with Saudi Arabia was virtually certain not to include a Palestinian component of any political significance.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Add to that recent Israeli efforts to undermine status-quo understandings on the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem. This has fuelled Palestinian concern that the compound could be split up or, worse, damaged or destroyed. Given the sensitivity of this issue, not only to Palestinians but to Arabs and Muslims throughout the world, it is hardly surprising that Hamas dubbed its October 7th operation “the Al-Aqsa Hurricane”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> All of which suggests that the objective Israel has now declared, of destroying Hamas, is unlikely to eliminate the possibility of future instability and conflict. As a political movement, with the ideology and the ideas it stands on, Hamas cannot be destroyed. Thus, Israel&#39;s intention to turn Gaza into a “deserted island”, with all that would entail by way of doubling down on bombardment, not to mention a land operation, is likely to lead only to thousands more casualties, and to destruction, misery and displacement of untold proportions. This is not to mention the distinct possibility that such retaliation leads to further escalation and the eruption of a region-wide conflict.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> If the consensus is that Israel suffered a major intelligence and security failure last Saturday, the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( <small>PLO</small> ) has been, arguably for decades now, suffering from a major doctrinal failure. The policymaking body, which is supposed to be the umbrella for all Palestinian groups and is considered the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, has made virtually no adjustments, either to its political platform or to its membership. Notably, the <small>PLO</small> ’s gamble in 1993, based on the promise of the Oslo accords to deliver Palestinian statehood, has clearly failed. Yet the <small>PLO</small> still adheres to and stands on the same political platform as it did back then.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even more anomalous is the continued absence from the <small>PLO</small> of Palestinian factions, like Hamas, that from the very beginning opposed the “peace process”. Equally significant, the <small>PLO</small> ’s platform has been steadily falling out of favour with the Palestinian public, who increasingly see it as irrelevant.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is time for Palestinians to adopt a new political platform, and to take concrete steps to bring non- <small>PLO</small> factions into the process. Membership of the <small>PLO</small> ’s executive committee should also be expanded to include full and effective representation for political forces that don&#39;t support or engage with its current approach.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> What principles should underpin the new platform? In short, it should commit itself to either of two (mutually exclusive) options. The first is a single state, with full equality for all citizens enshrined in the constitution, outlawing any discrimination on any basis whatsoever. The second is a negotiated two-state solution, but only with a fully sovereign Palestinian state on all of the territory occupied by Israel in 1967, including East Jerusalem. For this to work, the peace process would have to be preceded by recognition by Israel and the international community of the Palestinians&#39; right to such a state and, under international law, the right of return and to self-determination.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> At various junctures over the past decade, Hamas may have been open to considering such a scenario. Is it still a viable path forward? The only way to find out is not through yet another futile convening of a meeting of the heads of Palestinian factions that deals only in generalities and achieves little—as was the case when they last met a few months ago in Egypt—but rather by seeking to forge agreement among the factions, Hamas included, on such principles as those outlined above as a basis for achieving national unity. It has never been more important to find a way to end the division and fragmentation that has plagued the Palestinian polity since Hamas seized power in Gaza 16 years ago. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>Salam Fayyad is a former prime minister of the Palestinian Authority.</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 16:54:41 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/rbrfdumhd36ieob21o16c0jptndbpd6p</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/10/11/the-palestinian-cause-has-been-damaged-by-factionalism-argues-a-former-prime-minister </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why the Polish election campaign has been so vicious]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>O</span> <small>N OCTOBER 9TH</small> Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland&#39;s prime minister, and Donald Tusk, a former prime minister and the leader of the main opposition party, faced each other in a televised debate, six days before national elections. Four other candidates were on stage, but the two men paid them little heed. “I don&#39;t know what they poured into your glass, you&#39;re excited and aggressive,” snapped Mr Tusk. Mr Morawiecki accused his opponent&#39;s party of selling off national treasures. “They&#39;d sell our forests, the Baltic [Sea] and the Tatra [Mountains],” he claimed. Their exchange was representative of a campaign that has <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/05/after-a-brutal-campaign-poland-gets-ready-to-vote">dripped vitriol</a> . Both sides have accused the other of cronyism and treason, eagerly trading comparisons to Nazis and Soviets. Why has it been so nasty?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The election is a toss-up. Mr Morawiecki&#39;s Law and Justice ( <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> ) party, which is polling at 36%, is poised to take the largest share of the vote. But to form a government it will need the support of others, and it is not clear that it will secure it. The far-right Confederation party, on 9%, could <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/08/15/polands-far-right-could-be-the-next-governments-kingmaker">hold the balance of power</a> . If the opposition does well it could forge a ruling coalition instead. Civic Coalition ( <small>KO</small> ), an alliance which includes Mr Tusk&#39;s Civic Platform ( <small>PO</small> ) and several centrist and left-wing parties, is polling at around 30%. It would probably work with the Left and the Third Way, a centrist newcomer, each at 10%.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The stakes are unusually high. <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> has been in power for two terms—and no party has yet won a third consecutive stint in office. In the past eight years, Mr Morawiecki&#39;s party has packed courts and filled public media with propaganda. Its <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/02/16/polands-rule-of-law-conflict-with-the-eu-is-coming-to-a-head">assault on the rule of law</a> led the European Commission to freeze billions of euros of pandemic funds earmarked for Poland. The opposition fears that another four years would allow <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> to turn Poland into an authoritarian state, and take it out of the <small>EU</small> . <small>PO</small> has promised to put ruling-party politicians in jail for theft and breaching the constitution.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In such a close race, turnout will be a deciding factor. <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> needs to motivate voters in its rural strongholds, where turnout tends to be lower than in cities—57% compared with 64% at the previous election in 2019. To do so it has presented an opposition victory as a doomsday scenario that might lead to an increase in the retirement age (which <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> lowered) and cuts to benefits (which <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> has doled out generously). It has used the state broadcaster, <small>TVP</small> , to launch relentless personal attacks on Donald Tusk, a former president of the European Council. Mr Tusk&#39;s German heritage is played up. He is portrayed, with scant evidence, as plotting with European bureaucrats, German and even Russian leaders to undermine Poland&#39;s independence. Meanwhile the opposition hopes that mudslinging by both sides might deter wavering PiS voters: those already repulsed by the nastiness of politics might not show up at the polls.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But the hostility is not just for show: this election really is personal. Mr Morawiecki worked for Mr Tusk as an economic adviser from 2010 until 2012. (“I won&#39;t have advisers like this again,” gibed Mr Tusk during this week&#39;s debate.) And the hatred between Mr Tusk and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of <small>P</small> i <small>S</small> and a former prime minister, runs much deeper. Their feud is almost as old as <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2023/06/15/what-to-read-to-understand-modern-poland">modern Poland</a> and has come to define much of its politics. Mr Kaczynski has long argued that the country&#39;s transition out of communism in the 1990s unfairly vested power and money in the hands of liberal big-city elites, represented by Mr Tusk. He also blames his rival for a plane crash in 2010 that killed his twin brother Lech, then Poland&#39;s president, although official investigations have cleared Mr Tusk of responsibility. At a rally in August, Mr Kaczynski described his opponent as “pure evil”. This year&#39;s vote may be their last chance to settle scores. Mr Tusk is 66, Mr Kaczynski 74—and a new generation of voters is tired of their duelling. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 16:52:45 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/evrrhqpids5s4pbl3jfc978bkct733af</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/10/11/why-the-polish-election-campaign-has-been-so-vicious </item><item><title><![CDATA[Like human armies, army ants trail crowds of hangers-on]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-1746s8a e1ey6m752"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>L</span> <small>ike human</small> armies, army ants spell trouble for anything that finds itself in their path. The insects make a habit of <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/07/07/ants-acacias-and-shameless-bribery">killing organisms</a> , often much larger than themselves, breaking them into pieces and dragging the morsels back to their bivouacs. But they do not eat everything. Rubbish piles full with discarded bits of prey are a feature of army ant bases.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Where there is carrion, there are usually scavengers. But little is known about which animals scavenge on army ant leavings. As recounted in a paper in <i>Ecology &amp; Evolution</i> , Christoph von Beeren at the Technical University of Darmstadt and Daniel Kronauer at the Rockefeller University in New York, both entomologists, went to the rainforests of Costa Rica to find out. They found an entire ecosystem in miniature thriving among the leftovers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Tracking scavengers such as vultures or hyenas on the savannah can be done with a folding chair and a pair of binoculars. Monitoring tiny insects in a rainforest is much trickier—one reason why ant scavengers had not been examined before. But the researchers hoped modern <small>DNA</small> analysis techniques might make the job manageable. Working with a team of colleagues, they followed ant trails back to their bivouacs, finding 34 sites in total.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The researchers used a handheld vacuum cleaner to suck up all the bugs at each refuse pile and brought the sucked up samples back to a field laboratory for sorting. To keep the task manageable, the team confined themselves to examining only the beetles they had collected, leaving the other critters for later work. They identified the beetles they could and ran <small>DNA</small> analyses on those that they could not.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In total, they collected 8,364 adult beetles, 511 beetle larvae and 24 beetle eggs. Those were spread across 91 species, several of which were entirely new to science. Aside from that being far more than anyone had expected, the presence of the larvae and eggs indicates that the refuse piles are not so much convenient restaurants as full-on homes, where the beetles live out their entire lives.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Precisely how these species manage to avoid being eaten themselves by their army-ant hosts remains to be determined. Dr von Beeren speculates that a hygiene instinct that keeps the ants from eating material that has been taken to their refuse piles is at least partially responsible. And many species of beetles are able to produce compounds that smell repulsive to ants.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The research only scratches the surface of what is going on in the rubbish piles. Besides a bewildering variety of beetles, the middens were rife with mites, springtails (whose ability to jump long distance often sees them confused with fleas), as well as other varieties of scavenging insect that the team simply did not have time to include in their analysis. With so many different species present, the chances are high that among these insects are some predators too, seeking to feed on unsuspecting scavengers in turn.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Before mechanised transport and long supply lines, human armies were followed around by cooks, merchants, beer-sellers and prostitutes, all of whom made a living off the activities of the soldiers. It seems that army ants, with their own host of hangers-on, are not <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/09/03/ants-and-humans-have-shaped-each-others-destinies">so different</a> . <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 16:35:59 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/gtamu5pppenejof941rqr5ser03fhk6t</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/10/11/like-human-armies-army-ants-trail-crowds-of-hangers-on</item></channel></rss>
