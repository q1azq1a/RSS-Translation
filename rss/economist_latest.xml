在他位于德里市中心南区的办公室坐下来接受<i>《经济学人》</i>的采访。他就印度与美国、中国和俄罗斯的关系及其成为全球南方领导者的努力发表了看法。他还阐述了他对印度在世界上长期未来角色的看法。这是谈话的文字记录，为了篇幅和清晰度进行了轻微编辑。</p><p

Jaishankar</b>我认为你下周将看到的是印美关系状态的公开和可见的表达，这是非常好的，一天比一天好，一天比一天重要.这将主要在对话中体现出来，也许在某些理解中，当然在某些会公开表示的方向上。因此，当我们结束那次访问时，我认为明确无误的信息是，这种关系正走在正确的轨道上，并且非常非常迅速地向前发展。</p><p class="article__body-text">你可以说这是过去二十年的故事，但在过去十年中，它的势头确实有所增强。在这二十年里，我们实际上在美国有过四位总统，他们彼此截然不同。然而，将他们团结在一起的一项承诺确实是发展与印度的关系。在印度方面，你有两个政府。我肯定会争辩说，这个人在推动这种关系并赋予它今天所具有的那种实质或重量方面没有那么犹豫。</p><aside

class="article__body-text"><b>TE</b>您提到了我们下周可能会发布的公告。拜登政府已经通报说，我们期望看到的国防合作协议将是自 2005 年民用核合作协议以来两国关系中最大的里程碑。你同意这种描述吗？</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>让他们做他们喜欢做的事。我是一个谨慎的人，我已经待了很长时间了。我一般不做预测，我给人们一种广泛的期望。所以我会说，这就是方向。我们必须拭目以待，看看在总理离开时我们能够具体完成哪些工作。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b>好吧，我不问具体细节，但这种防务合作在两国关系中有多重要？</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b> Important 是一个非常低调的词。我认为这很关键。在我们这个不断变化的世界中，美国在审视印太地区时，看到了印度作为政治战略伙伴的价值。就我们而言，当我们评估全球竞争和全球多样性带来的新可能性时，美国是一个非常独特的伙伴。</p><p class="article__body-text">所以在过去的 20 年里，这种关系已经加强，其中很多实际上是在安全和国防方面。二十年前，印度与美国几乎没有任何防务交易，1965 年后实行武器禁运。偶尔会有一些例外。但总的来说，40 年来，美国实际上根本没有向印度进行过大规模的军售。现在，如果你看看今天，我们运营着三架美国飞机，P8、C-130 和 C-17。我们经营多种直升机——支奴干直升机、阿帕奇直升机。我们的一些大炮是美国的。这是我们可能与之进行最多锻炼的国家，也是我们与之进行非常深入的政策磋商的国家。所以毫无疑问，战略方面是这种关系的核心。我不想低估变化的其他方面，我认为这些方面也非常重要。当然，人与人之间的联系，以及由此产生的技术联系，确实非常了不起。我认为<small>美国</small>与任何其他国家都没有像与印度那样的技术联系。贸易和投资一直在回升……</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b>你是说通过私营部门？</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>这是一个以私营部门为主的经济体。曾经有一段时间你谈到经济问题时说是私营部门。今天我的假设是它是私营部门，除非你需要通过说不来限定它，这实际上是由政府完成的。贸易一直很好，投资流量正在增长。技术联系一直很强大。上上下下的学生人数都不错。有很多美国人居住在印度，因为他们中的许多人是印度裔。因此，无论以何种标准衡量，公民社会的支持都非常强大。这是一种在街头得到支持的关系。如今，美国的情况并非总是如此。这是一种流行的关系。我认为有一股巨大的顺风在推动我们前进。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b>我想你说过，也许其他人也说过，这种关系在印度街头很流行，但在印度精英阶层中并不总是如此。现在还是这样吗？</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>这部分是我写的一本书的主题。我的观点是，精英们在意识形态上对美国非常拘束或非常怀疑。因此，冷战结束后还有可能被利用的可能性。这些被相对谨慎地利用，在某种程度上是可疑的。上一次<small>BJP</small> [执政的印度人民党] 在总理 [Atal Bihari] Vajpayee 的领导下执政，取得了一些进展。然后在[曼莫汉]辛格总理的领导下，你达成了核协议。但是因为有犹豫，本该迈出的步伐没有迈出。显然，与政治情绪相比，公众情绪对美国关系的开放和欢迎程度要​​高得多。 2015 年后情况发生了变化。在过去的十年里，你的政府没有那些意识形态上的犹豫。所以你会看到这段关系更顺利地向前发展。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b>尽管如此，我感兴趣的是，当你几天前发表评论时，关于莫迪政府九年的外交政策，你几乎没有提到美国，两次非常非常顺便地提到美国。那是为什么？</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>看，老实说，这取决于我在和谁说话，以及我在哪儿说话。当我发言时，我不知道你指的是我的哪一篇演讲。我已经做了很多，我在瓦拉纳西做了一个，我在那里参加了 G20。在我出发之前，我在德里做了一些。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b>这是德里的一名记者。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>你知道，对公众来说，你真的不会谈论“印度和 A 国”和“印度和 B 国”。你试图做的是向他们展示一个能够在大舞台上发挥作用的印度，能够处理经常无法相处的多个大国之间的矛盾。一个印度正在做出巨大努力来改造邻近地区，因此我们创造了一种区域主义，这种区域主义已经遗憾地缺席了四十年。所以你正在与国内观众交谈，并且正在讲述大事件。我还可以指出我在谈话和采访中说过，印<small>美</small>关系的转变是我职业生涯的重大变化，现在已经进入第四个十年了。因此，如果你问我自从你开始从事这项业务以来发生了什么变化，我会说实际上是印<small>美</small>关系。</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>谢谢</b>。西方政府仍然经常谈论维护 1945 年后以美国为首的全球秩序的必要性。这是印度承认或支持的命令吗？</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>不，我认为你在这里对西方政府不公平，当然对<small>美国</small>和拜登政府也不公平。我认为他们敏锐地意识到 1945 年后的秩序受到了严峻挑战，他们需要一个新的模板、新的合作伙伴，他们需要超越联盟结构。因此，如果您没有误会的话，我相信媒体在很多方面都落后于对政策的理解。从广义上讲，西方政府——当然是美国，我想对澳大利亚说同样的话，它是我们的另一个四方合作伙伴——认为世界在过去 20 年里发生了根本性的变化，而今天这需要一套非常非常不同的关系</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE</b> To the Quad，您提到的那个分组主要是关于安全性的吗？作为后续行动，如果可以的话，它将如何随着时间的推移而演变？</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>那群人相处融洽。如果你问我，你与<small>英国</small>或<small>美​​国</small>的关系主要是为了安全吗？我会说，看，关系就是关系。是否出现安全问题？他们当然知道。但是选择一个特定的方面并说，这就是它的真正意义是很有吸引力的。我认为现实要复杂得多。从 Quad 一开始，从它早期的化身，当它不起作用时，我就与它联系在一起。当我今天看 Quad 时，Quad 提供人道主义援助、抗灾能力，Quad 在接种疫苗方面进行了尝试。它提供奖学金，提供关键和新兴技术。它做电信。</p><p class="article__body-text"> Quad 确实是两个仍在展开的非常有趣的倡议的基础。一是印太经济框架，涉及很多其他国家，还有印太海域意识，这与合作应对非法捕鱼等挑战有关。所以四方的四个国家，谁碰巧在印太地区的四个角落，他们走到了一起，因为他们相信共同努力可以更好地满足他们的利益。所以我不会把它限制在一个主题上。我们没有人在法庭上同意我们会讨论这个而不讨论那个。所以我认为我们会随着世界的发展而变化。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b>这表明安全性并不是 Quad 的首要和中心，尽管它显然在其中。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>你知道，我不想进行解析练习。这是这四个国家如何对待彼此的总和。我可以转身问你，你怎么看安全？今天对我来说，技术安全和经济安全可能是安全的最重要方面。因此，如果我和我的 Quad 合作伙伴一起坐下来锻炼，了解关键和新兴技术，比如 5G 和 6G，你会问我，这是电信还是安全？我告诉你，两者都是。安全性变得更大了，所以在某种程度上，答案是肯定的。如果您使用非常狭隘、老式的安全观点，我会说也许您需要关注安全性而不是 Quad。安全不仅仅是军队之间的相互交往。对我来说，安全是一个巨大的景观，一整套非常复杂的联系、互动和关系。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b>谈到北部边境地区，您谈到要恢复实控线沿线的“和平与安宁”。就最后剩下的阵地就[与中国]达成缓冲区协议能实现和平与安宁吗？你认为它的可能性有多大？</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>我想倒带一点。我们与中国的问题并不新鲜。他们实际上回到了 1950 年代。如果我没记错的话，我们与中国的第一次谈判早在 1958 年。我想我是当时在场的唯一一个人。现在，很多时候，当你遇到这些情况时，你有两个声称的土地，印度声称的土地和中国声称的土地，它们并不重合。双方都派出巡逻队来维护他们的主张线。问题往往是这些巡逻队相互碰撞，然后争夺他们的管辖权。这一直是运行问题。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">现在，当你遇到非常紧张的局势或偶尔发生暴力局势时，两国已经达成了一些谅解，即在某个特定区域进行自我克制巡逻。这不是第一次发生。如果你去 1958 年，那也发生了。我们在 1980 年代与中国人发生了重大分歧，当时谈判持续了七八年。即便如此，我们也了解您会做什么，但更重要的是，您不会做什么？这种理解是双向的。有我部不能巡的地方，也有他部不能巡的地方。</p><p class="article__body-text">这是我们解决当前一些问题的方式之一。我们还有一些其他问题需要解决。当我们谈话时，您如何制定对双方都适用的解决方案？我不会简单地预测，因为在这个时候，我还在和他们交谈。我要说的是，如果你回顾过去三年，每次都会有人说，好吧，你知道，这是不可能解决的，这永远不会发生。如果我可以非常礼貌地说的话，他们已经一次又一次地被证明是错误的。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b>让我们假设在最后剩下的闪点上有一个缓冲区协议。这将如何潜在地改变印度与中国的关系？</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>我不会进入那个假设。我只是不想参与其中。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b>已经进行了18轮指挥官级别的会谈。你一直在通过不同的闪点取得进展，并且模式是在双方创建一些缓冲区。因此，如果您能在 Demchok 和 Depsang 平原（他们现在正在谈论的重点）做同样的事情，是否可以提供可持续的解决方案？</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>我不想被卷入其中，但每个部门和每个情况都不一样。即使是在 a、b 和 c 中起作用的东西，如果你深入到复杂的地方，遗憾的是我无法与你分享，它们也不相同。这是一个非常复杂的问题，这就是为什么我们需要如此多的回合和如此巨大的努力。这不是查看地图并决定要做什么的问题。那里有地形。地形有其自身的价值和自身的劣势。所以每一个都是非常详细、非常复杂的谈判。但是您的评论假定推断以前的解决方案是解决此问题的一种方法。我不准备被卷入其中，只是因为这不一定是解决问题的方式。所以我要提醒的是，这不仅仅是说三个地方以这种方式完成的问题，因此四个和五个也将如此。这不是它的工作方式。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b>所以你不想对中国进行假设。我明白那个。我能不能至少试着问一下，这样的解决方案可能会对你们与美国的关系产生什么影响？它会以某种方式改变他们吗？</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>没有。我对中国的这轮问题是从2020年夏天开始的。我对中国的这一系列问题与我对美国关系的发展没有关联。正如我所指出的，我与美国的关系在过去的二十年中一直在稳步发展，并且在过去十年中加速发展。现有的经验数据表明，与中国边境发生的任何事情无关，印<small>美</small>关系一直在顺畅发展，不仅顺畅顺畅，还不错。所以我根本不鼓励你建立这种联系。我认为这是一个错误的。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b>好的，我同意你的观点。请问，对于那些因乌克兰战争而批评印俄关系的欧美人士，你有何回应？</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>这取决于。批评的问题是你必须看看我在和谁说话。所以这是一个问题，你在回应谁？于是有人...</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b>好吧，首先是<small>美国</small>国会。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>有些人，即使在<small>美国</small>国会，我也不认为<small>美国</small>国会是一个无差别的群体。我认为有知识的人多，有知识的人少。我并没有以任何方式削弱第二类，只是他们不像那些知识渊博的人那样熟悉这种关系和我们。今年，我们迎来了有史以来权力最大的国会代表团。查克·舒默 (Chuck Schumer) 带领四位委员会主席出席了会议。这真的很了不起，即使按照美国[国会代表团]的标准也是如此。我认为他们完全明白，俄罗斯关系是 60 年历史的产物。经过 60 年的历史，这并不像你说的那样，我改变了主意。现实生活并非如此。</p><p class="article__body-text">知识渊博的美国人，当然我会把政府和国会领导层归为此类，他们确实明白这一点，因为美国在 1965 年后选择不向印度出售武器，我们真的别无选择，只能去苏联。现在，不可能是你的选择把我推向了某个方向，现在你对此有疑问。这是你必须忍受的现实。</p><p class="article__body-text">但话虽如此，我不会将问题仅仅归结为印度对俄罗斯的军事依赖。同样，这是一个比这复杂得多的主题。对我们来说，有三个欧亚大国，俄罗斯、中国和印度。这有它自己的动力。这不是事务性的。这是地缘政治。当你说地缘政治时，我们谈论的是当大国彼此靠近或远离时发生的结果，或者取决于它们合作的质量。因此，欧亚大陆的很多事情将取决于这三个大国的动态。我们外交政策的基本原则仍然有效，即与俄罗斯保持牢固和良好的关系至关重要。地缘政治逻辑表明了这一点。所以我不想把这归结为军事依赖。这是一个重要的部分。但我们这边有更大的地缘政治前景或计算。我给你的是印度视角，我们希望有多种选择。显然要尽力而为。我不认为这有什么不对。每个国家都愿意这样做。有些可能会受到其他义务的约束，有些可能不会。所以对我来说，这不仅仅是说印度人拥有他们从过去继承下来的庞大军事武库。我也向前看，我做我的计算，我制定我的策略。我看看你知道，各种关系的成本和收益是什么？外交的真正挑战是如何调和相互矛盾的拉和推？</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b>在你的书中，你写了关于这个问题的内容，本质上是关于多极化和平衡的，从中得出......</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>首先，感谢您的阅读。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b>嗯，谢谢你写的。你写道 2005 年的核协议，我可以引用你的话，它“对其他关系的增长施加压力”。换句话说，印度向美国靠拢使印度也有责任关注与俄罗斯的关系。乌克兰的战争、与中国更爆炸性的边界问题是否改变了这种平衡计算？如果是这样，怎么办？</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>其中一些仍在展开。所以请不要将此作为确定的答案。我认为您会以非常不同的方式看待这种情况。让我以俄罗斯为例。我怀疑整个乌克兰问题将意味着俄罗斯，一个真正属于欧亚国家的国家，今天可能正在发现或预计其与西方的关系的很大一部分将不再有效。因此，它重新计算其优先级和关系。所以我希望俄罗斯更多地转向亚洲。从历史上看，俄罗斯一直认为自己是欧洲人。纵观历史，俄罗斯人的自我认知一直非常欧洲化，而不是亚洲化。当前的事件很可能会让他们转过身来，重新定位他们的优先事项，更多地关注亚洲或非西方合作伙伴必须提供的东西。所以如果你回顾一年半的时间，我认为有很多证据表明这正在发生。你会看到俄罗斯在亚洲、非洲和中东的活动要多得多，经济能量已经转移到其他地方，政治能量也可能是。所以我想说这将产生长期和重大的后果。就印度而言，中国... </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-5" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b>我可以跟进吗？你似乎是在暗示，乌克兰战争是印度拉近与俄罗斯关系或从与俄罗斯关系中获得更多利益的战略机遇，我并不是贬义这个意思。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>不，这与其说是机会，不如说是挑战。我正在向您描述我认为可能的地缘政治趋势。我试图从目前的困境中预测俄罗斯的行为和计算。现在其他一些国家——在这种情况下，印度，因为你正在和我说话——是否能从中得到一些东西，这是一个次要的问题。有些国家可以，有些国家不能。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b>嗯，这对你来说是头等大事。这是你要按的？</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>看，我当然认为非常有趣的是，直到一年前，我们与俄罗斯的贸易可能甚至比俄罗斯与一个不大的欧洲国家的贸易还要小。这主要是因为他们关注的是西方。因此，如果他们的重点转移，就会有结果。我发现很难准确预测是什么，但再次强调，如果我要进行趋势分析，今天的印度是第五大经济体，可能会在本世纪末成为第三大经济体，显然是一个日益重要的资源消费国，不断增长的商品和服务出口国。因此，如果你有一个更关注亚洲的俄罗斯，以及一个在全球经济中越来越重要的因素的印度，对我来说，这两种趋势交叉是常识。</p><p class="article__body-text">现在这不会孤立地发生。在同一时期，我可以想象印度与美国、印度与欧洲之间的互补性，我认为这些互补性是巨大的，而且我认为过去未被充分利用，这些互补性也将实现。所以我不想说我们要朝一个特定的方向转变，因为机会来了。你会看到这样的景象，巨大的变化已经开始发生。不同国家的这些变化将反映在他们的前景和规划中。</p><p class="article__body-text">我只是想将其稍微转移到经济学中，因为它是有道理的。你知道，我们一直在认真地与<small>英国</small>谈判<small>FTA</small> [自由贸易协定]。有了<small>欧盟</small>，我们就有了欧亚经济联盟<small>自由贸易协定</small>，但进展缓慢。<small>美国</small>不在<small>FTA</small>游戏中，但我们认为还有其他方法可以剥猫皮。所以，你有一个印度正在寻找跨越多个地区的多种机会，通常是利益冲突的政体。它正在努力在各个方面取得进展。一个挑战是中国，原因我们都知道。但是对于大国来说，你可以看到印度在政治、战略、外交、文化、技术等方面的互动取得了广泛的进步，几乎所有这些国家。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b>我只想强调这一点，如果可以的话，我也希望你能去中国，我打断了你。但是你在 2005 年后的情况中所描述的是，作为一个战略问题，甚至是学说问题，印度想要跟进 B 大国，因为它已经发展了与 A 大国的关系。这种战略计算是否仍然适用于情况？</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>如果我要完全公正地对待我自己的书，我实际上提出的是 2005 年在一个方向上取得了进步，对其他人施加了这样做的压力。但我后来继续说，在 2014 年之后，我们的强制性现在实际上变成了纳伦德拉·莫迪总理及其政府有意识地、有意识地向各个方向推进，而不是作为强制性的，而是作为战略的一部分。所以我认为在 2005 年，我们仍处于吸收一系列事件的阶段，然后试图了解它对其他关系意味着什么。十年后，在这个政府的领导下，有一个系统的观点认为这是我们对全球格局的分析。这些是关键中心，这些是重要的合作伙伴。我们今天必须制定一项战略，以非常协调的方式与他们中的每一个一起行动，这样我们才能获得最好的结果。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b>我早些时候打断了你关于中国的话题。你想添加一些东西吗？</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>不，我说的是与中国有关的挑战。我的意思是，这已经是一种竞争关系。但竞争关系有底线稳定性。因为从1988年开始，我们就非常清楚地认识到，边境地区的和平与安宁是两国关系发展的前提。现在，我不想让你把这与解决边界边界问题混淆，因为中国人经常试图将两者混为一谈。我们知道解决边界问题需要时间，但至少确保和平与安宁，即边界上基本没有暴力行为，是推动两国关系向前发展的最低共同点。</p><p class="article__body-text">从 1988 年到 2020 年，这种情况基本上一直存在。摩擦越来越大。但中国在 2020 年所做的事情，当 covid 正在进行时，至少在这个国家，请记住，我们当时正处于封锁之中，这产生了后果。或许他们认为它会产生后果，甚至在操作上也是如此。在封锁期间调动自 1962 年以来最多的军队，这违反了两项协议，其中有明确的条款阻止他们这样做——我认为这引发了很多问号。它导致了死亡，这使事情变得更糟。因此，除非我们找到解决方案，否则任何政府都不能，至少在我看来，假装一切都好，让我们在我们关系的其他方面开展业务。那是完全不现实的。</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>谢谢</b>。回到您的书，您在结论中写道，“印度方式更像是塑造者或决定者，而不是弃权者”。这是您描述的印度在世界上的传统角色，还是您想要定义的与尼赫鲁式不结盟形成对比的角色？</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>两者兼而有之。这将再次导致我们对我们的社会进行长期的文化解释。事实上，这是一个极度自我关注的社会。它需要定期提醒，外面有一个世界，那个世界正在发生一些事情，这对我们的社会和我们的利益产生了非常非常深刻的影响。因此，我们应该在场，我们应该积极，我们应该成为那个环境中正在发生的事情的一个因素。因为如果你不这样做，无论我们喜欢与否，这个世界都会对我们的命运产生越来越大的影响。如果我今天要写一本书，我实际上会说世界已经来到你家门口。看看 covid 的例子。在其他地方发生的事情接管了每个印度家庭长达两年半的时间。甚至像乌克兰这样的冲突也会对通货膨胀和能源成本产生直接影响。鉴于这些深层联系，这是对更多活动的呼吁。</p><p class="article__body-text">但它的第二部分也是，在一段时间内，人们从他们认为尼赫鲁所相信的东西中形成了这种神学。然后这变成了一种关于如何远离麻烦的教条。你知道，我们为什么要参与其中？我不认为我们应该涉足世界上的每一个问题。我需要看自己的兴趣，我需要理智，我也需要了解自己的能力。但对我来说，这是一个非常重要的问题，年轻一代的印度人必须开始准备更多地走入世界，发表意见，参与辩论，试图塑造和影响。这就是我要去的地方。</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b>因此，您批评不结盟的那种胆怯和过度谨慎，您认为印度外交仍然以任何方式受到这种遗产的影响吗？</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b>我不是为此批评不结盟，我批评的是某种谨慎，这实际上不仅仅是一种外交姿态。让我举一个例子。我们说我们希望与非洲保持良好关系。好吧，这没什么问题。现在，如果你是认真的，那么你必须走出去，把钱投到非洲，你必须说，好吧，今天，非洲有问题，非洲需要疫苗。所以伙计们出去做点什么。今天的非洲需要更多的发展选择，那就去开发更多的选择吧。所以在过去的十年里，你看到了一个印度，它正在世界上 78 个国家开展开发工作。我们已经完成或正在完成近 600 个重大项目。现在，这些不仅是邻国，还可能远至拉丁美洲和中美洲、加勒比海地区和太平洋地区。</p><p class="article__body-text">我们今天的工作是将全球意识带入印度人的思想中，让他们为一个将影响我们生活的世界做好准备，无论他们是否意识到这一点。我们的历史是，世界已经改变，而印度没有意识到它改变了多少。典型的例子当然是我们与英国的历史。不是现在，是百年前。那么今天，您如何获得对世界的足够认识？你如何真正利用这种意识来创建一个矩阵，你现在开始从我们的角度塑造世界的样子，而不是处于其他人的行动和计划的接受端。</p><p class="article__body-text">在过去的十年里，我们一直非常积极地塑造社区。我们正在做的事情很容易让人想起<small>东盟</small>[东南亚国家联盟] 所做的事情，欧洲所做的事情，拉丁美洲部分地区所做的事情，只是这次是一个国家在推动它，而不是一个国家区域契约。所以如果你看看电力传输，如果你看看燃料管道、公路、水路、铁路线、机场，南亚实际上已经经历了一场变革。我们今天去尼泊尔或孟加拉国或斯里兰卡。在斯里兰卡所关心的地方，让我们向前迈进。他们花了很长时间才与国际货币基金组织谈判达成协议。如果我没有愿意为他们投入 4.5 亿美元，他们早就沉没了。</p><p class="article__body-text">在某种程度上，我们是历史的受害者。分区在地缘战略上对我们的影响很糟糕，它确实缩小了我们的规模。那么，您现在如何收回社区的其余部分，即扩展的社区？你如何更好地处理海湾、中亚、海洋空间和东南亚？然后你把它带到更高的层次。因此，进入非洲，尤其是非洲东海岸，进入印度洋-太平洋地区，直至澳大利亚。 So I present to you today, almost India at the centre. I&#39;m giving you these concentric circles, the concentric circles of my immediate neighbourhood, the extended neighbourhood and the oceanic space, then the one beyond that, which is the Indo-Pacific. So it goes up to Australia, it goes up to East Africa, and then start preparing for a global footprint.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Preparations for a global footprint take two generations, we should have started earlier, but at least we are starting now. So how do you get people in Latin America and Central America and Mongolia and the Pacific used to India in their calculations? You know, how do you trade with them? How do you do projects? How do they know your products? Where is the intersection of interests? All of this is happening at the same time, so it&#39;s a long answer. But I have the opportunity to practise some of what I wrote in the book as a minister, and that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do.</p><p class="article__body-text"> I&#39;ve been helped by the fact that I have a prime minister who has that global worldview, he has been absolutely convinced from day one that his responsibility is to prepare us for that global role. For the first time in our history a prime minister is telling people, this is an era. People normally say this is a term, someone more visionary might say, this is a decade. This prime minister is telling the country to think about what will be in 25 years. And if you can get a country like India to start thinking in a 25-year timeframe, a lot of what we will do may not make sense in the short term. It may appear to be an expensive option which doesn&#39;t look that rewarding. For example our industrial policy, our embrace of technology, our desire to see technology-driven goods produced in this country–this is a 25-year vision. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-6" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b> You anticipate one of my remaining questions. What does the Indian role in the world look like in 25 years&#39; time?</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b> I&#39;ll give you an answer which I haven&#39;t touched on so far. I was in Brussels two weeks ago, for the first meeting of the Trade and Technology Council. This is a body which the European Union only has with two partners, with the <small>US</small> and with us. The purpose of that discussion was to address the two big challenges today. The supply-chain challenge is economic concentration, which leaves us very vulnerable to a single geography. The digital challenge is that you put a premium on trust and transparency, which is a polite way of saying you&#39;d like to know who&#39;s handling your data. In a more digital world, which is also more of a supply-chain world, how do you ensure that you are comfortable with the flows of the economy and the digital? The digital realm captures so much of each one of us in an unprecedented way that you cannot take a societal or national risk with it. You don&#39;t want your entire data to go into the wrong hands, you would take extreme precautions against it.</p><p class="article__body-text"> So we are no longer running a price-driven globalisation. The old 1990s-model of globalisation asked, where can I get it on scale? Where can I get it at cost? And where can I get it on time? This globalisation we&#39;re heading to asks, who&#39;s handling my data? What are the legal rules and constraints out there? Where is the supply chain passing through? Which part of it can be leveraged at the wrong moment? And how do I build redundancy and in some cases separation? This takes the form of many debates, including the de-risking debate. I think that&#39;s a more sensible way of capturing it than decoupling, which is too strong a word and too impractical an option.</p><p class="article__body-text"> If this is the kind of world we are heading for, where does India get into all of this? We have one major card, which is human resources, that I can churn out people at a scale and rate which no other democratic society can. In that same period, I have to make it easier to do business. And part of making it easier to do business is to make radical improvements in my infrastructure, which is what we are trying to do. So imagine an India with much stronger human resources, with a much better infrastructure, with a much easier, friendlier business club, which has arrangements with a lot of major economies which make possible easier flows and greater confluence. It would be a very different India. And it would be a very different India in terms of the magnitude of its contribution to the global order. So I would say...</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b> A digital superpower? How would you characterise the power that India is going to have?</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b> I am very cautious with....</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b> I believe you&#39;ve spoken to journalists before…</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b> I do believe we should be more ambitious. I don&#39;t see anything wrong with that, but we should be ambitious backed up by a determination to do that, you know, ambition should not be an articulation. Ambition should be a kind of a signalling of an intent. And that intent must be carried out. So I would hope that this is the kind of direction we&#39;re going. If I can bring this back to where we started our conversation, that is why the American visit is so important. The indispensable partners for each other in this regard are India and the United States. That collaboration today can produce a magnitude of solutions for the kind of world I&#39;m talking of, the new globalisation or re-globalisation which I think holds immense possibilities for us.</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b> And India is indispensable to America&#39;s prospects of realising that view worldwide?</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b> Let&#39;s say American companies are now looking a decade ahead. A decade ahead from now, in an even more digital world, in an even more supply-chain world, where would the <small>US</small> find partners where it can be sure that the fundamental models are compatible, that the fundamentals of our beliefs and values are the same? When you speak of a world of trusted collaboration, because that&#39;s the world we are heading towards, which countries will be able to work with which other countries? I think India has a lot to offer in that world.</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b> Because you need trust in that relationship when the commodity is data, rather than goods?</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b> You need trust, you need people, you need trust, you need talent, you need skill, you need demographics.</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b> Because of the nature of digital?</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b> I mean look at the chip industry. As the semiconductor industry goes through this current phase of repositioning, of churning anyway, I think it will be very interesting to see what relationships emerge from it. These are possibilities, I&#39;m not describing to you a landscape which exists. In this area, I&#39;m willing to make a prediction that this is where the world is going.</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b> Let me ask you to switch tack. You recently said of a <small>BBC</small> documentary on the prime minister: &#39;This is politics by other means. I don&#39;t know if election season has started in India, but for sure it started in London and in New York&#39;. What did you mean by that?</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b> Look the film was seen... to describe it as partisan would be an understatement. It did not take into account a very central set of developments pertaining to the matter. So, frankly, it was seen in this country as a political hit job.</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b> I mean, the suggestion of this quote is that the governments of the <small>UK</small> , the <small>US</small> ...</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b> No, no, sorry, that&#39;s in your mouth.</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b> &#39;I don&#39;t know if election season has started in India, but for sure it started in London and in New York&#39;. The inference is this was a political initiative.</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b> No, it was political.</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b> By the <small>BBC</small> ?</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b> Among others, yes.</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b> Among others…who were the others?</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b> Look, I think we are having this problem with a lot of media houses, with some think-tanks, a lot of activist organisations, with a lot of political forces. But I think for you to suggest that I imputed anything to the governments, I don&#39;t think would be a fair inference. I was very careful in my first...</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b> I only want to understand your words, what&#39;s the implication of “election season” in that case?</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b> Meaning that they, as our elections come closer, they start doing these things. That&#39;s what I meant.</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b> I have two questions, if I may.</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b> We are seriously running out of time.</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b> You&#39;ve been very generous. And we can deal with them both cursorily. One is about an unrelated political question. This is about the role of foreign policy in domestic politics, a big issue in America. And a big issue in some of your speeches, the idea of relating foreign policy to the Indian voter. I wonder if I could just ask you about that. What is the proper role of foreign policy in domestic discourse?</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b> As I travel around the country, I see a level of interest in foreign policy I&#39;ve never seen before. In many ways, the prime minister has been able to connect the world and what we are doing with the world to the interests of people and to their everyday lives. When you are an aspirational society, that has its attractions. At the end of the day the role of foreign policy is to communicate to the world outside a unified and considered view of what our national interests are. And see how we obtain that. Now, I&#39;m not impervious to the political debates at home. You can have political debates at home. I don&#39;t have an issue if there are people who want to tell the world how well they&#39;re doing. I think that&#39;s completely reasonable. But in any country, when the politicians of the country seek the intervention or the support of politics outside, I think that&#39;s a very slippery slope. So I am a consistent advocate of trying to keep foreign policy as unified and nonpartisan as possible. Obviously, I don&#39;t always succeed. The opposition sometimes has different views. That&#39;s life.</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b> Final question, if I may, then. This sort of brings us back to one of our starting points, which was your remarks in Delhi the other day, which emphasise the development projects, including in Africa, which you mentioned earlier. That&#39;s evidence, if you like, for India as the leader of the Global South, which is another way that you might draw some of those concentric rings of influence. What does that leadership look like going forward beyond? I understand the record so far, and the ambition on exporting digital utilities. What beyond that can you tell us about this?</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>SJ</b> We have just come out of the G20 development ministers meeting where, after all the wrangling on the geopolitical issues, I still got unanimous approval for two outcomes. One outcome pertains to the sustainable development goals. The other pertains to the environment where the prime minister has tabled an initiative about how we can change our individual lifestyles.</p><p class="article__body-text"> I mention those today, because if you look at the key issues of the Global South, they are the sustainable development goals, but really we&#39;re talking health, education, development, employment, we&#39;re talking progress in climate action. We&#39;re talking food, we&#39;re talking fuel, we&#39;re talking basic amenities of life. A large part of the developing world is under stress. They had a triple whammy, because first they got hit by a set of economic forces, including higher interest rates, then they had this very scarring experience of covid. And then you have the knock-on effects from the Ukraine war.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Now, the developing world by and large feels that we are, say 130, 40 countries in the world, but we are actually marginal to the big debates going on in the world, we&#39;re not on the board of management. For them to have somebody champion the cause and put it across is very, very important. And the difference which Prime Minister Modi has made is when we got the G20 presidency, one of the first things he did was to say, I want to consult 125 others and ask: if we speak for you, please tell us what we should be saying? So we did that exercise, meaning we are not a self-assigned spokesperson of the South. The fact that we did that exercise and were able to put these things on the table had some impact on the outcomes yesterday, because a very large part of the G20 acknowledged that what we said was something which was not only speaking for India, but for the world.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Now you are asking me, where does this go from here? I feel the big challenges today are economic growth, the climate, the digital realm, and health. I will actually prolong this because I need you to understand this. If you look at our own experience in the last three and a half years, or four years, it&#39;s been remarkable. A veritable revolution has happened in this country in terms of creating a social safety net. The expectation in 2020 was that we would take such a hit from covid that this society would fall apart. Instead we were able to create food security. You know the <small>US</small> food stamp system. Here we&#39;re not giving you the stamp, we&#39;re giving you the food, and we&#39;re giving it to 800 million people. You have payments, you can say unemployment benefits, you&#39;re actually able to put payments into the bank account of more than 400 million people because there is a digital backbone, and a sense of purpose, and an inclusive approach.</p><p class="article__body-text"> I would say, if you look at our programmes, every one of our programmes today goes into hundreds of millions. We&#39;re doing a housing programme where you build houses for those most vulnerable. We&#39;ve done 31 million houses. And if you take an Indian family at 4.8 people per family, that&#39;s 150 million people who are house owners because of this scheme. The same thing with health. You know what an issue health coverage is across the board. So if you&#39;re able to scale up health, bring down pricing, create a digital system where your health benefits can be assured to you wherever you are, so that you&#39;re not trading it in, but you&#39;re using it, it gives you the opportunity to really do it on a very big scale.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A decade ago, the conventional wisdom would be that a social security system is only possible in a developed country, you have to be at least a middle income country in order to create a social security system. We have shown by the power of technology, and by the impact it has had on governance, that actually it is possible to create what is essentially a foundation of a social welfare state. So when people look for analogies for Modi, he might actually be more analogous to <small>FDR</small> [Franklin D. Roosevelt] in terms of a new deal. A large part of the population in India may actually perceive him as someone who has taken social benefits to them on an unprecedented scale.</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>TE</b> And that example and the technology itself is...</p><p class="article__body-text"> . <b>SJ Y</b> ou know, when I go out to talk to the presidents and prime ministers and finance ministers, even the foreign ministers, I spend more time talking about these things abroad than I do the vanilla foreign policy.

On June 9th Mr Johnson <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/06/10/boris-johnson-strikes-again">resigned as an <small>MP</small></a> , having seen an advance copy of the committee&#39;s findings. But he had a parting gift. Just hours before he stood down, his resignation honours list was published.</p><p class="article__body-text"> As well as making his favourite Parliament hairdresser an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire Mr Johnson nominated 16 peers to the House of Lords, Britain&#39;s upper house. (One withdrew voluntarily.) But eight, including three Tory <small>MP</small> s, were found unsuitable by the House of Lords Appointments Commission ( <small>HOLAC</small> ), the Lords committee which vets proposed members and advises the prime minister on proposed members. That was an unusually high proportion of candidates not approved. The committee&#39;s guidelines say that peers should be in “good standing” and have done nothing to bring the house into disrepute. MPs recommended for peerages were required to indicate to the committee that they would step down from the House of Commons within six months. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> An almighty intra-Conservative spat broke out when Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, accused Mr Johnson of asking him to “overrule” <small>HOLAC</small> , a charge his former boss said was baseless. One of the three <small>MP</small> s who were denied peerages resigned; a second is threatening to follow suit. The chaos points to a perennially knotty question in British politics: just how do appointments to Britain&#39;s upper house work?</p><p class="article__body-text"> The House of Lords is the second largest parliamentary assembly in the world—only China&#39;s rubber-stamp National People&#39;s Congress is larger. And unusually it has no limit on its number. It currently has 777 members, and more are added every year. Critics say it is stuffed to the ornate rafters with elderly men many of whom prefer a good lunch, and a generous attendance allowance, to the hard graft of lawmaking. Its defenders argue that the Lords has a valuable role scrutinising legislation; like the Commons, it must approve all Acts of Parliament, and often introduces valuable amendments. Because of the ways members are appointed, the reality is somewhere in between.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Twenty-six are Church of England bishops known as the Lords Spiritual. The rest are the Lords Temporal, made up of “hereditary peers” and “life peers”. Hereditary peers are the remnants of the old order. For hundreds of years aristocratic men could take up a seat in the House of Lords and pass it on to their male heirs. In 1999 a Labour government limited the number of hereditary peerages to 92. Few earls, dukes or viscounts retire. When one dies, <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/06/21/peers-fight-for-a-place-in-the-house-of-lords">by-elections</a> are held among other eligible gentry to replace him.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Life peers—including women—were introduced by a Conservative government in 1958. These include non-political “crossbench” members; each year, <small>HOLAC</small> recommends people it believes will bring expertise to the house. (In 2022 it selected Shaista Gohir, a women&#39;s-rights campaigner, and Katherine Willis, a climate-change expert.) </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> But most life peers are political appointments, created through prime ministerial honours lists. British leaders are entitled to nominate people for honours, including peerages. They may do so each time they dissolve Parliament—as must happen before a general election—and when they resign, although not all have done so. They also put forward nominations on behalf of other political parties. There is no limit on the number of nominations prime ministers can make. It has been reported that <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/20/liz-truss-is-britains-shortest-serving-prime-minister">Liz Truss</a> , Britain&#39;s shortest-serving prime minister who resigned in October, will reportedly, and belatedly, nominate four peers, roughly one for every ten days she was in office.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Appointments to the Lords are often controversial. Allies and donors may be rewarded with titles regardless of their merit as legislators. But the circumstances of Mr Johnson&#39;s latest selection are especially divisive. The furore has revived calls for reform of the appointment of members. <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/04/26/sir-keir-starmer-on-starmerism">Sir Keir Starmer</a> , the leader of the Labour opposition, has suggested replacing the Lords with an “Assembly of the Nations and Regions” of around 200 members.

But overfishing has become a crisis. It is estimated that 90 percent of the world&#39;s fisheries are being fished either at or over their capacity, while some species have been driven to extinction. Can an <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/05/31/the-future-of-fish-farming-is-on-land">innovative farming method</a> , which grows fish on dry land, solve the problem?</p><p class="article__body-text"> Abby Bertics, <i>The Economist</i> ’s science correspondent, investigates. Tackling overfishing is a problem that needs to be solved in the ocean but also by using aquaculture, according to George Clark of the Marine Stewardship Council. At a small shrimp farm in California, Steve Sutton, the boss of TransparentSea, explains how recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) work. John Sällebrant, Salten Smolt&#39;s production manager shows how RAS can be scaled-up at a Norwegian salmon farm. Plus, Matt Craze, a consultant at Spheric Research, and David Cahill of Pure Salmon, explore the future of fish farming. Alok Jha, <i>The Economist</i> ’s science and technology editor, hosts.

In English, the most common answers are “he” or “she”. But a growing number of people identify as neither male nor female, and ask to be <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/01/20/personal-pronouns-are-changing-fast">referred to with novel pronouns</a> . “They” is by far the <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2017/04/01/english-has-a-traditional-solution-to-gender-neutral-pronouns">most common</a> of these. In English, the linguistic adjustments required to accommodate non-binary people are relatively limited. For gendered languages, gender-neutral options are a bigger problem. How do these languages handle the issue?</p><p class="article__body-text"> Movements to make gendered languages less sexist have <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/01/18/the-hopeless-struggle-to-make-german-gender-neutral">existed for years</a> . Many languages have a “default masculine”, where a generic (say) student or professor is given masculine gender and mixed groups are referred to with masculine adjectives. Efforts to promote change in different countries are sparking opposition from linguistic conservatives. Berlin&#39;s mayor recently said he would refuse to sign documents using new plural endings designed to include both women and men. Germany&#39;s main opposition leader has claimed that such language is driving voters to the far right. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The push to accommodate non-binary people has in some cases piggybacked on these earlier campaigns for gender neutrality. Nearly all European languages (descended from a common ancestor) have two or three genders, and the “neuter” gender is not normally used for humans. French uses the interpunct, a kind of floating dot, to insert the feminine ending into the generic masculine: <i>prêt·e·s</i> means “ready”, and is intended to include both men and women and, presumably, those who identify as neither. But it is pronounced identically to prêts, the masculine word. As in German, no easy alternative has emerged.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Spanish activists have found a more elegant fix. They use -e endings on nouns and adjectives, in contrast to the usual -o (masculine) and -a (feminine); the pronoun elle resembles <i>él</i> (he) and <i>ella</i> (she) and is used by some non-binary people. In Swedish <i>han</i> (he) and <i>hon</i> (she) have been joined by <i>hen</i> . It serves for both non-binary people and as the gender-neutral pronoun in sentences like “If a customer has a complaint <i>they</i> should put it in writing.” It was coined decades ago, but came to prominence after it was used in a children&#39;s book in 2012. Data show that in 2018 it was about one-hundredth as frequent as <i>han</i> and <i>hon</i> put together, on an upward trend from previous years.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Some languages have a head start when it comes to accommodating non-binary people. Many—including Estonian, Chinese and Hungarian—have one word that means both “he” and “she”. Still, there can be wrinkles. In Mandarin the word tā is written using different characters for “he” (他) and “she” (她). They differ in the “radical” element, the part of the character that carries the general area of meaning: “he” has a “person” radical, while “she” has a “woman” radical. Some non-binary people have begun using a roman-alphabet TA or X in place of that radical, next to the remainder of the character. Others have tried to craft new Chinese-style characters. But the People&#39;s Republic, which has little time for transgender rights, is cold to any such ideas. If linguistic accommodations for non-binary people are to catch on, they must be used by large numbers of people, such that they become commonplace—and it helps a great deal if they are easy to say. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 14 Jun 2023 15:29:35 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/8fjurno4faies84hl1u818595ch3lde8</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/06/14/how-do-languages-with-grammatical-gender-handle-non-binary-people </item><item><title><![CDATA[A selection of novels to read this summer]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="A free beach library at the Black Sea resort of Albena in Bulgaria." fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230617_BLP504.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 48en16">.css-48en16{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}</style><!-- --> <span class="css-48en16 e16qazw91">image: Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></section><p class="article__body-text"> <b>Birnam Wood</b> .

Birnam Wood is a witchy guerrilla gardening group run by Mira Bunting, a charismatic horticulturist, and her sidekick, Shelley Noakes. For years the group has cultivated small plots of urban land in Christchurch, New Zealand. Their equipment is salvaged and they barter what they grow. Mira works full time for the collective. Her ambition is for it to make “radical, widespread and lasting social change”. When an area of rich arable land is abandoned, Mira senses that Birnam Wood may have found its playground. But someone else is interested: Robert Lemoine, an American tycoon with a calculating mind and a preternaturally calm exterior. “Birnam Wood” is distinguished by its character studies: Ms Catton, who won the Booker prize in 2013 for “ <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2014/02/24/lit-up-by-the-luminaries">The Luminaries</a> ”, skewers anti-capitalist activists with the same relish she exhibits in chewing up the billionaire class. <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/03/09/in-birnam-wood-eleanor-catton-returns-with-a-thriller">Read our full review</a> . </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> <b>Chlorine</b> . By Jade Song. <i>William Morrow; 256 pages; $30</i></p><p class="article__body-text"> The mermaids of folklore tend to be tragic figures, pining for legs and the love of human princes. But for Ren Yu, the teenage narrator of “Chlorine”, such tales misunderstand their otherworldly powers. Ren should know, since she insists she is a mermaid herself. “Mermaids are not born. We are made,” she announces. A straight-A student, star swimmer and immigrant misfit, she longs to escape her human body. Her swimming coach is lecherous and her emotionally aloof mother shows her love through cut-up fruit and high expectations. Her father is back in China, having buckled under the weight of learning English. Ms Song is good on the growing pains of young adulthood. This is a book that enlivens its coming-of-age yarn with a touch of mystery and a twist of myth. “Outwardly, I studied,” says Ren. “Inwardly, I sought the weightlessness of water, to be as liberated as the aquatic beings in my imagination.” <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/03/23/the-narrator-of-chlorine-longs-to-escape-her-human-body">Read our full review</a> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>The Five Sorrowful Mysteries of Andy Africa.</b> By Stephen Buoro. <i>Bloomsbury; 313 pages; £16.99</i></p><p class="article__body-text"> “Life in Africa is a long prayer,” reckons the hero of Stephen Buoro&#39;s debut novel. On the road, people pray that they will avoid accidents; if they crash, they pray the hospitals will be functioning. Their prayers mostly go unanswered, but still they pray. Andy Africa is a 15-year-old semi-believing Christian boy from the mainly Muslim north-west of Nigeria. His devoted Mama has brought him up on her own, making ends meet by running a small photography studio opposite the local brothel. He spends his days with his “droogs”, Slim and Morocca. He philosophises about black power and mathematics and fantasises about white girls. Temptation comes in the form of Eileen, a preacher&#39;s niece. The course of true love does not run smooth. Mr Buoro is a writer of imagination and flair and Andy Africa is an unforgettable character: an old soul, goofy and generous, who dreams his evanescent dreams while battling his friends&#39; joshing and his own longings. <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/04/05/wit-and-wisdom-in-the-five-sorrowful-mysteries-of-andy-africa">Read our full review</a> . </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> <b>A History of Burning.</b> By Janika Oza. <i>Grand Central Publishing; 400 pages; $29. Chatto &amp; Windus; £16.99</i></p><p class="article__body-text"> Janika Oza&#39;s debut novel is a multi-stranded, intergenerational epic that charts the struggles of an Indian family over almost a century. Pirbhai&#39;s life in India ends when, at 13, he is tricked and taken to Kenya and forced into servitude. One morning he is tasked with burning down the huts of a village—an act that will haunt him throughout his life. Pirbhai marries another Indian in Kenya, and the pair move to Uganda and start a family. Their eldest daughter, Latika, works as a journalist, reporting on the feverish state of the nation. Then <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/02/29/two-exhibitions-explore-dark-moments-in-ugandas-past">Idi Amin</a> seizes power and declares that “Asians have milked the cow but did not feed it.” The family flees to Canada but Latika opts to stay behind. Ms Oza&#39;s own family was expelled by Amin. She dramatises this moment of history in a series of well-drawn scenes that convey terror, injustice and brutality. Pirbhai&#39;s son pithily sums up the predicament: “Too Indian for Africa, too African for India.” <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/11/janika-ozas-debut-novel-charts-the-indian-diasporas-struggles">Read our full review</a> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>The Guest.</b> By Emma Cline. <i>Random House; 304 pages; $28. Chatto &amp; Windus; £18.99</i></p><p class="article__body-text"> In Emma Cline&#39;s novel, a young woman loses control of her life. Alex is not just down on her luck; she is completely out of options. Her work as an escort is not proving lucrative. She has been kicked out of her shared flat for stealing. Simon, an older man, offers salvation in the form of a stay in his beach house for the summer. But Alex is unable to make the good times last. High on painkillers, she crashes Simon&#39;s car. She is soon cast out of this home, too. She survives by adapting to the opportunities presented to her. She ingratiates herself first with a group of partygoers, then a kindly housekeeper, then a troubled teenage boy. By the end of the novel, Alex&#39;s sense of self has been eroded entirely. “Maybe she was the ghost she had always imagined herself to be,” Ms Cline writes. “Maybe it was a relief.” <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/18/in-emma-clines-new-novel-a-young-woman-loses-control-of-her-life">Read our full review</a> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> <b>Tomás Nevinson.</b> By Javier Marías. <i>Translated by Margaret Jull Costa. Knopf; 656 pages; $32.50. Hamish Hamilton; £22.00</i></p><p class="article__body-text"> When Javier Marías died in 2022 he left a richly beguiling and original body of work. The Spanish author&#39;s final book revisits characters from “ <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2018/09/07/a-magical-novel-about-michelangelo">Berta Isla</a> ”, published in 2017. Tomás Nevinson&#39;s days in the British Secret Service are over. Back in Madrid, the half-English, half-Spanish former spy is trying to rebuild his life. But his old handler, Bertram Tupra, tempts him with one last assignment. His mission requires Tomás to go undercover and find out which of three women is a terrorist with ETA, a Basque separatist group. He watches the women for clues that might betray past crimes. But then Tupra, impatient for results, changes the rules. Those who prefer their espionage thrillers lean may be put off by this hulking tome. But “Tomás Nevinson” is a different kind of spy novel. It unfolds in meandering yet mesmerising sentences. The author&#39;s trademark literary allusions, historical references and philosophical debates all feature. Seamlessly translated by Margaret Jull Costa, this final work is a stimulating drama by a master of his craft. <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/05/25/in-javier-mariass-final-novel-an-agent-confronts-his-conscience">Read our full review</a> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> <i>Read a <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2023/03/10/a-selection-of-novels-to-read-this-spring" data-tegid="ub0v4vrnh99ck3sif8v3ilh1s9avfnlq">selection of novels</a> published at the beginning of 2023.</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 14 Jun 2023 14:18:36 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/mvhkmpossrgfau5lri21q1f9452afvvl</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2023/06/14/a-selection-of-novels-to-read-this-summer </item><item><title><![CDATA[The great global baby bust is under way]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-phnw8u ex4i8i00"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img theme="[object Object]" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 1440px) 700px, (min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 960px) 66vw, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/256/144/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/360/202/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/384/216/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/480/270/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/337/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/834/469/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/960/540/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1096/616/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/801/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/801/90/media-assets/image/20230617_WOT913.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></div><style data-emotion="css tati6o">.css-tati6o{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-4);font-weight:normal;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-upper);}.css-tati6o a{-webkit-text-decoration:none;text-decoration:none;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);display:block;}.css-tati6o a:hover,.css-tati6o a:hover .efv3iwx0{color:var(--ds-color-chicago-30);-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;}.css-tati6o a:focus,.css-tati6o a:focus .efv3iwx0{background-color:var(--ds-color-chicago-95);color:var(--ds-color-london-5);outline:none;-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;}.css-tati6o a:active,.css-tati6o a:active .efv3iwx0{color:var(--ds-color-chicago-30);}.css-tati6o a::before{bottom:0;content:'';display:block;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;right:0;text-indent:-999em;top:0;white-space:nowrap;z-index:1;}.css-tati6o+.e1dj3j7p0,.css-tati6o+style+.e1dj3j7p0{margin-top:0.5rem;}.e1wqg93o0 .css-tati6o+.e1dj3j7p0{margin-top:0;}</style><h3 class="css-tati6o eifj80y0"> <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/06/13/england-may-soon-become-the-worlds-best-cricket-team" data-analytics="more_from:headline_1">England may soon become the world&#39;s best cricket team</a> </h3><style data-emotion="css 1tj7b79">.css-1tj7b79{color:var(--ds-color-london-10);font-family:var(--ds-type-system-serif);max-width:43.75rem;font-size:1.125rem;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);}.e13odduf0 .css-1tj7b79{font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-2);}</style><p class="css-1tj7b79 e1dj3j7p0"> Winning the Ashes would propel them past India and Australia</p><p class="article__body-text"> <small><span data-caps="initial">“H</span> OW PARAMOUNT</small> the future is to the present, when one is surrounded by children,” wrote Charles Darwin in 1852, reflecting on his own parenthood.

In parts of the world where birth rates were already low, the shortfall of young employees, who are needed to subsidise the retired, will be felt keenly. In China, the number of workers aged between 21 and 30 has already declined from 232m in 2012, to 181m in 2021. By the mid-2050s the <small>UN</small> forecasts there will be fewer than 100m (see chart on the right). China&#39;s one-child—and later two-child—policy has contributed to the country&#39;s decline in young workers. Recent history has shown that it is much more difficult to raise fertility levels than it is to crush them in the first place. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 14 Jun 2023 11:10:55 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/4lvl65kpo3j7e23t9qlfivb5bnioksqo</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/06/14/the-great-global-baby-bust-is-under-way </item><item><title><![CDATA[A return to war has looming global economic consequences]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230616_PDP503.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p class="article__body-text"> CONFLICT IN UKRAINE has cut short the “peace dividend” the world was reaping.

In the 31 days of May, Russia fired 16% of all the missiles it has used in 15 months of war, nearly three times the average rate. Most were aimed at the capital, Kyiv. It was not only the number but the type that marked a step up; Russia switched to rarer ballistic missiles like the Iskander-M and the Kinzhals as it struggled to find a way through. Kyivians were woken by early morning Russian “discos”—exploding drones and missiles—on no fewer than 20 nights. As loud as it was, very few missiles found their way through the shield. The performance of the capital&#39;s air defenders made some observers conclude that the city has become the most protected on earth.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Ukraine owes its high-end missile-defence strength to new Western hardware. But that its air defence—and the country—survived at all is down to the Ukrainians&#39; agile use of vintage Soviet systems such as the Buk, <small>S-125</small> and <small>S-300</small> . In the early days of the war, many of Ukraine&#39;s air defences were damaged and destroyed. General Anatoly Krivonozhko, the man in charge of Kyiv&#39;s skies, describes heroic “duels”, in which divisional commanders manned guns without support teams, understanding that sooner or later a missile would get through and kill them. “This is how we survived. We lost people across the whole country. It was a close call.” Some mobile Buk surface-to-air systems continued to operate independently from hideouts behind the front lines, denying Russia supremacy in the skies even in areas where it notionally had control. Several Russian planes were ambushed in this way.</p><p class="article__body-text"> General Krivonozhko says that the construction of Kyiv&#39;s missile shield began in May 2022. Before then, missile defence had been limited to defending strategic sites. The shield adapted as Russian tactics evolved—and the Western appetite for risk increased. For a long time the main assistance Ukraine received was in man-portable air-defence systems ( <small>MANPADS</small> ) such as Stingers, which were first delivered before the war. By the time Russia turned its attention to a drone and missile campaign against Ukraine&#39;s energy infrastructure last autumn, Ukraine had already taken possession of the first of its advanced batteries, the German-produced IRIS-T system. Soon after came <small>NASAMS</small> systems, supplied by America and Norway, similarly capable against cruise missiles. Ukraine&#39;s first Patriot <small>PAC-3</small> system came online on April 21st, the second on April 27th. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Hesitant Western leaders explained their initial reluctance to supply Ukraine with powerful air-defence systems by citing the long training programmes they would require. The reality has been somewhat different. Vyacheslav trained on the Patriots in Oklahoma and Poland for three and a half months instead of the regular six. Denys Smazhny, a training co-ordinator for <small>IRIS-T</small> and <small>NASAMS</small> , suggests even that was too long. There was nothing exceptionally difficult in the largely automated Western systems, he contends. An <small>IRIS-T</small> system was “far less complicated” than the Buk system he used to operate: “It&#39;s like switching from a calculator to a MacBook Pro. The Western batteries basically do the work for you.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Kyiv&#39;s missile-defence system is organised in layers to ensure overlapping coverage. Powerful systems like the Patriot, NASAMS and <small>IRIS-T</small> sit at the top of the tree. They can communicate with each other straight out of the box, pooling radar visibility and range. But Ukraine has also just completed a process of integrating other kit, including Soviet-era Buks and <small>S-300</small> s, into a new centralised command system. When a target is identified, the most effective missile is used against it, hitting it as far away from the city as possible.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The first step of Kyiv&#39;s missile defence is a network of mobile gunnery units: essentially pickup trucks with machineguns or <small>MANPADS</small> installed in their cargo beds. These units are the first line of the capital&#39;s defence against drones. Each takes responsibility for an individual sector on the flight-path towards the capital. Most have night-vision equipment and searchlights; some have low-flying detection radars.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In one of the sectors alongside the Dnieper river, approximately 20km south of Kyiv, a sleep-deprived gunner with the callsign “Speckled” describes the protocol for intercepting drones. Usually the targets first appear as a moving dot on <i>Kropyva</i> , Ukraine&#39;s proprietary defence mapping system. The characteristic moped-like hum of the motor comes a few minutes later. The challenge lies in latching sensors onto the sound signal, Speckled says. “If you do that, and your missile functions, the drone has no chance.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Ukrainian air-defence officers say the Russian military is always switching tactics and looking for weaknesses. That can mean sending dozens of missiles and drones along a single corridor of attack, in the expectation that local mobile units will run out of ammunition. They sometimes do. It can mean flying drones at a maximum altitude, and then turning off their engines, making them less visible, before letting them glide to their targets. Or it involves varying the times and trajectories of attack to avoid radar-tracking. In one late May daytime assault on Kyiv, for example, the capital was attacked from all sides, with drones and advanced <small>KH-101</small> cruise missiles programmed to take twisty turns to their targets. Some survive. “The Russians have to try to find new ways to get through,” says General Krivonozhko. “Some of the missiles cost $10m and when six, eight, ten of them don&#39;t find their targets, there are tough questions for the leadership.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Keeping ahead will not be straightforward. The defences above central Kyiv might for now be world-leading, but Russia&#39;s goal of exhausting the city endures. “They want mass emigration and to make Kyiv unviable,” says General Krivonozhko. The skies in other parts of the country are meanwhile much less well protected. Russia can and does change focus to other cities—to devastating effect. On June 13th cruise missiles hit Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine&#39;s industrial powerhouse in the south, destroying an apartment block and killing at least ten people. There is a constant tension between employing systems in civilian areas or at the front lines.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The hope now is to construct two echelons of air defence at the national border, working alongside modern Western-built fighter jets to shoot missiles down well before they reach big cities. It would be a massive undertaking, requiring time and money that Ukraine might not have, the general concedes. But Russia is showing no sign it intends to step down its campaign of terror. “The threats will be with us for a long time to come.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 13 Jun 2023 14:05:27 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/vr6tbhilng8s55t0ehrn305mhk4frvq3</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/06/13/how-kyiv-fended-off-a-russian-missile-blitz-in-may </item><item><title><![CDATA[Silvio Berlusconi: his scandals and his supporters never went away]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_PDP502.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_PDP502.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_PDP502.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_PDP502.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_PDP502.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_PDP502.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_PDP502.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_PDP502.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_PDP502.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/media-assets/image/20230617_PDP502.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></figure></section><p class="article__body-text"> ITALY&#39;S LONGEST-SERVING prime minister has <a href="https://www.economist.com/obituary/2023/06/12/silvio-berlusconi-has-died-aged-86" data-tegid="sqihro65tfbi189uhlinr1574gpm0dsn">died</a> aged 86.
