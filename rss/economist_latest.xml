data-caps="initial">放在</span>你<small>面前的</small>是两个骨灰盒。每个包含 100 个球。你会得到第一个瓮的内容的清晰描述，其中有 50 个红球和 50 个黑球。进行实验的经济学家对第二个守口如瓶，只说有 100 个球按一定比例分为红球和黑球。然后你就会有一个选择。从瓮中挑选一个红球，您将获得一百万美元。您想从哪个瓮中取出？现在再试一次，但选择一个黑球。这次是哪个瓮？</p><p class="article__body-text">大多数人两次都会选择第一个瓮，尽管这样的选择意味着红球比第二个瓮中的红球多或少。这一事实被称为“埃尔斯伯格悖论”，以丹尼尔·埃尔斯伯格（Daniel Ellsberg）命名，丹尼尔·埃尔斯伯格是<small>智库兰德</small>公司的研究员，该公司因泄露详细描述美国卷入越南战争的文件而闻名。 6 月 16 日去世的艾尔斯伯格称这种行为为模糊厌恶。它偏离了数学家约翰·冯·诺依曼提出的理性选择模型，并证明了了解某件事的可能性可以改变决策。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">这个实验看起来可能只是经济学家喜爱的又一个可爱的谜题。事实上，它揭示了世界在应对气候变化时面临的更深层次的问题。不仅不知道结果的可能性（例如，十年后加勒比地区发生飓风的可能性），也不知道它们可能造成的损害。对未来的无知在今天带来了代价：模糊性使得风险无法投保，或者至少是昂贵得令人望而却步。保险公司对风险的了解越少，他们就越需要更多的资本来保护资产负债表免受可能的损失。</p><p class="article__body-text">今年五月，加州最大的家庭保险提供商 State Farm 完全退出市场，理由是“巨灾风险迅速增加”的成本。经纪人 Gallagher Re 估计，在加州和佛罗里达州发生灾难之后，今年美国的再保险价格上涨了 50%。很少有公司具体提及气候变化——这或许是共和党攻击“觉醒的资本主义”的遗产——但它却隐藏在房主免受火灾、洪水和飓风的保险成本不断上升的背后。</p><p class="article__body-text">保险是气候适应的工具。事实上，精算师在应对气候变化的斗争中与积极分子一样可以发挥重要作用。如果没有保险，那些房屋被野火烧毁或被洪水摧毁的人将失去一切。穷人可能会成为难民。保险也可以刺激纠正行动。准确反映风险的较高保费可以激励人们尽快适应，无论是阻止在危险地区进行建设，还是鼓励人们离开易发生火灾的地区。如果价格错误，社会将因世界变暖而受到比其他情况更大的伤害。考虑为洪泛平原家庭保险提供补贴的政客们应该引起注意。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">用经济学家的话来说，变暖的世界面临“不确定性”和“风险”，这使得设定适当价格的任务变得更加困难。约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯将不确定性描述为“没有科学依据来形成任何可计算的概率”的情况。他举了一个例子，预测欧洲爆发战争的可能性，或者一项新发明是否会过时。相比之下，风险意味着相对概率众所周知的情况：例如，从第一个瓮中挑选一个红球。</p><p class="article__body-text">当谈到气候变化时，现实并不像凯恩斯框架所暗示的那么糟糕，因为科学家可以帮助解决某些不确定性。对于被两位行为经济学家丹尼尔·卡尼曼和阿莫斯·特沃斯基标记为“内部不确定性”的形式尤其如此，它们与世界上已知的事情有关，而不是不可知的未来事件。与经济学家的模型不同，气候模型基于物理定律，几千年来，这些物理定律在地球上的化石和南极冰芯中留下了印记。就好像一位科学家观察了第二个瓮几个世纪，注意到不同的人随着时间的推移拉出的黑色和红色球的数量。有了确凿的证据并清楚地了解观测结果的生成过程，歧义就会消失，潜在灾难的可能性也会得到更好的理解。</p><p class="article__body-text">自然灾害再保险通常基于包含最新科学的模型，而不是历史统计数据，因为根据定义，极端事件很少见。对于最终关心其财务风险的再保险公司来说，模型必须与脆弱地区的建筑环境状况保持同步，这有助于他们在与决定灾难的环境条件相结合时计算潜在损失。前者通常比后者更容易造成不确定性，因为气候变化科学已广为人知，而且数据一直在改进。保费上涨可能是因为知识的丰富，而不是持续的无知。</p><h2>灾难资本主义</h2><p class="article__body-text">然而，即使是完美的科学模型也无法消除所有不确定性。气候变化涉及混乱的政策世界以及清晰的物理学。科学家们也许能够模拟一个比工业化前时期温暖 2°C 的行星如何增加特定地区发生野火的风险，但没有模型可以预测政策制定者是否会动用他们可以利用的杠杆以防止此类火灾的发生。想象一下，进行埃尔斯伯格实验的经济学家正在根据某些民主进程、国际外交或独裁者的突发奇想的结果，将球放入第二个瓮中。</p><p class="article__body-text">政策还可能妨碍对风险的正确核算。加州法规禁止保险公司使用最新的气候模型来定价，因为保护成本会更高。保费必须基于过去20年的平均支出，而不是最新的科学。回避歧义是可以理解的。把头埋在沙子里是愚蠢的。 <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p

data-caps="initial">交易</span><small>员有</small>一个说法来形容金融市场的不可预测性：“宁可愚蠢”。股票或其他金融市场有时会以不可预见的方式表现。分析人士预测，如果唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 赢得 2016 年大选，美国股市将暴跌，但股价却飙升。盈利好于预期的公司有时会看到股价下跌。预见未来应该会给交易者带来优势，而且大多数时候确实如此。但不总是。</p><p class="article__body-text">假设您在 2021 年初就知道通货膨胀将会飙升，这是央行疯狂印钞和过度财政刺激的结果。此外，也许你也知道，欧洲的堑壕战将引发通货膨胀。有了这些知识，也许有一种资产比其他资产更值得你倾注毕生积蓄：在通胀长期存在问题的国家，贵金属装饰着富人的脖子和手腕。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">那还不如装傻呢两年来金价几乎没有变动。 2021 年 1 月 1 日，每盎司价格略低于 1,900 美元。今天售价为 1,960 美元。您将获得 3% 的丰厚收益。</p><p class="article__body-text">到底是怎么回事？制定合适的黄金价格是一项艰巨的任务。黄金爱好者指出，这种金属作为货币支持资产的历史作用、其在高级珠宝中的用途、其有限的供应量及其物理耐用性，都是解释其保值性的理由。毕竟，乍一看这种现象很奇怪：与股票和债券相比，黄金不产生现金流或股息。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，收入的缺乏也为该金属近年来的平庸回报提供了线索。由于黄金不产生现金流，其价格往往与实际利率成反比——当安全的实际收益率（如国债产生的收益率）较高时，不产生现金流的资产就会变得不那么有吸引力。尽管人们对通货膨胀的上升感到愤怒，但利率的上升更为引人注目。因此，即使通胀飙升，长期预期仍然出人意料地稳定。扣除通胀预期指标后，十年期国债收益率已从 2021 年初的 -0.25% 左右攀升至目前的 1.4%。</p><p class="article__body-text"> 2021 年，芝加哥联邦储备银行的研究人员分析了自 1971 年以来金价背后的主要因素，当时美国取消了金本位制，即美元可以按固定价格兑换成黄金。他们确定了三类：黄金作为抵御通货膨胀的工具，黄金作为对冲经济灾难的工具，以及黄金作为利率的反映。然后，他们使用年度、季度和每日数据测试了金价与通胀预期变化、对经济增长的态度和实际利率的关系。 </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">他们的结果表明所有这些因素确实影响金价。当经济形势黯淡时，这种金属似乎可以对冲通货膨胀和价格上涨。但关于实际利率上升的影响的证据最为有力。无论数据出现的频率如何，负面影响都是显而易见的。研究人员指出，2001 年以来，通货膨胀可能是 20 世纪 70 年代、1980 年代和 1990 年代金价最明显的驱动因素，但从 2001 年起，长期实际利率和对经济增长的看法占据了主导地位。 2021 年以来金价的走势似乎支持了他们的结论：通胀很重要，但实际利率最重要。</p><p class="article__body-text">所有这些都意味着黄金可能起到通胀对冲的作用，但通胀并不是唯一重要的变量。在通胀时期，如果央行麻木不仁，实际利率下降，或者投资者对政策制定者恢复控制的能力失去信心，那么金属价格将会上涨。到目前为止，在这个通胀周期中，这两种情况都没有发生。</p><p class="article__body-text">对未来了解甚少可能是一件危险的事情。约翰·巴肯 (John Buchan) 于 1932 年出版的科幻小说《幕布中的缝隙》讲述了五个人被一位科学家选中参加一项实验的故事，该实验将让他们一睹一年前的情况。未来。两个人最终看到了自己的讣告。苏格兰对冲基金投资者休·亨德利 (Hugh Hendry) 表示，这是“有史以来最好的投资书籍”，因为它鼓励读者展望未来，同时深入思考某些事件的确切原因。正如最近看似令人费解的黄金走势所表明的那样，盲目展望未来是一种危险的习惯。 <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><b>阅读我们金融市场专栏作家 Buttonwood 的更多内容：</b><br>

class="article__body-text">在西方，其目标是扭转工业衰退，选民对此有着强烈的感受。制造业占全球经济产出的比重已从1997年的19%下降到如今的16%，其中富裕国家的降幅最大。在中国和印度，工业在经济产出中所占的份额似乎与三十年前大致相同，但即使在这些国家，近年来该比例也有所下滑（见图 1）。</p><p class="article__body-text">制造业的支持者提出了四个支持试图扭转这一趋势的论点。首先，西方政治家表示，工厂是稳定就业的来源，可以产生更多、更满意的中产阶级。其次，支持者将制造业视为创新和增长的驱动力。这是推动绿色转型的迫切需要——第三个原因——如果它能提供当地就业机会，选民将更容易接受。最后，美国和中国之间的紧张关系促使世界领导人重新考虑哪些商品具有战略重要性，因此应该在离本土更近的地方生产。</p><p class="article__body-text">首先考虑提供的就业类型。 “好的制造业工作”的概念由来已久。在20世纪，那些没有受过大学教育的人可以在工厂找到体面的工资、工作保障、一点个人自主权和职业发展。事实上，就在十多年前，美国的生产性工作岗位的工资比类似服务业的工作岗位高出 5%，并且提供稳定的工作时间和丰厚的福利。 </p></div><div

class="article__body-text">但最近，情况发生了变化：许多良好的制造业工作岗位已不复存在（见图 2）。在富裕国家，需要中级技术技能（例如机器操作员）的就业已经让位于高级和低级工作的混合，主要是在服务行业（例如编码员和咖啡师）。富裕人群将更多收入用于服务；工业需求越来越多地由新兴市场满足。无论是在底特律还是多特蒙德，后果都是显而易见的，而且现在已经很熟悉了。乍一看，那些谴责制造业岗位流失的人有一定道理。为了把它们找回来确实值得付出代价吗？</p><p class="article__body-text">有一个障碍。无论政府花多少钱，这些工作能否恢复尚不清楚。首先，制造业工资溢价大幅下降。美国生产工人的工资目前比同类服务业工人的工资低5%。此外，美国和欧洲试图吸引的高科技工厂是高度自动化的，这意味着它们不再是缺乏资格的人的重要就业来源。</p><p class="article__body-text">福特在科隆改造后的电动汽车 ( <small>ev</small> ) 工厂就是这样的一个例子，该工厂位于德国工业中心地带的莱茵河畔。车辆的底盘和车身涂有化学品，为喷漆做好准备并防止腐蚀。这种情况发生在多个楼层；参与现场工作的工人数量恰好为零（两名远程监控）。生产线下游的闪亮黄色装配机器人足够先进，能够进行自我监控。尽管组装所需的工人数量与传统汽油动力汽车的工人数量差不多，但这项活动需要更多的培训。这符合全国情况：根据就业研究所沃尔夫冈·多斯（Wolfgang Dauth）及其合著者的一项研究，工业机器人使现有工作变得更加复杂。</p></div><h2>农业工厂</h2><p class="article__body-text">与此同时，尖端产业看起来更像是服务业。根据国际货币基金组织<small>的数据</small>，近几十年来，与制造业相关的服务业在全球产出中所占的份额不断增长。组装小玩意并不是赚高薪工作的钱的地方。博世制造的运动传感器是先进的产品。但这家德国科技公司还提供与之配套的软件和服务，例如对传感器所指向的货物进行全天候监控。这些服务的设计、根据客户的需求进行定制、为小发明提供服务——所有这些对于现代制造商来说都变得越来越重要，但很少有服务能提供工业过去提供的那种就业机会。

class="article__body-text">经济历史学家也越来越多地质疑国家对制造业的支持是否真的像人们普遍认为的那样在东亚和西方的经济发展中发挥了决定性作用。至少，服务业生产率的增长和消除保护主义也至关重要。一份报告称，即使产业政策是由一个目光敏锐的政府完美设计的，利用税收和补贴将劳动力转移到规模经济最大的行业，也只能给<small>国内生产</small>总值带来一次性1-3%的增长。密歇根大学的 Dominick Bartelme 及其合著者的论文。事实上，近几十年来，经合组织国家的经济增长与制造业在<small>经济</small>中所占的份额之间几乎没有任何关系（见图3）。</p><p class="article__body-text">与服务业和农业相比，制造业的生产率增长备受赞誉，但也有一些警告。经济学家发现，金融、<small>信息技术</small>和法律服务可以提高其他领域的生产力，包括工业。据<small>国际货币基金组织</small>称，自世纪之交以来，许多国家制造业和服务业生产率增长之间的差距已经缩小。在中国和印度，其方向发生了转变，服务业生产率增长更快。此外，服务是一个广泛的教会，从教学到技术。后者拥有极快的生产率增长，人工智能可能很快会进一步推动这一增长。</p><p class="article__body-text">工业创新能力的增强也带来了一些问题。哥本哈根商学院的 Paul Hünermund 指出：“制造企业更容易衡量创新支出，因为它们往往拥有<small>专门</small>的<small>研发</small>部门。”他解释说，因此，国家的<small>研发</small><small>支出</small>通常是针对工业的，尽管服务业可能比典型措施所显示的更具创新性。</p><p class="article__body-text">关于制造业对创新重要性的最有力论据来自经济学家，他们指出，许多技术进步发生在工业和服务业共存的地方。哈佛商学院的加里·皮萨诺（Gary Pisano）和威利·施（Willy Shih）强调了在高科技芯片制造等行业中边生产边学习的重要性。这一想法得到了包括美国、中国和德国在内的政治家的支持。但即便如此，证据也好坏参半。 2001年，台湾放宽了离岸外包禁令，导致部分生产转移到中国大陆。研究其后果的学者发现，正如共存论文所表明的那样，受影响商品的创新确实减少了。不过，由于<small>研发</small>资源得到释放，其他商品和技术创新的增长平衡了这一<small>趋势</small>。结果是专业化，而不是降低整体创新。</p></div><p class="article__body-text">将国家资金用于工业（尤其是绿色工业）的另一个理由是，如果要实现净零排放，世界很快将需要更多的实物产品。绿色转型所需的投资确实是惊人的：依赖化石燃料的全部资本存量都必须被替换。这包括飞机、供暖系统、发电厂和车辆。世界各地的电网需要变得更有弹性，以承受不稳定的可再生能源发电。官方预测机构国际能源署估计，到 2030 年，每年所需的总投资约为 4 万亿美元（或当前全球<small>GDP</small>的 4%）。</p><p class="article__body-text">关键矿物的开采和精炼是值得明智花钱的领域之一。据智库能源转型委员会称，到 2050 年，已经找到足够的金属来满足绿色需求。但扩大供应需要时间。而且风险很高：例如，电池技术转向钠可能会削弱对锂的需求。政府增加金属供应和精炼的投资可能有助于克服此类投资障碍。</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image"

2030 年，太阳能电池板的现有产量已经超过可能的需求，考虑到计划产量时电池的情况也是如此（见图 4）。在其他领域，如热泵，如果需要，可以快速增加容量。</p><p

covid-19大流行期间和之后的供应中断显示出广泛的脆弱性：对防护性医疗设备的争夺增加了库存的理由；通常常见芯片的短缺导致汽车生产放缓；俄罗斯削减供应后，欧洲出现天然气短缺，这提供了一个令人震惊的例子，说明如何利用经济依赖。</p></div><h2>中国墙</h2><p class="article__body-text">中国在这个方向上又提供了推动力。 7 月 3 日，该国宣布计划限制光学和半导体技术所需的两种金属（镓和锗）的出口。官员们表示，此举是对美国限制高科技芯片及其生产机器等商品出口的回应。这也是一个信号，表明中国可以击中西方的痛处。</p><p class="article__body-text">供应限制实际上具有多大的破坏性？就某些稀有的<a

data-tegid="qu85gmfjculnv1js8d2k7uu9a6677otq">“战争金属”</a>而言，也许非常。但市场经济可以适应痛苦的限制。当俄罗斯去年发动乌克兰战争时，欧洲大陆40%的天然气来自入侵国。夏季供应量减少；天然气价格飙升四倍。政客们担心整个行业将陷入停顿，扰乱供应链并导致严重的经济衰退。</p><p class="article__body-text">实际结果更为良性。政府在其他地方确保供应；公司投资了节能设备，或找到了不同的能源；家庭消费减少。截至三月份的七个月里，欧洲天然气消费量比往年低了近五分之一。经济疲软，但避免了崩溃。 2010年中国削减对日本的稀土供应时，情况也类似。企业找到了在不过度干扰生产的情况下替代这些投入的方法。市场具有克服短缺的天然能力，原因很简单，企业寻求赚钱。</p><p class="article__body-text">其他研究指出了多元化的好处。各国政府现在更加热衷于提高国内生产，以减少受到外国供应中断的影响。但<small>国际货币基金组织</small>去年发表的研究表明，自给自足程度的提高可能会让各国更容易受到未来冲击的影响，而不是更少。回流将使生产依赖于国内条件，并且容易受到当地的巨大冲击。相比之下，多元化的供应链更具弹性，因为它们取决于一系列不同国家的经济表现。</p><p class="article__body-text">制定政策的官员认为，其中许多弊端是可以避免的。 “没有必要选择。美国应该全力推行自己的绿色产业政策，并帮助朋友们也这样做。”不久前担任白宫官员的詹妮弗·哈里斯 (Jennifer Harris) 表示。 To this end, the Biden administration has, since the laws governing its subsidies were passed, interpreted them in a way that makes some handouts available to foreign producers. The <small>eu</small> also wants to enter into partnerships with countries for the supply of critical materials.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Such efforts could reduce the damage done by the manufacturing delusion, which may be the best that can be hoped for given the strength of its grip on politicians the world over. Only once the agenda fails—either because the green transition does not create the jobs or economic growth electorates have been led to expect, or because subsidised production falls short of hopes—will a new generation of leaders begin to question whether industry is the cure for humanity&#39;s greatest ills. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>如需对经济、金融和市场领域重大新闻进行更多专家分析，请订阅我们的每周订阅时事通讯<a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/money-talks">Money Talks</a> 。</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 13 Jul 2023 10:22:51 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/5nvt68h21nl4uslfsjothrdl3fgtgiq2</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/13/the-world-is-in-the-grip-of-a-manufacturing-delusion </item><item><title><![CDATA[China controls the supply of crucial war minerals]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Using night vision goggles a U.S. Marine looks down a dark street." fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FNP503.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FNP503.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FNP503.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FNP503.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FNP503.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FNP503.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FNP503.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FNP503.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FNP503.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FNP503.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 11jvxbd">.css-11jvxbd{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}.e16qazw90+.css-11jvxbd{margin-left:0.5rem;}</style><span class="css-11jvxbd e16qazw91">图片：盖蒂图片社</span></figcaption></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">I</span> <small>n 2014</small> <small>tom price</small> , a commodities strategist, visited a “funny little building” in China&#39;s south-west. It was a warehouse where Fanya, a local trading firm, stored metals including gallium, germanium and indium. The company&#39;s “stockpiles” simply sat in boxes on shelves. Yet for some of the minerals, these meagre supplies represented the majority of global stocks. A year later Fanya was closed by China&#39;s government, which kept the stash—as well as the reserves and plants to produce more.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Today Western countries wish they, too, could produce some more. On July 4th China announced that it would restrict exports of gallium and germanium, of which it supplied 98% and 60% of global output, respectively, in 2022. Produced in tiny quantities, the metals have little commercial value. They are nevertheless crucial for some military equipment, including lasers, radars and spy satellites. The decision highlights that “critical” minerals are not limited to those which underpin economic growth, such as nickel or lithium. A dozen obscure cousins are also vital for a more basic need: maintaining armies. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The eclectic family of war minerals spans generations. Antimony, known in biblical times as a medicine and cosmetic, is a flame retardant used in cable sheathing and ammunition. Vanadium, recognised for its resistance to fatigue since the 1900s, is blended with aluminium in airframes. Indium, a soft, malleable metal, has been used to coat bearings in aircraft engines since the second world war.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The family grew rapidly in the cold war. Long before cobalt emerged as a battery material, nuclear tests in the 1950s showed that it was resistant to high temperatures. The blue metal was soon added to the alloys that make armour-penetrating munitions. Titanium—as strong as steel but 45% lighter—also emerged as an ideal weapons material. So did tungsten, which has the highest melting point of any metal and is vital for warheads. Tiny amounts of beryllium, blended with copper, produce a brilliant conductor of electricity and heat that resists deformation over time.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The superpowers of other minerals became known decades later, as military technology made further leaps. Gallium goes into the chipsets of communication systems, fibre-optic networks and avionic sensors. Germanium, which is transparent to infrared radiation, is used in night-vision goggles. Rare earths go into high-performance magnets. Very small additions of niobium—as little as 200 grams a tonne—make steel much tougher. The metal is a frequent flyer in modern jet engines.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Beyond their varied properties, this group of mighty minerals share certain family traits. The first is that they are rarely, if ever, found in pure form naturally. Rather, they are often a by-product of the refining of other metals. Gallium and germanium compounds, for example, are found in trace amounts in zinc ores. Vanadium occurs in more than 60 different minerals. Producing them is therefore costly, technical, energy-intensive and polluting. And because the global market is small, countries that invested in production early can keep costs low, giving them an impregnable advantage. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1081/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FNC827.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/356/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FNC827.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/533/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FNC827.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/711/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FNC827.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/1067/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FNC827.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/1138/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FNC827.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1422/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FNC827.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1778/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FNC827.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2276/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FNC827.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> This explains why the production of war minerals is extremely concentrated (see chart 1). For each of our 13 war materials, the top three exporters account for more than 60% of global supply. China is the biggest producer, by far, for eight of these minerals; Congo, a troubled mining country, tops the ranking for another two; Brazil, a more reliable trading partner, produces nine-tenths of the world&#39;s niobium, though most of it is sent to China. Many minerals are impossible to replace in the near term, especially for cutting-edge military uses. When substitution is possible, performance usually suffers.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The combination of concentrated production, complex refining and critical uses means trading happens under the radar. The volumes are too small, and transacting parties too few, for them to be sold on an exchange. Because there are no spot transactions, prices are not reported. Would-be buyers have to rely on estimates. These vary widely. Vanadium is relatively cheap: around $25 per kilogram. Hafnium might cost you $1,200 for the same amount.</p><p class="article__body-text"> All this makes building new supply chains much more difficult. America is investing in a purification facility for rare-earth metals in Texas, which is scheduled to come online in 2025. It is nudging Australia and Canada, the only two Western countries with decent reserves, to produce and export more rare metals. It is also doing its best to forge ties with emerging markets in the Indo-Pacific, where there are deposits waiting to be tapped.</p></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FNC810.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/218/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FNC810.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/327/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FNC810.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/436/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FNC810.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/653/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FNC810.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/697/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FNC810.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/871/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FNC810.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1089/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FNC810.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1394/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FNC810.png 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Even so, America&#39;s army will remain vulnerable to a supply squeeze until at least 2030, reckons Scott Young of Eurasia Group, a consultancy. Its cold-war stockpiles, once sizeable, were liquidated after the fall of the Berlin Wall (see chart 2). Its strategic stash now mostly comprises energy commodities such as oil and gas.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Weaning themselves off China might take decades longer for Europe, Japan and South Korea, which are devoid of deposits and lack America&#39;s diplomatic clout. That does not mean their armies will run short of high-tech metals, but they will probably have to buy them from America—at a price already buoyed by their ally&#39;s scramble to rebuild stockpiles. Last year&#39;s gas drama, prompted by Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine, amplified Europe&#39;s dependence on American fuel. The metals squeeze threatens to make Uncle Sam a still bigger magnet for panicked procurement officials. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>如需对经济、金融和市场领域重大新闻进行更多专家分析，请订阅我们的每周订阅时事通讯<a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/money-talks">Money Talks</a> 。</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 13 Jul 2023 10:21:41 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/qu85gmfjculnv1js8d2k7uu9a6677otq</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/13/china-controls-the-supply-of-crucial-war-minerals </item><item><title><![CDATA[Subsidies and protection for manufacturing will harm the world economy]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="A machine being oiled with money" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD003.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD003.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD003.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD003.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD003.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD003.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD003.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD003.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD003.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD003.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 11jvxbd">.css-11jvxbd{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}.e16qazw90+.css-11jvxbd{margin-left:0.5rem;}</style><span class="css-11jvxbd e16qazw91">图片：神林聪</span></figcaption></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">P</span> <small>oliticians have</small> always been captivated by manufacturing, but rarely has their desire to make things been as zealous as it is today.

In the emerging world, governments hope that subsidies can secure a foothold in supply chains as worried Westerners move production out of China.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The sums being spent are vast, and growing. Since they were signed into law, the estimated ten-year cost of America&#39;s green subsidies has risen by at least two-thirds, and is likely to pass $1trn.

India&#39;s central government is subsidising a Micron factory in Gujarat to “assemble and test” chips, spending an amount equal to a quarter of its annual budget for higher education.

America welcomes it, saying the world needs green technologies and a diversified supply of chips. It is true that an ocean of public money is bound to accelerate the green transition and reshape supply chains in ways that should increase the security of democracies. Alas, the accompanying economic benefits being promised are an illusion. <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/07/13/the-world-is-in-the-grip-of-a-manufacturing-delusion" data-tegid="5nvt68h21nl4uslfsjothrdl3fgtgiq2">As we report this week</a> , governments that subsidise and protect manufacturing are more likely to harm their economies than help them.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In ideal conditions, promoting manufacturing can add to innovation and growth. Towards the end of the 20th century South Korea and Taiwan caught up with the West thanks to the careful promotion of manufacturing exports. In industries like planemaking the enormous costs of entry and uncertain future demand can justify support for new firms, as when Europe backed Airbus in the 1970s. Likewise, targeted help can boost national security.</p><p class="article__body-text"> But today&#39;s schemes are likely either to fail or to prove needlessly costly. Countries subsidising chips and batteries are not pursuing catch-up growth but fighting over cutting-edge technology. The market for electric vehicles and batteries is unlikely to become an Airbus-Boeing style duopoly. In the 1980s protectionists argued that Japan would dominate the strategically vital semiconductor industry, owing to its subsidised mastery of memory-chip making. It did not turn out that way.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Duplicating production reduces specialisation, raising costs and hitting economic growth. Some analysts expect the price of a chip produced in Texas to be 30% higher than one made in Taiwan. The Biden administration is belatedly seeking ways to open up its electric-vehicle subsidies to carmakers from friendly countries. But most of the “Buy American” requirements are written into laws that may be all but impossible to amend. And they are being copied. A decade ago about 9,000 protectionist measures were in place worldwide, reckons Global Trade Alert, a charity. Today there are around 35,000. </p></div><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> European leaders think they must match America or face catastrophic deindustrialisation. They have forgotten the logic of comparative advantage, which guarantees that countries will always have something to export, no matter how many cheques foreign governments write or how productive their trading partners become. Denmark has no car industry to speak of, but <small>GDP</small> per person is 11% higher than in Germany. Even the benefits to workers are overstated, because manufacturing jobs no longer pay a premium over comparable service work.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The potential for the manufacturing obsession to backfire is enormous. The state of New York spent nearly $1bn building a solar-panel factory which Tesla pays $1 a year to rent. The idea was to create a manufacturing hub but the project has returned only 54 cents in benefits per dollar spent; according to the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> , the only new nearby business is a coffee shop. India&#39;s attempt to boost its mobile-phone industry appears to have brought mainly low-value assembly work. The lesson from South Korea is that national champions must be exposed to global competition and allowed to fail. The temptation today will be to protect them, come what may.</p><p class="article__body-text"> America says it wants a “small yard and a high fence”. For national security, in particular, access to vital technologies is worth paying for. Yet unless policymakers are clear about the dangers of subsidies, the fenced-in yard will only get bigger. However well-intentioned those doling out money today, their successors are likely to be less focused and more lobbied. Governments are not wrong to pursue good jobs, the green transition or national security. But if they succumb to the manufacturing delusion, they will leave their countries worse off. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 13 Jul 2023 09:42:45 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/2tkt7f29a2ckpbq8sbrmkd2v1rj52ae5</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/07/13/subsidies-and-protection-for-manufacturing-will-harm-the-world-economy </item><item><title><![CDATA[American trustbusters are losing their focus]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="A judges arm giving a thumbs up sign with a Microsoft logo coloured gavel on his thumb" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD004.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD004.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD004.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD004.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD004.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD004.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD004.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD004.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD004.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD004.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 11jvxbd">.css-11jvxbd{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}.e16qazw90+.css-11jvxbd{margin-left:0.5rem;}</style> <span class="css-11jvxbd e16qazw91">image: Travis Constantine</span> </figcaption></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">I</span> <small>n recent YEARS</small> trustbusters have made no secret of their distaste for big firms and big deals. Lina Khan, the head of America&#39;s Federal Trade Commission ( <small>FTC</small> ), came to office after saying that the agencies had failed for decades to do enough proper policing. In addition to suing Amazon and Google for abusing their market power, regulators sought to block Microsoft&#39;s $69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard and are holding up the purchase of Horizon Therapeutics by Amgen, a health-care firm. The activist approach has been mirrored in Europe. Britain&#39;s trustbusters have been conspicuously aggressive, and on July 12th the European Commission slapped a €432m ($480m) fine on Illumina, a biotech giant, for buying Grail, a cancer-screening firm.</p><p class="article__body-text"> This expansive agenda raises questions of whether regulators have become overambitious. On July 11th a district court halted the <small>ftc</small> ’s attempt to stop Microsoft buying Activision. The <small>FTC</small> will appeal, but Britain&#39;s trustbusters, which had previously blocked the deal, abruptly signalled that they would be open to negotiations. Almost 18 months have passed since the deal was launched. Even if it eventually succeeds, that would be enough to chill future dealmaking. And all the while, the obsession with size may have distracted policymakers from tackling genuine hurdles to competition, to the detriment of consumers. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> In principle trustbusters&#39; zeal is welcome, because vigorous competition is essential in any free-market economy. After the 1980s, deference to business curbed regulators and courts in America. From the 1990s to the 2010s, the average number of mergers investigated yearly by the Department of Justice fell from 180 to 70. Corporate profits are a sign of market power and, depending on how they are measured, they have been 20-40% higher in the past decade than in the three decades before that. Mergers such as the one between Whirlpool and Maytag in 2006 led to higher prices. The past 20 years have seen nearly 2,000 hospital mergers; on average, prices have risen while the quality of care has stagnated.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Yet, as the Activision saga shows, and <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/12/is-big-business-really-getting-too-big" data-tegid="dau82eooss0gq4qo6ctnrdudri4d2kb0">as we report this week</a> , bigness need not be bad. The five largest tech firms pay for a quarter of all research and development in America. True, corporate concentration has risen across the decades in both America and much of Europe. But this expansion appears to have been caused mainly by growing economies of scale from technology, not market power.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Moreover dealmaking, even involving big firms, is a vital part of healthy capitalism. Microsoft&#39;s purchase of Activision promises to make gaming more competitive, by developing the nascent subscription and cloud-gaming markets that could challenge the status quo.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The consequences of regulators&#39; emphasis on size are starting to be felt. Nearly any deal involving a large tech firm is scrutinised. Adding “sand to the gears of <small>M&amp;A</small> ”, as lawyers put it, sabotages the launch of some worthy bids, because managers choose to avoid the reputational risk of being barred or the headache of compliance. Although the overall volume of deals has fallen only a little, their average value has shrunk by about 40% this year compared with the past half-decade, suggesting that larger deals are being deterred. Since 2020, the share of deals involving the five largest tech giants has been cut in half.</p><h2> <b>Broaden your horizons</b></h2><p class="article__body-text"> Two principles should guide the regulators. The first is that size alone should not warrant alarm. Needless scrutiny uses up regulators&#39; resources and damages their credibility and the morale of their staff. Plenty of industries in America with persistently high profits and low innovation deserve attention, including hospitals and their intermediaries, and credit-card firms. The <small>FTC</small> has rightly blocked a handful of hospital mergers in recent years, and courts have agreed with it. It has more work to do.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The second principle is to acknowledge the limits of antitrust. Two years ago President Joe Biden rightly pointed out that blocking deals and anti-competitive practices was just one piece of the puzzle. That idea has been forgotten. Land-use and occupational-licensing restrictions are still entrenched. Firms are being protected by <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/article64055-prod.ece">rising barriers to trade</a> . Such things win fewer headlines than targeting blockbuster deals. But tackling them would at least boost competition. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 13 Jul 2023 09:42:37 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/1kk32q1alvordpo1jv0ldl8mnrgqeh4t</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/07/13/american-trustbusters-are-losing-their-focus </item><item><title><![CDATA[How MAGA Republicans plan to make Donald Trump’s second term count]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="A red carpet being rolled out for Donald Trump, who is approaching" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD010.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD010.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD010.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD010.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD010.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD010.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD010.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD010.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD010.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_LDD010.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 11jvxbd">.css-11jvxbd{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}.e16qazw90+.css-11jvxbd{margin-left:0.5rem;}</style> <span class="css-11jvxbd e16qazw91">image: Federico Yankelevich</span> </figcaption></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">T</span> <small>HE OVERWHELMING</small> memory of Donald Trump&#39;s time in office is of chaos and resentment. It was summed up by the shameful end to his presidency, when his whipped-up supporters sacked the Capitol in a bid to keep him in power. Mr Trump has since lurched from an ignominious post-electoral impeachment to two criminal indictments, with perhaps more in the offing. The former president seems obsessed with relitigating his election loss in 2020: “I am your justice,” he thundered to a crowd of supporters this year. “I am your retribution.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Trump is likely to win the Republican presidential nomination for 2024. You might think victory in the general election would foreshadow even more chaos—this time without the grown-ups who, it turns out, at first reined in their impulsive new boss. In fact, a professional corps of America First populists are dedicating themselves to ensuring that Trump Two will be disciplined and focused on getting things done. They are preparing the way and you should not dismiss their efforts. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> In contrast to the slapdash insurgency that captured the White House in 2016, the veterans of Mr Trump&#39;s first term have been years at work, as our <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/07/13/a-second-trump-administration-would-get-its-way-far-more-than-the-first" data-tegid="34fdaqhpnfv8mqucvmtb54fk4r3206ap">Briefing</a> this week lays out. Even at this early stage, the details are something to behold. Thousand-page policy documents set out ideas that were once outlandish in Republican circles but have now become orthodox: finishing the border wall, raising tariffs on allies and competitors alike, making unfunded tax cuts permanent and ending automatic citizenship for anyone born in the United States. They evince scepticism for <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/07/12/natos-promises-to-ukraine-mark-real-progress" data-tegid="h7f44jumsojn07vvm370ts9k73et0mu0"><small>NATO</small></a> and pledge to “end the war on fossil fuels”, by nixing policies designed to limit climate change.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Alongside these proposals is something that aims to revolutionise the structure of government itself. <small>MAGA</small> Republicans believe that they will be able to enact their programme only if they first defang the deep state by making tens of thousands of top civil servants sackable. Around 50,000 officials would be newly subject to being fired at will, under a proposed scheme known as Schedule <small>F</small> .</p><p class="article__body-text"> At the same time, to fill the thousands of political appointments at the top of the American civil service, the America Firsters are creating a “conservative LinkedIn” of candidates whose personal loyalty to Mr Trump is beyond question. Merely expressing qualms about the storming of the Capitol on January 6th 2021 is grounds for disqualification. None of this is a shadowy conspiracy: it is being planned in the open.</p><p class="article__body-text"> America Firsters will argue that civil-service reform promises to enhance democracy by preventing the unelected bureaucracy from stymying the programme of an elected president. Although checks and balances are an important part of America&#39;s constitutional design, the civil service is not one of the three branches of government it enshrines. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> That argument does not wash. One objection is practical. The draining of brains from government would come just as the expansion of the American state across the economy makes a competent bureaucracy more important than ever. Running a modern nation state requires expertise in administration, economics, foreign affairs and science. If officials cannot challenge political appointees&#39; madder proposals for fear of being fired, policy will rot from the inside.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A second objection is political. A future Democratic president endowed with imperial powers and unchecked by reality is not something Republicans should wish for. One reason for the professionalisation of the bureaucracy in the 19th century was to provide the ship of state with enough ballast to keep sailing from one administration to the next.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A third objection is that these changes would give an overmighty president direct control of the Department of Justice. By being able to sack all of its purported dissenters, the administration would obliterate the norm of legal independence. If so, Trumpian resentment would be channelled into concrete vengeance. That prospect should concern all Americans.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Having encountered resistance from his previous attorneys-general, the prime criterion for Mr Trump&#39;s next one would be a suppleness of spine: a willingness to quash investigations into the president and his allies and to authorise them against his long list of real and perceived political enemies. Although Mr Trump would have little practical reason to continue to foment distrust in the electoral system—since the constitution precludes a third term—the need to be vindicated about his supposedly stolen election in 2020 may lead him to do so, all the same.</p><p class="article__body-text"> If the Republicans win both houses of Congress, as is possible, nobody in the executive or the legislature will be in a position to stop Mr Trump. After all, most of those in charge will already have publicly attested to the legitimacy of storming the Capitol. The federal courts will become one of the few remaining redoubts of independence and expertise in the American system. It is hard to see how they will not also come under sustained attack.</p><p class="article__body-text"> If these carefully laid plans were enacted, America would follow Hungary and Poland down the path of illiberal democracy. True, America has more guardrails against backsliding—including centuries of democratic history and a more raucous and more decentralised media. However, these guardrails are weaker than in the past. Moreover, many Americans would be left worse off by these plans. Trust in institutions and the rule of the law would suffer, leaving the country yet more divided.</p><h2> <b>Donaldus imperator</b></h2><p class="article__body-text"> Some people will try to take comfort from the idea that Mr Trump will not win the primary, or that he will lose the general election. Perhaps his nominees will not be confirmed, or the emperor of entropy will sabotage his own supporters&#39; designs. That is unforgivably complacent.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Trump is favourite to win the nomination in a country where general elections are determined by a few tens of thousands of votes. In victory, a team of practised demolition experts would prime their explosive ideas. The deconstruction of the administrative state could begin. The vain and tyrannical whims of an emperor-president would emerge from the rubble. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i>For subscribers only: to see how we design each week&#39;s cover, sign up to our weekly <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/cover-story">Cover Story newsletter.</a></i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 13 Jul 2023 09:16:23 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/s0bolo2h15k8llqgtnvpdkph1sdsst3o</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/07/13/how-maga-republicans-plan-to-make-donald-trumps-second-term-count </item><item><title><![CDATA[The American left and right loathe each other and agree on a lot]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="A donkey and an elephant face to face holding a globe between their heads" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_USD001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_USD001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_USD001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_USD001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_USD001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_USD001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_USD001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_USD001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_USD001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_USD001.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 11jvxbd">.css-11jvxbd{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}.e16qazw90+.css-11jvxbd{margin-left:0.5rem;}</style> <span class="css-11jvxbd e16qazw91">image: Tyler Comrie/Getty Images</span> </figcaption></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">N</span> <small>ORMALLY, YOU</small> need read only the first six or seven words of a senator&#39;s sentence to be able to correctly surmise his party.

In the eyes of our elites, the spread and support of free trade should come before all other concerns—personal, political and geopolitical. In recent years this has led to a kind of &#39;free-market fundamentalism&#39;.” Suppose you were given a hint. The three proposed solutions for the neoliberal malaise are: “putting Wall Street in its place”, bringing “critical industries back to America” and resurrecting “an obligation to rebuild America&#39;s workforce”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> If you guessed a Democrat—perhaps even more cleverly Bernie Sanders writing in his recent work, “It&#39;s <small>OK</small> to be Angry About Capitalism”—you would be wrong. It was in fact Marco Rubio, the Republican senator from Florida and one-time presidential contender, writing in his just-published book, “Decades of Decadence”. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The populist era marked by Donald Trump&#39;s ascension has been tumultuous for economic policy on both the American left and right. What was once heterodox has quickly become orthodox. It is easy to be drawn to where the new left and the new right are diametrically opposed, because partisans amplify disagreement, and because there are real differences on the role of policing, say, or whether pupils ought to be schooled in gender fluidity. What the culture wars distract from is that, on matters of economic policy, there is rather a lot of agreement. The culture wars may even have hastened the convergence between the two sides by quickening the break-up between the Republican Party and big business, which is now commonly derided as just another redoubt of wokeness.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The diagnoses from the new right and new left of what ails America are strikingly similar. Both sides agree that the old order that prized expertise, free markets and free trade—“neoliberalism”, usually invoked as a pejorative—was a rotten deal for America. Corporations were too immoral; elites too feckless; globalisation too costly; inequality too unchecked; the invisible hand too prone to error.</p><p class="article__body-text"> These problems, both sides agree, must be rectified by the state, through the use of tariffs and industrial policy to boost favoured industries. That should be coupled with greater redistribution, to the detriment of corporations and to the benefit of left-behind workers. When Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, who is tasked with making something called “a foreign policy for the middle class” a reality, endorsed the idea that the administration&#39;s domestic economic policies represented a “new Washington consensus” in April, he was speaking grandly but not incorrectly. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> For wonks pushing in this direction, that is great news. “It is a sign of a healthy politics that you have people with their eyes open on both sides of the political spectrum saying, &#39;This is really broken,&#39;” says Oren Cass, a former policy adviser to Mitt Romney and now the executive director of American Compass, a think-tank leading the charge on the right. In June the organisation released an anthology of policy essays called “Rebuilding American Capitalism: A Handbook for Conservative Policymakers” that resembles a slaughterhouse for Republican sacred cows.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Trade deficits are obsessed over; federal budget deficits are hardly mentioned. Child benefits for parents should be made much more generous, as Democrats suggest, though only on the condition that parents work. Financial engineering should be resisted, with share buy-backs banned. Organised labour is to be encouraged rather than being dismissed as a hindrance. “Conservative economics, unlike the fundamentalism that supplanted it for a time, begins with a confident assertion of what the market is for and then considers the public policies necessary for shaping markets toward that end,” Mr Cass writes at the start of the manifesto.</p><p class="article__body-text"> This is apparently a catchy proposition. Most of the young guard of Republican senators who are trying to fashion populist economic policy—like Tom Cotton of Arkansas, JD Vance of Ohio and Todd Young of Indiana—gave lengthy interviews at an event to celebrate its unveiling. Mr Rubio was there, too; his recent book of recriminations against the decadent technocratic, neoliberal elite is studded with references to Mr Cass and his writings.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The idea that capitalism has inherent contradictions that require government intervention is more usually associated with the left. But Thomas Piketty, the famed French chronicler of inequality, is also optimistic that there is a broader ideological shift under way. “Beginning with the 2008 financial crisis, we&#39;ve seen the beginning of the end of this sort of neoliberal euphoria and the pandemic accelerated this transformation,” he reckons.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Biden is doing “interesting things” when it comes to industrial policy, says Mr Piketty—who freely admits his preference for the more revolutionary Democratic alternatives like Elizabeth Warren and Mr Sanders over the centrist Mr Biden. The president, he says, is “not really questioning the very high level of inequality that we have in the <small>US</small> today”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> This is a critique that those in the Biden administration might heed. There are more than a few casual fans of Mr Piketty in the White House. Heather Boushey, a member of the president&#39;s Council of Economic Advisers, helped edit an entire volume of economic essays titled “After Piketty”. Even as a tight labour market after the pandemic increased wages for the lowest-paid workers, top incomes continued to rise, causing some measures of inequality either to rise or remain stuck at stubbornly high levels. Mr Piketty had called for a return to the high marginal tax rates on income in effect in the three decades after the second world war, as well as a new steeply progressive wealth tax to finance a generous welfare state. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> This is one difference between new right and new left. Mr Biden has taken on board the idea that extreme wealth at the top of the distribution is a problem that needs tackling, and insists that he will not raise taxes on those earning less than $400,000 a year (98% of Americans fall below that threshold). Mr Cass and co spend less time fretting that the top 2% are doing too well. Though since Mr Biden has not managed to actually raise taxes on top earners, the difference is moot.</p><p class="article__body-text"> All of which leads Mr Piketty to worry that America could have a “neoliberal stabilisation” at a very high level of inequality, or continue to flirt with alternative systems like the “neo-nationalism” embodied by Mr Trump. He also worries that some of the leftish industrial policy that the Biden administration has championed, and which plenty of Republicans would copy, is in fact something more retrograde in disguise. “Some of what we call industrial policy today looks a lot like subsidies and sort of a new wave of tax competition and a race to the bottom,” he says.</p><h2> Crossing the Piketty line</h2><p class="article__body-text"> Aside from the focus on the super-rich, the differences between the new left and new right on economic matters can be hard to detect. Those on the left often discuss social policy as something that happens between state and individual; the right insists that the family remain the intermediating institution. Both find competition with China to be a justification for industrial policy; but the new right does not find the threat of climate change to be nearly so moving. There is little appetite on either side to reform entitlement programmes before the trust funds that hold cash for old-age-pension and health benefits are depleted within the next decade.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Both the new left and the new right agree on empowering workers but disagree on the means. “The Democratic Party is just completely committed at this point to strengthening existing unions,” says Mr Cass. He prefers alternative ways of organising labour like sectoral bargaining, or a German-style co-determination system in which a set number of corporate-board seats are reserved for workers (an arrangement also praised by Mr Piketty).</p><p class="article__body-text"> If there is so much agreement, why is Congress not enacting more laws that reflect the new consensus? The main reason is that mutual suspicion on matters of culture, the primary currency of contemporary politics, infect whatever new economic consensus there is. A wholesale refashioning of America therefore won&#39;t come soon. But the ideas are already proving to be more than a mere passing fad. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"> <i>Stay on top of American politics with <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance">Checks and Balance</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.</i></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 13 Jul 2023 09:16:06 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/ltmo4cs1bur7up9uh1alvvsbhfce2cai</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/07/13/the-american-left-and-right-loathe-each-other-and-agree-on-a-lot </item><item><title><![CDATA[A second Trump administration would get its way far more than the first]]></title><description><![CDATA[<section class="css-1ugvd2u e1y6i3a60"><style data-emotion="css j1vyw6">.css-j1vyw6 img{display:block;}.css-j1vyw6 .e16qazw92{margin-top:0.25rem;}</style><figure class="css-j1vyw6 e12yhaj20"><img alt="Silhouette of a Donald Trump statue being assembled" fetchpriority="high" width="1280" height="720" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent" sizes="(min-width: 960px) 700px, 95vw" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230715_FBD001.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><style data-emotion="css 18w36g1">.css-18w36g1{width:100%;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);}</style><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 e16qazw92"><style data-emotion="css 11jvxbd">.css-11jvxbd{font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans-smallcaps);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale--1);font-weight:400;font-variant-ligatures:none;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-lower);text-transform:lowercase;color:var(--ds-color-london-35);}.e16qazw90+.css-11jvxbd{margin-left:0.5rem;}</style> <span class="css-11jvxbd e16qazw91">image: Ben Hickey</span> </figcaption></figure></section><p data-caps="initial" class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap"> <span data-caps="initial">B</span> <small>ROOKE ROLLINS</small> is sitting at her desk in Fort Worth, Texas, at the back of an anonymous, low-rise building. It looks uncannily like an office in the White House, with its lemony cream wallpaper, dark wood furniture and photographs of the president signing bills as admirers look on. Only one detail jars: the 18th-century rifle leaning against the wall.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The resemblance is not a coincidence. Mrs Rollins worked in the White House under Donald Trump and briefly ran his Domestic Policy Council. She purchased her West Wing furniture when she left. Towards the end of Mr Trump&#39;s first term, she was in charge of putting together a policy agenda for his second one. After Mr Trump lost his bid for re-election in 2020, she set up a think-tank to continue that work, the America First Policy Institute ( <small>AFPI</small> ). </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-1" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> <small>AFPI</small> aspires to be an administration-in-waiting. Its staff of 172 includes eight former cabinet secretaries from the Trump administration and 20 other political appointees. “I will leave things ready for the next Republican president,” Mrs Rollins says. Campaign-finance laws prevent her from saying so, but she means Mr Trump.</p><p class="article__body-text"> <small>AFPI</small> is the newest think-tank preparing for a second term for Mr Trump, but it is not the biggest. The Heritage Foundation, which prides itself on having done the preparatory work for Ronald Reagan&#39;s “revolution”, has its own presidential transition project. This is led by Paul Dans, a lawyer who worked in the White House&#39;s Office of Personnel Management during Mr Trump&#39;s presidency. In 1981 copies of a manual for government produced by Heritage were placed on the chairs of each of Reagan&#39;s cabinet members before their first meeting. Heritage is updating that idea, co-ordinating an effort by 350 conservative wonks and former administration officials to write a plan for government in time for the Republican primaries next year. Those who have criticised Mr Trump or his agenda will not be part of it.</p><p class="article__body-text"> As well as drafting policies for each department, Mr Dans and his colleagues are building a list of potential recruits to serve in the next Republican administration. He likes to describe the effort as a conservative LinkedIn. Fully staffing an administration requires about 4,000 political appointees, 1,200 of whom must be approved by the Senate. Heritage and its allied think-tanks are vetting the people to fill those jobs now.</p><h2> Dismiss that which insults</h2><p class="article__body-text"> What would prove disqualifying? “If you kind of have shown yourself to have fought against the Trump administration, or there are issues where you&#39;ve actually been counter to it,” says Mr Dans. “You know where people stand by where they sit, so to speak. Their postings and social media, their allegiances over time can give people a pretty good picture.” Blaming Mr Trump for the ransacking of the Capitol in 2021, or supporting his impeachment in the days that followed, for example, would be enough to keep someone off the list.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Thanks to these efforts, the next Trump administration, if there is one, will have fleshed-out plans and the know-how to advance them. That would make it very different from Mr Trump&#39;s first term. “We didn&#39;t have the people because nobody thought we would win,” says Steve Bannon, who managed Mr Trump&#39;s campaign and was an influential figure at the beginning of his presidency. (Mr Trump fired Mr Bannon, but later stopped him being tried for misuse of funds from a non-profit group he headed by pardoning him.) </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-2" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Mr Bannon mentions the National Security Council ( <small>NSC</small> ) as an example of the staffing problems the Trump administration faced. It struggled to come up with half the necessary number of political appointees, he says. They were an odd mixture of people like Michael Anton, a corporate <small>PR</small> man and apocalyptic political commentator, and old foreign-policy hands who turned out to be queasy about Mr Trump&#39;s courting of North Korea&#39;s dictator and his hostility to American allies.</p><p class="article__body-text"> What was true of the <small>NSC</small> applies to other agencies, too. “You have got to hit the beach with three or four thousand guys,” Mr Bannon says. Mr Dans agrees. “In Hollywood they like to describe things as &#39;this meets that meets the other&#39;. This is the Manhattan Project meets the Empire State Building meets <small>D</small> -Day.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> The initial objective for this invading force is to capture the civil service. One lesson that Mr Trump&#39;s backers drew from his first term is that no policy matters more than control of the bureaucracy, because no policies can be implemented without it.</p><p class="article__body-text"> To that end Mr Trump&#39;s commandos will “deconstruct” the administrative state—the 300 or more federal offices that issue and interpret regulations. The philosophical version of this idea is that, over time, as the role of the federal government has grown from fighting wars and running the postal service into the Leviathan it is today, unelected bureaucrats have assumed powers that should belong to Congress. The Twitter version is that the deep-state liberals who thwarted Mr Trump when he was in office and have persecuted him since he left must be vanquished. Either way, Mr Trump&#39;s shock troops will try to wrest power back from the bureaucracy.</p><p class="article__body-text"> In practice it is hard to see how government would function without the administrative state. Congress struggles to fulfil basic responsibilities like passing a budget on time. To imagine that the same body could act as, say, the regulator of financial markets is a stretch. That may be the point. The <small>MAGA</small> movement is not libertarian, but in many ways it would like the federal government to do far less than it does now.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The would-be Trump appointees plan to subdue the bureaucracy using Schedule <small>F</small> , shorthand for an executive order issued by Mr Trump in 2020 and rescinded by Joe Biden when he became president. It reflects a view that the federal bureaucracy, whatever its size, should not have any entrenched authority. For the first century of its existence, civil servants were appointed to jobs by the government of the day based on an algorithm of personal contacts and favours owed known as the spoils system. Then in 1881 a deranged office-seeker assassinated the president, spurring the passage of the Pendleton Act, which created a class of professional bureaucrats who stayed in their posts even as the presidency changed hands. Since the 1940s, when Franklin Roosevelt was expanding the government, it has been hard to fire federal bureaucrats, <small>AFPI</small> complains.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Many political appointees in the Trump administration believe that a minority of civil servants used their protected status to thwart or undermine the president&#39;s wishes. James Sherk, a policy adviser in the Trump White House who is now at <small>AFPI</small> , cites two cases on which lawyers in various government departments reportedly refused to work: one against Yale University for allegedly discriminating against Asian-Americans, and one aimed at protecting nurses from having to perform abortions. Schedule <small>F</small> would empower Mr Trump&#39;s appointees to remove perceived obstructionists at will.</p><p class="article__body-text"> “Schedule <small>F</small> is now, I think, Republican doctrine,” says Russell Vought, who ran the Office of Management and Budget under Mr Trump. “I don&#39;t know how a Republican gets elected and doesn&#39;t do that.” It would also be straightforward to enact: Mr Trump could just reissue his old executive order. Again, there is a reasonable version of this idea, in which a small number of recalcitrant civil servants lose their jobs, and a campaign version, where Schedule <small>F</small> becomes the instrument of Mr Trump&#39;s righteous purge of Washington.</p><h2> To be with those I like is enough</h2><p class="article__body-text"> The combined effect of appointing only loyalists and cowing the bureaucracy would be both to remove constraints on Mr Trump and to ensure his wishes are acted on more often. In his first term Mr Trump&#39;s opponents took some comfort from the idea that not all the people around him were true believers, and were willing to stall his most alarming ideas. The <i>New York Times</i> ran an anonymous piece by a political appointee who claimed there was an internal resistance within the administration that acted as a check on presidential power. In a second Trump term, there will not be any “grown-ups in the room”, as Mr Trump&#39;s detractors called such people. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-3" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/778/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD002.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/256/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD002.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/384/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD002.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/512/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD002.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/768/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD002.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/819/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD002.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1024/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD002.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1280/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD002.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1638/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD002.jpg 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="Silhouette of a Donald Trump statue being handed a spear" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Once a second Trump administration had bent the bureaucracy to its will, what policies would it pursue? The department-by-department plans being drawn up at <small>AFPI</small> , Heritage and elsewhere give some guidance. They involve some predictable fusillades in the culture wars, such as completing a wall along the border with Mexico and directing all federal officials to consider only people&#39;s biological sex, rather than “self-identified” gender. But some of the putative policy agenda is both more sweeping in scope and more of a break with past Republican orthodoxy.</p><p class="article__body-text"> One such area is the economy. The new right is enthusiastic about the kind of industrial policy the Biden administration has pursued. “No one in Ohio…cares that the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> editorial board doesn&#39;t like the <small>CHIPS</small> bill on free-market economic grounds,” JD Vance, a senator, recently told a gathering at American Compass, a think-tank, referring to a law subsidising semiconductor factories. In some cases Mr Trump&#39;s supporters would go further: Mr Vance advocates taxing companies that shift work offshore.</p><p class="article__body-text"> The main partisan disagreement over industrial policy is no longer whether to have one at all, but over the Democrats&#39; habit of smuggling diversity requirements and environmental goals into it. As the Republicans have become a more working-class party than the Democrats, people like Mr Vance have tried to synthesise a <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/article63922-prod.ece">new Republican position</a> that is both pro-labour and hostile to union leaders. His advocacy of subsidies for industry without “the woke bullshit” is probably more popular than the Biden administration&#39;s approach.</p><p class="article__body-text"> That enthusiasm for an active state coexists with a more conventional Republican programme of lowering taxes, coupled with a belief that well-intentioned efforts to cut poverty usually backfire. <small>AFPI</small> ’s policy book talks of making permanent the tax cuts in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, some of which are due to expire in 2025. <small>AFPI</small> ’s policy wonks also advocate attaching work requirements to Medicaid (health insurance for the poor) and other government benefits. In Arkansas, the only state to have implemented work requirements for Medicaid, a quarter of those enrolled in the programme lost their health insurance and there was no noticeable increase in employment. The reforms would at least save some money, but not enough to have much impact on the federal deficit.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> Expensive industrial policy, lower taxes and only small reductions in benefits—in other words, less revenue and more spending—would not balance the books, much less trim government debts or refill the funds that pay for Medicare (subsidised health insurance for the disabled and the old) and Social Security (the state pension), which are due to run dry in the early 2030s. On past evidence the bond market is likely to continue to finance the growing gap between the government&#39;s income and expenditure. Investors might become nervous, however, if the Federal Reserve&#39;s independence were in question. Some Trumpists think it should be, since they do not like to cede so much power to unelected bureaucrats. That is a minority view, Mr Vought concedes, but could gain ground: “I guarantee that if that debate was in front of President Trump, that he wouldn&#39;t just throw you out of the Oval Office.”</p><p class="article__body-text"> Another area in which a second Trump term could bend the arc of history is in environmental policy. In his first term emissions of greenhouse gases kept falling, even though he reversed many of Barack Obama&#39;s policies to slow climate change. Investors assumed that government policy would soon revert to a greener norm and coal-fired power stations have lifespans of several decades, so the administration&#39;s fondness for them was not enough to get new ones built. In this respect, too, a second Trump administration would be more methodical and better organised.</p><h2> Whatever satisfies the soul is truth</h2><p class="article__body-text"> <small>AFPI</small> ’s policy book talks about ending “the war on fossil fuels” and makes untethered assumptions about how much bigger the economy would be without it. ( <small>AFPI</small> estimates that America&#39;s <small>gdp</small> will be 6% smaller by the end of this decade than it would have been without the Obama administration&#39;s emissions-reductions targets.) The argument is presented in both pragmatic and moral terms. Why should American oil stay in the ground while Saudi oil flows? And why should the use of fuels which can bring so much prosperity to so many be circumscribed? Never mind that Mr Biden&#39;s administration has granted more permits to drill than Mr Trump&#39;s did, that America is the world&#39;s largest producer of oil or that it is in the national interest to limit global warming.</p><p class="article__body-text"> America Firsters like oil, gas and coal and the relatively well-paid, manly jobs for high-school graduates they bring. They are also opposed to the green transition, which they see as unnecessary government meddling that raises energy prices for ordinary Americans. Both Kevin Roberts, who runs Heritage, and Mrs Rollins, who started <small>AFPI</small> , used to be senior figures at the Texas Public Policy Foundation ( <small>TPPF</small> ), a think-tank which opposes the development of wind farms and solar plants. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div id="econ-4" class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> Over a quarter of Texas&#39;s electricity is generated by renewables, and <small>TPPF</small> has helped to propagate the idea that this makes the state&#39;s power grid unstable. Investors in renewables say Texas&#39;s electricity regulator has become hostile to new projects. <small>TPPF</small> , meanwhile, is battling renewables as far afield as New York, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, where it has initiated a lawsuit against a big offshore wind farm on behalf of fishermen. If the federal Environmental Protection Agency and Justice Department were run by people who shared these instincts, investors in renewables would face the same sort of political risks as owners of coal plants.</p><p class="article__body-text"> A third area which is likely to see great upheaval if Mr Trump becomes president again is foreign policy. Among America First types, there is deep disagreement about Ukraine. <small>AFPI</small> ’s policy book talks about facing the threat from Russia. Yet Mr Bannon says, “I don&#39;t give a shit about Ukraine—what I give a shit about is the invasion of America&#39;s southern border.” Mr Vought makes the same point in a more wonkish way: “Ukraine is being subsidised by our taxpayers to fight and not make strategic calculations that they would otherwise make if we weren&#39;t subsidising it. And it&#39;s not in our interest to subsidise that conflict.” Mr Trump himself says he would end the war. He may not be able to do that. But Ukraine and its other allies ought to take seriously the possibility that America may no longer be with them in 18 months.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Policy towards China is less contested. The Trump administration was more confrontational towards China than any of its predecessors. The Biden administration has continued in the same vein, albeit with less inflammatory rhetoric and more considered policies. “The difference between the Biden administration and the Trump administration on protectionism is that the Biden administration is competent,” says Dan Drezner of Tufts University. A second Trump term would be more likely to build on what the Biden team have done rather than, say, loosening export controls.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure> <span itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/778/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/256/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/384/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/512/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/768/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/819/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/1024/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1280/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1638/90/media-assets/image/20230715_FBD003.jpg 1280w" sizes="336px" alt="Silhouette of a laurel wreath being lowered onto a Donald Trump statue" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></span></figure><p class="article__body-text"> Heritage&#39;s plan for 2025 foresees an immediate ban on TikTok and also on Confucius Institutes.

The government should be prepared “to employ punitive policy measures” to prevent American investment in sensitive areas in China and Chinese investment in America. American companies considering large-scale investments in anything deemed critical would have to submit information about counterparties and anticipated use of funds to the <small>US</small> government before investing, “under a presumption of denial”.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Whether Mr Trump would authorise the use of force if China were to invade Taiwan is hard to say. Some who worked in his administration note that whenever they were about to adopt tougher policies on China, the bosses of big American firms would call the White House and tell him that the move would alarm financial markets and he would back down. The same dynamic may apply in a second term. In a memoir of his time as Mr Trump&#39;s national security adviser, John Bolton suggests the former president was not really committed to Taiwan&#39;s security. Others claim he would be “stronger” than Mr Biden.</p><p class="article__body-text"> Other allies could expect the same peremptory treatment as in Mr Trump&#39;s first term. He reportedly told aides he wanted to leave <small>nato</small> . Even <small>AFPI</small> , which on foreign policy is closer to the old Republican orthodoxy, thinks that military support should be withdrawn from countries that do not spend at least 2% of <small>GDP</small> on defence, a level that neither Japan nor most countries in <small>nato</small> meet. The modern America First movement, like its namesake during the second world war, contains some true isolationists. But it also contains an influential clutch of people like Elbridge Colby, who served in the Department of Defence and believes in a muscular foreign policy. He thinks China is such a threat that America should pull back from its defence commitments in Europe and the Middle East to concentrate on the Pacific.</p><p class="article__body-text"> No matter how well-laid the plans for a second Trump term, nor how thoroughly vetted the people carrying them out, Mr Trump would still be in charge, which means there is a limit to how methodical it could be. But it would be altogether more formidable than the version of 2017-21. As for the candidate himself, he is aware of the plans being made on his behalf but has never been excited by the details of public policy. For the professional wonks in the movement, that is an opportunity.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"> “ <i>The Economist</i> doesn&#39;t think that populists can govern, right?” asks Mr Vought. “We believe we&#39;re trying to be an answer to that viewpoint. So we&#39;re trying to look systemically: how does someone who has an American First perspective, a populist perspective, govern credibly and effectively? Because they know the inner workings of government so well.” The winner of next year&#39;s presidential election will be sworn in in 18 months. The institutions of the new right expect it to be Mr Trump, and this time they will be prepared. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 13 Jul 2023 09:15:55 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/34fdaqhpnfv8mqucvmtb54fk4r3206ap</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/07/13/a-second-trump-administration-would-get-its-way-far-more-than-the-first</item></channel></rss>
