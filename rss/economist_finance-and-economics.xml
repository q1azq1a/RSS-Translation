e190yofl0"><span>每个</span><small>人都想要</small>更多的金属。近几个月来，英国与赞比亚签署了一项协议，日本与纳米比亚签署了一项协议，<small>欧盟</small>也动摇了<small> </small>与智利握手。欧盟谈判代表还开始与刚果民主共和国进行谈判。与此同时，美国访问了蒙古。这项漫无目的的活动也针对菲律宾和沙特阿拉伯，其目标只有一个：获取快速脱碳所需的矿物。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">占全球排放量五分之四的 72 个国家已承诺实现净零排放目标。据智库能源转型委员会<small>等</small>机构称，到 2050 年要实现这一目标，需要将风力发电能力提高 15 倍，将太阳能发电能力提高 25 倍，将电网规模扩大三倍，并将电力机队增加 60 倍。电动汽车 ( <small>ev</small> )。到 2030 年，铜和镍的需求可能增长 50-70%，钴和钕的需求可能增长 150%，石墨和锂的需求可能增长 6 至 7 倍。官方预测机构国际能源署预测，总而言之，到 2050 年，实现碳中和的世界每年将需要 3500 万吨绿色金属。加上铝和<a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/05/31/there-is-more-than-one-way-to-make-green-steel">钢</a>，<small>等机构</small>预测从现在到那时的需求将达到 65 亿吨。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">因此，分析师和政策制定者担心本世纪末将出现严重的供应紧缩。<small>等公司</small>预计，到 2030 年，市场短缺程度将达到突破性水平：铜和镍的短缺量约为 10-15%，其他电池金属的短缺量为 30-45%。当库存减少导致价格上涨时，生产商将提高产量，而客户将更有效地使用稀缺材料或转向更便宜的替代品。然而，在此之后仍未满足的需求将被摧毁，因为无法或不愿支付更高价格的潜在买家将被迫退出市场。过多的此类需求破坏将扼杀绿色转型。那么问题就很简单了。可以尽量减少紧缩吗？</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">首先考虑相关金属。其中三种已在工业中得到广泛应用：铝和钢是面板和涡轮机的支柱，而铜对于从电缆到汽车的所有产品都至关重要。然后是为电动汽车 ( <small>ev</small> ) 提供动力的材料：构成电池阴极的钴、锂和镍，以及主要阳极元素的石墨。除了镍（也是不锈钢的成分）之外，所有这些都只有小众应用。最后一组含有磁性稀土，例如<small>电动</small>汽车电机和涡轮发电机中发现的钕。这些只需要很少的量。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">一个令人不安的事实使得寻找此类金属的紧迫性稍微降低了一些：气候政策不太可能像大多数预测所假设的那样将全球变暖限制在比工业化前水平高出 1.5°C 的范围内。此外，许多未来展望者还认为，对绿色装备以及<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/07/06/the-world-needs-more-battery-metals-time-to-mine-the-seabed">金属的</a>需求将以线性方式增长，尽管一些国家无疑只会在最后几码开始冲刺。因此，到 2050 年的净零排放预测可能比 2030 年更可信。钢铁的绿色利用仍只是沧海一粟，但可能仍将保持丰富。钴是其他广受欢迎的金属的副产品，其供应可能永远超过需求。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但仍然存在许多困难。 <i>《经济学人》</i>调查的行业预言预测，到 2030 年，铜供应缺口将达到 200 万至 400 万吨，即潜在需求的 6% 至 12%。他们还预计锂缺口将达到 50,000-100,000 吨，即 2-4%。理论上含量丰富的镍和石墨可能会引起问题，因为电池需要的材料纯度难以捉摸。能够将铝土矿提炼成铝的冶炼厂太少。中国以外几乎没有人生产钕。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这些都将是难以克服的问题。然而我们发现三个杠杆可以在不破坏过渡的情况下降低压力。首先，生产商可能会从现有来源中提取更多供应，这可以立即完成，但会生产有限数量的金属。其次，企业可能会开设新矿，这可以完全解决问题，但需要时间。这两个杠杆的局限性使得第三个杠杆成为最重要的杠杆，至少在未来十年是这样：寻找规避绿色瓶颈的方法。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">全金属球拍</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">重复使用更多的材料可能会带来快速的成功。铝、铜和镍的涨幅最大。所有这些都被广泛回收，但更高的价格将刺激这个乏味、分散的行业的支出。其中一些已经发生。大型矿商必和必拓<small>（bhp</small> ）支持了坦桑尼亚一家镍回收新贵。该公司首席经济学家 Huw McKay 估计，十年内废铜可能占铜供应总量的 50%，而目前这一比例为 35%。另一家矿业巨头力拓正在投资铝回收中心。去年，专注于电池金属回收的初创公司筹集了 5 亿美元，创纪录。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">重启闲置矿山可能会带来更多收益。其中的数量并不多：后疫情时代需求的激增已经减少了闲置现象。即使价格翻倍，铜和镍的成本曲线也表明只有少数矿山会重新开放。但铝是一个重要的例外。自 2021 年 12 月以来，能源成本飙升导致欧洲每年有 140 万吨冶炼产能（占全球的 2%）关闭。托克 (Trafigura) 贸易商格雷姆·特雷恩 (Graeme Train) 认为，价格上涨 25% 将吸引大部分资金回流。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最大的希望在于能够从棘手的存款中挤压供应的技术。新公司正在开发被称为“尾浸”的化学工艺，从金属含量低的矿石中提取铜，使废物值得利用。 Jetti Resources（一家此类公司）的 Daniel Malchuk 表示，大规模使用该技术每年可以额外生产 100 万吨铜，而无需花费太多成本。与此同时，在全球最大的镍生产国印度尼西亚，矿商正在使用“高压酸浸”将低品位矿石转化为适合电动汽车的材料。耗资 30 亿美元的工厂已经建成，并宣布了价值近 200 亿美元的额外项目。苏克敦贸易商 Daria Efanova 估计，到 2030 年，印度尼西亚将生产约 40 万吨优质镍，部分填补她预计的 90 万吨供应缺口。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，这些新技术存在不确定性，并且在某些情况下还存在污染等缺点。由此产生的供应不能被视为理所当然。开办新矿山，即第二个杠杆，将带来更大的收益，即使速度很慢。咨询公司麦肯锡计算出，如果至少已开始预可行性研究的 382 个钴、铜、锂和镍项目能够在 2030 年之前完成，那么市场将保持基本平衡。这些项目将意味着产量的大幅增长：目前全球约有 500 个钴、铜、锂和镍矿正在运营。为了按时开业，他们必须克服许多困难。 </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px"

edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">首先是缺钱。麦肯锡估计，到 2030 年，为了填补供应缺口，采矿业的年度资本支出必须增加一倍，达到 3000 亿美元。另一家咨询公司<small>cru</small>预计，到 2027 年，仅铜方面的支出就必须达到 220 亿美元，而 2016-21 年的平均支出为 150 亿美元。大型矿商的投资正在增加，但速度还不够快。然而，这需要时间才能产生效果，因为挖掘新矿需要很长时间——锂矿需要四到七年，铜矿平均需要 17 年——而且由于缺乏许可证，延误情况更加严重。在活动人士的怂恿下，政府和监管机构越来越多地以环境为由阻止项目。 2017 年至 2021 年间，智利新矿平均需要 311 天才能获得批准，而 2002-06 年为 139 天。与此同时，在平静国家开采的铜矿石的金属含量正在下降，迫使矿商寻找更加危险的地点。到 2030 年计划新增供应的三分之二位于 2020 年世界银行“营商便利度”指数排名低于 50 位的国家。 Reko Diq 是加拿大公司 Barrick Gold 领导的一个项目，位于伊朗和巴基斯坦之间，蕴藏着世界上最大的未开发铜矿之一。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">所有这些都意味着，从长远来看，新的供应只能是一个解决方案，也许是在经历了一段时间的高价格之后。因此，未来十年的大部分调整将归结为需求——我们的第三个杠杆。方程的这一面比未来的生产更难建模，人们对此知之甚少。但它可能比通常意识到的更灵活。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">汽车和电池制造商是金属市场上前所未有的买家。这些公司具有强烈的创新精神、对价格敏感且规避风险，一旦出现供应紧张的迹象，就会立即解决问题。他们已经通过“节俭”——不断发现减少金属使用的小方法——取得了很多成就。典型的电动汽车电池现在仅含 69 公斤铜，低于 2020 年的 80 公斤。cru 的 Simon Morris 认为下一代可能只需要 21-50 公斤，到 2035 年<small>每年</small>可节省多达 200 万吨铜。他认为到 2027 年，电池的锂强度可能会减半。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">通过替代可以实现更多目标。钴含量与镍一样多的镍锰钴化学物质（称为<small>nmc</small> 111）正在被逐步淘汰，取而代之的是<small>nmc</small> 721 和 811，它们含有更多的镍，但含有很少的钴。它们占<small>电动汽车</small>电池阴极的四分之一，而 2017 年为零。与此同时，更便宜但能量密度较低的磷酸铁锂 ( <small>lfp</small> ) 混合物正在征服蓬勃发展的中国市场，城市居民不太担心较短的行驶里程。事实上， <small>LFP</small>目前占全球<small>电动汽车</small>阴极的 30%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">石墨阳极也掺杂了硅，硅的含量非常丰富。三月，电动<small>汽车</small>制造商特斯拉表示，将制造一款不需要稀土的电机。钠离子电池用地球上第六丰富的元素钠取代锂，最终可能会取得胜利。由于能量密度低，它们将首先用于固定存储，其中体积的限制较小。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">客户偏好将发挥一定作用。如今，人们希望<small>电动汽车</small>一次充电即可行驶 600 公里，但很少有人经常行驶这样的距离。由于锂资源稀缺，汽车制造商可能会设计短程车辆，通过安装便携式电池来增强续航里程，从而从根本上缩小标准电池组的尺寸。如果价格合适，采用可能会很快。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">铜无法轻易地从网格中分离出来，这是主要问题。但在这方面，消费转变也可能有所帮助。 <small>cru</small>估计，绿色需求占铜总需求的比例将从现在的 7% 上升到 2030 年的 21%——虽然比例更大，但仍然只是一小部分。当供应缺口出现时，剩下的许多克铜可以转移到绿色应用中。随着金属成本上升，同样含有铜的电话和洗衣机的销量可能会比电线和太阳能电池板的销量下降得更快——特别是如果清洁技术市场得到补贴和政府订单的支撑的话。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">到 2030 年代末，可能会有足够的新矿山和回收设施，以便过渡按计划进行。问题是在此期间会有多少干扰。事情会很紧张。由于供应将集中在少数国家，当地动乱、地缘政治冲突甚至恶劣天气都可能对市场造成冲击：Liberum Capital 银行的模拟显示，秘鲁的矿工罢工或印度尼西亚三个月的干旱都可能导致市场崩溃。到 2028 年，铜或镍市场将出现 5-15% 的供应短缺。但有了灵活的买家、坚定的政府和一点运气，绿色金属的碰撞不一定会导致电动汽车事故。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 11 Sep 2023 20:39:46 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

decade?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">野村综合研究所 (Nomura Research Institute) 的理查德·古 (Richard Koo) 在最近的一次演讲中表示： <span>“</span><small>自从</small>中国房地产泡沫破灭以来，我接到了大量来自中国记者、经济学家、投资者，有时还有政策制定者的电话，他们问我，‘我们要不要日本的方式？”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">辜先生是一个很好的提问者：他将自己的职业生涯奉献给了研究金融过剩的后果。 1991 年，当美国经济从第一次海湾战争中的复苏步履蹒跚时，时任纽约联邦储备银行老板的爱德华·弗赖德尔 (Edward Frydl) 开始担心债务和商业地产的过剩问题。弗莱德尔认为，这“助长了企业和消费者中普遍存在的金融和经济保守主义”。信贷需求受到抑制，因为企业“将努力转向资产负债表重组”。为了描述这些压力，他创造了“资产负债表衰退”一词。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">辜先生后来意识到，日本也面临着同样的问题，甚至更严重。 1989年股市泡沫破灭后，不到三年股价就暴跌60%。东京的房地产价格连续十多年下跌。从某些指标来看，通货紧缩持续的时间甚至更长。甚至高尔夫会员资格（可在日本有组织的交易所进行交易）的价格也暴跌了 94%。许多借钱购买其他公司的财产或股票的公司发现自己在技术上已经资不抵债，资产价值低于负债。但它们仍然保持流动性，赚取足够的收入来履行持续的义务。正如古先生所说，由于生存受到威胁，他们将努力方向从利润最大化转向债务最小化。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在健康的经济中，企业利用家庭和其他储户提供的资金，将资金投入到业务发展中。在后泡沫时代的日本，情况看起来有所不同。企业部门不再筹集资金，而是开始偿还债务并积累自己的财务债权。其传统的财政赤字转变为长期的财政盈余。企业抑制剥夺了经济急需的需求和创业活力，导致经济陷入一两年的通货紧缩。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">那么中国是否会步日本的后尘呢？相对于国内<small>生产总值</small>的规模，中国企业积累的债务甚至比泡沫时代的日本还要多。中国的房价已经开始下跌，损害了家庭和房地产公司的资产负债表。尽管降息，信贷增长仍大幅放缓。资金流量统计显示，近年来我国企业财务赤字有所收窄。古先生判断，中国已经陷入资产负债表衰退。再加上人口减少和美国的敌对，人们很容易感到悲观：它会重蹈日本的覆辙吗？应该是这么幸运吧。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">但如果仔细观察，就会发现情况还不是很确定。中国企业的大部分债务是国有企业所欠，如果中国政策制定者有要求，国有企业将在国有银行的支持下继续借贷和支出。民营企业中，债务主要集中在房地产开发商的账上。他们正在减少负债并削减新住房项目的投资。但面对房价下跌和房屋销售疲软，即使是资产负债表稳健的开发商也会采取同样的做法。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">中国房地产繁荣的结束使得家庭变得更加富裕。这可能会滋生他们支出的保守主义。近几个月来，家庭提前偿还抵押贷款也是事实，导致信贷增长急剧放缓。但调查显示，家庭债务相对于其资产较低。他们的抵押贷款提前还款是对利率变化的理性反应，而不是资产负债表压力的迹象。当中国利率下降时，家庭无法轻松地以较低的利率为其抵押贷款再融资。因此，他们偿还旧的、相对昂贵的抵押贷款是有意义的，即使这意味着赎回目前收益率较低的投资。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">中国的资金流量统计数据显示企业部门正在走向财务盈余，企业行为的转变又如何呢？美国银行的皮晓庆和她的同事指出，这种缩小的主要原因是对影子银行的打击。当金融机构被排除在外时，企业部门仍然需要从经济的其他部门获得资金。中国企业并没有集体从利润最大化转向债务最小化，这种转变导致日本陷入通货紧缩十年。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">日语课程</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这些差异表明中国尚未陷入日本那样的衰退。辜先生本人也热衷于强调两国之间的一个“巨大”差异。当日本陷入资产负债表衰退时，该国没有人知道这个问题的名称，也不知道如何应对它。他说，今天，许多中国经济学家正在研究他的想法。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">他的处方很简单。如果家庭和企业即使在低利率下也不会借贷和支出，那么政府将不得不这样做。财政赤字必须抵消私营部门的财政盈余，直到其资产负债表得到完全修复。古先生表示，如果中国统治者习近平得到正确的建议，他可以在 20 分钟内解决问题。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">不幸的是，中国官员迄今为止反应迟缓。该国的预算赤字（广义上包括各种地方政府借款）今年有所收紧，加剧了经济衰退。中央政府有空间增加借贷，但似乎不愿意这样做，宁愿保持干燥状态。这是个错误。如果政府支出较晚，则可能需要花费更多。具有讽刺意味的是，中国面临陷入长期衰退的风险，并不是因为私营部门一心要整顿其财务，而是因为中央政府不愿让自己的资产负债表变得足够肮脏。 <span

class="article__body-text">米雷受弗里德曼影响的提议中影响最深远的就是经济美元化。这将涉及用美元取代比索，并意味着摆脱阿根廷央行，米莱称其为“宇宙中最糟糕的事情”。他夸大了，但只有一点点。阿根廷经济千疮百孔。年通货膨胀率为113%。央行已经耗尽了美元。自今年年初以来，比索兑美元的价值已减半。简而言之，激进思考的时代已经到来。不幸的是，美元化更有可能是一种诅咒，而不是阿根廷问题的解决方案。</p><p class="article__body-text">当一个国家将其经济与另一个国家的货币挂钩时，它就放弃了制定自己的货币政策。利率将由美联储决定，这使得利率更加可预测，而且几乎不可能被篡改。对于像阿根廷这样历史记录如此坎坷的国家来说，这将缓解许多令人头疼的问题。无论如何，大多数阿根廷人都使用美元。正式宣布这种情况将使公众避免从美元到比索来回兑换的麻烦。作为世界上交易量最大的货币，美元的汇率不会因阿根廷这个规模相当小的经济体所发生的任何事情而受到影响，这意味着货币价值将不再上下波动。厄瓜多尔在 2000 年美元化之后，这个公式至少在一段时间内保持了相对稳定。</p><p class="article__body-text">然而，主要的吸引力在于阿根廷将被禁止印钞。弗里德曼对中央银行持批评态度，认为大多数中央银行都太弱，无法控制通货膨胀，因为这样做意味着要坚定地顶住政客的压力，要求他们更容易支付账单或让经济在选举期间过热。正如米莱先生很快指出的那样，阿根廷央行是最不负责任的央行之一。美元化将使印刷机变得遥不可及。支持者认为，这意味着国家缩减规模和与通货膨胀的长期斗争结束只是时间问题。 </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dUghhK8YBvA?enablejsapi=1" class></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text">然而，这一论点有一个问题：它对政府抱有不切实际的玫瑰色看法。它假设政客们意识到他们在危机中无法再向央行求助，他们会自动将借贷减少到安全水平。如果政府过度借贷的唯一原因是因为他们知道央行会救助他们，那么情况确实如此。事实上，大多数政府之所以举债，是因为面临着巨大的压力。贷款人需要偿还。官僚机构必须进行重组。反对党敦促现任者花钱。而且，最紧迫的是，选民开始期望国家提供某些服务。印刷机的缺乏并不足以消除这些担忧。</p><p class="article__body-text">当灾难袭来时，美元化经济中的事情就会变得可怕。没有中央银行充当政府或银行系统的最后贷款人。因此，违约的可能性变得更大。本可以通过紧急流动性拯救的银行倒闭，政府缺乏美元来支付存款，导致数百万人陷入困境。此外，届时大部分借款可能会受到美国法律的管辖，从而使政府在任何重组谈判中处于不利地位。</p><p class="article__body-text">事实上，厄瓜多尔目前正在经历美元化的许多弊端。政策一出台，物价立刻就稳定了。但它也未能遏制政府的财政赤字。此后，政策制定者采取了越来越有创意的方式来为该法案提供资金，推动该国于 2019 年与<small>国际货币基金组织</small>达成协议。</p><h2>米莱，震撼</h2><p class="article__body-text">阿根廷陷入灾难的未来比政策制定者了解成功美元化所需的艰难决定的未来更容易预见。一个世纪以来的大部分时间里，财政过剩一直是一个问题。过去 65 年来，国际货币基金组织已对该国进行了 22 次<small>救助</small>，该基金已经筋疲力尽，以至于放弃了要求该国实现收支平衡的要求。一系列左翼政府建立了庞大的福利国家和庞大的官僚机构。米莱先生承诺向占<small>GDP 38% 的公共部门削减 GDP</small><small>的</small>15%，但很难概述这些资金的来源。</p><p class="article__body-text">还有很多其他问题。一个重要的问题是，米雷先生的政府将如何找到他的团队认为转向美元所需的 400 亿美元。目前，阿根廷甚至无法偿还<small>国际货币基金组织的债务</small>，该国欠国际货币基金组织 440 亿美元。由于美国货币耗尽，央行转而烧毁从中国借来的人民币。米雷先生建议通过离岸基金出售国有企业和政府债务，以筹集必要的资金。很难想象会有很多买家。</p><p class="article__body-text">无论谁在 12 月掌权，都将处于一个糟糕的境地。忘记寻找资金来实现美元化吧。越来越多的经济学家认为，该国再次资不抵债，这意味着它几乎不可能偿还现有债务。该国的债券价格反映了金融市场正在消化另一次债务重组的事实。为了重新开始，阿根廷可能需要违约，而不是美元化。 <span>■</span></p><p

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>很少</span><small>有资产</small>像住房一样具有政治性，因此很少有市场像抵押贷款市场那样如此依赖国界。政府可以无休止地调整一切来控制事情的发展，涉及一切事情，从你可以借多少钱、谁可以贷，到如果你强硬他们可以做什么。然而，对于当今的借款人来说，一键拨号感觉最为紧迫：您的贷款期限是多长？</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如果您是美国人或丹麦人，答案很可能是您在抵押贷款期间享有固定利率。因此，你可能对鹰派央行行长和债券收益率攀升的关注度很低。在许多其他国家，包括英国、加拿大和南欧大部分国家，抵押贷款利率往往最多固定几年，或者根本不固定。如果你属于这一类，那么你最近对货币政策的思考可能比你想要的要多得多，因为（恭喜！）你是货币政策的传导渠道之一。面对即将增加的付款，您可能会羡慕那些永远不需要担心的人。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，对于这个群体来说，事情并不像最初看上去那么美好。美国冻结的房地产市场，房主不愿出售并失去在廉价货币时期锁定的低利率，这应该提醒政策制定者注意长期修复的危险。对于抵押贷款付款人来说，有一个更直接的理由对此类贷款保持警惕。终生利率可能会提供心理安全。但你必须付出高昂的代价才能获得安全。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">要了解原因，首先要从如何设置固定费率开始。无论是谁向你贷款——银行、建屋互助会或债券投资者——要么自己借钱（比如从储户那里），要么放弃借给其他人（比如通过购买政府债券）。在这两种情况下，他们都放弃了其他地方的利息支付。如果他们要放贷的话，你的抵押贷款利率需要补偿这一点。一种补偿方法是根据市场条件浮动的利率，始终与贷方在其他地方损失的利息支付相匹配。另一种是在一定年限内固定的利率，按照贷款人在此期间预期的平均融资成本。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">问题是你可能想提前偿还抵押贷款——例如搬家。对于浮动利率，贷方不太可能介意。毕竟，他们可以拿走你的还款并将其借给其他人以获得相同的收入。但对于固定利率，他们可能会非常介意。假设您最初同意支付 5% 的利息，为期 30 年，然后想在同等市场利率降至 3% 时偿还。在这种情况下，您的贷方将无法再以相同的收入向您提供还款。同样，他们会想要补偿：两个百分点的差异，乘以抵押贷款的剩余年数，再乘以您的平均余额。换句话说，很多。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">因此，30 年期固定利率在世界大部分地区并不受欢迎。如果情况发生变化并且市场朝着错误的方向发展，很少有借款人愿意承担巨额提前还款成本的风险。监管机构的一个解决方案是限制成本，但这首先会阻碍长期修复的贷款。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">除此之外，美国和丹麦采用的替代解决方案看起来几乎就像炼金术一样。在这两个国家，抵押贷款的固定期限为 30 年，并可根据借款人的要求按面值提前偿还。无论利率如何变动，美国人都不会获得任何利润或损失。同样，如果利率下降，丹麦借款人也无需支付罚金（相比之下，固定利率变得昂贵），但如果利率上升，则可以实现利润。这意味着，与美国人不同，丹麦人不必担心放弃比市场更便宜的价格来搬家，而且可以更自由地这样做。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，一切都是有代价的，在这种情况下，这个代价就是高得令人瞠目结舌的借贷成本。新的 30 年期美国抵押贷款的平均利率为 7.2%，而 30 年期国债利率仅为 4.4%。在丹麦，相应的税率为 5.3% 和 2.9%。与此同时，在英国，抵押贷款持有人和政府的借贷成本大致相似。换句话说，这两项长期修复措施都使相关 360 个月抵押贷款还款额增加了三分之一以上。那些几年前拥有令人羡慕的远见以确保最低利率的人可能不会太介意。其他人，无论多么羡慕，都应该记住，安全并不便宜。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><b>阅读我们金融市场专栏作家 Buttonwood 的更多内容：<br></b> <i><a

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>近年来</span><small>，</small>美国司法部反垄断部门一直在打击企业合并，提出了创纪录数量的投诉，试图阻止最大的企业变得更大。除了少数例外，这些努力都遭到了法院的阻挠。让法官干预商业如此困难，反映出芝加哥大学这一机构的工作，该机构因其对经济的自由市场影响力而不是法律而闻名。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">五十年前的这个秋天，联邦法官、芝加哥学者理查德·波斯纳（Richard Posner）发表了他的《法律的经济分析》。该书现已出版第九版，引发了包括加里·贝克尔、罗纳德·科斯和米尔顿·弗里德曼在内的芝加哥学派经济学家的大量思想，这些思想进入了美国法官和律师的著作中。 “法律与经济”运动使法院更加理性和严谨。它还改变了法官的判决。研究发现，那些接触其想法的人更反对监管机构，不太可能执行反垄断法，并且往往会更频繁地判处监禁，时间也更长。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">经济学与法律之间的联系长期以来一直被研究。托马斯·霍布斯在 1651 年出版<i>的</i>《利维坦》中写道，经济交换体系所需的安全产权是一种法律虚构，只在现代国家中出现。 By the late 19th century, legal fields that overlapped with economics, such as matters of taxation, were being analysed by economists.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> With the arrival of the law-and-economics movement, every legal question was suddenly addressed in the context of the incentives of actors and the changes these produced. In “Crime and punishment: an economic approach” (1968), Becker argued that, rather than being a balancing-act between punishment and the opportunity for reform, sentences act mainly as a deterrent: the literal “price of crime”. Harsh sentences, he argued, reduce criminal activity in much the same way as high prices cut demand. With the caveat that a greater chance of arrest is a better deterrent than longer prison sentences, Becker&#39;s theorising has since been borne out by decades of empirical evidence.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Too steep?</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the movement&#39;s early days, “the legal academy paid little attention to our work”, recalls Guido Calabresi, a former dean of Yale Law School and another of the field&#39;s founding fathers. Two things changed this. The first was Mr Posner&#39;s bestselling textbook, in which he wrote that “it may be possible to deduce the basic formal characteristics of law itself from economic theory.” Mr Posner was a jurist, who wrote in a language familiar to other jurists. Yet he was also steeped in the economic insights of the Chicago school. His book successfully thrust the law-and-economics movement into the legal mainstream.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The second factor was a two-week programme called the Manne Economics Institute for Federal Judges, which ran from 1976 until 1998. This was funded by businesses and conservative foundations, and involved an all-expenses-paid stay at a beachside hotel in Miami. It was no holiday, however, even if those who went nicknamed the conference “Pareto in the Palms”. The curriculum was extremely demanding, taught by economists including Friedman and Paul Samuelson, both of whom had won Nobel prizes. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC471.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC471.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC471.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC471.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC471.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC471.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC471.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC471.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC471.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC471.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC471.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC471.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC471.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC471.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC471.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC471.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC471.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">By the early 1990s nearly half the federal judiciary had spent a few weeks in Miami. Those who attended included two future justices on the Supreme Court: Clarence Thomas (an arch conservative) and Ruth Bader Ginsburg (his liberal counterpart). Ginsburg would later surprise colleagues by voting with the conservative majority on antitrust cases, applying the so-called “consumer welfare standard” championed by the Manne programme. This states that a corporate merger is anticompetitive only if it raises the price or reduces the quality of goods or services. Ginsburg wrote that the instruction she received in Miami “was far more intense than the Florida sun”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In a paper under review by the <i>Quarterly Journal of Economics</i> , Elliot Ash of <small>eth</small> Zurich, Daniel Chen of Princeton University and Suresh Naidu of Columbia University treat the Manne programme as a natural experiment, comparing the decisions of every alumnus before and after their attendance at the conference. They then use an artificial-intelligence approach called “word embedding” to assess the language in judges&#39; opinions in more than a million circuit- and district- court cases.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The researchers find that federal judges were more likely to use terms such as “efficiency” and “market”, and less likely to use those such as “discharged” and “revoke”, after time spent in Miami. Manne alumni took what the authors characterised as the “conservative” stance on antitrust and other economic cases 30% more often in the years after attending. They also imposed prison sentences 5% more frequently and of 25% greater length. The effect became stronger still after 2005, when a Supreme Court decision gave federal judges greater discretion over sentencing.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That researchers are turning the unforgiving lens of economic analysis on law and economics itself is a promising trend. The dismal science has come a long way since the heyday of the Chicago school. Thanks in large part to the empiricism of behavioural economics, it is less wedded to abstractions like the perfectly rational actor. This has softened some of the Chicago school&#39;s harsher edges. But it will nevertheless take time for judges to modify their approach. As Mr Ash notes: “The Chicago school economists may all be retired or dead, but Manne alumni continue to be active members of the judiciary.” In courtrooms across America, Mr Posner&#39;s influence will live on for decades to come. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/money-talks">Money Talks</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 07 Sep 2023 10:15:29 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/qjfll7iepnmju9c7pmcof32etj7l2obo</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/09/07/how-chicago-school-economists-reshaped-american-justice </item><item><title><![CDATA[China’s slowdown is rattling Asian economies]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/067%20Finance%20and%20economics%20-%20Asian%20exposure-d563f15e12bd982673e35e22fbc0aeee.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>B</span> <small>ali, a holiday</small> destination in Indonesia,<small> </small>and Busan, a port in South Korea, are not easily confused. The former produces little industrial machinery; the latter falls short on year-round tropical weather. But the two have something in common. They are among the regions of Asia now imperilled by the less-than-impressive reopening of China&#39;s economy, and the prospect of a prolonged slowdown.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Many Asian countries benefited from Chinese growth over the past two decades, becoming entwined with the world&#39;s second-largest economy. Since China is in the midst of a real-estate slump, with property investment down 9% in the first seven months of the year, these countries now face a headache. China is less of a big buyer of their wares than it was. According to data released on September 7th, its imports dropped by 7.3% in the year to August.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the richer parts of the continent, makers of semiconductor circuits and car parts are nursing losses. South Korean exports to China fell by 20% year on year in August. On September 4th the government pledged fresh support, announcing loans for exporters worth up to 181trn won ($136bn), in addition to tax breaks and other schemes earlier in the year. Between January and July exports from Taiwan to mainland China and Hong Kong fell by 28% against a year before. Almost 10% of the country&#39;s <small>gdp</small> is driven by mainland Chinese consumption and investment, estimates Goldman Sachs, a bank.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Some exporters may hope that China&#39;s slump, which has been exacerbated by a global slowdown in sales of electronic goods, has bottomed out, since the year-on-year decline in imports has stabilised. But most do not expect a rapid turnaround. The Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry recently published a survey of 302 domestic companies that export to China. Almost four in five expected the slump to continue. Without more fulsome stimulus from the Chinese government, such low expectations are likely to be met.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In South-East Asia tourist numbers are yet to return to anything like their pre-covid levels. Thailand received just 1.8m Chinese travellers between January and July, compared with more than 11m in 2019. A new government in Bangkok last week announced it would relax visa rules to encourage Chinese visitors to return. Several countries in the region have tourism industries large enough to affect their overall balance of trade. In Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia and Thailand, tourism accounted for between 9% and 25% of total exports in 2019—before covid struck—with China the largest source of visitors to all four. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC483.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC483.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC483.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC483.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC483.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC483.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC483.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC483.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC483.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC483.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC483.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC483.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC483.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC483.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC483.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC483.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC483.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">A few Asian countries, such as India, Indonesia and the Philippines, are less exposed to the slowdown, according to Vincent Tsui of Gavekal Research. Their smaller industrial bases mean they have forged fewer Chinese connections over the past two decades. Mr Tsui believes this lower exposure accounts for the better performance of the countries&#39; currencies against the dollar this year (see chart).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even during an economic slump, not everything moves in the same direction. Thailand&#39;s exporters of durian, a pungent fruit that is inexplicably popular across much of Asia, have been recent winners. In the first seven months of the year, Chinese imports of the fruit have risen by 52%, relative to the same period last year. Thai officials credit new transport links, particularly a train line connecting Laos and China, for the boom. Sadly for the rest of Asia, not everyone is a Thai durian farmer. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/money-talks">Money Talks</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 07 Sep 2023 10:14:20 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/30uhajfhh2s6jdv5fp7kab4sbopshahk</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/09/07/chinas-slowdown-is-rattling-asian-economies</item><item><title><![CDATA[The end of a remarkable era in Indian finance]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/066%20Finance%20and%20economics%20-%20Official%20blessing-fa25a90d1437b270bfc089ab3e02f91b.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>M</span> <small>ost people</small> would go to London, New York or Hong Kong to find the world&#39;s outstanding financiers. But perhaps Mumbai deserves a look. After all, it is home to three men who rebuilt India&#39;s banking system after its enfeeblement by a wave of socialist experiments that began in the 1950s. The last of these giants, Uday Kotak, announced his retirement from Kotak Mahindra Bank on September 1st.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> First to retire, in 2020, was Aditya Puri, who left Citibank in the 1990s to create <small>hdfc</small> Bank, which is now worth almost twice as much as his former firm. Second, in June this year, was Deepak Parekh, who left Chase in the 1970s to build one valuable institution himself, in housing finance, before assisting others, including Mr Puri. Finally, Mr Kotak leaves behind an outfit that leads in areas from conventional lending and investment banking to asset management and insurance. The earliest investors in his project received unimaginable returns: a $120 stake would be worth $40m today. His company went public in 1992; its shares have since made a gain of 12,000%.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Each of the three giants played a part in recreating a dynamic private sector. The government had taken a sledgehammer to Indian finance, starting in the 1950s with the nationalisation of insurance firms, before taking over private-sector banks between 1969 and 1980. Mr Kotak began his work in 1985, not long after leaving business school. His first activity, like that of Goldman Sachs&#39;s founder Marcus Goldman, was discounting notes. Mr Kotak paid 12% for funds he lent at 16% to suppliers waiting for payment by Tata, a conglomerate, and other companies with strong credit. In 1989 he moved into automotive finance. Cars were in short supply, making them excellent collateral. Mr Kotak arranged to buy in bulk from Maruti Suzuki, the leading manufacturer, then distributed the vehicles through dealerships on the condition that they were financed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As India&#39;s economy opened up in the 1990s, Mr Kotak started new subsidiaries: investment banking for public listings, then insurance and finally commercial banking in 2003. He was not alone in seeing opportunity. Thousands of financial institutions were established in India during the 1990s only to be wiped out by the global financial crisis of 2007-09. But Mr Kotak, along with Messrs Parekh and Puri, avoided the common mistake of providing credit based on political and personal criteria, and made it through.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Kotak Mahindra&#39;s market capitalisation peaked in 2021 at $59bn. It has since dropped to $42bn, despite superb growth, profits and credit quality. The peak came just after a rule on bosses&#39; tenure was imposed by the Reserve Bank of India ( <small>rbi</small> ), which set a firm end to Mr Kotak&#39;s time in charge. (Mr Puri suffered a similar fate.) Rather than push on to the last day, Mr Kotak stepped aside a bit early, noting he had a large event to plan: his son&#39;s wedding.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The names of two candidates to succeed Mr Kotak have been submitted to the <small>rbi</small> for its blessing, as is now required. The head of the central bank, in turn, is appointed by the prime minister. Although an era of explicit financial nationalisation has ended, a quieter one has emerged. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/money-talks">Money Talks</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 07 Sep 2023 10:13:02 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/j6r4jrfl5n02k1qm3s31re6n5el6b48c</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/09/07/the-end-of-a-remarkable-era-in-indian-finance</item><item><title><![CDATA[A higher global oil price will help Russia pay for its war]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/065%20Finance%20and%20economics%20-%20Oil%20sales-1a3b75a30bd2952a4a952e9fed38319c.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>he bonanza</small> could not last for ever.

They are likely to remain sub-par. On September 5th Russia said it would extend a “voluntary” 300,000 b/d cut first announced for August to the end of 2023 (the baseline for this reduction is unclear). </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC476.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC476.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC476.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC476.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC476.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC476.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC476.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC476.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC476.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC476.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC476.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC476.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC476.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC476.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC476.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC476.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC476.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Sagging exports deprive the Kremlin of <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/04/23/russias-economy-can-withstand-a-long-war-but-not-a-more-intense-one">treasure</a> just when it wants to replenish its military arsenal. In August federal-tax revenues from crude sales dropped to $8bn, down from $10bn in July and $13bn in August last year, according to estimates by Viktor Kurilov of Rystad Energy, a consultancy (see chart). The <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/14/russia-will-struggle-to-cope-with-a-sinking-rouble">rouble</a> , which was for a long time another symbol of Russian resilience, has crashed to near 100 to the dollar, its cheapest since the invasion. Both slumps have injected urgency into Russia&#39;s efforts to earn more money from every drop of crude it pumps out. Three types of tactic feature in its new playbook.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The first—chasing higher prices for the fewer barrels it sells—has faced difficulties. Between January and August, the price of Urals, Russia&#39;s main grade of crude, averaged $59 a barrel, down from $83 in the first eight months of last year. This was mostly because of a lower global oil price, which fell from $104 to $81 over the period. But Western embargoes, which make it easier for other buyers, such as China and India, to negotiate down prices probably played a part, too. So did the <small>g</small> 7’s “price cap”, which bans Western shippers and insurers from facilitating Russian crude exports unless fuel is sold below $60 a barrel.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> More recently, though, the strategy of chasing higher prices has seen some success. Expectations of peaking interest rates in America, as well as production cuts both by Russia and Saudi Arabia, have helped lift the global oil price, which rose above $90 a barrel for the first time this year on September 5th. That benefits Russia, which has recently built a “grey” fleet of tankers—often ageing ships owned by obscure intermediaries in the Gulf, Hong Kong or Turkey—and a state-backed insurance system which insulates much of its distribution network from the price cap&#39;s effects. It is also shipping less from the Black Sea and more from its Baltic and far-eastern ports, where breaches of sanctions are harder to detect. Since mid-August Urals has been trading above $70 a barrel.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The West is unlikely to push for stricter enforcement of its price cap: it wants to keep Russian oil flowing to avoid supply shortfalls later this year if the global economy rebounds. Therefore gains in the price of Urals look secure, even if it will be difficult to persuade customers to accept smaller discounts relative to the global oil price. India insists that the rising price of Urals has eroded the grade&#39;s competitive edge, especially compared with Gulf crude. This is a little disingenuous. Urals continues to trade at a solid $7 rebate to the cheapest grade of Saudi crude, reckons Kpler, a data firm, despite being a superior blend. India&#39;s obduracy hints that it probably has the upper hand in talks.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As Russia sells less crude, it is also trying to sell more of its premium refined oil—its second tactic for keeping proceeds afloat. To do so, it can process more crude through its refineries by mobilising idle capacity, which Kpler estimates at 10% of the total. Analysts reckon it will postpone much of the maintenance scheduled for this month to autumn next year. And it is maximising yields of diesel, a highly profitable product, to the detriment of jet fuel. In August the country exported more such “clean” products than during the same month in any of the past six years.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The third way that Russia is trying to compensate for lower crude shipments is by developing new channels to distribute its oil. Exporters are discreetly cranking up piped flows to those European countries that still can, and do, buy Russian oil: namely, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Analysts expect this to continue until 2025, by when the Czech pipeline operator should have capacity to take more crude from a conduit linking it to Italy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Russia is also starting to send more cargoes through the Arctic, which could cut the cost of shipments to China. The route is 30-45% shorter than those departing from the Baltic and Barents seas. Kpler data show an eight-fold rise in Russian crude tankers using this path in 2023. Navigating the Arctic is possible only in the summer and early autumn but Russia, betting on global warming, is targeting year-round sailing by 2025. That may come too late to support the war effort. Much of what will decide Russia&#39;s export receipts in the interim—starting with the state of the global economy—remains beyond its control. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/money-talks">Money Talks</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Sep 2023 16:50:08 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/rr2mjas9ecst8qptalv93vumh3cjg6nq</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/09/06/a-higher-global-oil-price-will-help-russia-pay-for-its-war </item><item><title><![CDATA[The $100trn battle for the world’s wealthiest people]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/063%20Finance%20and%20economics%20-%20Life%20of%20luxury-5a95ff1f180adb20ff6370dfe4f188c1.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>he</small> ü <small>ber-rich</small> hire all kinds of people to make their lives easier. Landscapers maintain gardens, housekeepers tidy homes, nannies raise children. Yet perhaps no role is as important as that of the wealth manager, who is hired to protect capital.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These advisers are scattered across the globe in cities like Geneva and New York, and are employed as fiduciaries, meaning they are required to act in the interest of their clients. As such, they are privy to the intimate lives of the rich and famous, who must expose their secrets so advice may be offered on, say, the inheritance of a child born of an extramarital affair. Advisers also help families allocate investments, stash cash in boltholes, minimise tax bills, plan to retire, arrange to pass down wealth and satisfy unusual wishes. A Singapore-based manager recalls being told to invest a “double-digit” percentage of a family&#39;s wealth in “bloodstock horses”—steeds bred especially for racing—a term he hurriedly looked up after the meeting.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For decades wealth management was a niche service, looked down upon by the rest of finance. Now it is perhaps the most attractive business in the industry. Capital and liquidity requirements set after the global financial crisis of 2007-09 have made running balance-sheet-heavy businesses, such as lending or trading, difficult and expensive. By comparison, doling out wealth advice requires almost no capital. Margins for firms that achieve scale are typically around 25%. Clients are loyal, meaning that revenues are predictable. Competition has crushed profits in other formerly lucrative asset-management businesses, such as mutual funds. And whereas the pools of assets managed by BlackRock and Vanguard, the index- and exchange-traded-fund giants, are huge, they collect a fraction of a penny on every dollar invested. A standard fee for a wealth manager is 1% of a client&#39;s assets, annually.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Wealth management is all the more appealing because of how quickly it is expanding. The world economy has grown at a decent enough clip over the past two decades, at more than 3% a year. Yet it has been left in the dust by growth in wealth. Between 2000 and 2020 the total stock rose from $160trn, or four times global output, to $510trn, or six times output. Although much of this wealth is tied up in property and other assets, the pool of liquid assets is still vast, making up a quarter of the total. Bain, a consultancy, estimates that the pool will expand from just over $130trn to almost $230trn by 2030—meaning that a $100trn prize is up for grabs. They expect the boom to help lift global wealth-management revenues from $255bn to $510bn.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It will be fuelled by geography, demography and technology. The biggest managers are attempting to cover ever more of the globe as dynastic wealth is created in new markets. Baby-boomers are the last generation that can rely on defined-benefit pensions for their retirement; more people will have to take decisions about how their own wealth will support them. Meanwhile, software is streamlining the bureaucracy that once waylaid wealth managers, enabling them to serve more clients at lower cost, and helping firms automate the acquisition of new ones. These gains will allow big banks to serve the merely rich as well as the über-wealthy. Firms are already climbing down the rungs of the wealth ladder, from ultra-high-net-worth and high-net-worth clients, who have millions of dollars to invest, into the lives of those with just $100,000 or so.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Markus Habbel of Bain sees a comparison to the booming luxury-goods industry. Handbags were once prized for their exclusivity as much as their appearance, but have become ubiquitous on social media, with influencers touting Bottega Veneta pouches and Hermès bags. “Think about Louis Vuitton or Gucci. They have basically the same clients as [wealth managers] target and they increased from 40m [customers] 40 years ago to 400m now,” he notes. Upper-crust buyers have not been put off.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Which firms will grab the $100trn prize? For the moment, wealth management is fragmented. Local banks, such as <small>btg</small> in Brazil, have large shares of domestic markets. Regional champions dominate in hubs, including Bank of Singapore and <small>dbs</small> in Asia. In America the masses are served by specialist firms such as Edward Jones, a retail-wealth-management outfit in which advisers are paid based on commissions for selling funds. Only a handful of institutions compete on a truly global scale. These include Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. But the two biggest are Morgan Stanley and a new-look <small>ubs</small> , which has just absorbed Credit Suisse, its old domestic rival. After acquiring a handful of smaller wealth-management firms over the past decade, Morgan Stanley now oversees around $6trn in wealth assets. Following its merger, <small>ubs</small> now oversees $5.5trn.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This patchwork is unlikely to last. “The industry is heading in a winner-takes-all direction,” predicts Mr Habbel, as it becomes “very much about scale, about technology and about global reach”. Jennifer Piepszak, an executive at JPMorgan, has reported that her firm&#39;s takeover of First Republic, a bank for the well-heeled that failed in May, represents a “meaningful acceleration” of its wealth-management ambitions. Citigroup has poached Andy Sieg, head of wealth management at Bank of America, in an effort to revamp its offering. In 2021 Vanguard purchased “Just Invest”, a wealth-technology company.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>ubs</small> and Morgan Stanley have grander ambitions. The firms&#39; strategies reflect their contrasting backgrounds, and may in time produce a clash. Morgan Stanley competes globally but dominates in America, and is focusing on wealth services for the masses, as shown by its purchase in 2020 of <small>e</small> * <small>trade</small> , a brokerage platform. James Gorman, the bank&#39;s boss, has said that if the firm keeps increasing new assets by around 5% a year, its current growth rate, it would oversee $20trn in a decade or so. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC469.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC469.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC469.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC469.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC469.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC469.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC469.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC469.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC469.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC469.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC469.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC469.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC469.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC469.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC469.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC469.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC469.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">This may be possible thanks to Morgan Stanley&#39;s existing scale. In 2009 the bank agreed to acquire Smith Barney, Citi&#39;s wealth-management arm, for $13.5bn, which helped boost margins to the low teens from 2% or so in the years before the financial crisis. Today they are around 27%, reflecting the use of tech to move into advising the merely rich. Andy Saperstein, head of the wealth-management division, points to the acquisition of Solium, a small stock-plan-administration firm, which Morgan Stanley purchased for just $900m in 2019, as crucial for building a strong client-referral machine. “No one was looking at the stock-plan-administration companies because they didn&#39;t make any money,” he says. But these firms “had access to a huge customer base and [clients] were constantly checking to see when the equity was going to vest, what it was worth and when they would have access to it.”</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Swiss role</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <small>ubs</small> is employing a more old-school approach, albeit with a global twist. Having taken over its domestic rival, the Swiss bank has a once-in-a-generation chance to cement a lead in places where Credit Suisse flourished, such as Brazil and South-East Asia. Deft execution of the merger would make the firm a front-runner in almost every corner of the globe. Thus, for now at least, the new-look <small>ubs</small> will focus more on geographic breadth than the merely rich.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In differing ways, both Morgan Stanley and <small>ubs</small> are seeking even greater scale. When clients hire a wealth manager they tend to want one of two things. Sometimes it is help with a decision “when the cost of making a bad choice is high”, says Mr Saperstein, such as working out how to save for retirement or a child&#39;s education. Other times it is something exclusively available, such as access to investments unobtainable through a regular brokerage account. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC424.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC424.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC424.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC424.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC424.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC424.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC424.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC424.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC424.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC424.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC424.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC424.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC424.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC424.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC424.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC424.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230909_FNC424.png"><figcaption class="css-18w36g1 edweubf2"><span class="css-6pzdis edweubf1">图片：经济学人</span></figcaption></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">Being able to offer clients access to private funds or assets will probably become increasingly important for wealth managers. Joan Solotar of Blackstone, a private-equity giant, says that a quarter of the firm&#39;s assets already come from individuals, and most arrive via big banks. Greater scale for wealth managers means greater bargaining power when negotiating with private-markets firms to secure exclusive deals, such as private funds for customers or lower fees. Younger generations, which will soon be inheriting wealth, are expected to demand more environmentally and socially conscious options, including those that do not just screen out oil companies, but focus on investing in, say, clean energy. A decade ago a client would tend to follow their wealth adviser if he or she moved to a new firm. Exclusive funds make such a switch more difficult.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The winner-takes-all trend may be accelerated by artificial intelligence ( <small>ai</small> ), on which bigger firms with bigger tech budgets already have a head-start. <small>ai</small> could be used to create three kinds of tool. The first would take a firm&#39;s proprietary information, such as asset-allocation recommendations or research reports, and spit out information that advisers can use to help their clients. Attempts to build such tools are common, since they are the easiest to produce and pose few regulatory issues.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The second type of tool would be trained on client information rather than companies&#39; proprietary data, perhaps even listening in on conversations between advisers and clients. Such a tool could then summarise information and create automatic actions for advisers, reminding them to send details to clients or follow up about certain issues. The third kind of tool is the most aspirational. It would be an execution tool, which would allow advisers to speak aloud requests, such as purchasing units in a fund or carrying out a foreign-exchange transaction, and have a firm&#39;s systems automatically execute that transaction on their behalf, saving time.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It will take money to make money, then. The biggest wealth managers already have hefty margins, access to products their clients want and a head start on the tech that might put them even further ahead. “We are a growth company now,” claims Mr Saperstein of Morgan Stanley, a sentence that has rarely been uttered about a bank in the past 15 years. “We are just getting started.”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet the two giants are both going through periods of transition. <small>ubs</small> has barely begun the open-heart surgery that is required when merging two large banks. Meanwhile, Mr Gorman, the architect of Morgan Stanley&#39;s wealth strategy, will retire some time in the next nine months. The succession race between Mr Saperstein, Ted Pick and Dan Simkowitz, two other executives, is already under way. Either firm could falter. Although the two are chasing different strategies, it is surely only a matter of time before they clash. <small>ubs</small> is on an American hiring spree; Morgan Stanley is eyeing expansion in some global markets, including Japan.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> And despite the advantages offered by scale, smaller firms will be hard to dislodge entirely. Lots of different types of outfit have a foothold, from customer-directed brokerage platforms, like Charles Schwab, which also offer their richest customers advice from a fiduciary, to asset-management firms, such as Fidelity and Vanguard, which have millions of customers who might seek advice. “Back in the day, when our programme was started, it was focused on how you help people manage their wealth using mutual funds. But the business has evolved,” says Rich Compson of Fidelity. The firm&#39;s wealth arm, which oversees $1.8trn, also offers advice on ways to use individual securities, exchange-traded funds and alternative investments.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> When Willie Sutton, a dapper thief also known as Slick Willie who died in 1980, was asked why he robbed banks, he replied that it was “because that&#39;s where the money is”. The aphorism helps explain strategy on Wall Street, as firms race to take advantage of the $100trn opportunity in wealth management. Once the business was a sleepy, unsophisticated corner of finance. Now it is the industry&#39;s future. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/money-talks">Money Talks</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Sep 2023 20:03:08 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/2jg7jbi0223vhm0ecb1t0cf95c3vodtv</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/09/05/the-100trn-battle-for-the-worlds-wealthiest-people</item><item><title><![CDATA[Germany’s economic model is sputtering.

Another ingredient is less renowned but no less fundamental: the country&#39;s banks, many regionally focused, provide long-term funding to Mittelstand companies nice and cheaply.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Unfortunately, this model is no longer delivering: German growth is forecast by the <small>imf</small> to be the lowest of any <small>g</small> 7 member this year. And the country&#39;s banks are struggling, too. The European Banking Authority estimates that in the first three months of 2023 their weighted-average return on equity, a measure of profitability, was 6.5%, compared with 10.4% across the <small>eu</small> . In 2020 banks in eight countries in the <small>eu</small> offered worse returns than German lenders. In the first three months of this year only those in Luxembourg did.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In part, this poor performance reflects quirks of the German market. The country&#39;s banks are unusually keen on making fixed-rate loans, which has limited their ability to profit from higher interest rates. Their net interest margin—what a bank collects on loans minus what it pays for funding—has grown by just 0.1 percentage points since June 2020, half the <small>eu</small> average.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet there are also deeper issues at play. German lenders are unusually structured, coming in three categories: private-sector lenders, including Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank; public banks, including 361 savings banks and five Landesbanken, which act as wholesale banks for the savings banks; and 737 co-operatives.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Non-private lenders, which hold 57% of banking-sector assets, are conservative outfits with goals besides profits, such as supporting local firms. Many public banks have politicians as chairs or board members. This politicised governance brings poor risk management, says Nicolas Véron of Bruegel, a think-tank. Lots are highly exposed to property, for instance, leaving them vulnerable to recent price falls.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Public banks and co-operatives also operate on a “regional principle” that bars them from seeking business in one another&#39;s territory. They form networks, with the biggest possessing more assets than any single European bank, allowing them to share costs and reducing the amount of capital with which they are required to fund themselves. As a result, margins for private-sector banks are squeezed, making it hard for them to compete with other institutions. Deutsche Bank&#39;s price-to-book ratio languishes at 0.3, about half that of <small>bnp</small> Paribas, a French rival.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Germany&#39;s unusual financial system is well-suited to supporting regional companies. It is rather less well-suited to supporting riskier business (say, startups needed for the green transition or digitisation) that require funding from capital markets alongside more traditional forms of finance. Although German politicians and policymakers are engaged in a lively debate about the country&#39;s economic future, discussion of its financial institutions has yet to feature prominently. Perhaps the country&#39;s banks are simply too much of a fixture to be questioned. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/money-talks">Money Talks</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 31 Aug 2023 10:21:34 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/g7nulu8ddrv1n6p1cceqb73vgnddgsrk</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/31/germanys-economic-model-is-sputtering-so-are-its-banks </item><item><title><![CDATA[Europe’s economy looks to be heading for trouble]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/065%20Finance%20and%20economics%20-%20Recession%20watch-eabd3f20e6343c05861ac70fbb678696.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>E</span> <small>urope&#39;s summer</small> was a strange mixture of heavy rainfall and wildfires. The continent&#39;s economy was also plagued by extremes. Inflation remained hot: prices rose by 5.3% in August compared with a year earlier. And officials are increasingly worried by the cloudy growth outlook. A recent drop in the purchasing managers&#39; index ( <small>pmi</small> ) suggests the bloc is facing recession.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Ahead of the next meeting of the European Central Bank ( <small>ecb</small> ) on September 14th, policymakers will be worried by the possible emergence of stagflation (a situation in which low growth is paired with entrenched inflation). Christine Lagarde, the central bank&#39;s president, recently reiterated her commitment to bringing down inflation and setting interest rates at “sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary to achieve a timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target”. In plain English: the <small>ecb</small> would much prefer a “hard landing”, featuring economic pain, to failing to reduce price rises. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FNC394.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FNC394.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FNC394.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FNC394.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FNC394.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FNC394.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FNC394.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FNC394.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FNC394.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FNC394.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FNC394.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FNC394.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FNC394.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FNC394.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FNC394.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FNC394.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230902_FNC394.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The problem is that the <small>ecb</small> risks crashing the plane. Euro-zone inflation is proving as stubborn as the American variety. In Europe, price rises were sparked by increasing energy costs; in America, they were more demand-driven. But in both places inflation has followed a similar path, with Europe slightly behind. Now the question is whether core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, will come in to land. So far, it is staying stubbornly high (see chart).</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This is in part because Europe has, like America, so far managed to dodge recession. At the end of last year, when many expected a European downturn, monetary tightening had yet to hit the economy and national governments offered generous handouts in order to counteract the energy shock. The service sector showed decent growth, and industrial order books remained full from the post-covid boom.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Gloom is now spreading across the continent. The global economy is weakening, and order books have plenty of blank pages. State support for households is also running out. Retail energy prices remain higher than before last year&#39;s crisis; real incomes have yet to recover. Activity in the service industry contracted in August, according to the <small>pmi</small> survey. The sector is at its weakest in two and a half years.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Higher interest rates have also started to affect the European economy, as intended by the <small>ecb</small> ’s policymakers. Construction, which is traditionally sensitive to interest rates, is feeling the pain. Stingier bank lending is leading to a 0.4 percentage-point reduction in <small>gdp</small> growth each quarter, according to Goldman Sachs, a bank. Corporate insolvencies rose by more than 8% in the year&#39;s second quarter, compared with the first, and have reached their highest since 2015. The impact of tighter monetary policy will peak in the second half of this year, predicts Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics, a consultancy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> A hard landing is thus almost guaranteed. But the return of inflation to the <small>ecb</small> ’s 2% target remains some way off. Two forces are pulling prices in different directions. One is the situation in the labour market. Unemployment remains at a record low. Although firms are hiring fewer workers, there is no imminent danger of mass lay-offs—in part because bosses want to hold on to workers that are increasingly scarce in an ageing continent. As a result, wages across the bloc are rising, even if not by enough to make up for earlier inflation.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The other force, which is pulling down inflation, is weakening demand for goods and services. During the covid pandemic, price growth took off in advance of wage growth, causing companies&#39; profits to rise strongly alongside inflation. If companies now find that demand is drying up, it is possible that inflation will fall at the same time as wage growth stays high, bringing profits back down. Indeed, prices on wholesale markets for goods are already falling fast, and import prices are also declining. At some point, these lower prices will be passed on to consumers.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Which of these two forces will win out? At the moment, it looks like the answer will be weak demand, since it has spread to the service sector, too. This suggests that euro-zone inflation might fall in relatively short order. But the <small>ecb</small> appears unconvinced, and seems ready to lift its main rate to 4.5% from 4.25%.
