class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>德国</span><small>的经济</small>模式以老板和工会之间的密切关系而闻名。中小型企业，该国世界领先的制造企业；以及广泛传播繁荣的联邦制政治制度。另一个因素不太出名，但同样重要：该国的银行（其中许多银行专注于区域性业务）为中小型企业提供优质且廉价的长期融资。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">不幸的是，这种模式不再有效：国际货币基金组织<small>预测</small>德国今年的经济增长将是<small>七国集团</small>成员中最低的。该国的银行也陷入困境。欧洲银行管理局估计，2023 年前三个月，其加权平均股本回报率（衡量盈利能力的指标）为 6.5%，而整个<small>欧盟</small>的这一比例为 10.4%。 2020 年，<small>欧盟</small>八个国家的银行提供的回报率低于德国银行。今年前三个月，只有卢森堡的企业这样做了。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在某种程度上，这种糟糕的表现反映了德国市场的怪癖。该国的银行异常热衷于发放固定利率贷款，这限制了它们从高利率中获利的能力。自 2020 年 6 月以来，它们的净息差（银行收取的贷款减去融资费用）仅增长了 0.1 个百分点，是<small>欧盟</small>平均水平的一半。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，还有更深层次的问题在起作用。德国贷款机构的结构不同寻常，分为三类：私营部门贷款机构，包括德国商业银行和德意志银行；公共银行，包括 361 家储蓄银行和 5 家作为储蓄银行批发银行的 Landesbanken；合作社737家。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">非私人贷款机构持有银行业 57% 的资产，是保守机构，其目标除了利润之外，还包括支持当地企业。许多公共银行都有政治家担任主席或董事会成员。智库布鲁盖尔的尼古拉斯·韦隆表示，这种政治化的治理带来了糟糕的风险管理。例如，许多地段对房地产的风险敞口很大，因此很容易受到近期价格下跌的影响。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">公共银行和合作社还按照“区域原则”运作，禁止它们在彼此的领土上寻求业务。它们形成网络，其中最大的银行拥有比任何一家欧洲银行都多的资产，使它们能够分担成本并减少它们为自己提供资金所需的资本量。结果，私营银行的利润受到挤压，使其难以与其他机构竞争。德意志银行的市净率徘徊在0.3，约为法国竞争对手<small>法国</small>巴黎银行的一半。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">德国独特的金融体系非常适合支持地区性公司。它不太适合支持风险较高的业务（例如，绿色转型或数字化所需的初创企业），这些业务需要资本市场的资金以及更传统的融资形式。尽管德国政治家和政策制定者就该国的经济未来展开了激烈的辩论，但有关其金融机构的讨论尚未占据显着位置。也许该国的银行实在是太固定了，不容质疑。 <span

e190yofl0">问题是<small>欧洲央行</small>面临着飞机坠毁的风险。事实证明，欧元区的通胀与美国的通胀一样顽固。在欧洲，能源成本上涨引发了价格上涨；在美国，他们更受需求驱动。但这两个地方的通胀都遵循类似的路径，欧洲略为落后。现在的问题是，排除波动性的能源和食品价格的核心通胀是否会下降。到目前为止，它仍然顽固地保持在高位（见图表）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">部分原因是欧洲和美国一样，迄今为止已经成功避免了经济衰退。去年年底，当许多人预计欧洲经济将陷入低迷时，货币紧缩尚未对经济造成影响，各国政府提供了慷慨的援助以应对能源冲击。服务业呈现出良好的增长势头，工业订单在后疫情时期的繁荣中依然饱满。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">忧郁情绪正在整个大陆蔓延。全球经济正在疲软，订单簿上有大量空白页。国家对家庭的支持也即将耗尽。能源零售价格仍高于去年危机前；实际收入尚未恢复。根据采购经理人指数<small>(PMI)</small>调查，8 月份服务业活动萎缩。该行业正处于两年半以来的最低水平。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">正如<small>欧洲央行</small>政策制定者所希望的那样，更高的利率也开始影响欧洲经济。传统上对利率敏感的建筑业也感受到了痛苦。高盛银行 (Goldman Sachs) 表示，吝啬的银行贷款导致每个季度<small>GDP</small>增速下降 0.4 个百分点。与第一季度相比，今年第二季度企业破产率增加了8%以上，达到2015年以来的最高水平。牛津经济研究院的奥利弗·拉考（Oliver Rakau）预测，紧缩货币政策的影响将在今年下半年达到顶峰，一家咨询公司。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">因此，硬着陆几乎是板上钉钉的事情。但通胀率回到<small>欧洲央行</small>2% 的目标仍有一段路要走。两种力量正在将价格推向不同的方向。一是劳动力市场的情况。失业率仍处于历史低位。尽管企业雇用的工人数量减少，但大规模裁员的迫在眉睫的危险并不存在——部分原因是老板们希望留住在老龄化大陆上日益稀缺的工人。结果，整个欧元区的工资都在上涨，尽管涨幅不足以弥补之前的通胀。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">拉低通胀的另一股力量正在削弱对商品和服务的需求。在新冠疫情期间，物价增长先于工资增长，导致企业利润随着通货膨胀而强劲增长。如果企业现在发现需求正在枯竭，那么通货膨胀可能会在工资增长保持高位的同时下降，从而导致利润回落。事实上，商品批发市场的价格已经在快速下降，进口价格也在下降。在某些时候，这些较低的价格将转嫁给消费者。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这两种力量谁会胜出呢？目前，答案似乎是需求疲软，因为它也蔓延到了服务业。这表明欧元区通胀可能会在相对较短的时间内下降。但<small>欧洲央行</small>似乎并不相信，并似乎准备将主要利率从 4.25% 提高至 4.5%。政策制定者最好保持利率稳定，以便他们能够评估崩盘的危险。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>世界</span><small>公共</small>财政看起来越来越不稳定。截至 7 月份的一年中，美国联邦政府借入了 2.3 兆美元，占<small>GDP</small>的 8.6%——这种赤字在经济灾难期间通常会出现。根据<small>国际货币基金组织</small>的预测，到 2025 年，<small>七国集团</small>富裕国家中的五个国家的净债务与<small>GDP</small>之比将超过 100%。在 2010 年代的低利率时代，此类债务可能是可持续的。但那些日子早已一去不复返了。本月，十年期国债收益率一度触及 4.3%，为 2007-09 年全球金融危机爆发以来的最高水平。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">政府将如何减轻这些负担？经济学家越来越关注这个问题。国际货币基金组织的 Serkan Arslanalp 和加州<small>大学</small>伯克利分校的 Barry Eichengreen 最近在 8 月 26 日于怀俄明州杰克逊霍尔举行的美国年度货币政策盛会上发表了一篇论文，列出了一系列选项。这并不完全是一种令人胃口大开的东西。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">大型经济体以前也曾背负过巨额债务。一般来说，他们通过采用两种策略之一来处理这些问题。称它们为严肃的和算术的。紧缩的方法是维持基本盈余（即债务利息支付之前的盈余）。 1820年代，拿破仑战争结束后，英国的债务几乎达到<small>GDP</small>的200%；普法战争使法国在 1870 年代负债了近 100% 的<small>GDP</small> 。此前，艾兴格林先生和合著者发现，1822 年至 1913 年间，英国的基本盈余足以将债务与<small>GDP 的</small>比率降低 180 个百分点以上； 1896 年之后的短短 17 年里，法国就将这一比例降低了 100 个百分点。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">阿尔斯拉纳尔普和艾肯格林对民主国家今天重蹈覆辙的前景感到悲观。在 19 世纪，福利国家的规模非常小。英国政治家遵循维多利亚时代“健全金融”的哲学；法国人寻求减少债务，以便为下一场战争做好准备。相比之下，现代福利国家受到人口老龄化的压力，而对更多国防支出和绿色投资的需求意味着国家规模不断扩大。政客们可以提高税收。但<small>国际货币基金组织</small>的其他研究发现，在发达经济体中，从1979年到2021年，如果财政整顿是通过增税而不是削减支出来推动，那么在削减债务方面不太可能成功，这或许是因为提高税收会损害经济增长。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">算术方法又如何呢？这是第二次世界大战后许多国家所走的道路，当时美国的债务达到<small>GDP 的 106%（</small>他们很快就会超过这个水平）。它涉及经济增长率超过通货膨胀调整后的利率，使得遗留债务相对于<small>GDP</small>随着时间的推移而减少，基本盈余也随之减少。可以说，最近的高通货膨胀率已经启动了世界经济算术债务削减路线。事实上，发达经济体的净债务在 2020 年 covid-19 来袭时飙升后，已下降了约 4 个百分点。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，通货膨胀只会在意想不到的情况下减少债务。如果债券持有人预期价格会快速上涨，他们就会要求更高的回报，从而推高政府的利息支出。第二次世界大战后持续的通货膨胀之所以有所帮助，只是因为政策制定者通过一项称为金融抑制的政策压低了名义债券收益率。 1951 年之前，美联储通过发行货币购买债券来限制长期利率。后来禁止支付银行存款利息将把储蓄转向债券市场。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">由此产生的低实际利率与战后的快速增长相伴。 1945 年至 1975 年间，富裕国家的债务与<small>GDP</small>之比加权平均降低了 80 个百分点。等式两边都很重要。每个人都同意增长是可取的——Arslanalp 和 Eichengreen 先生写道，这是“解决债务问题的无痛方法”，这一时期富裕国家的平均年增长率为 4.5%。但高增长通常会提高实际利率。约翰·霍普金斯大学的朱利安·阿卡林 (Julien Acalin) 和劳伦斯·鲍尔 (Laurence Ball) 撰写的另一份工作论文发现，如果实际利率不失真且基本预算平衡，1974 年美国债务与<small>GDP 的</small>比率将下降至仅 74%，而不是 1974 年的 74%。实际数字为23%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">除非人工智能或其他技术突破带来生产力增长的阶跃变化，否则今天的老龄化经济体不可能达到战后的扩张速度。预计未来十年美国的<small>GDP</small>将以每年 2% 的速度增长。这立即限制了算术策略，将责任归咎于实际利率。有充分的理由预期利率会“自然”低，例如随着社会老龄化，储蓄会增加。但正如近期长期债券收益率的上升所表明的那样，投资者似乎对此心存疑虑。要降低实际利率，金融抑制和高通胀需要进行彻底的改变，例如央行放弃通胀目标，以及逆转 20 世纪末发生的金融自由化。</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0">最坏的最好的</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">那么，会发生什么呢？ “政府将不得不承受高额的继承债务，”阿尔斯拉纳尔普和艾兴格林先生认为。政治家能做的最好的事情就是不要让糟糕的情况变得更糟。然而债务的持续积累表明政客们不太可能采纳这一建议。按照目前的路径，美国将在 2030 年追平其战后记录，即利息支出占<small>GDP</small>的 3.2%。二十年后，这一数字将超过 6%。如果同时发生另一场流行病或重大战争，费用可能会更高。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">无论选民和政客似乎不太可能愿意容忍基本盈余、持续的通货膨胀或金融抑制，他们很可能会达到同样不愿意忍受将大量税收收入移交给债券持有人的地步。到那时，政治约束将会放松，债券市场危机的危险将会上升。这样一来，债务削减菜单就不会显得那么令人难以接受了。 <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs

e190yofl0">尽管房地产通常是对利率最敏感的行业之一，但美国的情况却并非如此简单。随着美联储在过去两年变得强硬，抵押贷款利率飙升，从不到3%升至7%以上。根据全国房地产经纪人协会的数据，对于购买中位住房的中位家庭来说，抵押贷款支付额从 2020 年占家庭月收入的约 14% 翻了一番，达到 6 月份的近 29%，为 1985 年以来的最高水平（见图表）。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">令人惊讶的是，抵押贷款利率的上涨并没有导致房价下跌。随着利率开始上升，它们短暂下跌，但在新冠时代的刺激措施席卷整个经济之后，它们又反弹至去年初创下的历史新高。 8月29日公布的数据显示，这种反弹可能正在增强：根据美国房价基准<small>标准普尔</small><small>凯斯</small>希勒指数，今年第二季度房价年化增长率为15%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">如何解释这种令人印象深刻的恢复力？对于美国房地产市场的规模——年销售额约为 2 万亿美元，分散在整个大陆规模的经济体中，其中一些地区正在蓬勃发展，而另一些地区则在萎缩——不可避免地会有一个微妙的答案。然而，美国最大的住宅建筑商之一托尔兄弟公司 (Toll Brothers) 的首席执行官道格拉斯·耶尔利 (Douglas Yearley) 在 8 月底的财报电话会议上给出了一份很好的总结。 “仍然有买家。他们的选择很少，”他解释道。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">尽管随着利率上升，房屋需求下降，但房产供应几乎同步下降。购房者通常获得 30 年的固定利率抵押贷款——这在大多数国家闻所未闻，但在美国几乎被视为一项宪法权利，因为房利美和房地美这两家政府支持的大型公司从贷方购买抵押贷款。并将它们证券化。在使贷款人能够提供长期固定利率的过程中，他们的目标是让人们更容易购房。但现在长期利率成为了一个障碍，因为在美联储加息之前获得低息抵押贷款的房主不想放弃它们，因此不愿意出售房屋。房地产平台 Redfin 计算得出，82% 的房主抵押贷款利率低于 5%。富国银行的查理·多尔蒂 (Charlie Dougherty) 将这一结果称为房地产市场的“假死状态”。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">在其他条件相同的情况下，交易量的下降应该会损害经济，抑制与住房相关的活动，导致用于改建、新建、家具等的资金减少。然而，事情的发展却并非如此。由于无法换到更好的住处，锁定的房主不得不投入更多资金来修缮现有房屋。远程工作的兴起强化了这一趋势，人们在家里增加了额外的办公空间。根据哈佛大学住房研究联合中心的数据，2022 年的改建支出将达到近 5700 亿美元，约占<small>GDP</small>的 2%，较 2019 年名义增长 40%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">许多冒着市场购买房屋的人选择了新建房屋，而不是现有的房屋。新建房屋的优点之一是它们实际上是可用的。根据全国住宅建筑商协会的数据，这意味着它们约占今年活跃挂牌房屋的三分之一，高于 covid-19 大流行前二十年的平均 13%。正如 Redfin 的达里尔·费尔韦瑟 (Daryl Fairweather) 所说：“建筑商正在受益，因为他们没有来自现有房主的竞争。”</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">房屋建筑商也大胆地向买家提供激励措施。最引人注目的是，他们通过预先支付一次性费用来“降低”抵押贷款利率高达 1.5 个百分点，从而减少未来的利息支付。这使得他们的内部抵押贷款公司能够提供大约 5% 的利率。对于房屋建筑商来说，这些收购相当于将售价降低约 6%，鉴于其资产负债表的实力，他们可以轻松负担得起。对于买家来说，较低的抵押贷款利率在当前环境下是受欢迎的缓解措施，这已转化为购买和建设的回升。单户住宅的新开工量在去年年底触底。 7 月开工率较去年同期增长近 10%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">房地产类型现在想知道价格弹性是否会持续。随着抵押贷款利率进一步攀升，市场面临考验。在过去一年的大部分时间里，利率似乎稳定在 6.5% 左右，但自 8 月初以来，投资者得出结论，美联储将在更长时间内保持紧缩政策，这将抵押贷款利率推向 7.5%。 “利率越高，需求下降就越多。这将很快赶上房屋建筑商的步伐，”房地产顾问约翰·伯恩斯 (John Burns) 认为。为了应对经济放缓，一些贷方可能会提供风险更高的交易。房地产平台 Zillow 已开始在亚利桑那州这个曾经炙手可热的市场上推出仅 1% 的房屋首付。如果价格下跌，房屋净值很少的业主可能会首先违约。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">然而，如果房地产市场保持弹性，美联储的政策制定者将面临考验。强劲的房地产市场活动导致经济过热。价格持续反弹也将使通胀前景变得复杂。这种关系并不完全简单，因为房地产在通胀指数中是以租金而非购买价格的形式体现的。此外，主要通胀指标往往落后于高频租金指标至少六个月。这些指标在过去一年的大部分时间里都在下降，而且这种下降目前刚刚渗透到官方通胀指数中——这一过程可能会持续到 2024 年初。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">此后会发生什么就不太确定了。一方面，目前正在建设的公寓单元数量创历史新高，这种供应应该会抑制租金。另一方面，住房负担不起正迫使更多潜在买家进入租赁市场，这可能会推高租金并加剧通货膨胀。一件大事是明确的：在利率回落之前，数百万美国人别无选择，只能推迟他们的住房梦想。 <span

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"><span>探究</span><small>童话</small>故事通常并不是投资者时间的最佳利用<small>方式</small>。但可能有一个例外。 “金发姑娘和三只熊”的内在逻辑，以及经济对金融市场来说“恰到好处”的想法，值得检验。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">今年早些时候，由于利率上升，美国经济衰退似乎不可避免，这一前景引发了整个金融界的讨论。现在，随着通胀迅速下降， <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/23/americas-astonishing-economic-growth-goes-up-another-gear">经济增长</a>看起来强劲，美联储至少放慢了加息步伐，人们谈论的不再是“金发姑娘”的情况：经济既不太热（通胀飙升）也不太热。寒冷（失业率高得令人不快）。随着经济形势变得更加光明，美国政府债券的收益率也不断走高。十年期国债收益率目前为 4.2%，高于年初的 3.8%。根据通胀预期调整后的实际收益率达到 2009 年以来的最高水平。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">它们不太可能很快下跌。除了强劲的增长数据（一项受到密切关注的估计表明美国经济可能以近 6% 的速度增长）之外，基本供给和需求也呈上升趋势。截至 7 月份的一年里，政府的赤字几乎占<small>GDP</small>的 9%，这一较高水平预计将持续下去。与此同时，自去年夏天以来，美联储已允许其资产负债表上约 7,650 亿美元的美国国债到期且无需更换。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">最近的利好经济消息对金融前景的影响并不如预期的乐观。事实上，各个市场已经受到收益率上升的挤压，从而威胁到金融稳定。天价的债券收益率意味着相当大的财务困境正在酝酿之中，尽管这种困境尚未显现出来。随着每一项强劲的经济数据的出现，这种威胁也在加剧。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">考虑商业地产。据房地产经纪公司高力国际 (Colliers) 统计，今年年中美国写字楼空置率达到 16.4%，高于 2007-09 年全球金融危机后创下的最高纪录。根深蒂固的在家工作习惯和不断上升的利率相结合，对办公楼业主来说是残酷的。研究公司凯投宏观预测，到明年年底，价格将再下跌 15%，其中西海岸受到的打击尤其严重。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">即使经济进一步好转，商业地产业主面临的情况也可能会恶化。额外增长一两个百分点只会带来很少的租户。但由此带来的利率上升将给企业带来压力，这些企业无法为在covid-19大流行期间以低利率积累的债务进行再融资。物业服务公司 Newmark 确定，问题商业地产债务的到期期限为 6,260 亿美元，其中借款人的优先债务价值相当于房地产价值的 80% 或更多，这些债务将于 2023 年至 2025 年期间到期如果债券市场不放松，很多公司就会碰壁。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">商业地产的问题可能会蔓延。许多美国贷方已向该行业提供信贷。 8月初，穆迪下调了十家中小型机构的评级，并对几家较大的机构进行了降级观察。该评级机构指出，资产低于 100 亿美元的银行对商业房地产的敞口占其股本缓冲的 279%，而资产超过 2500 亿美元的银行的这一比例为 51%。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> 3 月和 4 月导致硅谷银行、第​​一共和银行和 Signature 银行陷入困境的问题也没有消失。自春季暴跌以来，整个行业的存款几乎没有恢复，过去四个月平均每周增长 0.02%，而过去四十年平均每周增长 0.13%。货币市场基金的吸引力在于，高收益为投资者提供了低息银行账户的替代选择，这意味着压力难以缓解。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">对于杠杆率较低的公司、工人和股票投资者来说，经济粥的温度似乎恰到好处。即使在引发全球金融危机的住宅房地产市场，业主也基本上对美联储的快速加息不屑一顾。但美国市场最容易受到再融资成本上升影响的部分却面临着一碗令人倒胃口的冷粥。对某些人来说，金发姑娘的结果对另一些人来说是一场悲观的噩梦。如果国债收益率保持高位，将这两种现实分开可能会变得越来越困难。 <span

class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">中国影子<small>银行新华信托的股票</small><span>正</span>以最低价出售。该公司于五月破产，成为二十多年来第一家倒闭的中国信托公司。此后，该公司的大部分股份在在线电子商务平台淘宝上以 30% 的折扣出售。最近，该公司的汽车被加入了法院强制拍卖的拍卖行。抄底者只需 12,000 元人民币（1,650 美元）就能买到新华社商标。</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0">这家银行的倒闭是一个警告：导致其倒闭的同样力量现在正在席卷中国的信托行业，该行业的资产规模达21万亿人民币。该国的经济增长<a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/24/chinas-economy-is-in-desperate-need-of-rescue">弱于预期</a>，房地产开发商陷入了令人畏惧的<a

Panicked investors fear more firms will be ensnared, and that collapses will lead to further economic problems.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> During China&#39;s years of strong growth, trusts and their investors flourished, with investment products often offering annual returns of 10% or more. Property developers and local governments were willing to pay lofty interest rates, transactions required less regulatory scrutiny than bank lending and trusts benefited from the widespread perception that investors&#39; cash was safeguarded by the state in a fashion similar to bank deposits. That perception is now long gone—and as more developers default, it is likely that more shadow banks will be unable to pay out.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Zhongrong, which managed about 630bn yuan in trust products at the end of last year, shows how pain has spread from property to the financial system. When Sunac, China&#39;s fifth-largest developer, defaulted last year, local governments began freezing company funds in order to ensure that projects were finished. One place where funds were frozen was Wuhan, a city in central China, and the money included investments linked to Zhongrong. Across the industry, about 7% of trust products were invested in the property sector at the end of March. Indirect investments via securities push that exposure to as much as 30%, reckon analysts at <small>anz</small> , a bank.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The risk of contagion is high because lending by trusts is ubiquitous and opaque, and investment in them produces tangled ties. On August 29th Jingwei Textile Machinery, a state-backed firm and Zhongrong&#39;s largest investor, announced it would delist from the Shenzhen stock exchange, citing “market changes”. Other listed firms that invest in Zhongrong&#39;s products say the company has missed payments. Trusts have meanwhile invested about 4.6trn yuan in stocks, bonds and other funds. They have also lent to local-government projects—and now cities and provinces across China are struggling to repay debts, which are estimated to have hit 57trn yuan at the end of 2022.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is another avenue through which trouble may spread. Zhongrong is controlled by a larger investment manager, called Zhongzhi, which has about 1trn yuan in assets under management across an array of divisions. Zhongzhi has also been thrown into a liquidity crisis and has reportedly been unable to pay the 230bn yuan it owes to some 150,000 investors. Across the country, similar investment-management firms have millions of customers. Since news of Zhongzhi&#39;s troubles broke, phones have been ringing off the hook as worried clients, many of whom are regular white-collar workers, seek to confirm their savings are safe, reports an executive at another of these companies.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These sorts of links between trusts, local governments and developers, and the possibility of larger financial firms getting caught in the trouble, have spooked investors. Indeed, Zhongrong&#39;s troubles have contributed to the poor performance of the Chinese stockmarket. The <small>csi</small> 300, a benchmark index, fell by more than 6% in August. Government interventions, which included a cut to stamp duty on August 27th, have had little impact.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Officials are aware of these problems. After all, they inadvertently brought many into being. Since 2017 China&#39;s shadow banks have been under intense scrutiny as part of an effort to transfer opaque off-balance-sheet lending to banks. The official attack was ramped up in 2020 when the state introduced sharp restrictions on leverage at property developers. As a result of such moves, the issuance of shadow-banking products in the first half of this year was at its weakest in a decade, according to Capital Economics, a research firm. The crackdown has sapped liquidity and confidence from the market, pushing both developers and trust firms towards default.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> The rich get poorer</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> In the short term, much of the pain will be borne by wealthy investors: the threshold for putting money into a trust is usually more than 300,000 yuan. Most cannot even demand the return of initial investments, since products usually have terms that prevent investors from withdrawing, sometimes for up to two years. This may stop a fully fledged financial crisis caused by a run on shadow lenders, and will give the government time to deal with the mess. Bloomberg, a news service, has reported that China&#39;s banking regulator has already set up a task force to examine the problems at Zhongzhi. Given the connections such firms have across the economy, inspectors might not like what they find. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/money-talks">Money Talks</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 28 Aug 2023 19:28:26 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/dos3afgfvpvc9a6q6lfa1eat52svf711</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/28/chinas-shadow-banking-industry-threatens-its-financial-system </item><item><title><![CDATA[Which animals should a modern-day Noah put in his ark?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/069%20Finance%20and%20economics%20-%20Free%20exchange-88b3d88580ac045710f3fd937b04eeea.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>“O</span> <small>f fowls after</small> their kind,” the Lord said to Noah, “and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the Earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee.” Co-operation from the animal kingdom helped make the biblical patriarch history&#39;s greatest conservationist, saving every land-based animal, including humans, from a wave of divine extinction.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Unlike Noah, contemporary conservationists face constraints: they cannot save everything. The patriarch was able to fit a breeding pair of each of the 5.6m or so terrestrial species onto his 300 cubits-long ark. If he was forced instead to ration his space, facing the traditional economic problem of scarce resources and unlimited wants, which animals should Noah have prioritised and kept safe from the flood for future generations?</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This was the dilemma Martin Weitzman, an economist, posed in a paper published in 1998, and it is one that carries enduring lessons. Weitzman&#39;s goal, beyond biblical interpretation, was to create an economic theory of conservation, calculating a strategy that a rational conservationist could follow to maximise both human welfare and natural biodiversity. He wanted to come up with a way of ranking conservation projects; how to weigh what the Lord called creeping things of the Earth against one another given the limited amount of funding to keep them all alive.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Animals have two sources of value in Weitzman&#39;s model. The first is the utility they provide humanity: economists now call this “ecosystem services”. They vary from the delight that megafauna provide those visiting a safari park to the more prosaic: pollinators fertilising crops; earthworms keeping the soil healthy. A forthcoming paper by Eyal Frank of the University of Chicago and Anant Sudarshan of the University of Warwick looks at the economic benefits of “keystone species”. They find that the accidental poisoning of vultures in India led to a dramatic increase in human mortality, with more than 100,000 additional deaths in an average year, as the birds no longer devoured waterway-poisoning carrion ( <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/08/22/the-sudden-demise-of-indian-vultures-killed-thousands-of-people">see Graphic detail</a> ). Despite their poor reputation, vultures might therefore earn a place on a resource-constrained ark.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The second part of the calculation places a direct value on biodiversity. Imagine, now, that you are not Noah trying to save the natural world from a flood, but a scholar trying to save texts from the Library of Alexandria. All the scrolls might be valuable, but many have information on them that is in other libraries. The aim would be to save those with information not recorded elsewhere. Weitzman applies the same logic to animals: biodiversity has both an aesthetic value and an informational one, with content embedded in the genetics of animals. The selection for the ark should try to preserve as much of this information as possible, even if the animals themselves do not do much for human welfare.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> That led to what some conservationists might consider a repugnant conclusion: counterintuintively, the best way to preserve biodiversity is for the resource-constrained ark to pick a single species and squeeze in as many as possible. Preventing just one type of animal from going extinct preserves not only what is distinct about that animal, but everything it shares genetically with every other animal as well. Trying to keep two species alive, and failing, means losing everything. The real-world implication of this is that using conservation funds on highly endangered species risks throwing good money after bad. Pandas, for instance, are cute but require a lot of effort to keep alive. Noah might be best to fill the ark with resilient cockroaches instead, ensuring that at least one creature makes it through the flood.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> To reach that counterintuitive conclusion, Weitzman assumed that people ought to value biodiversity for its own sake. Some boatbuilders might instead want to focus only on the benefits animals provide to humans. Perhaps a few creatures provide a sufficiently low or even negative value as to be excluded altogether. Stinging wasps are one candidate, but the picnic irritants play a vital role, eating other pests and pollinating flowers. Mosquitoes, humans&#39; greatest natural killer, responsible for more than half a million deaths a year, are another. Some scientists have suggested releasing genetically modified, sterilised versions of the insects that would get rid of the species altogether; others warn that doing so could have unforeseen consequences by eradicating both a pollinator and a food source for other animals.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Deliberate eradications are occasionally successful. Every week the <small>us</small> Department of Agriculture ( <small>usda</small> ) and Panamanian government drop sterilised screwworms, a parasitic flesh-eating fly larva that feeds on livestock, out of a plane on the Panama-Colombia border in order to stop the creatures from breeding. This helps maintain a biological barrier that prevents the creature from moving northward, and thus safeguards a programme spanning decades and countries that has got rid of the fly from North America. The <small>usda</small> estimates that the project produces economic benefits worth around $3.1bn a year.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Be fruitful and multiply</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> There is reason to be careful, though. Even when valuing animals solely on their benefits to humanity, biodiversity still has something to offer: insurance. Genetic range reduces the vulnerability of any individual part of an ecosystem to pests and diseases, helping avoid catastrophe if a species vital for human survival goes extinct. Were Noah to have filled his ark with cockroaches—or pandas, for that matter—a single virus could have wiped out the lot.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Weitzman himself applied such an approach to climate change, formulating his “dismal theorem”, which states that, in the presence of sufficiently big risks with a small chance of great harm, regular cost-benefit analysis is of little use. The same may be true of biodiversity. Deliberate extinctions are irreversible and reduce humanity&#39;s options, so should be used sparingly. Playing at being Noah is one thing, playing at being God quite another. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <b>Read more from Free exchange, our column on economics:<br></b> <i><a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/article67039-prod.ece">Democracy and the price of a vote</a> (Aug 17th)<br></i> <i><a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/07/elon-musks-plans-could-hinder-twitternomics">Elon Musk&#39;s plans could hinder Twitternomics</a> (Aug 7th)<br></i> <i><a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/article65319-prod.ece">Deflation is curbing China&#39;s economic rise</a> (Jul 27th)</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 24 Aug 2023 11:19:03 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/fec596bguj47invocbvlk5euiqurqlc8</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/24/which-animals-should-a-modern-day-noah-put-in-his-ark </item><item><title><![CDATA[Argentina is pushing international lending to its breaking point]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/068%20Finance%20and%20economics%20-%20The%20IMF%20flounders-22009acd70a703efe63b8faacf69ccb3.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>he Argentine</small> economy hangs by a thread. So far this year, the peso&#39;s black-market value has fallen by half against the dollar and annual inflation has hit 113%. The only foreign-currency reserves left are lent by China. Policymakers are torn between printing pesos to cover the government&#39;s bills and the need to avoid hyperinflation. Ahead of presidential elections in October, much is riding on the candidates&#39; proposed fixes. Javier Milei, a libertarian economist who once smashed a model of the central bank on live <small>tv</small> , and who unexpectedly prevailed in recent electoral primaries, would scrap the peso and make the American dollar Argentina&#39;s legal tender.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet the economy may implode before any candidate gets to fix it. On August 23rd the government persuaded the <small>imf</small> to release a $7.5bn tranche of its bail-out programme, its only hope of meeting dollar-debt repayments and staving off default. The <small>imf</small> ’s reluctance stemmed not from the fact Argentina is broke—lending to such countries is the fund&#39;s purpose—but from the fact that most of the cash Argentina must repay this year is promised to the fund itself. Argentina is a rare country with the <small>imf</small> as its biggest creditor, owing the fund a cool $40bn, roughly a third of its external debt. By providing support, the <small>imf</small> has delayed disaster. It has also prolonged an increasingly absurd situation. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC229.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC229.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC229.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC229.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC229.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC229.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC229.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC229.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC229.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC229.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC229.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC229.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC229.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC229.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC229.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC229.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC229.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>imf</small> lends to the world&#39;s unstable economies as a “preferred creditor”. If a country only has a little cash, it<small> </small>is the first to be repaid. It never takes a loss during debt restructuring. This lets it and other multilateral institutions, including the World Bank, hand out cheaper rescue packages. The approach has worked when packages are small enough that even troubled countries are able to repay them.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet Argentina is pushing the model to its breaking point. In 2018 the <small>imf</small> took a gamble and offered the country a bail-out worth $57bn, the fund&#39;s biggest ever. At the time, many observers thought it was too much for a country with Argentina&#39;s patchy track record. It turned out also to be far too little to fix the country&#39;s economy.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Argentina cannot afford its bills; the <small>imf</small> cannot cut the debt it is owed without forfeiting its status as preferred creditor. The result is a stalemate. For now, an instrument approved by the <small>imf</small> last year provides a workaround. Every time the fund collects Argentine debts it deposits a roughly equal amount with Argentina&#39;s government. This programme has an elongated repayment schedule, but also eye-watering interest bills of 8%. Argentina has just as much borrowing—and just as few ways to pay—as it did before.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> One escape for Argentina would be to find the cash to repay the <small>imf</small> . During 60 years of borrowing from the fund, however, the country&#39;s politicians have shown little interest in taking its advice. Few reforms stipulated as part of the agreement in 2018 have been enacted. Even if the next president is disciplined, it will take years to get the economy on track. <small>imf</small> officials point to the country&#39;s recent bad luck, including a drought that cost an estimated $20bn. But that would have barely covered repayments to the fund for the year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Another option is for the <small>imf</small> to admit that Argentina has too much debt and things will have to change. Although the fund reckons that Argentina is just about solvent, with a bit of luck, many outside economists think the country is already unable to repay its debts without restructuring. It is unlikely other creditors, mostly American financial institutions, will agree to take losses while the fund shelters behind its elevated status, since the more obligations Argentina racks up to multilateral institutions, the less its bondholders matter. Soon private-sector lenders could hold so little of the country&#39;s external debt that they are irrelevant for its solvency.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The <small>imf</small> ’s preferred-creditor status ultimately rests on the expectation that borrowers will turn their fortunes around and on other creditors&#39; goodwill. Neither condition holds in Argentina. By doling out another wodge of cash, the fund will reassure markets, stopping sudden fluxes in the peso or bond prices. But the disbursement brings a tough question. When does the <small>imf</small> stop handing out money? Through their desperation to avoid default, the fund&#39;s officials are putting up with naked disobedience from Argentina, which may set a bad example for other countries.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Meanwhile, Argentina desperately needs a lasting fix. Each month without one deepens the country&#39;s economic woes. Inflation worsens as imports become more expensive and monetary policy flirts with fiscal dominance, where the government borrows so much the central bank has no choice but to bail it out. The longer Argentina limps on without restructuring, the more damaging the process will be when it happens. In the past three months, Argentina has racked up short-term debts of $1.7bn from China, $1.3bn from <small>caf</small> , a regional lender, and $775m from Qatar.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These are steep costs to protect the <small>imf</small> ’s preferred-creditor status. The alternative would be for the fund to stop lending to Argentina, which would force the country to restructure its debts. In doing so, the fund would risk default and perhaps even a loss. Those in favour of such a move argue that the damage to the <small>imf</small> ’s preferred-creditor status would not affect its dealings with other countries, so long as it did not make a habit of big bail-outs.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> With the next disbursement due in November, <small>imf</small> officials might even be able to use the threat of this action to squeeze real reforms from the outgoing government. If the move fails, the next government would at least receive a clean slate, rather than being dogged by negotiations during its first year in office. The cost of letting Argentina carry on is high. In the coming months, the <small>imf</small> will have to figure out if the cost of cutting it off is higher. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/money-talks">Money Talks</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 24 Aug 2023 10:22:43 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/3lje9ct2jk18i7p3tjq2pt2dqdo1j3p3</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/24/argentina-is-pushing-international-lending-to-its-breaking-point </item><item><title><![CDATA[China’s economy is in desperate need of rescue]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/064%20Finance%20and%20economics%20-%20Growth%20problems-ffa7759dbed3f6bf5ed093a4d7272da6.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>he headlines</small> keep getting worse for China. Consumer prices are falling. America is shunning exports from the country and restricting investment in it. China&#39;s trade with its best customer and biggest rival shrank by a fifth in July compared with a year earlier. The country&#39;s property sector, which has driven more than 20% of its <small>gdp</small> in recent years, is teetering. Developers, which carry debts worth about 16% of <small>gdp</small> , are struggling to meet their obligations. Two of them, Country Garden and Sino-Ocean, have missed bond payments. Investment products sold by Zhongrong Trust, which are probably exposed to property, have failed to pay out.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> These reports have been accompanied by even scarier metaphors. China&#39;s economy is a “ticking time-bomb”, according to America&#39;s President Joe Biden, because of its ageing workers and unemployed young. Others think it is suffering from “long covid” because of the private sector&#39;s “immune response” to Xi Jinping&#39;s meddlesome rule. Many worry that China faces “Japanification”—a combination of debt, deflation and demographic decline—in the long term and a “Lehman moment” in the more immediate future, as defaults cascade through the shadow-banking system.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Even level-headed observers are shaken. The mood is the worst it has been for years, if not decades. The cause of this despondency is disputed—is it politics or property?—but the consequences are clear. It is inhibiting spending, which is depressing prices, profits and hiring, all of which only adds to the gloom. To break this cycle, the country&#39;s confidence must be revived.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Morale used to respond to a strong signal from China&#39;s leaders, such as Deng Xiaoping&#39;s “southern tour” of entrepreneurial cities in 1992, or Zhu Rongji&#39;s vow to keep growth at 8% during the Asian financial crisis in 1998. But China today lacks a ruler with the requisite economic credibility. Officials will have to put their money where their mouth is, spending on infrastructure, pensions and the like. These tools should work—if they are used. The problem is that they entail a generosity that some in China&#39;s leadership find distasteful. And they require a commitment to growth that seems to be lacking.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It is a disorientating state of affairs. For 40 years Chinese officialdom&#39;s commitment to growth was never much in doubt. When China began its reform era in 1978, <small>gdp</small> per person was only $2,000 at purchasing-power parity, which adjusts for differences in the cost of living. More than 70% of the country&#39;s workforce toiled on farms. Almost 90% suffered in abject poverty. Only 12 firms were permitted to trade across borders. The millions who worked in state-owned factories were saddled with “obsolete and dysfunctional products”, according to Thomas Rawski of the University of Pittsburgh and his co-authors, such as “transformers that failed to keep out rainwater” and “sewing machines that leaked oil onto the fabric”.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Market reforms meant managers “switched from politics to business”, as one of them put it. China&#39;s <small>gdp</small> per person now exceeds $20,000, above the global average. The most wretched poverty has been eliminated. Those 12 trading firms have been succeeded by tens of millions of others, turning China into the world&#39;s biggest exporter of goods by 2009, and perhaps its biggest exporter of cars this year. The country&#39;s manufacturing <small>gdp</small> exceeds America&#39;s and the European Union&#39;s combined, churning out chips, ships and industrial sewing machines (60m leakless ones in the past ten years). In its combination of scale and speed, this economic revolution has no precedent.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The transformation included a remaking of China&#39;s urban landscape. From 2010 to 2020, the country added more than 140m units of housing to its cities, according to Morgan Stanley, a bank. In just three years, it produced enough cement to turn the whole of Britain into a car park. The amount of living space per person increased from a cramped 27 square metres (like the eastern half of Europe) to a more comfortable 35 (like the western half), according to calculations by Rosealea Yao of Gavekal Dragonomics, a research firm. Chinese residential property became one of the world&#39;s largest asset classes, worth over $30trn by the end of 2019.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> China&#39;s miracle is long over. Its economy has matured. Its workforce is shrinking. Fundamental demand for new property in China&#39;s cities, driven by people&#39;s aspirations for a first home or better digs, has passed its peak. For China&#39;s leadership, the pursuit of prosperity must now compete with other goals. Mr Xi wants to break the West&#39;s chokehold on vital technological inputs. He wants to keep finance tethered to the needs of the “real” economy, like a kite tied to a tree, according to an official think-tank. He frowns on the “disorderly expansion of capital” into social realms like education and child rearing. And he despises the mix of gumption and corruption that motivates many local cadres. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC243.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC243.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC243.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC243.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC243.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC243.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC243.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC243.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC243.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC243.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC243.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC243.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC243.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC243.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC243.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC243.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC243.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The question now is whether the next phase is moderate or malign. China&#39;s strict “zero-covid” policy played havoc with its economy last year. Thus hopes for this year were high. China&#39;s reopening released pent-up demand for the goods and services it was hard to enjoy when a single infection could imprison an entire city block. It also cleared a backlog of export orders and allowed a flurry of home purchases in China&#39;s more expensive cities. Some private-sector economists raised their growth forecasts for the year to a jaunty 6%.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> This bout of spending was, however, considerably briefer than hoped. And, crucially, it did not lift morale sufficiently to sustain a broader recovery of spending. In April consumer confidence fell back to last year&#39;s lows, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, which promptly stopped releasing the figure (see chart 1). Foreign direct investment all but vanished in the second quarter, falling by 87% year-on-year to $4.9bn, as multinationals repatriated their earnings rather than reinvesting them. The Shanghai Composite, a benchmark stock index, is down by about 5% compared with a year ago, when the memory of Shanghai&#39;s torturous lockdown was still fresh. Prices for existing properties in China&#39;s 100 biggest cities have dropped by 14% compared with their 2021 peaks, according to Beike, a broker. In the smaller cities, where price information remains patchy, things are probably worse.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> An old trick</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Many economists now expect growth to meet the government&#39;s target of “around 5%” only because the word “around” gives it some wriggle room. Slowing growth has also been accompanied by declining prices and a weaker currency. The combined effect could wipe trillions off the dollar value of China&#39;s <small>gdp</small> . In the past four months, for example, Goldman Sachs, a bank, has slashed its forecast for this year and next by a combined $3trn (see chart 2). </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC245.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC245.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC245.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC245.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC245.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC245.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC245.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC245.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC245.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC245.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC245.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC245.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC245.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC245.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC245.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC245.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC245.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> For some observers, there is little hope of improvement. Adam Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think-tank, has suggested that China&#39;s economy is suffering from something akin to “long covid”. Draconian and arbitrary lockdowns in 2020-22 ruptured people&#39;s faith in Mr Xi&#39;s meddlesome party. Households and entrepreneurs can no longer assume that the party will not bother them if they do not bother it, he argues. Therefore private investment is tentative, purchases of consumer durables are weak and bank deposits are unusually high, as people self-insure against an uncertain future.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Confidence has also suffered as a result of the “regulatory storm” that struck after 2020, humbling China&#39;s online platform companies, such as Alibaba and Meituan, and all but killing the ed-tech industry. The succession of crackdowns and lockdowns left the impression that the government was newly willing to sacrifice economic growth for other ends. Whereas Mr Zhu urged China to keep growth at 8%, Mr Xi insists that it must be “high-quality”, by his own evolving definition. For entrepreneurs, that requires an uncomfortable switch from business to politics.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> If Mr Posen is right, China is stuck. If spending is weak because households and entrepreneurs fear the party&#39;s intrusive policymaking, their spirits will not revive until Mr Xi commits to self-restraint—a commitment that he cannot credibly make. Even if the setbacks of the past two years have chastened him, he cannot prove he will not change his mind again. The party lacks the power to limit its own power.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Yet low confidence may have more mundane explanations. Households may be despondent because employment is insecure, wages are stagnant and assets, especially houses, are losing value. If so, morale should pick up if the job and housing markets improve. The animal spirits of private entrepreneurs should also revive if their sales regain momentum.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> It may, in fact, be property that is at the heart of the problem. In manufacturing, by contrast, private investment has been respectable, growing by 8% in June compared with a year earlier. Weak spending on consumer durables may also reflect property-market woes, which have depressed furniture and white-goods sales. Purchases of other consumer durables have shown more signs of life. Sales of cars surged in the first half of this year, helped by the exemption of electric vehicles from a 10% sales tax. China&#39;s households are not so worried by their government that they will miss out on a bargain. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC307.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC307.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC307.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC307.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC307.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC307.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC307.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC307.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC307.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC307.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC307.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC307.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC307.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC307.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC307.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC307.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC307.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The renewed weakness in China&#39;s property market has certainly contributed to fears of deflation and default (see chart 3 ). The price of building materials fell by 5.6% in July compared with a year earlier, and the price of household appliances fell by 1.8%. The “deterioration in sales” was one reason Country Garden gave for failing to pay its bondholders on its deadline of August 6th. Property distress may also help explain why products sold by Zhongrong, an asset-management firm, have failed to pay investors as expected.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> If property is a bigger mood-killer than official interference, this raises a question. Are China&#39;s property problems any easier to solve than those produced by an overbearing state? The market got ahead of itself in 2020 and 2021, buoyed by people looking for a place to park their wealth, rather than a place to live. Although the non-speculative, fundamental demand for new construction will remain on a gently declining path from its historical peak, demand is now so low it has probably fallen below this fundamental pace. Sales are running at about 54% of their 2019 level. A sustainable pace would be closer to 75%, reckons Ms Yao of Gavekal Dragonomics.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Lifting sales back to such a level would require bolder macroeconomic manoeuvres from China&#39;s policymakers. Lower interest rates would make new mortgages more affordable, although they would be of little immediate assistance to existing borrowers, since mortgage refinancing is difficult in China. The People&#39;s Bank of China, the country&#39;s central bank, this week surprised observers by deciding not to reduce the five-year loan-prime rate, which serves as a benchmark for mortgages. Given the drop in inflation in recent months, real interest rates are rising.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The central bank&#39;s response partly reflects uncertainty about the impact of interest-rate cuts. Officials worry, for example, about the profit margins of banks, which may feel obliged to pass on rate cuts in full to borrowers but not to depositors. The authorities also fret about the yuan. China&#39;s capital controls give it a degree of monetary independence. But about $26bn of foreign exchange still left the country in July, according to Goldman Sachs—the fastest pace of outflows since September 2022. China&#39;s currency has weakened more quickly than the central bank would like in recent weeks. There are signs that state-owned banks are helping to prop it up.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Such constraints on monetary policy necessitate a more forceful fiscal push. During past slowdowns, local governments and affiliates have led the way, allowing the central government to keep its balance-sheet relatively uncluttered. But local stimulus efforts have included poorly conceived projects, which Mr Xi views with distaste. Some cadres “over-borrow for construction and blindly expand businesses”, he complained last year.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Other provinces have been a little more imaginative. Three years ago, for example, cities in Zhejiang distributed perishable coupons to consumers through e-wallets on their mobile phones. These coupons offered discounts on things such as restaurant meals if shoppers spent above a certain threshold. A study by economists at the Ant Group Research Institute found that these vouchers had a high multiplier, delivering a lot of wallop for the yuan. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC002.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC002.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC002.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC002.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC002.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC002.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC002.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC002.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC002.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC002.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC002.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC002.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC002.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC002.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC002.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC002.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC002.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The problem is that many of China&#39;s local governments are in no position to stimulate the economy this year, imaginatively or otherwise. Indeed, they will need more help merely to prevent damaging spending cutbacks. According to <i>Caixin</i> , a business magazine, China&#39;s central government will allow local governments to sell an extra 1.5trn yuan-worth ($210bn) of bonds, which carry an implicit central-government guarantee, to help repay the riskier, costlier debt owed by their financing vehicles (investment firms, backed by state assets, that can borrow in their own right). Proceeds from these bonds should help prevent an explicit default. Yet even 1.5trn yuan looks meagre compared with the total risky debt of these platforms, which one estimate suggests amounts to 12trn yuan.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Although avoiding a default by a local-government financing vehicle will prevent the economic downturn getting worse, it will not reverse it. That would require the central government to make greater use of its own balance-sheet, through increased investment in green infrastructure, consumer giveaways of the kind pioneered in Zhejiang or increased spending on things such as pensions and anti-poverty programmes. Some economists have argued that the government should also establish a fund to buy up some of the unsold inventories of China&#39;s struggling property developers in order to create affordable rental housing for the poor.</p><h2 class="css-8p8dhl e8f47sz0"> Flaming out</h2><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The aim would be to prevent a fire-sale of properties by distressed developers, add to household incomes and replenish company order books. If used, stimulus should be enough to ward off deflation, cap unemployment and ensure China&#39;s economy fulfils its potential over the next few years. Low inflation, after all, is both a threat and an invitation. It implies that the economy has plenty of “slack” or room to expand over the medium run, even if its growth potential is constrained in the longer term. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC248.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC248.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC248.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC248.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC248.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC248.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC248.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC248.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC248.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC248.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC248.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC248.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC248.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC248.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC248.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC248.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC248.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> But this comes with two mighty caveats. The first is that fiscal heroics will not erase the long-term problems that cloud China&#39;s economic future. The country will still have to contend with demographic decline and diplomatic dangers. Its workforce will begin to shrink more rapidly in the 2030s (see chart 5). And America&#39;s restrictions on semiconductor exports will bite more keenly as technology advances.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The second concerns the political dynamics at play. If China&#39;s government acts with urgency, it has the tools it requires in order to engineer a recovery in the latter part of this year. But will it use them? Mr Xi lacks the credibility or focus of previous leaders. He now prizes greatness over growth, security over efficiency and resilience over comfort. He wants to fortify the economy, not gratify consumers. These competing priorities may prevent China&#39;s rulers from doing whatever it takes to revive demand. Mr Xi no longer wants growth at all costs. And so the country has not had it. At growing cost. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/money-talks">Money Talks</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 24 Aug 2023 10:20:09 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/qnk9073ikjh0c4rsb3tftsiknkir6utl</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/24/chinas-economy-is-in-desperate-need-of-rescue </item><item><title><![CDATA[America’s astonishing economic growth goes up another gear]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="css-er00if e1whazj12"><div class="css-1lm38nn e50l3u40"><figure><div><figcaption>听听这个故事。</figcaption><span class="css-1fs0t47 ed4dtdz0">在<a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25">iOS</a>或<a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199">Android</a>上享受更多音频和播客。</span> </div><audio class="react-audio-player " id="audio-player" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/066%20Finance%20and%20economics%20-%20Energised%20economy-89245531683e2f41c461336a873c8c1a.mp3"><p>您的浏览器不支持<audio>元素。</p></audio></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <span>T</span> <small>he energizer bunny</small> , a pink mechanical hare that keeps banging its drum owing to long-lasting batteries, will celebrate its 35th anniversary this October. As if to mark the momentous occasion, the American economy is doing its best imitation of the advertising icon. Despite umpteen predictions of a slowdown, it keeps going and going. Recent data suggest it may even be on track for annualised growth of nearly 6% in the third quarter, a pace it has hit only a few times since 2000.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> As has been the case repeatedly over the past year, a steady stream of better-than-expected data has left analysts scrambling to lift their forecasts. New orders for manufacturing firms reached their highest in nine months in July. Retail sales were perky last month, too, with consumers splurging on everything from restaurant meals to online shopping and clothing to sporting goods. The construction industry has also been buoyant, supported by a rebound in homebuilding. Underpinning all this is the labour market, which has remained hot, making it relatively easy for people to find work at decent wages. The total number of jobs in America has been growing faster than the working-age population, helping to keep the unemployment rate at 3.5%, just shy of a five-decade low.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The worry is that such strong growth, veering into overheating, will also beget a long-lasting inflation problem. Added up, America is on track for a <small>gdp</small> figure this quarter that may look more like a “no landing” than the “soft landing” expected a short while ago. The Federal Reserve&#39;s branch in Atlanta uses a range of data points to estimate <small>gdp</small> growth in real time: a technique known as nowcasting, rather than forecasting, because it assigns weights to already observed variables without factoring in expectations for future figures. On August 16th, its latest update, the model showed the economy may expand by 5.8% in the third quarter. That would be a shocker after more than a year of aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed. </p><div class="css-1bzwzkr eitqf4z1"><figure class="css-qts40t e1197rjj0"><img alt width="608" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=16,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC226.png 16w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=32,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC226.png 32w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=48,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC226.png 48w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=64,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC226.png 64w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=96,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC226.png 96w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC226.png 128w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=256,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC226.png 256w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=360,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC226.png 360w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=384,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC226.png 384w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=480,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC226.png 480w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=600,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC226.png 600w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=834,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC226.png 834w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=960,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC226.png 960w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1096,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC226.png 1096w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC226.png 1280w, https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC226.png 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1424,quality=80,format=auto/content-assets/images/20230826_FNC226.png"></figure></div><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Could growth really be that strong? The nowcast almost certainly exaggerates the economy&#39;s vigour. It is normally off by about two percentage points at this point in the quarterly cycle (see chart). One factor this time is likely to be inventories. When firms make sales from their stocks rather than by producing new goods, this drawdown counts as a subtraction from <small>gdp</small> . A recent gap between rising retail sales and declining wholesale transactions suggests that such a drawdown is now taking place and will weigh on growth, according to Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics, a consultancy. Still, even if somewhat exaggerated, the Atlanta Fed&#39;s nowcast is almost always directionally correct. The inference is clear: America&#39;s economy is not just holding up but steaming ahead.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Recent months have offered some respite on the inflation front. Core prices, which strip out volatile food and energy costs, have risen at their slowest pace in more than two years. But if the economy continues to heat up, inflation may well stage a rebound. Andrew Hollenhorst of Citigroup, a bank, warns that shortages of both workers and housing risk a significant reacceleration of prices next year. Where once optimists thought that inflation might be transitory, now pessimists fear that disinflation will be fleeting. That would scupper hopes for a pivot to monetary loosening by the Fed.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The strength of the American economy may also add to financial strains. It is the principal factor explaining why investors have sold off government bonds since May. Yields, which move inversely to prices, have risen by about one percentage point during that time, with long-term Treasury yields climbing to 16-year highs. This has prompted a debate about whether America&#39;s neutral short-term interest rate—where the Fed would set rates to neither stifle nor stimulate growth—has drifted up. Bill Dudley, a former Fed official, has argued that in the long run America may require higher rates to balance the need for more borrowing (implied by higher government deficits) and a smaller funding pool (as retirees spend their savings). A gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, taking place after we go to press, was expected to discuss such issues.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Wall Street is now convinced that in the short run the Fed will need to keep rates higher than expected, too. A few months ago most were pricing in rapid rate cuts starting in September; now most think the Fed will wait until May and will move tepidly. Given the economy&#39;s continuous outperformance, pricing in higher rates further into the future seems prudent.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> Higher yields are contributing to an increase in funding costs for financial institutions, which are a headache for smaller lenders in particular. Moody&#39;s and <small>s</small> &amp; <small>p</small> , two credit-rating agencies, downgraded a spate of banks this month, a reminder of the continued fragility of the financial sector. Higher borrowing costs are also starting to bite for consumers. Delinquencies on credit cards and car loans have started to increase sharply. Finally, higher rates are clouding the outlook for housing. Like the wider economy, the market has been most notable for its resilience to date. But mortgage rates have jumped over the past couple of months and hit 7.5% this week, their highest since 2001. This is already having a dampening effect on existing home sales, which could spread to homebuilding and construction more generally.</p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> The lesson of recent history is that the American economy inevitably blows through such problems. Nothing lasts for ever, though. The higher yields rise, the greater the challenge. In the advertisements the Energizer Bunny&#39;s batteries never fade. In real life even the strongest batteries are drained eventually—or unceremoniously yanked out. <span class="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="css-1hno3qs e190yofl0"> <i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/money-talks">Money Talks</a> , our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 23 Aug 2023 20:14:42 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> /content/3dlbhislgu86tmghni0jnqqvdcqe9579</guid><link/> https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/08/23/americas-astonishing-economic-growth-goes-up-another-gear</item></channel></rss>
