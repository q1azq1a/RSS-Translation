&lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;overflow:hidden;width:100%;height:自动；填充：0px；最小宽度：256px；显示：块；边距：自动；最大宽度：650px；&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-content-wrapper&quot;>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;但是，内容营销不仅仅是发布一小段内容并希望人们会找到它。这是针对目标受众有目的地定制您的页面、视频、电子书和帖子，以便他们通过入站方式而不是出站方式找到您。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今天，&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog .hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/2989/inbound-marketing-vs-outbound-marketing.aspx&quot;>;出站营销&lt;/a>;策略（或任何干扰受众成员的行为）在以下情况下效果不佳：像以前一样与观众产生共鸣并转化他们。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今天，您的内容需要以一种感觉自然的方式（又名 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/入站营销&quot;>;入站&lt;/a>;）。一种常见的方法是为您的内容创建一个叙述，或者讲一个故事。这样做，您的内容会感觉更真实、更有吸引力，并且更适合您的受众。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么，内容营销的定义是什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h3>;为什么内容营销重要吗？&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;2022 年 HubSpot 研究表明，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics&quot;>;70% 的公司使用内容营销&lt;/a>;。&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;内容营销很有价值，因为它：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;向您的潜在客户和潜在客户介绍您提供的产品和服务。根据 2023 年 HubSpot 研究，&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/content-media-planning-report&quot;>;29%&lt;/a>; 的营销人员使用博客或网站来吸引潜在客户并实现转化。&lt; /li>; &lt;li>;提高转化率。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;在客户和企业之间建立关系，从而提高忠诚度，并且&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of -content-marketing-infographic&quot;>;30%&lt;/a>; 的营销人员正在创建反映品牌价值的内容。&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;向受众展示您的产品和服务如何解决他们的挑战&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;创造围绕您的品牌的社区意识。&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;现在让我们看看内容营销的各种类型。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;内容营销的类型&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;有您可以选择将多种类型的内容营销纳入您的策略 - 以下是一些最常见的内容：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs /types-content-marketing.webp?width=650&amp;amp;height=488&amp;amp;name=types-content-marketing.webp&quot; alt=&quot;企业内容营销类型&quot; width=&quot;650&quot;

&lt;p>;HubSpot 的主页就是一个例子，它可以立即吸引访问者了解有关我们产品的特定内容。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>; 2.社交媒体内容营销&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;超过&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/#:~: text=Social%20media%20usage%20is%20one,almost%204.41%20billion%20in%202025。&amp;text=Social%20network%20penetration%20is%20constantly,2020%20stood%20at%2049%20percent。&quot;>;

&lt;p>;内容营销人员通过引人入胜的故事和分享有价值的信息来吸引受众。他们还使用内容渠道来建立社区。&lt;/​​p>; &lt;p>;因此，企业内容营销不仅仅是一种技术或策略，而是一种独特的沟通形式。考虑到这一点，人们在购买过程的不同阶段有不同的需求。为了确保您的内容满足每个阶段的需求，您需要考虑您的&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/conversion-funnel&quot;>;转化渠道&lt;/a>;。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;漏斗顶部 (TOFU)&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;在漏斗顶部，您希望通过内容建立知名度。您的目标受众可能知道他们遇到了问题，但他们不确定如何解决。在这个阶段，您可以专注于品牌知名度、广泛的痛点和常见问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;TOFU 内容应该吸引潜在客户，帮助他们更好地理解特定问题。这为您提供了向他们介绍您的解决方案的相关机会。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;TOFU 内容的常见挑战包括竞争、平衡教育和促销内容以及&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/ marketing/measure-content-marketing-roi&quot;>;跟踪投资回报率&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;要解决这些问题，&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing -plan&quot;>;创建吸引特定受众注意力的内容策略&lt;/a>;。您的策略还将帮助您创建一个计划，使内容主题和格式与业务目标保持一致。然后，创建 KPI 列表来跟踪您的内容绩效。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;漏斗顶部的有用内容类型包括：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;博客文章&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;社交媒体帖子&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;短片视频&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;播客&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;信息图表&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;清单&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;电子书&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;网络研讨会&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;视频广告&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;漏斗中部 (MOFU)&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;一旦潜在客户进入漏斗中部，他们就会正在考虑您的产品。他们可能不止一次访问过您的网站，或者正在使用您的社交媒体。他们可能已经订阅了您的电子邮件通讯。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;MOFU 内容应该与该人建立关系。此时，他们了解了自己的问题并正在比较可能的解决方案。因此，您的内容应该让他们了解您的解决方案的具体细节，并展示它如何满足他们的独特需求。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这也是建立信任的重要时刻。潜在客户可能还没有准备好购买，因此请注意用户行为的变化。做出假设或快速转变可能很诱人，但这可能会损害双方的关系。相反，提供深入的信息和价值来培养您的领先优势。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;优秀的漏斗中间内容类型包括：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;电子邮件通讯&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;产品演示&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;登陆页面&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;白皮书&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;案例研究&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;较长的视频&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;博客文章&lt; /li>; &lt;li>;互动内容&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;网络研讨会&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;您可能听说过社交媒体只是漏斗顶部的内容。但&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/do-consumers-shop-directly-on-social-media-platforms&quot;>;越来越多的用户在社交媒体上购物&lt;/a>;，而且也是一个受欢迎的客户服务和支持渠道。因此，请务必创建 MOFU 社交帖子，并让潜在客户知道您已准备好在此渠道上为他们提供帮助。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;漏斗底部 (BOFU)&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Bottom-of-漏斗内容可以帮助您的潜在客户做出决定，并在理想情况下实现转化。这个阶段的重点是转化。因此，BOFU 内容应该让测试产品、了解定价和购买变得容易。转化的内容应该推动行动并创造一种紧迫感。准备好&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/handling-common-sales-objections&quot;>;回应常见异议&lt;/a>;以及其他可能影响您的内容销售的阻碍因素。&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/13829/60-ways-personalization-is-changing-marketing.aspx&quot;>;个性化&lt;/a>;可以在此阶段增加内容的影响力。 &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-examples&quot;>;创建强大的 CTA&lt;/a>; 也很重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;漏斗底部内容类型包括：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;个性化电子邮件&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;用户生成的内容，例如客户评价&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;案例研究&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;定价页面&lt;/li>; li>; &lt;li>;竞争对手比较博客文章&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;视频演示&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;白皮书&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;再营销活动&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;看看这个发布有关&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-for-every-funnel-stage&quot;>;如何使您的内容与买家旅程保持一致&lt;/a>;的更多信息。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在，让我们看一些内容营销示例。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;现在，让我们来介绍一下您的内容营销策略。通过实施策略，您的内容营销工作将在转化潜在客户和接触目标受众方面产生影响力和有效性。&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;p>;让我们深入了解您想要完成的步骤为了制定&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-plan&quot;>;有效的内容策略&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1.找到您的目标受众。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;为最广泛的受众创建内容听起来是个好主意。但很难通过吸引所有人的内容脱颖而出。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相反，应关注具有特定兴趣和需求的利基人群。这可以帮助您用您的内容建立一个社区。首先，请查看您的&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona&quot;>;买家角色&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然后，回答以下问题有关目标受众的问题，以帮助您缩小适合他们的内容类型的范围：&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;他们需要您提供什么？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;他们希望克服哪些挑战？ &lt;/li>; &lt;li>;他们为什么需要您的产品或服务？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;您如何帮助他们取得成功？&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;他们把时间花在哪里？&lt;/li>; &lt;/ ul>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;2.设定 SMART 目标。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;内容营销策略的下一部分是设定 SMART 目标。这些应该针对您的业务 - 它们可能会补充您更广泛的营销策略和公司目标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以下是一些&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/smart- goal-examples&quot;>;SMART 目标示例&lt;/a>;和&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-define-your-smart-marketing-goals&quot;>;SMART 目标模板&lt;/a>;帮助您入门。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3.确定您的 KPI。&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;接下来，为您的 SMART 目标设置&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/choosing-kpis&quot;>;关键绩效指标 (KPI)&lt;/a>; 。 KPI 是可量化的数据点，可用于根据目标衡量实际绩效。&lt;/p>; &lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse:collapse; width: 100%; height: 884px; border-width: 0px; border-style :solid;&quot;>; &lt;tbody>; &lt;tr style=&quot;height: 65px;&quot;>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50%; height: 65px;&quot;>;智能目标&lt;/td>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50% ; height: 65px;&quot;>;相关 kpi&lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;tr style=&quot;height: 149px;&quot;>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50%; height: 149px;&quot;>;品牌知名度&lt;/td>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50%; height: 149px;&quot;>;网站流量、社交媒体关注者、订阅注册、提及（客户和合作伙伴）&lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;tr style=&quot;height: 65px;&quot;>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50%; height: 65px;&quot;>;收入&lt;/td>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50%; height: 65px;&quot;>;每日销售额、网站流量&lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;tr style=&quot;height: 177px;&quot;>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50%; height: 177px;&quot;>;转化&lt;/td>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50%; height: 177px; &quot;>;转化率、购物车放弃率、相关运费趋势、竞争性价格趋势&lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;tr style=&quot;height: 121px;&quot;>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50%; height: 121px;&quot;>;品牌忠诚度&lt;/td>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50%; height: 121px;&quot;>;回头客、促销员、产品评论、推荐&lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;tr style=&quot;height: 93px;&quot;>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50%; height: 93px;&quot;>;客户参与度&lt;/td>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50%; height: 93px;&quot;>;点赞、分享、关注、提及、反向链接&lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;tr style=&quot;height: 121px;&quot;>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50%; height: 121px;&quot;>;融洽和信任&lt;/td>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50%; height: 121px;&quot;>;回头客、推广者、关注者、提及&lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;tr style=&quot;height: 93px;&quot;>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50%; height: 93px;&quot;>;战略合作伙伴&lt;/td>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50%; height: 93px;&quot;>;新的合作伙伴关系、提及、反向链接&lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/tbody>; &lt;/table>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;4. 确定内容类型和内容格式。&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;接下来，您需要选择要创建的内容类型以及最常用的内容格式。&lt;/p>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;溢出：隐藏；宽度：100%；高度：自动；内边距：0px；最大宽度：650px；最小宽度：256px；显示：块；边距：自动;&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-content-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;div style=&quot;position:relative;溢出：隐藏；最大宽度：100%；底部填充：56.25%；边距：0px;&quot;>; &lt;iframe style=&quot;位置：绝对；顶部：0px；左：0px；宽度：100%；高度：100%；边框：无；&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PfDwKjgL8tY?feature=oembed&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowedfullscreen>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;/div >; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;内容类型是您计划生成的内容的大致类别。内容格式是内容类型中的具体呈现方法。例如，博客文章是一种内容类型，而博客可以包含列表文章、操作方法、思想领导力、产品评论等内容格式。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;要开始使用，请运行 &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing /company-content-audit&quot;>;内容审核&lt;/a>;，了解哪种内容已经引起了客户的共鸣。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;您可能还想做一些&lt;a href=&quot;https:// blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitive-analysis-kit&quot;>;competitive analysis&lt;/a>; and take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-buyers-journey -guide&quot;>;industry trends&lt;/a>;. This research can help you figure out what content strategy will work best for your business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, take a look back at the various types of content we reviewed earlier and your target audience research to decide on content types and formats.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Choose your content channels.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Once you&#39;ve decided on the type of content you&#39;ll market with, it&#39;s time to choose your specific content channels. Where will you share your content? Where will it live and be shared from?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For some of the content types, the channel you need to work with will be obvious. For example, if you&#39;re creating Facebook content, your channel will be the social platform itself.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;6. Set a budget.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Now, set your budget. Think about the type of content you&#39;re creating and which channels you&#39;re marketing that content on.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, ask yourself the following questions to figure out your budget:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Do you need to purchase any software or technology to create the content (such as graphic design software like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html&quot;>;Adobe Photoshop&lt;/a>;, a subscription to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canva.com/&quot;>;Canva&lt;/a>;, a camera to take high-quality photos and videos)?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Do you need to hire any content marketers or designers (such as artists, writers, editors, designers)?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Do you need to pay for ad space?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Do you need access to specific tools or resources to enhance or measure your specific type of content?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Make note of how your responses impact your budget — whether that&#39;s an increase or decrease in what you may have already estimated.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;7. Create a content publishing schedule.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;To ensure you&#39;re consistently producing content and sharing it with your prospects and customers, use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar&quot;>;social media calendar&lt;/a>; or an &lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/editorial-calendar-templates&quot;>;editorial content calendar&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This will help your team stay on top of all the content your team is creating as well as allow you to schedule it ahead of time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/editorial-calendar-templates&quot;>;&lt;em>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/editorial-calendar-templates-content-strategy.webp?width=458&amp;amp;height=361&amp;amp;name=editorial-calendar-templates-content-strategy.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Content marketing for business template, free editorial calendar&quot; width=&quot;458&quot; height=&quot;361&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 458px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Use a &lt;/em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/editorial-calendar-templates&quot;>;&lt;em>;free editorial calendar&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;em>; to schedule and optimize your marketing content and help boost conversions.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;6. Create and distribute the content.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Create and distribute your content so your audience members can consume it — and possibly convert.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This step is about more than creating high-quality content. Keep learning to make your content as useful and engaging as you can. Practice writing headlines, make the most of the latest content trends, and build skills in the media that your audience favors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Next, optimize your content so it&#39;s easy for your audience to find. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo&quot;>;SEO&lt;/a>; is a useful skill for searchability. And every social media platform is unique, so check out tips to succeed on channels like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/instagram-marketing&quot;>;Instagram&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/marketers-guide-to-tiktok&quot;>;TikTok&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/23454/the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-for-mastering-linkedin.aspx&quot;>;LinkedIn&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, promote your content on email, social media, and more.

Analyze and measure results.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Lastly, analyze and measure your results so you can make any necessary changes to enhance your content marketing efforts and reach more audience members.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Look at your SMART goals and KPIs to track the success of your content marketing strategy.

Let&#39;s find out.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Traits of Effective Content Marketing&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;With so many companies creating and publishing content online, it&#39;s essential to go beyond your standard industry fare. A secret? HubSpot strives to meet the following criteria to make sure all our content meets your and other readers&#39; needs.结果？ Millions of visits to our blog posts and web pages per month.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can achieve similar results for your company if your content:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Provides value beyond your product offerings.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Content marketing isn&#39;t just about sharing your products&#39; virtues to get readers to become a customer. It&#39;s important to offer value that empowers your customers to do something more efficiently, such as making their businesses more profitable or shortening their morning routine.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whatever the case may be, strive to create content that gives a solution for your customer&#39;s most urgent needs. Your product may be a solution, but if you&#39;re not explicitly writing a product page, you should only incorporate product mentions if they make sense.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://curlsmith.com/blogs/curl-academy/hair-protein-moisture-balance&quot;>;blog post below&lt;/a>;, hair care brand Curlsmith helps readers understand how to reach the right balance between high-protein and high-moisture products. It doesn&#39;t mention its products until the very end, instead educating the reader first.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/traits-of-effective-content-marketing-curlsmith.jpeg?width=650&amp;amp;name=traits-of-effective-content-marketing-curlsmith.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;traits of effective content marketing: curlsmith blog post&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Targets readers&#39; specific buying journey stage.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Providing value and answering customers&#39; needs is only a part of the story. In each piece of content, you should also target your customers&#39;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-for-every-funnel-stage&quot;>; specific buyer&#39;s journey stage&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generally, there are three stages of the buyer&#39;s journey: Awareness, consideration, and decision. In the awareness stage, buyers are still researching their issue. In the consideration stage, they&#39;re researching solutions. In the decision stage, they&#39;re about to pick a provider.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re writing a &quot;What is [X]?&quot; post, then the person who&#39;s reading that article is likely not ready to make a decision about their provider. They are still in the awareness stage, completing research so that they can find out who offers a solution.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conversely, if you&#39;re writing a product page, then the reader who visits that page has already researched potential products and found you as a possible provider. That means you should pitch your product at every turn, reiterating your &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/write-value-proposition&quot;>;value proposition&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/product-differentiation&quot;>;differentiating yourself&lt;/a>; from the competition. You shouldn&#39;t be shy about your products&#39; most valuable features.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Demonstrates a consistent brand voice and image.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/traits-of-effective-content-marketing-hubspot.jpeg?width=650&amp;amp;name=traits-of-effective-content-marketing-hubspot.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;traits of effective content marketing: hubspot brand voice deck&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x7wtZuBNYroycRrZF2WYaowuLEwpDrqqL8pbolJ7AdY/edit#slide=id.g13049079b58_0_279&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;>;Image Source&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter if you&#39;re creating a blog post, web page, or ebook, your visitors should be able to tell who you are immediately upon consuming your content. Your brand shouldn&#39;t sound as if ten different people are writing for you, even if that may be the case.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s why it&#39;s critical to create both a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31247/the-simple-template-for-a-thorough-content-style-guide.aspx&quot;>;writing style guide&lt;/a>; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/examples-brand-style-guides&quot;>;brand style guide&lt;/a>;. Both of these documents will confirm that:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Your brand visuals look the same across all platforms and devices.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Your brand tone and voice sound the same across all written communications.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Once you create both of these, share them with both your content writers and your freelance or in-house designers. Your content marketing publications will be much more cohesive and consistent, which will keep readers coming back to you as a resource and make you look more polished and professional.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Is timely and engaging.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Do your customers typically plan their financials at the start of the year? If you&#39;re a finance startup, you might publish a blog post in January about budgeting quarter-over-quarter to prevent clerical errors and avoid overspending.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the post, you might include a prompt to check out your software, or lead users to a template they can download after providing their email.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is one example of content marketing that is timely and engaging. If you know your customer&#39;s behavioral and spending patterns throughout the year, it&#39;s critical to capitalize on that.

&lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h3>;How to Use Gender Neutral Pronouns&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In English, &quot;He&quot; is often used as an automatic fill-in for generic individuals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;He&quot; and &quot;she&quot; are also two extreme binaries that don&#39;t leave room for other gender identities, which can be hurtful for transgender, nonbinary, and gender queer communities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ultimately, you probably don&#39;t want to make incorrect or hurtful assumptions about someone&#39;s gender — they could be agender, nonbinary, or uncomfortable identifying with “he” or “she.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gender-neutral language ensures your sentences are inclusive of everyone. But, when in doubt, refer to someone by their name rather than &quot;him&quot; or &quot;her.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/&quot;>;They&lt;/a>;&quot; is one of the more common gender-neutral pronouns, and it&#39;s easy to incorporate into your daily conversations. Here are some examples of how to use it:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&quot;I spoke to the marketing director and they said they&#39;d get back to me.&quot;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&quot;I think someone left their laptop behind.&quot;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&quot;Who&#39;s in charge of that campaign? I&#39;ll email them.&quot;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s go over some examples of how you&#39;d use other pronouns in conversation.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Ze/hir/hirs&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;“Where did ze go?”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;“This pencil belongs to hir.”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;“Ze would rather do it hirself.”&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h4>;Xe/xem/Xirs&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;“I think xe is nice.”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;“Tell xem I say hello.”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;“That sandwich is xirs.”&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h4>;Ver/vir/Vis&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;“I think ver is nice.”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;“I borrowed vis pencil.”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;“I went to the store with vir.”&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h4>;Te/tem/ter&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;“Te went to the store.”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;“I borrowed it from tem.”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;“That&#39;s ter dog.”&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h4>;Ey/em/eir&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;“Ey wrote me a note.”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;“That belongs to em.”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;“I asked to borrow eir pencil.”&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;Gender Neutral Pronoun Considerations&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;1. How to Learn Someone&#39;s Pronouns&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Upon first meeting someone, most people agree it&#39;s best not to outright ask for pronouns because someone may feel like you&#39;re assuming their gender identity. In some cases, it may put someone in a situation where they have to out themselves but don&#39;t want to or aren&#39;t ready to.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instead, introduce yourself with &lt;em>;your&lt;/em>; pronouns: &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Caroline, and my pronouns are she/her.&quot; With this, you&#39;re allowing the other person to share theirs, but not forcing them to.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you do ask, there are ways to do so respectfully. For example, in a work meeting, you could say, “Before we start, I&#39;d like to go around and share our names and pronouns if you&#39;re comfortable sharing.” Then, people have the option to share or not to share.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During a one-on-one conversation, you could introduce yourself and share your pronouns first or say, “What are your pronouns?” or “Can you remind me of your pronouns?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You could also include your pronouns in an email signature, social media profiles, or professional pages.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you don&#39;t ask for pronouns, it&#39;s best to default to addressing someone by name. While many people consider they/them to be a gender-neutral option, some people may feel misgendered by it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Featured Read: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrc.org/resources/why-we-ask-each-other-our-pronouns&quot;>;Why We Ask Each Other Our Pronouns&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Aim to shy away from saying “preferred pronouns.”&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Despite the popularity of the term “preferred pronouns,” it can be alienating as it can imply someone&#39;s gender is a preference.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As mentioned, you don&#39;t always want to ask someone about their pronouns and can instead share yours first. But, if you are asking, you can say any of the following instead of “preferred pronouns”:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;“What are your pronouns?”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How would you like me to refer to you?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How would you like to be addressed?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Featured Read: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gendercensus.com/results/2023-worldwide/&quot;>;Gender Census 2023 Worldwide Report&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. What if someone uses multiple pronouns?&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;People might use multiple pronouns, like she/they or they/hirs. If someone shares that with you, they might also say they&#39;re more comfortable with one over the other, or they&#39;d like you to vary the pronouns you use in conversation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That may seem challenging, but you&#39;ve likely already done it before. For example, “He was late to work yesterday, so she had to lead the meeting.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An example of how this would look in a conversation with someone using multiple pronouns is, “She went to the doctor because their cough hadn&#39;t gone away for a few days.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Featured Read: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.them.us/story/multiple-sets-of-pronouns&quot;>;How To Affirm the People in Your Life Who Use Multiple Sets of Pronouns&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. How do you use gender neutral pronouns with titles and honorifics?&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;An honorific or title describes someone&#39;s position in life or professional settings. Mrs., Mr., and Sir are examples of common honorifics, and there are gender neutral variations of them that someone might use:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Mx. (the most common gender neutral honorific)&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Pr. (derived from person)&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Msr. (a mix of miss and sir)&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Misc. (miscellaneous)&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Not everyone chooses a gender neutral honorific, so it&#39;s best to follow their lead. If they share one, use it; if they don&#39;t, you can avoid using one entirely.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Featured Read: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theequalityinstitute.com/equality-insights-blog/non-traditional-honorifics-and-why-they-matter&quot;>;Gender Neutral Titles and Why They Matter&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Should I correct other people who make a mistake?&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Some people won&#39;t want to call attention to someone making a mistake, but others will appreciate you correcting people for them. If you have more of a relationship with the person who is misgendered, you can ask them directly what they&#39;d like you to do, or you can say something like: “[Persons name] uses [pronoun],” and then continue the conversation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you don&#39;t know someone&#39;s preference and still want to support them, you can make sure you use the right pronouns if you talk about them. For example, if someone says, “He made an excellent point,” you could say, “I agree ze did make a good point.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Featured Read: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.folxhealth.com/library/misgendering-guide/&quot;>;Misgendering Guide&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;6. You don&#39;t have to ask everyone for their pronouns.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;There are some cases where there is no need to ask for pronouns at all. For example, a brief encounter with a server at a restaurant doesn&#39;t necessarily require knowing their pronouns, which is why defaulting to calling someone by their name is considered a best practice.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Featured Read: &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/5748649/word-of-year-they-merriam-webster/&quot;>;This Is Why Singular &#39;They&#39; Is Such a Controversial Subject&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;7.

Define your goal.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;What&#39;s your aim for developing a content marketing plan? Why do you want to produce content and create a content marketing plan?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It may seem obvious, but these questions are the core of a useful content strategy. Look at high-level business goals, notes from meetings, and notes from your team, then do some solo research to make sure your goals have staying power.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Organize goals by priority.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Once you have a list of goals, rank them from most to least important. This can help you decide which parts of your strategy are an immediate need and which are for long-term action. This step can also help with resource questions later in the process.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Use the SMART framework to define goals.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/smart-goal-examples&quot;>;SMART framework&lt;/a>; can help you make broad goals more specific and actionable.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Know your goals before you begin planning, and you&#39;ll have an easier time determining what&#39;s best for your strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-determine-your-smart-marketing-goals&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;em>;Download this goal planning template for help figuring out the right content goals.&lt;/em>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;2. Conduct persona research.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;To develop a successful plan, you need to clearly define your content&#39;s target audience — also known as your &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research&quot;>;buyer persona&lt;/a>;. This is a crucial part of the planning phase of content strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is especially important for those who are new to marketing. By knowing your target audience, you can produce more relevant and valuable content that they&#39;ll want to read and convert on.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Collect data and analyze it to find patterns.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If you don&#39;t already have defined personas, you&#39;ll want to analyze your data to find who you want to create content for and the types of content they enjoy. This post has some useful tips for &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research&quot;>;how to create buyer personas&lt;/a>; using your data.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As you analyze metrics like contact trends and demographics, group your leads by what they have in common first. Then, look closely at these groups to find other similarities.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Use your research to refine buyer personas.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re an experienced marketer, your target may have changed. Do you want to target a new group of people or expand your current target market? Do you want to keep the same target audience?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Revisiting your audience parameters by conducting market research each year is crucial to growing your audience. Taking a closer look at your current &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-segmentation&quot;>;customer segments&lt;/a>; can also help you refine your personas.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;strong>;Featured Tool:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona&quot;>; Buyer Persona Generator&lt;/a>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;3. Run a content audit.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Early on, many brands start with blog posts or social media. If you want to venture out into different formats, you can run a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/company-content-audit&quot;>;content audit&lt;/a>; to assess your top-performing and lowest-performing content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;ve been in business for a while, you should review your content marketing efforts and last year&#39;s results.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Find topic and formatting gaps.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As you review your content, be sure to record page titles, content formats, word counts, and a summary of what your content covers. This can help you find areas for improvement.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Review content for quality and relevance.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Next, analyze content quality and whether your content reflects what&#39;s most important to your audience. Then, use that information to inform which direction you take next.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Look for repurposing opportunities.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;There are many ways to repurpose content. And, this strategy can help you optimize your content on multiple channels. It might mean grabbing your most popular blogs and creating YouTube videos, an ebook, or launching a podcast with that content.

Your &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-workflow&quot;>;content workflow&lt;/a>; impacts how you come up with ideas, what you publish, and the quality of your work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Do you have a strategic workflow in place or is your workflow organized around the habits of your team? An audit can help you see blocks and slow-downs that can affect your content long-term.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Use your content audit to figure out what you can do differently in the upcoming year and set new goals. Now is also a great time to align your team&#39;s goals with the rest of your organization&#39;s goals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whatever stage you&#39;re in, a content audit will help you decide what resonates best with your audience, find gaps in your topic clusters, and process and brainstorm fresh content ideas.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;4. Choose a content management system.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A few vital parts of content management include content creation, content publication, and content analytics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You want to invest in a CMS to create, manage, and track your content in an easy and sustainable way.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Figure out specific CMS needs.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Finding the right CMS for your team may take some time. First, talk to your team about their current processes to get a sense of the top features you&#39;ll need. Then, start researching the best CMS for your needs with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/website/best-cms-systems&quot;>;this list&lt;/a>;. A CMS for a business should be easy to use, customizable, secure, and cost-effective.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Choose the right content management system.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;With the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms-free&quot;>;HubSpot CMS&lt;/a>;, you can plan, produce, publish, and measure your results all in one place.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another popular CMS is WordPress, to which you can add the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/products/wordpress&quot;>;HubSpot WordPress plugin&lt;/a>; for free web forms, live chat, CRM access, email marketing, and analytics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/comparisons/best-cms&quot;>;list of the best content management systems&lt;/a>; offers a comparison between the tools above and other popular choices.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Adopt a content governance model.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As you get to know your new CMS, be sure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-governance-model&quot;>;put a content governance model in place&lt;/a>;. This is a process to manage content creation, publishing, and maintenance. It helps you make sure that each piece of content aligns with business standards and policies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As your content presence grows, this model will also help you create processes for updating and removing outdated content.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;5. Determine which type of content you want to create.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;There are a variety of options out there for content you can create, from written content like ebooks and blog posts to audio content like podcasts. Great content strategy is a balance of decision-making, data analysis, and risk-taking. Those skills will all be put to the test in this step.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Review personas and goals.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;You may need different types of content for different personas and goals. Take a careful look at your end goals and the actions you want each persona to take. Then, work backward to choose the right kind of content for each goal and user.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, say you&#39;re trying to decide between &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-vs-podcast&quot;>;starting a blog or a podcast&lt;/a>;. Blogs tend to be better for conversion, while podcasts are great for building brand awareness. Your goals and audience should be the deciding factor for which is best for your business.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Assess your resources.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Use a critical eye when you&#39;re reviewing the resources you have for content production. Questions like the ones below can help you narrow your focus and create a sustainable content strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;How big is your team?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How much time does your team have to create content?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What skills does your current team have?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What types of content would you need training on and what would you need to outsource?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What is your content budget?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h4>;Choose the right topics, formats, and channels for your content.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Using your personas, choose a set number of high-level topics to focus your content on. Then, using your audience and topic choices, narrow down your chosen content formats and channels.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, say your team is launching a video channel, but they don&#39;t have a lot of experience. You might consider creating video shorts. But if rankings for that topic tend to be long-form videos or podcasts, you&#39;ll want to think about that decision — do you want to stand out and hope your audience pivots to a new format? Or should you get help creating the content you think will top the current competitive landscape for your topic?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once you&#39;ve made these big decisions about your content strategy, you&#39;ll be ready to get into the details.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;6. Brainstorm content ideas.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Use your content audit, persona research, and goals to make the best content decisions for your business. A quick review of this information before brainstorming can help you keep these insights top of mind.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Use a range of brainstorming approaches.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Next, it&#39;s time to start coming up with ideas for your next content project.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are some tools to get the juices flowing.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;1.&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedly.com/i/welcome&quot;>; Feedly&lt;/a>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;The Feedly RSS feed is a wonderful way to track trendy topics in your industry and find content ideas at the same time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You start by telling the software what topics you&#39;re most interested in and its AI tool will do the rest.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You won&#39;t need to scour the internet to find new content ideas anymore. Instead, you can go through your curated list, compiled from news sites, newsletters, and social media.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;2.&lt;a href=&quot;https://buzzsumo.com/&quot;>; BuzzSumo&lt;/a>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Want to discover popular content and content ideas? This company offers several market research tools, one of which uses social media shares to figure out if a piece of content is popular and well-liked.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This information helps you see which content ideas would do well if you were to create content about them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;3.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.impactbnd.com/blog-title-generator/blogabout&quot;>; BlogAbout&lt;/a>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;Get your mind gears going with IMPACT&#39;s blog title generator. This tool works a bit like Mad Libs, but instead of joke sentences, it shows you common headline formats with blanks where you can fill in the subject you have in mind.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This brainstorming technique helps you put general ideas in contexts that would be appealing to your target audience. Once you have a headline you like, BlogAbout lets you add it to your &quot;Notebook&quot; so you can save your best ideas.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;4.&lt;a href=&quot;http://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer&quot;>; CoSchedule Headline Analyzer&lt;/a>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;You can get blog post ideas for an entire &lt;em>;year&lt;/em>; with&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/blog-topic-generator&quot;>; HubSpot&#39;s Blog Ideas Generator&lt;/a>;. All you need to do is enter general topics or terms you&#39;d like to write about, and this content idea generator does all the work for you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This tool analyzes headlines and titles and gives feedback on length, word choice, grammar, and keyword search volume.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you have an idea in mind, run a few title options through the Headline Analyzer to see how you could make it stronger, and to move your idea further along in the brainstorming process.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;5.&lt;a href=&quot;https://website.grader.com/&quot;>; HubSpot&#39;s Website Grader&lt;/a>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;This is a great tool to use when you want to see where you&#39;re at with your website and SEO efforts. The Website Grader grades you on vital areas of your website performance and sends you a detailed report to help you optimize.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With this tool, you can figure out how to make your website more SEO-friendly and discover areas of improvement.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Refine and rank your ideas.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The brainstorming process should be loose and unstructured. It can be tempting to jump on an idea and start creating content right away. But instead, try to throw out your wildest ideas and see where they lead.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, take that list of content ideas and refine them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To start, break ideas into groups and organize them around your goals, topics, or personas. Then, review each idea in detail and add specifics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, say your topic is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/stories/artificial-intelligence&quot;>;AI&lt;/a>;. One of your content ideas might be image generation. You can break this idea down further, with content for image-generation tools, text-to-image prompts, or how to edit existing images. Another way to refine content ideas is to conduct &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht&quot;>;keyword research&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can also define your process for refining ideas in your &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-workflow&quot;>;content workflow&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;7. Publish and manage your content.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Your marketing plan should go beyond the types of content you&#39;ll create — it should also cover how you&#39;ll organize your content.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Develop a content calendar.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;With the help of an editorial calendar, you&#39;ll be on the right track to publishing a well-balanced and diverse content library on your website. Then, create a social media content calendar to promote and manage your content on other sites.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;Featured Tool:&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/editorial-calendar-templates&quot;>; Free Editorial Calendar Templates&lt;/a>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/editorial-calendar-templates&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/editorial-calendar-templates-content-strategy.webp?width=458&amp;amp;height=361&amp;amp;name=editorial-calendar-templates-content-strategy.webp&quot; alt=&quot;editorial calendar templates, content marketing templates&quot; width=&quot;458&quot; height=&quot;361&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 458px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/editorial-calendar-templates&quot;>;Download for Free&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Optimize your content for reach.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Many of the ideas you think of will be evergreen (ie: just as relevant months or years from now as they are today). That being said, you shouldn&#39;t ignore timely topics either. While they may not be the bulk of your editorial calendar, they can help you generate spikes of traffic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, most people count on incorporating popular holidays, like New Year&#39;s, in their marketing efforts.

It can sometimes be difficult to get the resources you need to test a risky idea. Data-driven insights can support your case for trying new ideas with your content strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Questions to Ask When Creating a Content Strategy&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;When you develop a content strategy, there are a few questions to answer. Let&#39;s dive into those now.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;1. Who will be reading your content?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Who&#39;s the target audience for your content? For how many audiences are you creating content?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just as your business might have more than one type of customer, your content strategy can cater to more than one type of user.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using a variety of content types and channels will help you deliver content that&#39;s tailored to each persona.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;2. What problem will you be solving for your audience(s)?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Ideally, your product or service solves a problem you know your audience has. By the same token, your content coaches and educates your audience through this problem as they begin to notice and address it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A sound content strategy supports people on both sides of your product: those who are still figuring out what their main challenges are, and those who are already using your product to overcome these challenges.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your content reinforces the solution(s) you&#39;re offering and helps you build credibility with your target audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;3. What makes you unique?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Your competitors likely have a similar product as yours, which means your potential customers need to know what makes yours better — or, at least, different.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maybe your main asset is that your company has been established for many years. Or perhaps you have a unique brand voice that makes you stand out from your competitors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To prove why you&#39;re worth buying from, you need to prove why you&#39;re worth listening to. Once you figure that out, permeate that message in your content.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;4. What content formats will you focus on?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;To figure out what formats to focus on, you need to meet your audience where they are.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While you may to tempted to launch a podcast since it&#39;s grown so much in the last few years, or launch a YouTube channel, find out first where your audience lives.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Otherwise, you may waste time creating content that either won&#39;t reach your audience or capture their attention.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once you choose the best formats, start &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/business-templates/project-budget&quot;>;creating a budget&lt;/a>; to assess what resources you can allocate to execute this strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;5. What channels will you publish on?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Just as you can create content in different formats, you&#39;ll also have various channels you can publish to, from your website to social media.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This part of your content strategy, again, will show where your audience lives. If your audience prefers long-form video content, you may opt to publish your content on YouTube. If you have a younger audience that likes quick content, you may opt for TikTok and Instagram.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;6. How will you manage content creation and publication?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Figuring out how you&#39;ll create and publish all your content can be a daunting task.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before you execute, it&#39;s important to establish:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Who&#39;s creating what.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Where it&#39;s being published.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;When it&#39;s going live.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;In a small team, this may be easy enough as you may be the sole decision-maker. As your company grows, you may need to collaborate with several content teams to figure out an effective process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s content strategies prevent clutter by managing content from a &lt;em>;topic&lt;/em>; standpoint. When planning a &lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/editorial-calendar-templates&quot;>;content editorial calendar&lt;/a>; around topics, you can easily visualize your company&#39;s message and assert yourself as an authority in your market over time.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Content Strategy Template&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Ready to get started with your own content marketing strategy?&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/content-marketing-training-workbook&quot;>; Download this helpful workbook.&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/content-marketing-training-workbook&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-marketing-workbook-content-strategy.webp?width=400&amp;amp;height=519&amp;amp;name=content-marketing-workbook-content-strategy.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Content strategy template, marketing workbook&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;519&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 400px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It includes key readings and activities to help you fine-tune your plan and develop a robust strategy. You&#39;ll learn how to:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Generate content ideas.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Create topic clusters and pillar pages.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Promote your content.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Repurpose your content based on your needs.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Content Marketing Strategy Examples&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To understand what a content strategy is, let&#39;s explore some examples of real-life content strategies based on a few business goals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s start with &lt;strong>;Evernote&lt;/strong>;, a note-taking app, that developed an SEO-driven content strategy to attract new prospects to their website.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m a huge fan of Evernote&#39;s blog, which offers a wealth of knowledge on the topic of productivity. The blog post,&lt;a href=&quot;https://evernote.com/blog/discipline-when-times-are-tough/&quot;>; How To Stay Disciplined When Times Are Tough&lt;/a>;, made me laugh out loud — and incentivized me to grab a pen and write down some of the tips I liked best.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But &lt;em>;why&lt;/em>; is a company that sells a note-taking app writing about discipline?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because it&#39;s how I found their website when I searched &quot;How to stay disciplined&quot; on Google.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People interested in reading content related to productivity are likely the &lt;em>;same&lt;/em>; people interested in downloading Evernote&#39;s note-taking product.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the contrary, if Evernote&#39;s marketing team simply created content for the sake of increasing traffic — like publishing &quot;Our 10 Favorite Beyonce Songs&quot; — it wouldn&#39;t be considered a content &lt;em>;strategy&lt;/em>; at all, it would just be content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A strategy needs to align content with business goals. In Evernote&#39;s case, the strategy aligns content (blog posts on productivity) with the business goal of attracting leads (people interested in note-taking) to their site.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s take a look at another example to see how a good content strategy can help businesses with sales enablement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider the following scenario: A prospect calls a sales representative at Wistia and asks questions related to &lt;strong>;Wistia&lt;/strong>;&#39;s video hosting service. As the Wistia sales rep speaks with her, he learns her business is using a few other tools to convert leads into sales, including Intercom.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bingo.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once the call ends, the sales rep sends the prospect a follow-up email with a blog post about&lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/learn/product-updates/wistia-intercom-integration&quot;>; Wistia&#39;s integration with Intercom&lt;/a>;, which enables Intercom users to further personalize messages to prospects based on video-watching data they collect through Wistia.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a prime example of how you might use a content strategy as a sales enablement tool.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the surface, it might seem odd that Wistia has dedicated content about &lt;em>;another &lt;/em>;business tool. However, this content is a great resource for Wistia&#39;s sales team, particularly when prospects have concerns about how Wistia&#39;s product can integrate with their existing software or processes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that we&#39;ve explored a few examples of content strategies, let&#39;s dive into content tactics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Putting a content strategy in place means that you need a firm understanding of content tactics.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Content strategy or content tactics?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Content tactics are the actions you take to deliver your content strategy. Content strategy defines the why and how of your content programming as a whole. Content tactics define the types of content you create and how you create each piece of content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both are important to a successful content marketing program.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are the eight most popular types of content marketing you can create for your readers and customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;1. Blog Posts&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If you haven&#39;t already noticed, you&#39;re currently reading a blog post. Blog posts live on a website and should be published regularly to attract new visitors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Posts should offer valuable content for your audience that makes them inclined to share posts on social media and across other websites.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We recommend that blog posts be between 1,000 and 2,000 words in length, but you should experiment to see if your audience prefers longer or shorter reads.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;strong>;Featured Tool:&lt;/strong>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/blog-post-templates&quot;>;&lt;strong>; 6 Free Blog Post Templates&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/blog-post-templates&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blog-templates-content-strategy.webp?width=450&amp;amp;height=450&amp;amp;name=blog-templates-content-strategy.webp&quot; alt=&quot;blog post templates, content marketing templates&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Check out our&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/blog-post-templates&quot;>; free blog post templates&lt;/a>; for writing great how-to, listicle, curation, SlideShare presentation, and newsjacking posts on your own blog.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;2. Ebooks&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Ebooks are lead-generation tools that website visitors download after submitting a lead form with their contact information. They&#39;re typically longer, more in-depth, and published less often than blog posts, which are written to attract visitors to a website.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But ebooks aren&#39;t only effective for the top of the funnel.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Nora Leary, Growth Director at&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ironpaper.com/&quot;>; Ironpaper, Inc&lt;/a>;., notes, &quot;Ebooks serve different purposes at varying stages in the buyer&#39;s journey.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She told me, &quot;Awareness-level ebooks help educate the prospect about a certain pain point and are an excellent lead capture tool. The content should remain introductory and informational.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leary adds, &quot;Ebooks can convert leads in the funnel by offering them useful tools as prospects consider their needs more in-depth. An ebook here might dive deeper into a particular problem and solution options and include templates or calculators.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;[Lastly,] ebooks further down the funnel should become more personalized and offer more sales content. Comparison guides or an ebook of case studies are beneficial for prospects at this stage.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ebooks are the next step in the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/inbound-marketing&quot;>; inbound marketing process&lt;/a>;. After reading a blog post, such as this one, visitors might want more information.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is where&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-examples&quot;>; calls-to-action&lt;/a>; (CTAs) come into play, directing people to a landing page where they can submit their contact information and download an ebook to learn more valuable information for their business. In turn, the business producing the ebook has a new lead for the sales team to contact.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;strong>;Featured Tool:&lt;/strong>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/ebook-templates&quot;>;&lt;strong>; 18 Free Ebook Templates&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/ebook-templates&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ebook-templates-content-strategy.webp?width=525&amp;amp;height=315&amp;amp;name=ebook-templates-content-strategy.webp&quot; alt=&quot;18 free ebook templates, content marketing templates&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 525px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/ebook-templates&quot;>;Download for Free&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;3. Case Studies&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A case study allows you to tell a customer story and build credibility in the process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A case study is perhaps your most versatile type of content marketing because it can take many different forms — some of which are on this list. That&#39;s right, case studies can take the form of a blog post, ebook, podcast, or even an infographic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The goal is to show how your product helped real-life companies succeed. Before choosing a customer for a case study, narrow in on the business area you&#39;re trying to drive value for.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;strong>;Featured Tool:&lt;/strong>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/case-study-templates&quot;>;&lt;strong>; 3 Free Case Study Templates&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/case-study-templates&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/case-study-templates-content-strategy.webp?width=350&amp;amp;height=466&amp;amp;name=case-study-templates-content-strategy.webp&quot; alt=&quot;3 free business case study templates&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;466&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 350px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/case-study-templates&quot;>;Download for Free&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;4. Templates&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/content-creation-templates&quot;>;Templates&lt;/a>; are effective content marketing examples to try because they generate leads while offering tremendous value to your audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you offer your audience templates to save them time and help them succeed, they&#39;re more likely to engage with your content in the future.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;5. Infographics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Infographics can organize and visualize data in a more compelling way than words alone.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are great content formats to use if you&#39;re trying to share a lot of data in a way that is clear and easy to understand.&lt;/p>; &lt;h5>;&lt;strong>;Featured Tool:&lt;/strong>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/infographic-templates&quot;>;&lt;strong>; 15 Free Infographic Templates&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/infographic-templates&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/infographic-templates-content-strategy.webp?width=600&amp;amp;height=388&amp;amp;name=infographic-templates-content-strategy.webp&quot; alt=&quot;15 free infographic templates, content strategy templates&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;388&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re ready to get started, get our templates for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/infographic-templates&quot;>;creating beautiful infographics&lt;/a>; in less than an hour.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;6.

People consider their attitude toward brands when choosing between competing products.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They read reviews, chat with customer support, compare options with friends, or sign up for a free trial. All of these touchpoints affect brand perception and impact a company&#39;s success.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If consumers think highly of a brand, they become more loyal.

Alternatively, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/advertising?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=%20advertising&quot;>;advertising&lt;/a>;is the process of creating persuasive messages around these broad goals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of campaigns, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/digital-advertising?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=digital-advertising-certification&amp;amp;_ga=2.202528273.1297659820.1636758994-1495700724.1636758994&quot;>;advertising campaign&lt;/a>;might be one facet of a larger marketing campaign strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Say shoe brand Nike launched a campaign surrounding the release of a new product. Its advertising would only reflect one facet of its marketing strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The brand might also leverage email newsletters, social media, and paid search to meet its goal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that we understand the difference between advertising and marketing campaigns, here are a few more types of marketing campaigns you might run.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;p>;Marketers have a wealth of choices when deciding what kind of marketing campaign to build. So, how do you make the right choice?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-blog-marketing-industry-trends-report&quot;>;2023 Marketing Strategy and Trends Report&lt;/a>;, we found that data-informed marketing strategies have become the most popular type of marketing campaign. Brands also emphasize agile marketing and the ability to pivot in the types of campaigns they run.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Successful marketing campaigns continue to focus on social media marketing and brand-building. Companies have focused on online communities to drive more engagement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regardless of the type of campaign, the most popular marketing asset is video. This is followed by images, blog articles, infographics, podcasts, and other audio content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Video continuously has the highest ROI of any media format — a trend that remains strong in 2023. Marketers are continuing to invest more in video elements of marketing campaigns.&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;Marketing Campaign Components&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Multiple components go into the planning, execution, and results of a stellar marketing campaign. We&#39;ll discuss the most important components of campaigns below.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Goals and Key Progress Indicators (KPIs)&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;This component defines the end goal of your campaign. You&#39;ll develop specific, measurable goals. Then, you&#39;ll state which metrics will be used to track progress.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, your content creation campaign might be measured by organic traffic. Each post may aim to drive 1,000 views per month and 10 new contacts. These categories will be measured in Google Analytics and Looker.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Channel&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Where will your content and messaging be distributed? Let&#39;s say you&#39;re running a social media marketing campaign. You might prioritize growing the channels most relevant to your audience. You can also omit those where you&#39;re least likely to grow a loyal following.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Budget&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Not all marketing campaigns require an incremental budget, but many still do. Factor in the agency, advertising, and freelance costs. Then, factor these numbers into any ROI analysis for your campaign.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Content Formats&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Determine what kind of content you will be creating to fuel the campaign. It&#39;s common for marketers to include multiple content formats in a singular campaign. For example, a branding campaign could include &lt;a href=&quot;https://invideo.io/make/ad-maker/&quot;>;video ads&lt;/a>;, press releases, and guest blogs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Team&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Who are the individuals you&#39;re relying on to get the job done? Before kickstarting your campaign, designate people to work on every aspect of the campaign. You should know who handles copywriting, design, media buying, and reporting.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Creative Assets&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A great marketing campaign should have great creative assets to match. Whether it&#39;s a sleek website design or an interactive infographic, make sure your design is professional. All your assets should fit the purpose of the campaign.&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;How to Create a Successful Marketing Campaign&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Now, you might be wondering, “How do I get started from here?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, now is the time to plan your campaign. The campaign planning process will involve you mapping out your strategies and tactics. Your campaign plan should include a course of action. This document will list the required resources, assets, stakeholders, and measurable goals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s dive into what that process will look like in detail in the section below.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Planning Your Marketing Campaign&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;This step is crucial to the effectiveness of your marketing campaign. The planning stage will determine how you measure success and will guide your team when things go awry.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Use HubSpot&#39;s free marketing plan generator to outline your annual marketing strategy, identify your most important initiatives, and track metrics throughout the year.&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/how%20to%20create%20a%20marketing%20campaign_32023-3.png?width=600&amp;amp;height=369&amp;amp;name=how%20to%20create%20a%20marketing%20campaign_32023-3.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 600px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;369&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;Featured Resource: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-plan-template-generator?hubs_post-cta=inline-text&amp;amp;hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=Free%20Marketing%20Plan%20Generator&amp;amp;hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns&quot;>;Free Marketing Plan Generator&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1. Set a purpose and goal for your campaign.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s start simple. Why are you running this campaign? What would you like your campaign to accomplish for your business?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re having trouble defining your campaign purpose, start broad. Take a look at the goals below. Which one is most aligned with your own?&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Promote a new product or service.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Increase &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-awareness?_ga=2.29459327.15258776.1540221058-1384912595.1528309621&amp;amp;hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=brand%20awareness&quot;>;brand awareness&lt;/a>;.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Gather customer feedback or content.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Drive leads.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Generate revenue.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Boost user engagement.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Advertise an upcoming event.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;This is hardly a definitive list, but it gives you an idea of general business goals a campaign could help reach.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s take this broad campaign purpose and turn it into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/smart-goal-examples?_ga=2.29459327.15258776.1540221058-1384912595.1528309621&amp;amp;hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=SMART%20goal&quot;>;SMART goal&lt;/a>;. We&#39;ll use the third option as an example: Gather customer feedback or content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&quot;The goal of my marketing campaign is to gather user-generated content from 100 customers via a branded hashtag on Instagram featuring our new product line by December 31.&quot;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The goal is specific (user-generated content), measurable (100 customers), attainable (via a branded Instagram hashtag), relevant (featuring the new product line), and timely (by December 31).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;See how this broad campaign purpose instantly transforms into an actionable, attainable goal?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Pro tip: &lt;/strong>;Setting SMART Goals is simple when you have the right tools. Check out the free SMART Goal-Setting template below to get started on this critical piece of your marketing campaign.&lt;/p>; &lt;strong>;Featured Resource: &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-determine-your-smart-marketing-goals?hubs_post-cta=inline-text&amp;amp;hubs_signup-url=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns&amp;amp;hubs_signup-cta=Free%20SMART%20Goal-Setting%20Template&amp;amp;hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns&quot;>;Free SMART Goal-Setting Template&lt;/a>;&lt;/strong>; &lt;h4>;2. Establish how you&#39;ll measure your campaign.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This will look different for everyone depending on the channels you&#39;re leveraging and your end goal. You might measure email open rates, new Facebook likes, or product pre-orders. You can also track a combination of several helpful metrics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These answers will depend on your overarching campaign goal. Here are a few examples of metrics based on the campaign goals mentioned above.&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;For promoting a new product or service:&lt;/strong>; Pre-orders, sales, and upsells.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;For increasing brand awareness: &lt;/strong>;Sentiment, social mentions, and press mentions.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;For gathering customer feedback or content:&lt;/strong>; Social mentions and engagement.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;For generating revenue:&lt;/strong>; Leads, sales, and upsells.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;For boosting user engagement:&lt;/strong>; Blog shares, social shares, and email interactions.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;For advertising an upcoming event:&lt;/strong>; Ticket sales, vendor or entertainment bookings, and social mentions.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;If your campaign involves multiple marketing channels, it&#39;s wise to define how you&#39;ll measure your campaign on each medium.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, say I was running my user-generated content (UGC) campaign on social media, email, and our blog. First, I&#39;d define my key performance indicators (KPIs) for each medium, which may look like:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Instagram engagements (likes and comments) and profile tags.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Email open rates and click-through rates.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Blog views, click-throughs, and social shares.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Then, I&#39;d define my primary campaign KPI: Instagram-branded hashtag mentions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While the above KPIs indicate how well my campaign reaches and engages my audience, my primary KPI tells me how close I am to reaching my SMART goal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lastly, let&#39;s think about another question: What does &quot;success&quot; look like for your company? Sure, it&#39;s exciting to reach a predetermined goal, but that&#39;s not always possible. What (outside of your goal) would constitute success for you (or serve as a milestone)?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Pro tip:&lt;/strong>; When determining how you&#39;ll measure your campaign, consider setting up some checkpoints along the way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s say your campaign involves boosting brand awareness, and your goal is to reach 50 PR mentions by the end of the year. You can set benchmark notifications at 10, 25, and 40 mentions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This will remind you to keep pushing toward your ultimate goal and boost morale within your team. Checkpoints are a reminder that your hard work is paying off.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;3. Define your target audience.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Imagine constructing a bulletproof marketing campaign only to be met with crickets.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In that case, you might think you chose the wrong marketing medium or that your creative wit wasn&#39;t enough. However, the culprit may be your audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To resolve this problem, figure out what stage of the buyer&#39;s journey your campaign is targeting. Are you trying to bring in new customers? Are you attempting to gather feedback from existing clients?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are you marketing to those who recognize your brand? Or are you introducing a new brand identity altogether?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your marketing message will vary depending on whether your campaign audience is in the awareness, consideration, or decision stage. Even though your campaign may reach those outside your target audience, it&#39;s vital to design your campaign with a specific target in mind.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Next, identify your audience&#39;s interests and pain points. Here are &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-questions?_ga=2.194075949.1297659820.1636758994-1495700724.1636758994&amp;amp;hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=some%20questions&quot;>;some questions&lt;/a>; to ask yourself and your team to better understand your audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;What are my audience&#39;s general interests? What magazines do they read? What TV shows do they watch? How do they spend their free time?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Where does my audience hang out online? For what purpose do they use Instagram, Facebook, and other networks? Do they engage or merely browse?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What kind of content gets my audience&#39;s attention? Do they respond to straightforward sales messages? Would they rather consume witty, humorous content? What cultural references would they understand?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What kind of problems do they have that my product, service, or brand could solve?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Becoming well-acquainted with your campaign audience will help you confidently answer these questions and any others that may arise during the campaign.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Pro tip: &lt;/strong>;To uncover more about your audience, survey your existing and potential customers in your market. Then, use this data to create your buyer personas. You can even enter that data into a free buyer persona generator like the one below.&lt;/p>; &lt;strong>;Featured Resource: &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona?hubs_post-cta=inline-text&amp;amp;hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=Buyer%20Persona%20Generator&amp;amp;hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns&quot;>;Buyer Persona Generator&lt;/a>;&lt;/strong>; &lt;h4>;4. Set a concept for your campaign and get in contact with the right team.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Marketing campaigns require a mission, vision, and visual identity. Great campaigns are an offshoot of their parent brand — both visually and creatively. These campaigns stay consistent with the business brand while maintaining their own identity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When creating campaign assets, some businesses use an in-house team. Others opt for an agency. You can also hire a freelancer or contractor to complete a specific portion of the project, such as the copy or design.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Pro tip: &lt;/strong>;We recommend starting with your in-house team and moving forward from there. This team includes experts. They know your brand and can speak to what your campaign needs to succeed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This step will likely take the longest, as you&#39;ll be creating your campaign concept from scratch. Next, we&#39;ll dive into how you&#39;ll distribute your campaign assets and connect with your audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Featured Resource: &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/market-research-kit?hubs_post-cta=inline-text&amp;amp;hubs_signup-url=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns&amp;amp;hubs_signup-cta=Market%20Research%20Kit&amp;amp;hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns&quot;>;Market Research Kit&lt;/a>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Distributing Your Marketing Campaign&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Here, you&#39;ll focus on the public-facing part of your campaign. This is what your audience will see and when. If you&#39;ve combed through the previous section, you should have all the answers you need to guide you through.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;5. Choose the channels on which you&#39;ll run your campaign.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This choice depends on your audience preference, budget, and brand engagement levels.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take a look at the current media channels you use to promote your company. Which ones perform the best? Which ones allow you to pay for advertisements? Which ones have the best engagement? Most importantly, where are your customers hanging out?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Need a few ideas? Explore the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shonaliburke.com/peso-model-content-distribution-super-strategy/&quot;>;PESO&lt;/a>;model, which divides distribution channels into Paid, Earned, Shared, and Owned.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The PESO model breaks up distribution channels into Paid, Earned, Shared, and Owned.&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/how%20to%20create%20a%20marketing%20campaign_32023.png?width=600&amp;amp;height=298&amp;amp;name=how%20to%20create%20a%20marketing%20campaign_32023.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 600px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;298&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ceralytics.com/content-marketing-campaigns/#actions&quot;>;Image Source&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;6. Set a timeline for your campaign.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Establishing a campaign deadline gives you a better idea of when, how, and how often you&#39;ll promote it. Here&#39;s how to do this:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Build a general campaign timeline. Then, mark your campaign start date and deadline on a calendar.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Take a look at your marketing assets and chosen promotional marketing channels. Then, work backward from the campaign launch date. Based on your resources, how often can you afford to post and promote your campaign content? With this information, create a promotional calendar for each marketing channel.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Decide on a cadence for each channel and map your scheduled posts, emails, etc., on your calendar.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Visually mapping your marketing campaign will help you evenly disperse your campaign promotions. You can then publish equally on each medium.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Visual mapping also gives you an idea of where your time and energy are going. When the campaign is over, you can look back to assess your effectiveness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Pro tip: &lt;/strong>;If your promotional calendar seems full, don&#39;t fret. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-calendar-tools?_ga=2.194075949.1297659820.1636758994-1495700724.1636758994&amp;amp;hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=Social%20media&quot;>;Social media&lt;/a>; and email scheduling tools can alleviate the pressure of posting daily.

Ensure your campaign is driving users toward a desired action.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Even if your campaign is effective and drives a ton of traffic, it still needs to complete its desired action. By &quot;the desired action,&quot; I&#39;m talking about that SMART goal you initially defined. Let&#39;s take a moment and reiterate that goal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For my sample campaign, my SMART goal was &quot;to gather user-generated content from 100 customers via a branded hashtag on Instagram featuring our new product line by December 31.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This step is all about calibrating your marketing efforts and channels to lead your customers to complete your desired goal. This is done through conversion assets like calls-to-action, landing pages, and lead forms.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Pro tip:&lt;/strong>;Lead conversion assets can be used separately or in conjunction with one another. For example, you may feature a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/lead-generation-forms?_ga=2.194075949.1297659820.1636758994-1495700724.1636758994&amp;amp;hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=lead%20form&quot;>;lead form&lt;/a>;on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-examples-list?_ga=2.180709921.744970675.1636760229-1821932007.1636760229&amp;amp;hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=landing%20page&quot;>;landing page&lt;/a>;or create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-examples?_ga=2.180709921.744970675.1636760229-1821932007.1636760229&amp;amp;hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=call-to-action&quot;>;call-to-action&lt;/a>;asking your audience to complete a form.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;8. Monitor the right metrics.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Your campaign effectiveness metrics will depend on what type of marketing campaign you&#39;re running. This section merely serves as a baseline list to give you an idea of what to watch.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Focusing on vanity metrics like generated traffic, click-through rate, and impressions is tempting. A bump in these areas is a good thing. However, they don&#39;t necessarily indicate a change in revenue. Vanity metrics can&#39;t be the only means to measure the effectiveness of your campaign.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Pro Tip: &lt;/strong>;Bookmark this link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/essential-marketing-metrics?_ga=2.180709921.744970675.1636760229-1821932007.1636760229&amp;amp;hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=all%20the%20marketing%20metrics%20to%20watch&quot;>;all the marketing metrics to watch&lt;/a>;. It&#39;s organized by marketing channel. You can quickly scan the list for new metrics to track.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Assessing Your Marketing Campaign&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The post-campaign stage determines your success just as much as the planning stage. Analyzing your campaign data can provide unique insight into your audience, marketing channels, and budget. Insights will also inform future campaigns.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;9. Establish success numbers and metrics.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Start by considering your campaign&#39;s initial SMART goal. Did you meet your target? If it did, great! If it didn&#39;t, you can dive into the data to assess why.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, if your goal was to increase organic blog views by 100K, any bump in views would be considered successful. But there&#39;s a difference between a campaign that works and a worthwhile campaign. A worthwhile campaign gives you an ROI proportionate to the time and energy you put into it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Pro tip: &lt;/strong>;While it&#39;s OK to celebrate any bump in pre-orders, leads, views, or engagements, don&#39;t assume that&#39;s enough. There&#39;s a reason the very first thing to do is set a campaign goal. Sticking to that goal and calibrating your investment will ensure your campaign is worthwhile.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;10. Decide what you&#39;ll do with the campaign data.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This step helps maximize your campaign&#39;s business impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you analyze and apply your data, its value increases tenfold. The data helped you assess your campaign results. Analyzing further gives you clarity on your audience, marketing methods, creative prowess, and more.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s return to my UGC Instagram campaign.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to meeting my goal of 100 posts with UGC, the data I collect in the process also offers insights into who my audience is. I can understand when and how often they post on Instagram, what languages they use, and how they use my product.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether you collect lead information, pre-orders, social engagements, or offer downloads, your data can equip you to expand your marketing efforts as a whole.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Pro tip: &lt;/strong>;The campaign isn&#39;t over once you&#39;ve pulled that final report. Spend time with your team in a retrospective meeting. Ask yourselves questions like:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;What could&#39;ve been done differently?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How could we have saved money?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;For anything that went wrong, why do we think it went wrong?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What did we learn about our audience or marketing channels?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What kind of feedback could we gather from participants or customers?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;How to Create a Successful Marketing Campaign. Set a purpose and goal for your campaign. Establish how you&#39;ll measure your campaign. Define your target audience. Set a concept for your campaign and get in contact with the right team. Choose the channels on which you&#39;ll run your campaign. Set a timeline for your campaign. Ensure your campaign is driving users toward a desired action. Monitor the right metrics. Establish success numbers and metrics. Decide what you&#39;ll do with the campaign data.&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/how%20to%20create%20a%20marketing%20campaign_32023-1.png?width=600&amp;amp;height=400&amp;amp;name=how%20to%20create%20a%20marketing%20campaign_32023-1.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 600px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;400&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;Great Marketing Campaign Examples (and Why They&#39;re So Great)&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This wouldn&#39;t be a HubSpot Ultimate Guide if we didn&#39;t share some examples from the pros.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelipbar.com/&quot;>;The Lip Bar&lt;/a>;&#39;s &quot;Something BAWSE is coming.&quot;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In 2022, The Lip Bar celebrated its 10-year anniversary. It also released a new product called &quot;The Bawse Bundle.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early February, the brand launched a multi-channel campaign, from website and social media to billboards.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Lip Bar&#39;s &amp;quot;Something BAWSE is coming&amp;quot; campaign&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/how%20to%20create%20a%20marketing%20campaign_32023-1.jpeg?width=600&amp;amp;height=362&amp;amp;name=how%20to%20create%20a%20marketing%20campaign_32023-1.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;362&quot;>;&lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thelipbar.com/&quot;>;Image Source&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The campaign is built around a story of resilience and perseverance, focusing on the CEO&#39;s negative experience on the show Shark Tank.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Why This Campaign Works&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It accomplishes multiple things through a single campaign: It gives the audience a peek into the brand&#39;s journey. It builds on that journey and beautifully connects it to a product.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Current customers share in this excitement because of the 10-year anniversary. Plus, new customers will be drawn in by the CEO&#39;s personal story.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.facebook.com/meta&quot;>;Meta&lt;/a>;: &quot;The Metaverse&quot;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In Q4 2021, Facebook announced the &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/&quot;>;rebranding of its parent company&lt;/a>;. The new name, Meta, comes with its own &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CVlR5GFqF68/&quot;>;marketing campaign&lt;/a>; that introduces the world to a new concept called the &quot;metaverse.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Meta&#39;s campaign is still in its infancy stages, but it has taken over social media networks, including the Facebook app itself.&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/how%20to%20create%20a%20marketing%20campaign_32023.jpeg?width=500&amp;amp;height=448&amp;amp;name=how%20to%20create%20a%20marketing%20campaign_32023.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;448&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/tv/CVlhWMxheDk/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&quot;>;Image Source&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/tv/CVlhWMxheDk/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&quot;>;video &lt;/a>;posted to the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/meta/&quot;>;@meta&lt;/a>;Instagram account showcases an alternate reality where people can interact in 3D.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Why This Campaign Works&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The idea of a Facebook rebrand had been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/facebook-reportedly-changing-name-042958266.html&quot;>;speculated&lt;/a>;before the launch of the campaign, which piqued the public&#39;s interest.

This inevitably had a negative effect on the way potential customers perceived the quality of service.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, the company changed its marketing campaign to target a more rational customer who appreciates a little humor.&lt;/p>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 868px; max-height: 488px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.22%; margin: 0;&quot;>; &lt;iframe class=&quot;hs-responsive-embed-iframe&quot; style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FgOrfg5IwaY&quot; width=&quot;868&quot; height=&quot;488&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Shaquille O&#39;Neal became the face of the brand.

In doing so, Airbnb focuses on the human aspect of its platform: You&#39;re not renting an Airbnb property.

Explain your content.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;To explore the best tactics for writing YouTube descriptions, I spoke with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EricPeters0/&quot;>;Eric Peters&lt;/a>;, a Senior Growth Product Manager on HubSpot&#39;s Academy team. He said, &quot;[YouTube descriptions] are one of the primary ways YouTube knows what your video is about. Include links, additional resources, links to other videos and playlists, etc. Make sure the description box is easy to read.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peters explained that your YouTube video description and closed captioning should incorporate keywords into your description. It also helps with accessibility for people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Hence, adding closed captioning to your videos is an absolute must for accessibility.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, take a look at one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@HubSpotMarketing&quot;>;HubSpot Marketing&#39;s YouTube&lt;/a>; video descriptions:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube-description-explain-your-content.png?width=650&amp;amp;height=743&amp;amp;name=youtube-description-explain-your-content.png&quot; alt=&quot;youtube video description example: hubspot&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;743&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A YouTube description differs from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-a-meta-description?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/youtube-description-template&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=web%20page%20meta%20description&quot;>;web page meta description&lt;/a>;. In a YouTube description, content creators explain what your entire video is about and even link to external resources.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peters told me, &quot;You get 5,000 characters total, so make use of it. YouTube creators use asterisks or all-caps to differentiate titles from body copy because it&#39;s all plain text. Consider writing up a text version of the key points from the video, or even copying the transcription of the video and paste it into the description.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Include a call-to-action (CTA).&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Your YouTube description is a fantastic opportunity to ask viewers to continue to engage with your channel or find additional resources that will help them learn more about a topic of interest.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, let&#39;s say you create a brief &quot;How to Add Filters to Instagram&quot; YouTube video, but you also have an in-depth &quot;How to Use Instagram for Marketing&quot; blog post. Why not link it in the description? Most likely, anyone watching your Instagram video on YouTube would be equally grateful for the opportunity to learn more through a blog post.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps you simply want to ask viewers to subscribe, turn on notifications, or share your content with their networks. These are all acceptable CTA&#39;s for your description.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You must format your description to ensure you put the most important information first. Peters advises, &quot;The first 200 characters are above the &#39;more&#39; fold on the description box, so if you want your CTA/link to be seen by most people, keep it within the first 200 characters.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/show-more-youtube-video-description.png?width=650&amp;amp;height=86&amp;amp;name=show-more-youtube-video-description.png&quot; alt=&quot;Collapsed YouTube Video Description With Show More Box Highlighted&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;86&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the first 200 characters, your text will be cut off, and viewers will need to click &quot;Show more&quot; to see the rest. Therefore, you must make your first 200 characters count.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Add your personality.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A YouTube description should be fun and demonstrate your brand&#39;s personality with a unique voice. Unlike traditional forms of advertising, this is an opportunity for you to instill creativity and humor into your content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/backlinko&quot;>;Brian Dean&#39;s YouTube channel&lt;/a>; is a great example of this. His YouTube descriptions often mirror the way he speaks. The descriptions are candid and casual, and he makes it feel like he&#39;s writing to a friend.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Brian Dean YouTube Video Description&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/DRAFT%20youtube%20descriptions-1.png?width=650&amp;amp;height=552&amp;amp;name=DRAFT%20youtube%20descriptions-1.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;552&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To learn more about using YouTube for marketing purposes, consider checking out HubSpot Academy&#39;s comprehensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/youtube-marketing&quot;>;YouTube Marketing course&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Use timestamps to make videos scannable.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Including timestamps in your video description can make your video more user-friendly and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rev.com/blog/benefits-adding-timestamps-videos&quot;>;help your content rank well on search engines&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;YouTube video timestamps appear within search results, improving user retention by directing users to the most relevant portions of videos from SERPs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Users can search for keywords that appear in your video&#39;s description and click on a thumbnail on the SERP to view the portion of your video that answers their search query.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/image-png-Jun-12-2023-02-50-26-2750-PM.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot; alt=&quot;youtube description examples: timestamps&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 12px; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnN8WSrnmjk&amp;amp;_conv_v=vi%3A1*sc%3A249*cs%3A1685660271*fs%3A1617725195*pv%3A666*seg%3A%7B10031564.1%7D*exp%3A%7B100315213.%7Bv.100393143-g.%7B10033808.1-10033809.1-10038020.1-10039628.1-100313080.1%7D%7D-100316151.%7Bv.100396483-g.%7B10033808.1-10033809.1-10038020.1-10039628.1-100313080.1%7D%7D-100330256.%7Bv.1003131869-g.%7B%7D%7D-100333145.%7Bv.1003138897-g.%7B100320388.1%7D%7D-100334952.%7Bv.1003143355-g.%7B100320388.1%7D%7D-100335047.%7Bv.1003143583-g.%7B100320381.1-100320388.1-100321708.1-100321709.1%7D%7D%7D*ps%3A1684872233&amp;amp;_conv_s=si%3A249*sh%3A1685660271375-0.7719613991908942*pv%3A1&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;>;Image Source&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;YouTube Channel Description Examples&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Every YouTube channel description should allude to a specific niche or central theme.

The YouTube video description increases visibility through SEO, views, and subscriptions. In each video description, the content creator will encourage their viewers to &quot;Like,&quot; &quot;Share,&quot; and &quot;Subscribe&quot; to their content. An effective video description will be persuasive and informative, and prompt the audience to tune in regularly.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Simple YouTube Video Description Template&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Rather than writing a lengthy summary of your video, keep your video descriptions detailed enough to let the viewer know what to expect, yet concise enough so they don&#39;t lose interest.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Listen to how our CEO explains the difference between X and Y, and learn best practices for implementing your own strategy.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Learn more about X and Y in our course: [course link].&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2.

Search-Friendly YouTube Video Description Template&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;YouTube increases visibility within keyword searches and relevant content. As a result, videos should have buzzwords in video and channel descriptions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you want to craft a description that explains what your video is about and incorporates a keyword description, try this:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Hey there! This lesson is part of a free online course. Take the full course here: www.company.com/course1.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Some people are unsure what X is — at its most basic, X is [brief definition of keyword].

Sometimes, A is all it takes to lose a customer.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Teaser YouTube Video Description Template.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Use your video descriptions as an opportunity to let your viewers know when to expect new content from you, like this template:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Join the &quot;musical nerds&quot; on a mission to improve our musical understanding. We upload every Wednesday and Thursday. We will have Q &amp;amp; A sessions to answer all of your beginner questions on Wednesdays, starting next week.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Transparent YouTube Video Description Template&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Transparency is key to gaining the trust of your audience. This template is a great example of how to let your viewers know when you are using affiliate links in your descriptions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;What&#39;s up, guys? In this video, we&#39;ll talk about an everyday makeup look you can do in 10 minutes. I&#39;m not an early riser, but just like anyone, I still want to look good for the day. I&#39;ll list the products I used in this video.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Please subscribe if you are feeling my vibe. I post content weekly, and you can always find me on Insta!

Clicking on affiliated links doesn&#39;t cost you anything.**&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;6. Engaging YouTube Video Description Template&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Engaging with your audience is essential for building community with them. Here, this description encourages viewers to leave suggestions in the comments section for the chance to be featured in future videos.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Hi, everyone! We&#39;re the Science Kidz! Today we are experimenting to find out which popcorn brand leaves behind the least number of kernels. Will it be Orville Redenbacher&#39;s or Act II?&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Every week, we do a new experiment as part of our initiative to highlight STEM careers in Savannah, Georgia.

Sponsored YouTube Video Description Templates&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Disclosing paid sponsorships or product placements doesn&#39;t have to be super jargon-heavy. Using a template like this one can help you be candid with your audience without straying from your brand&#39;s voice and sounding like a robot.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Hey, y&#39;all! Today, we&#39;ll be rebuilding a 454 Chevy Big Block motor. We&#39;ll be adding 200 horses to bring the motor up to 680 horsepower. I hope y&#39;all are ready to dive into business with Motor Boyz.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;This episode is sponsored by Husky tools, and we&#39;ll be using their latest impact and driver tools to rebuild the 454. We would like to thank Anderson Auto for donating the 1972 C10 to be our frame once the motor is rebuilt and completed.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Use templates.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Once you have your brand voice down, create a template to use in your video descriptions to help save you time when uploading. If you&#39;re having trouble creating a template on your own, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/youtube-templates&quot;>;HubSpot&#39;s YouTube templates&lt;/a>; to get some inspiration.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Be clear and concise.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When writing a description for a YouTube video, you should aim for simplicity. Make sure all the essential information is above the fold. That way, you can ensure potential viewers know what your video is about as they search for what they need.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Connect with subscribers.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Use your YouTube descriptions to help new viewers connect with you on your other channels and social media platforms. In doing this, you can increase your cross-promote content more easily and boost engagement and discoverability. Just make sure to put your social media links toward the end of your descriptions, since there are more important details to keep above the fold.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Create a niche.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Whether you&#39;re writing a description for your channel or a video, you&#39;ll want to define your niche. Start by introducing yourself or your brand, then highlight what you have to offer and what makes you unique. Be sure to incorporate relevant keywords that are used to search for content in your niche so your target audience has a better chance at finding you.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Show your journey.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;You may want to create a channel description that asks viewers to join you on a journey that you document on your YouTube channel. For instance, if your YouTube channel focuses on streaming video game content, you may invite your subscribers to watch you as you attempt to win the game. Therefore, mentioning a goal for your channel can help you gain new subscribers eager to come along for the ride as you pursue a goal.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;6. Be more personal.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Create a sense of community with your channel by being more personal with your audience. When writing your descriptions, consider including personal touches, such as telling a story, using relatable language, or speaking directly to the viewer. By offering an emotional appeal, you and your content will come off as more authentic, helping you create a stronger connection with your subscribers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;7. Create anticipation for new content.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A content creator needs to build excitement for the next video — a sense of urgency and anticipation for their audience. A YouTuber can create giveaways, conduct polls, and invite special guests to participate in the videos to maintain the channel&#39;s success.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;8. Make it search-friendly.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;We have all done it: Having parts of an idea and hoping Google will fill in the blanks by completing the search with the rest of our thought. As a content creator, you need to own each of the video&#39;s related tags, including misspellings, to help refine the content under your channel. The YouTube videos need to be centered around keywords, maximizing your SEO for Google and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/youtube-seo&quot;>;YouTube searches&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;9. Lead viewers to other resources.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When crafting your descriptions, consider linking to related content that viewers might find interesting or helpful. For example, if you have a blog, you can link to a blog post that goes more in-depth on the topic you&#39;re discussing. Not only will this help provide additional context to the viewer, but bring more traffic to your website.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;10. Incorporate keywords.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Use keywords in your descriptions to increase the visibility of your YouTube channel and videos. In order to determine which keywords you should target, you&#39;ll need to conduct keyword research. When crafting your description, don&#39;t repeat the same keywords too much. Instead, insert them in a way that sounds natural. This will keep it easy to read and help you avoid keyword stuffing.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;11. Tease a new initiative.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A new video is upcoming, and you need to send a teaser to your audience that will create buzz leading up to the release of the new content. A video teaser can be uploaded to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/youtube-shorts?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/youtube-description-template&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=YouTube%20Shorts&quot;>;YouTube Shorts&lt;/a>; to increase anticipation.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;12. Be transparent.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Authenticity sells. Viewers know when you aren&#39;t being transparent with them, so just be real. If you have affiliate partners, gifted products, or sponsorships, don&#39;t try to hide it. Be honest with your viewers and write a disclaimer in your description.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a YouTuber, it is essential to engage with your audience and build their trust. If you lose that trust, it can be hard to win it back.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;13. Maintain engagement.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Keeping your audience engaged is crucial for getting them to return for more content. When writing your video description, use a strong hook that grabs your audience&#39;s attention and makes them want to watch. Be sure to break down the video into sections and include timestamps for each one. This allows viewers to jump to specific parts of the video, so they remain interested.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;14. Plug your products.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Any time you mention or use one of your products or services in a video, you should always include a link in your description. By doing this, you prompt the audience to try your product or service for themselves. Offering a discount code may also encourage potential customers to take the leap.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;15. Test out different formats.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If your videos aren&#39;t getting the reach you expect, try experimenting with different description formats and templates.

So, let&#39;s get started with the types of content you can create and then review your content strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h3>;Content Creation Ideas for Blogs&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;One type of content creation (the kind you&#39;re consuming right now, actually) is blog posts. Blogs can educate, entertain, and inspire your audience through the written word. When someone types a query in Google, the posts that pop up are usually blog posts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qW_O6ZlUY9QYBkWvL9Nj3px87c1SjKTgtJ7iI38GFlTeSZkDNBXrWIC0mJFDJoTPodPA8yFqPBhJqxHWQtzBu444GwUtX_xsofKE6r79t0dFs18xkjTqzV6THP5ArSxy5SIK9Di-hDPNYugi1lsJOwk&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot; alt=&quot;content creation ideas: blogs&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=Blogging&quot;>;Blogging&lt;/a>; is worth the time and effort, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of-content-marketing-infographic?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=56%25&quot;>;56%&lt;/a>; of marketers say that blogging is their most effective content strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it can be tough to narrow your focus and start writing. In addition to opinion pieces and product announcement posts, these are some proven ideas for blog content creation.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1. Answer a Question&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re not sure which question to answer first, start with questions from beginners. These can create a foundation you can use to continue growing your blog.&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WoSAL85tB5gmBNjl0PyPg8GOT_txQTa3tyR1y2MPsgwaznZHlqa7cNlJHXcjbdwM7hB2t3ynJwFx-R_2aC2GLS5AwYMZYeloWd8jzEAiU8h31cbBT-WeTHoczMRT9rZYfI0sBcxHov8FBFwPmy0mUF0&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;257&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; alt=&quot;blog content creation ideas: answer a question&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another way to use questions as a starting point is to think about the questions you had when you were a beginner. Even questions from your more recent experience can help someone else in your industry.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once you&#39;ve figured out the right questions, write a complete answer. You might want to skim over the details, but this is where you can add the most value for your readers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People are often shy about asking questions because they don&#39;t want to sound foolish. Anticipating and answering their questions can help you earn their trust. It can also improve your search engine results.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;2. Compare and Contrast Solutions to a Problem&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Another way that you can serve your readers is by helping them make a decision. There are answers online, but it can sometimes feel like there are too many answers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you are an expert in your niche, you can share your expert opinion and help out buyers who want to make an informed purchase at the same time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As you choose what you&#39;re going to compare, make sure that the products have more similarities than differences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, you wouldn&#39;t want to compare a project management tool with email marketing software.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you&#39;re writing compare and contrast blogs for a product or service, be as open and transparent as you can. List all the possible positives and negatives you can think of. Then, get into detail about how you came to those decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;3. Teach Something&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Some of the most popular blogs are educational. If you want to use your blog as a teaching tool, there are a few things you&#39;ll want to think about.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As you choose a topic, it&#39;s smart to start small. So, instead of covering a broad topic, choose a niche topic that people in your industry might be asking about.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, instead of writing about website design basics, write about how to design the home page for an automotive dealership.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As you start writing how-to blogs, there are a few things to remember:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Use short sentences and paragraphs and create a clear structure. This will make your instructions easier to follow.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Avoid jargon and technical terms if you can, and use examples to make new information easier to understand.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Keep in mind that your directions should be easy for a beginner to follow, so don&#39;t skip steps or offer shortcuts.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;These tips should help your readers learn and bring you more traffic and interest in your educational content.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;4. Daily, Monthly, or Weekly Series&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Writing a series of posts can be useful for your readers, and it can help you grow your blog. A series will usually run for a set period of time. You can choose to publish the series every day or on a set day every week or month.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A series can generate content that you can easily repurpose for other channels. For example, if you run a blog about social media, you could turn a blog series about Instagram Reels into a podcast, ebook, or video.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This strategy makes it simple to fully explore a particular topic. It&#39;s useful for building internal and external links, and for establishing you as a thought leader.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;5. Quizzes and Surveys&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Blog surveys are a great way to collect feedback from your audience. This can help with more than website traffic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Responses from quizzes and surveys can also help you:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Figure out other types of content your audience likes&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Choose which products to promote and sell&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Grow your social media following&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Go viral with interactive content&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Anticipate customer service issues&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;For an effective quiz or survey, define your goals before you start creating. Keeping your quizzes short and offering incentives can improve response rates.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;6. Curated Content for Target Audiences&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;While your blog could appeal to just about anyone, your goal is to connect with your ideal buyer personas.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-practices-effective-content-curation?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=Curated%20content&quot;>;Curated content&lt;/a>; will make your most important audience members feel important. This could mean that this audience turns into a group of promoters who share your content and encourage others to buy your products.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With this in mind, it&#39;s a good idea to create curated content that&#39;s specifically for this audience. For example, say you&#39;re selling sandals. You&#39;ll want to write different content for people who wear sandals year-round and people who only wear sandals at certain times of the year.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To curate your content, start with detailed buyer personas and competitor research. Next, create clusters of content that are just for that specific buyer persona.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Curated content is also where you&#39;ll want to highlight quotes and insights from industry leaders. This content shouldn&#39;t just inform a targeted audience. It should make them feel like they are part of an exclusive group.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re looking for help curating your content, check out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-curation-tools?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=useful%20list%20of%20tools&quot;>;useful list of tools&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;7. Celebrate Wins&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Most blogs are evergreen. This means that once you publish a blog on the internet, it can be a resource for many years. This makes blogs a great place to celebrate wins.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether you&#39;re calling out top-performing employees or thanking customers, you can use your blog to celebrate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remember to celebrate the little things. Then use images, videos, and design to make celebration posts feel extra special.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Content Creation Ideas for Podcasts&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Podcasts are like listening to the radio. But anyone can make and broadcast a podcast. This means that professional and beginner podcast hosts are competing for the same listening time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But they also have a big audience, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation&amp;amp;hubs_post-cta=28%25&quot;>;28%&lt;/a>; of Americans 12 years old and up listen to podcasts on a weekly basis.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Podcasts are extra interesting to listen to when the audience likes the host and wants to learn something from them. Keep reading for more podcast content creation ideas you might want to try.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/IOJFW6gudspi5uQknlxgnMOk3vnOHaJEeM3o0goGjXC-IyD6DnRBfHb3RwaGwpN97fyUclTp-5j3efOYSHnpATEMVmMW40Z2vm-KtmDzVUKtY_mPoo9J718eKlScuYe6bYW5gdjRUKimATjJZtYM-D8&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;241&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot; alt=&quot;My First Million podcast page on Apple Podcasts&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generally, a great podcast will center on a great idea and then expand on that topic with listener and expert feedback. Storytelling podcasts are popular, and so are educational podcasts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you are launching your first podcast, be sure to post with a consistent schedule. It&#39;s also a good idea to follow the same structure for every episode.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other than that, it&#39;s about being your authentic self.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1. Thought Leadership&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This type of podcast content centers on your professional experience. Be sure to include case studies and other real-life scenarios in this content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remember that your audience is listening in for different reasons and often have different levels of industry experience. So, offer insights for a range of listeners and share advice that you think your listeners could apply themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;2. Interview Influencers&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If you want to add influencer interviews to your podcast, knowing who to interview comes first. Don&#39;t just go for the biggest names. Instead, choose interesting guests who can offer value to your listeners.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Be sure to research your guests and ask original questions. For example, the success of the YouTube show &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAzrgbu8gEMIIK3r4Se1dOZWSZzUSadfZ&quot;>;Hot Ones&lt;/a>;&quot; comes in part from the well-researched questions its host asks each celebrity guest.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other ways to get the most out of influencer interviews on your podcast include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Asking for follower suggestions&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Encouraging participation from your featured influencer&#39;s followers&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h4>;3. Discuss Trends&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Trends are great content for a podcast. Whether you&#39;re discussing a long-term trend or the latest fad, this is a smart context to show how your products are relevant to what&#39;s new.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While many people listen to daily or weekly news podcasts, most podcasts are evergreen like a blog. Many podcast listeners will tune into a podcast years after the podcast was first released.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that you&#39;ll want to tie trends to larger topics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://listen.hubspot.com/public/83/Marketing-Against-The-Grain-fc89af93&quot;>;Marketing Against the Grain&lt;/a>; covers trends like the creator economy on their podcast, but they talk about it as part of marketing as a whole. This strategy grounds what could be a fleeting trend into a topic with more staying power.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;4. Contests and Giveaways&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33352/everything-you-need-to-run-a-successful-social-media-contest.aspx?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=Contests&quot;>;Contests&lt;/a>; give your podcast listeners a fun way to participate while also giving you a chance to grow your subscribers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One way to launch a podcast contest is to post to social media about a prize or giveaway. Interactive contests where a listener can call in to be a part of the podcast are another option.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you plan to offer a prize, make sure it&#39;s unique and fitting for your unique audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Content Creation Ideas for Video&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Whether you want to post videos on social media or YouTube, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-marketing?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=video%20marketing&quot;>;video marketing&lt;/a>; is a type of content creation that becomes more popular every year. Short-form and long-form videos both have their place in your content creation strategy. So, be sure to come up with ideas for both types of content.&lt;/p>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 650px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-content-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.5%; margin: 0px;&quot;>; &lt;iframe width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;113&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dLrw4cr5FZA?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of-video-marketing-new-data?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=86%25&quot;>;86%&lt;/a>; of video marketers say that video is effective for generating leads. This makes original video marketing an important strategy for anyone who is working on content creation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some solid video content ideas include behind-the-scenes or time-lapse videos. Let&#39;s go over some other useful ideas for video content creation.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1. Animate Hard-To-Understand Ideas&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Animation makes it easier to understand new or complex information. So, use video to show your viewers how your product works or to talk about the specific problem your product solves.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Choose scenarios that people can relate to that clearly connect to your product. Whether you choose to use digital animation or stop-motion, animation can bring a dry topic to life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, tech products often solve problems that the average user doesn&#39;t deal with every day, like a broken connection with an API.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what about an animation of what happens when the wireless at home gets cut off? A video with this scenario could make that abstract idea easier for the average user to understand.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;2. Repurpose Blog Content&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Another quick video idea is to use the text from your most popular blog as a voiceover. Long blogs make great content for a video series.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can also break up key points from blogs into bite-size videos for your social media posts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, add your videos to your blog posts. This gives people who find your blog on search engines another alternative to get the information they&#39;re looking for.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;3. How-tos and Tutorials&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How-to content is also very popular in video formats. To create a powerful instructional video, stick to short and specific steps. Don&#39;t skip anything, but you also don&#39;t want to overwhelm your viewers with extra information.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Use simple visual steps to help your viewers learn, and offer a clear call-to-action at the end.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s also a good idea to engage with the comments on these videos. This reassures your audience that you are available if they have more questions, and could help you come up with more video ideas.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;4. Product Demos and Unusual Use Cases&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Product demos can make it easier for potential customers to see how they can use your products. It&#39;s also a chance for you to share some product design processes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By sharing the problem you initially solved with your product, and how the solution changed through the process, you&#39;re building a relationship with your viewers. This relationship builds trust and makes them more likely to engage with you and your products.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Show how your product works in an interesting way. For example, the &quot;Will It Blend?&quot; video series on YouTube was a winner for Blendtec because it didn&#39;t just show the power of its blender.&lt;/p>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 650px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-content-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.5%; margin: 0px;&quot;>; &lt;iframe width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;113&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEWizqP_dP0?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;They were inventive and asked for customer suggestions for each video. And the videos were blending objects you normally wouldn&#39;t throw in a blender, like cell phones, golf balls, or glow sticks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can also personalize your video content. Video product demos are a great option for connecting individual customers to your products.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Image-based Content Creation Ideas&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In your blog posts, or in your social media posts, you might want to post original graphics. These can be infographics, photography, GIFs, memes, illustrations, or screenshots.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This type of content creation usually requires a graphic designer or a design tool to help you get the job done.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2W-oAuP_XMu7uaJiIc0cwqX2xeQocMFJ983uvnqK9mCikMm6XSng3Foon1BOet6bfO6cQIw1Yo63uJlB6v2tdnCAGVrNVgqfDIp_C8j6C_mvtMfJZGiorZSDGkSjNf3ayFqHwiQ2OoUwNKhSw5l4n8&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;433&quot; alt=&quot;Content creation idea example: infographic&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Photo and image-based posts are the content types &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation&amp;amp;hubs_post-cta=businesses%20use%20most&quot;>;businesses use most&lt;/a>; to increase audience engagement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As you begin to create visual content, make sure you have a strong grasp of the basics. These include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Choose the right subject to illustrate your idea&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Think about composition&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Use contrast and color&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Keep it simple&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h4>;1. Visual Storytelling&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Visual content is great for quick storytelling. As you start to experiment with storytelling, remember to show, not tell.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, say you&#39;re telling a story about meeting a tough sales goal. A picture of a sales rep talking on the phone won&#39;t tell the story as well as an image of that same sales rep scaling a tall mountain.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Try to use setting, clothing, lighting, and motion to emphasize the action and drama of every scene in your images.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;2. User-Generated Content&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Fans of your products are often looking for ways to get involved. And there&#39;s nothing like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-leverage-user-generated-content?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=user-generated%20content&quot;>;user-generated content&lt;/a>; to show your followers that you care about their opinions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To get your users to create and share content for your brand, invite them to get involved. Try a custom hashtag or contest on social media to start. Email is also a great channel for collecting photos, quotes, and stories from your customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That said, don&#39;t use content from users without asking for their permission. You also want to make sure you credit users for their contributions. Nothing can damage your relationship with a customer like using their images without consent.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;3. Infographics&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://visme.co/blog/infographic-statistics/&quot;>;proof&lt;/a>; that data visualizations can decrease errors and improve learning and retention by as much as 80%.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you want your content creation strategy to include infographics, keep these best practices in mind:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Choose the right data for your target audience&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Choose the right graph or chart for your data&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Do your research&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Tell a simple visual story&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Don&#39;t add too much data&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Make your main points easy to read and remember&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h4>;4. Go Behind the Scenes&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sharing industry and product secrets is exciting and interesting for your readers. It&#39;s also an interesting way to share information about how you make, package, and update your products.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To create visuals that take your audience behind the scenes, start with a plan. Whether you&#39;re sharing photos from a tour of your manufacturing facility or documenting an average day on social media, make it cool.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think about lighting, composition, and the little details. You don&#39;t want a great product shot ruined by a big messy trash can or a warning sign in the background.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, make your images feel authentic. Don&#39;t set up your photos in a space that feels too perfect to be real.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Content Creation Ideas for Content Offers&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Another type of content is content offers. These are templates, whitepapers, worksheets, or ebooks that your visitors can download. This is gated content — meaning your audience will need to fill out a form and provide their email to have access to it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/yORCOaoGKz9C7Lq5zqjQ79xDYGD9xcL8ORRoRhdWVgUsDikscjtAtOsMIAU08JwD2Ep46Sf7kqeJK88tAljA3kGmjlx-L_vxLd_BA5Z7dufrru4qmd8FNrWXXisNMjqUUCwIiL3OylYWal_fD-s7dmg&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; alt=&quot;Content creation ideas example: content offers&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation&amp;amp;hubs_post-cta=67%25&quot;>;67%&lt;/a>; of companies use lead generation as the primary metric for content success.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that you should combine any content creation efforts with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-promotion-ideas?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=content%20offers&quot;>;content offers&lt;/a>; to draw new leads. The best lead magnets solve a problem for your followers. Usually, they solve urgent issues and offer lasting value to your target audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be immediately useful to your users, a content offer should be specific and quick to use. It should also offer value that reflects your high level of understanding and expertise.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This will keep your audience coming back for more and help you convert more leads into delighted customers. These are some content offer ideas for you to start with.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1. Ebooks or White Papers&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Long-form written content creation is where many businesses start for content offers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ebooks and white papers can give your readers a deeper understanding of a topic. They can also help them solve an urgent problem.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While ebooks can be intense projects, you can also use existing content, like blogs, to build your ebooks. A great &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-create-an-ebook-free-templates?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=ebook%20template&quot;>;ebook template&lt;/a>; can also speed up the process.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;2. Original Research&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Data drives many businesses, but not every business has the time or the resources to put together the data they need. You can use your knowledge and network to put together research that your visitors can use.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To create high-quality research you&#39;ll need:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Goals for your research&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;A process for sampling and analyzing your data&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Questions&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;A process for managing the project&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s important to figure out how much time and what resources you&#39;ll need to complete the research. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-buyers-journey-guide?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=market%20research%20template&quot;>;market research template&lt;/a>; can make it easier for you to organize and compile your research.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, you&#39;ll want to decide the best format and channels to present your research to create a stellar content offer.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;3. Tools and Templates&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A great content offer helps your audience solve a problem faster than they could figure it out on their own. This makes tools like calculators, swipe files, and checklists invaluable. It means that your templates can be useful for your fans both now and later.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And these useful lead magnets don&#39;t just give you a chance to help out your community. They&#39;re also excellent resources for leads and to create advocates for your brand.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If someone uses one of your templates regularly, they&#39;re more likely to tell someone else about it. This makes content offers a great way to grow your following by word of mouth. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/how-online-word-of-mouth-marketing-is-changing?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=word%20of%20mouth&quot;>;word of mouth&lt;/a>; is one of the most trusted sources for consumers. This makes this type of content offer a win-win.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While some templates and tools need you to have advanced coding or technical knowledge, most are simple to put together. You can easily create a template with tools like Microsoft Excel or Google Docs, tools most people use every day.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As you start building, keep in mind that creating something useful is more important than making it look perfect.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;4. Kits and Workbooks&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Once you&#39;ve put together a few of the resources listed above, you might be ready to create a larger content offer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kits and workbook content offers usually include a range of different resources that work together. For example, say you&#39;ve made a few different templates for social media captions on different platforms. You can put these together to create the ultimate social media caption kit.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To keep your leads from getting information overload, think about structure. It&#39;s a good idea to break your kit or workbook into bite-sized pieces. You&#39;ll also want to use graphics and other media to break up dense sections of text to keep things engaging.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A workbook or kit might also include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Worksheets&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;A Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Checklists&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Schedules&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Journal prompts&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;Social Media Content Creator Ideas&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Creating shareable social media content can be a challenge. Each platform is a little different and not every post will perform the same on all channels. Still, it is a great way to engage with and grow your audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are a few ideas to help you generate new social media content.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Share relevant industry news.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Not everything your brand posts on social media has to be original content. In fact, there are plenty of benefits to sharing relevant industry content and news on your pages.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, it keeps your audience engaged and informed on the latest news and trends. This can be particularly important in fast-moving industries where staying up-to-date is essential.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, it can ensure that you&#39;re always engaging with your audience. No matter what social media platforms you use, you should stick to a consistent schedule that works for your business. Including related content in your calendar can make content planning easier and free up time to work on high-value campaigns.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Create educational content.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Teach your audience something new by creating educational content. Perhaps there&#39;s a common problem your customer&#39;s face that a simple &quot;how-to&quot; video can solve, or maybe there&#39;s a topic area that&#39;s relevant to your industry you can write a blog post about.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By creating educational content, you position your brand as a valuable resource that your audience can rely on when they are looking for new information.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Keep in mind that most consumers prefer to watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of-content-marketing-infographic&quot;>;short-form videos&lt;/a>; when learning about a new service or product, so consider breaking up your educational social media content into a series instead of one long post or video.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Partner with other companies or influencers.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When you partner with another company or influencer, you get access to your partner&#39;s audience, which can significantly increase your brand&#39;s exposure and help you gain new followers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can also give your brand a boost in credibility. For instance, if an influencer trusts your product, it provides consumers with social proof that your product or service is the real deal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Collaborating with others can lead to diverse and unique content that you may not be able to produce otherwise. Plus, partnering with others can open up opportunities for future collaborations, joint ventures, and strategic partnerships.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Share user-generated content.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Sharing user-generated content on your social media pages can add a layer of authenticity to your brand because it showcases real people who enjoy your product or service. It can also lead to more social engagement and community building since people like seeing themselves and their peers featured on a business&#39;s page.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plus, UGC is an easy way to keep your social media pages fresh without having to create more content in-house.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Participate in trends.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;With how quickly trends cycle through on social media, participating in them may seem like a lost cause. However, if you&#39;re able to jump on them quickly, it can be an effective way to engage with your followers and increase your visibility.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Social media platforms tend to prioritize trending content, which can increase the likelihood of your content being seen and shared. Plus, participating in trends shows that your brand is relevant and has a pulse on what&#39;s going on in the world. Staying out of touch and churning out stale content will only repel people from your brand.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;6. Host contests or giveaways.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Social media contests and giveaways are a great way to promote your brand. After all, who doesn&#39;t like free stuff?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These can help increase engagement by requiring followers to like, comment, or share in order to win. Contests also give your audience an incentive to share their contact information with you because they have a chance to gain something in return. Ultimately, this can generate new leads and drive sales for your brand.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;7. Share testimonials.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A positive testimonial can be the deciding factor on whether or not a consumer buys your product or service. So, sharing them on social media can be an effective way to boost your brand&#39;s credibility.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Posting customer reviews can help build trust with potential customers because it shows that your product actually works. It can also help humanize your brand. By featuring real people and their experiences, you&#39;re able to show, not tell, your audience how your product or service may benefit them.&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;Content Planning and Strategy&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;You wouldn&#39;t start building a house without a blueprint, a sculpture without a sketch, or a company without a mission statement. So, there should be no content creation without a plan. Otherwise, you risk getting derailed from your objective.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-plan&quot;>;content strategy&lt;/a>; includes everything from brand and tone to how you will promote your content and eventually repurpose it. Let&#39;s go over how to create your content plan, step-by-step.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Featured Resources&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/content-marketing-training-workbook&quot;>;Content Marketing Workbook&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/content-strategy&quot;>;Content Strategy Course&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;Set your content goals.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Similar to a traditional marketing campaign, your content strategy should be centered on your marketing goals (which should, in turn, be derived from your company goals).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your goals could range from attracting more visitors to your site to generating more leads to anything in between — as long as they&#39;re &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33898/how-to-set-smart-marketing-goals-for-2013-template.aspx&quot;>;SMART&lt;/a>; goals. An example of this kind of goal would be to increase organic traffic to the blog by 25% in the next quarter.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-creation-smart-goal-example.jpg?width=650&amp;amp;name=content-creation-smart-goal-example.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Content creation strategy example: SMART goals&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once you determine that, each piece of content you create should be aligned with your goal and contribute to your desired outcome.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In sum, start with your goals, then create your content.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Create a buyer persona.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Building a content strategy is more than considering what type of content you want to create. You first need to know who you&#39;re speaking to, how you want to speak to them, and where to find them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-creation-make-buyer-persona.jpg?width=650&amp;amp;name=content-creation-make-buyer-persona.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Content creation strategy example: Buyer personas&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to creating successful inbound content is to make each reader feel like you&#39;re speaking directly to them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The only way to do this is to get intimate with your visitors, leads, and customers — you need to know them like you know an old friend. You should be aware of their obstacles, their pain points, their challenges, and their fears. Similarly, you should understand their best possible outcome, their dream solution, and their biggest fantasies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Always remember that you are marketing to humans that want to feel connected.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ideally, you&#39;d know and be able to speak directly to every individual that visits your website, but you can&#39;t.解决方案？ Create a buyer persona.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your buyer persona is the person that you want to reach with your content. This semi-fictional character serves as a representation of your target audience, ie, the people who are most likely to benefit from your message and become customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Creating a buyer persona takes a bit of research, some guesswork, and tweaking. But the end result is a clear picture of the person you want to market to and someone who will happily consume your content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not sure where to start? Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makemypersona.com/&quot;>;Make My Persona&lt;/a>; to build out your buyer persona.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Rely on the buyer&#39;s journey.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;ve ever had a headache, the first thing you likely did was try to figure out the cause. Perhaps you were dehydrated, or caffeine-depleted, or maybe you were sick. After you diagnosed the problem, you moved on to solutions — drink some water, grab an espresso, or take some medicine. Finally, you decide between solutions: Evian or tap water? Starbucks or Peet&#39;s Coffee? Aleve or Tylenol? Hopefully, your headache then subsided and you were able to go about your day.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a representation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey&quot;>;buyer&#39;s journey&lt;/a>;. Each of your prospects follows a path to a solution — that path involves awareness, consideration, and decision stages. But each of your prospects is in a different part of that journey, so it&#39;s important to use your content to appeal to each stage.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-creation-buyers-journey.jpg?width=650&amp;amp;name=content-creation-buyers-journey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Content creation strategy example: Buyer&#39;s journey&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By creating content for each stage of the buyer&#39;s journey, you&#39;re ensuring that no visitors fall through the cracks and that every individual that comes to your site feels like they are receiving relevant, useful information.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You also want to select a format for your content so that it&#39;s tailored to each stage of the buyer&#39;s journey. A new visitor in the awareness stage won&#39;t want a live demo of your product, but they &lt;em>;would&lt;/em>; read a quick checklist or blog post that helps them better understand their problem. A prospect in the decision stage doesn&#39;t need to know about all the possible solutions, they need a consultation or demo that shows them that your product is the &lt;em>;right&lt;/em>; solution. Always meet your audience where they are.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s a guide to the best content formats for each stage of the buyer&#39;s journey:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-creation-assets.png?width=650&amp;amp;name=content-creation-assets.png&quot; alt=&quot;Content creation strategy: Content examples for stages of the buyer journey&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Perform a content audit.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Whether you&#39;ve been creating content for a while without any clear direction or you&#39;ve been following a strategy all along, every marketing department can benefit from a content audit. Just because you didn&#39;t start out with a clearly defined strategy doesn&#39;t mean that the content you already have won&#39;t fit into one.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A content audit is simply taking inventory of the work you&#39;ve already done, then organizing it to fit under your new content plan.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The process might involve some re-writing, or it could reveal gaps that need to be filled with content that appeals to your persona and their journey stage.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s how you&#39;d perform your content audit:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;Gather all of your content in a spreadsheet.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Create columns for target keywords, buyer persona, buyer&#39;s journey stage, format, and main topic, then fill these in for each content piece.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Add columns for your key metrics, like page views, shares, engagement, etc.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Finally, categorize each post (using highlights or another column) by those that are doing well, need improvement, should be rewritten, or can be merged with another post.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;While a content audit may seem tedious, all the manual labor will be worth the increased traffic and leads. Plus, you&#39;ll have a verified plan moving forward.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If this process seems a bit overwhelming, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/company-content-audit&quot;>;this post&lt;/a>; for some more guidance.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Choose the right format.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Remember that buyer persona you created? You&#39;re creating content &lt;em>;for&lt;/em>; them. That means you should be crafting content in a format that is most easily and enjoyably consumed by your prospects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The format you choose might be a blog post, video, Slideshare, graphic, ebook, whitepaper, podcast, or whatever your creative mind can conceive. As long as it serves your persona, you&#39;ll be in good shape.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also, you don&#39;t need to stick to one format for every piece of content that you create. But you should be able to create content — in whatever format — on a consistent cadence. What I mean is, a podcast series might be a great marketing tactic, but if you lack the resources (and patience) to stick to it, then a blog might be a better route.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Digital content creation is the process of choosing the format (usually digital), and then utilizing the right tools to publish and promote your content online.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Use these questions as a guide when choosing your content format:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;What stage of the buyer&#39;s journey is this for?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How easy is it for your audience to consume this content?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Where does your persona spend their time online?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What format can you create on a consistent basis?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Are you able to produce this content at a quality level that&#39;s competitive?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;Choose capable content creators.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;At this point, you&#39;re ready to start creating content, but first, you&#39;ll need to build a team of content creators. To get started, categorize the type of content you want to create and the type of content creator it takes to produce that content. Below is an example list:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Blogs — Writer&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Social media posts — Social media coordinator&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Podcasts — Podcast host/producer&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Graphics — Graphic designer&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Webinars/Lead Magnets — Lead acquisition expert (content offer producer)&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Videos — Videographer/editor&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;As you can see, there are many different types of content creators you&#39;ll need to either outsource or hire to produce high-quality content that converts your audience from viewers to customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In many organizations, there is one person responsible for a lot of this content, and that is a content marketing strategist. While having one content marketing strategist might make sense, expecting one person to be able to produce all of that content doesn&#39;t.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The best way to go about content creation is to collaborate with freelancers, use influencer marketing to increase your audience reach, and hire a content strategist (or several preferably) to help you organize your content creation.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Promote your content.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;What good is it to create all this great content if no one sees it? In a perfect world, herds of people would flock to your site every time you published a new post. In reality — especially when you&#39;re just starting out — you&#39;ll need to entice people to consume your content and even shepherd them into your online space.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hence why content promotion is just as important to your strategy as whatever content you create.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your promotion plan should be guided by your persona. Where do they spend their time online? What time of day do they use a particular platform? How often do they want to see content from you? How do they like to consume content? What email subject lines get them to click?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Content promotion varies by medium, and there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/how-to-effectively-promote-content&quot;>;specific rules to follow&lt;/a>; for each.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Social Media&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;While social media is a relationship-building tool, it can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/understanding-social-media-promotion&quot;>;used to promote content&lt;/a>;. It&#39;s all about finding the right balance between self-promotion, sharing useful information, and entertainment. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat are all great mediums to both create and share relevant content. The key is modifying that content to fit the platform.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Featured Resources&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-use-twitter-for-business&quot;>;How to Use Twitter for Business (+ Follower Growth Tracking Template)&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/30-days-of-instagram&quot;>;30 Days of Instagram: A Guide for Businesses&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-attract-customers-with-facebook&quot;>;How to Reach &amp;amp; Engage Your Audience With Facebook&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h4>;Email Marketing&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Email is one of the best ways to reach your audience for any reason, especially to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-promotion-ideas&quot;>;promote content&lt;/a>;. The reason is anyone on your email list has opted in to hear from you &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; you can guarantee that they&#39;ll get your messages.

These ads can run on social media, search engines, or other websites. Once you define your buyer persona, you&#39;ll want to go the paid route so as not to waste money targeting uninterested parties. Once you have your audience down, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/media-tactics-to-promote-content&quot;>;paid promotion&lt;/a>; can yield a great ROI.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Featured Resources&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/template-managing-and-organizing-google-adwords-campaigns&quot;>;The Ultimate Google Ads PPC Kit&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/digital-ads-myths&quot;>;Advertising Plan Kit [Free Planning Templates + Guide]&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h4>;Syndication&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Getting your content promoted through authoritative, third-party channels is a great way to build your audience. Syndication gets your brand in front of fresh eyes (and wallets) that you wouldn&#39;t otherwise reach with your own efforts.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Repurpose your content.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When you repurpose content, you&#39;re reusing something you spent a lot of time creating and transforming it in various formats so that it can be more widely consumed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think of it as recycling. You want to spend less time creating and more time getting your content in front of your audience. For example, that blog post that you wrote on marketing stats can also serve as a great infographic or even a video.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you created something in one format, try to think of all the other ways that you could reuse that information that might be just as effective.&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;Creating a Content Plan&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Content exists everywhere, but its success relies on &lt;em>;your&lt;/em>; ability to adapt it to the medium on which it lives. One size does not fit all when it comes to posting on different mediums — or the platforms within those mediums, for that matter.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Social media content varies from blog content, which is different than website content. So, you need to know how to tailor your creation to reach your audience where they are.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s dive into some guidelines for sharing content on various platforms.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Social Media Content&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;There is an art to &lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-creation&quot;>;creating content for social media&lt;/a>;. But it&#39;s well worth your time since there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/&quot;>;3.96 billion&lt;/a>; users across social media platforms worldwide. Plus, someone who follows you on social media is like a warm lead — they already like you and are interested in what you have to say. So, you have an eager audience that&#39;s ready to engage with your content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are a few quick tips for creating content on some popular social channels.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1. Facebook&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Facebook can be used to build micro-communities via Facebook Groups or to share to a mass audience on Facebook Pages. When it comes to sharing content, questions and videos reap the most engagement.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;2. Instagram&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Instagram is best for sharing high-quality imagery and short videos with brief captions. Hashtags work well on this platform as long as they&#39;re relevant to your account and business. Instagram Stories has introduced a new way to engage with your followers, from quick polls to questions to real-time videos.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;3. YouTube&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;YouTube has &lt;a href=&quot;https://influencermarketinghub.com/12-best-types-of-youtube-content/&quot;>;1.3 billion users&lt;/a>; and counting. Users frequent this platform to watch content ranging from DIY videos to parodies. Some of the most successful content on this platform are how-to guides, vlogs, product reviews, and educational videos.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Featured Resources&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/beginners-guide-to-video-marketing&quot;>;The Ultimate Video Marketing Starter Pack&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/youtube-for-business&quot;>;18 YouTube Templates for Business&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h4>;4. TikTok&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;TikTok has become one of the most popular social media platforms of our time. It&#39;s best known for fun, short-form videos. It can be used to engage with your Millennial or Gen Z audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;5. Twitter&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Twitter best practices include short messages, supporting images, relevant hashtags, and retweets. And, of course, replies go a long way to win over your audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Website Content&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Website content should focus on three things: your persona, your target keywords, and your solution.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like your blog content, the copy on your website needs to guide visitors to your solution in a cohesive and natural way.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Think of web content like a map to your product.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Be careful not to turn visitors away through social media feeds and other distracting elements. Once you&#39;ve attracted a potential customer, you must do everything you can to keep them there, and that&#39;s the key function of your website content.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Blog Content&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The purpose of blog content is to support your business by attracting strangers and bringing in qualified leads.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Blog content is a free resource that&#39;s not often directly tied to sales, but don&#39;t underestimate the power of a well-crafted blog to ultimately generate revenue for your business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics&quot;>;Research shows&lt;/a>; that companies that blog more get more traffic and more leads than those that don&#39;t.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Featured Resources&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-start-a-successful-blog&quot;>;How to Start a Successful Blog&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/blog-post-templates&quot;>;6 Free Blog Post Templates&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;The Content Creation Process&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We, marketers, are busy. We don&#39;t have time to waste on inefficient systems. That&#39;s why we create processes for everything we do. We devise a system, roll it out, tweak it until it works, then repeat that system over and over to generate the results we want.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think about every marketing campaign you&#39;ve ever done — webinars, autoresponders, surveys. Each of them had a process. Content creation is no different.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Follow these steps to create content, remove the guesswork, and allow for more creative mental space.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-creation-process.png?width=458&amp;amp;name=content-creation-process.png&quot; alt=&quot;The content creation process&quot; width=&quot;458&quot; style=&quot;width: 458px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. SEO Research&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Creating your buyer persona likely gave you some ideas about what topics to write about and what questions your audience might have, which is a great start.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, you need to confirm if those ideas can apply on a bigger scale to a larger audience. Sure, it would be great to write a blog post directed toward a single person, but, &lt;em>;boy&lt;/em>;, would it be a waste of energy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;SEO research — aka keyword research — will show you the search volume of a specific keyword phrase and whether it&#39;s worth the investment of creating a piece of content around it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A good way to go about keyword research is to write down some questions that your persona might have based on their obstacles and goals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, perform some keyword research around those queries to see if enough people are searching for them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-creation-keyword-research.jpg?width=650&amp;amp;name=content-creation-keyword-research.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Content creation process: Keyword research&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A good approach is to target keywords that are attainable, meaning that they have a monthly search volume (MSV) and keyword difficulty that corresponds to your domain authority.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trying to target high volume (read: highly competitive) keywords when you&#39;ve just started blogging won&#39;t pan out too well for you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Before we go any further, let&#39;s detour into a quick-and-dirty SEO explanation:&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One important factor that helps you to rank in search engines is domain authority. You gain domain authority by how many external sites link back to your content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order for this to happen, you need to have a pretty large library of content that is valuable enough to cite.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That means, the longer you write high-quality content, the higher your domain authority and the easier it is to rank for highly competitive keywords that will put you on the first page of Google.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re not quite there yet, the best thing to do is to target &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/website/best-tools-to-find-long-tail-keywords&quot;>;long-tail&lt;/a>;, low-volume keywords with minimal keyword difficulty (&amp;lt;50) — we&#39;re talking 200-1000 MSV. This will give you the best chance at ranking for keywords and getting your content in front of more people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;SEO lesson concluded. Back to our scheduled programming.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are a few ways you could perform your keyword research:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Use keyword research tools, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semrush.com/&quot;>;SEMRush&lt;/a>; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/explorer&quot;>;Moz Keyword Explorer&lt;/a>;.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Type your keyword into a search engine and take note of the auto-filled queries.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Check out the related searches section on search engine results pages (SERPs).&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Featured Resources&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-conduct-technical-seo-audit&quot;>;How to Run an SEO Audit [Free Kit]&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/seo-myths&quot;>;Complete SEO Starter Pack&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;2. Ideation&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Now that you&#39;ve determined which keywords to target, it&#39;s time to brainstorm some content ideas.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;HubSpot research shows that the best way to organize content is through &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.hubspot.com/topic-clusters-seo&quot;>;topic clusters&lt;/a>;, meaning you create a long-form, comprehensive pillar page based on a keyword that then links to content you&#39;ve created on related subtopics (think blog posts).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-creation-topic-cluster.jpg?width=650&amp;amp;name=content-creation-topic-cluster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Content creation process: Topic clusters&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To illustrate the point, it looks something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJsQLwTeF60&quot;>;this&lt;/a>;. The topic cluster model makes brainstorming because it gives you a structure to follow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can use your main keyword to create a pillar piece that covers that topic in-depth, like … say a guide to content creation. Then, you can create shorter pieces of content like:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Infographics&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Blog posts&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Templates&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;These will help your audience dive deeper into the topic and target long-tail keywords.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re stumped for ideas, you might want to consider looking for inspiration from books you&#39;ve read, industry studies, your competitor&#39;s sites, or related searches on SERPs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once you have all of your ideas down, you can develop your &lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/editorial-calendar-templates&quot;>;editorial calendar&lt;/a>; and start creating.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Writing&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Your specific content creation strength might be videos or graphics or podcasts, but writing is the foundation of most content generation. Whatever content you make, the creation process follows some pretty similar guidelines.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s go over some helpful tips for great content creation.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Write to your persona.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Use their voice, their euphemisms, even their humor to construct a piece that resonates.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Tell your audience why your content is important to them.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Use titles, meta descriptions, and other teasers to compel your audience to read your content. Put the benefit of your content &lt;em>;right&lt;/em>; in the title to let them know why they should read it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Create something unique.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Don&#39;t just regurgitate the information that&#39;s already out there. Infuse a unique style or cite new research to emphasize your points.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Stick to one idea.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Then, use your content to reinforce it. Don&#39;t confuse your reader by going on tangents or trying to explain multiple semi-related topics in a single piece.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Stay true to your voice.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Don&#39;t try to impress your audience with eloquent prose or an expansive vocabulary if &lt;em>;they&lt;/em>; don&#39;t speak that way.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Be clear and concise.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;You want your audience to relate to you and derive value from your content. So, don&#39;t ask them to sift through jargon or confusing metaphors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Featured Resource&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/good-copywriting-practices-list&quot;>;HubSpot&#39;s Copywriting 101&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;4. Editing&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The way you edit your (or others&#39;) work is a very subjective process. You may want to edit as you go, or you might wait a few days and review the work with fresh eyes. You might care a great deal about grammar, or you might aim for a more colloquial piece.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Either way, there are a few things that you should definitely look out for as you refine your content, like active voice, clear language, short sentences, and plenty of whitespace. Consider having a colleague or manager review your work, too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some tools that will help you cut down on your editing time are &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.grammarly.com/&quot;>;Grammarly&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hemingwayapp.com/&quot;>;Hemingway Editor&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Uploading&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Now that your content is ready, you&#39;ll need to put it somewhere that people can access it. A content management system (CMS) is software that hosts digital content and allows you to display it on your website (or anywhere else on the web).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-creation-cms-upload.jpg?width=650&amp;amp;name=content-creation-cms-upload.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Content creation process: CMS upload&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The benefit to a CMS is that it connects all of your content and stores it in one place. So, you can easily link to a landing page in your blog article or insert a content offer in an email.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only that, but you can analyze the results of all the content you created for a specific campaign (which can help with content audits). A CMS saves you from having a disjointed content marketing system.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/content-optimization-system&quot;>;CMS Hub&lt;/a>; is home to our blog, where you get access to all of our great content and useful free offers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;6. Publishing&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Publishing content is as simple as clicking a button. So, why include a section on it? Well, because it&#39;s not always that simple.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can publish your content immediately after uploading, or you can maximize its impact by waiting for an optimal time. If you&#39;re just starting out, then clicking publish right away probably won&#39;t impact your audience too much.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But if you have committed to a regular publishing schedule, like delivering a new post every Wednesday, your audience will expect to see posts published on Wednesdays.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Something else to keep in mind is to publish according to trends or time-sensitive events. For example, if you create content about national holidays or current events, then you&#39;ll want to publish those at specific times.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A CMS will allow you to schedule posts for a future date and specific time, so you can click, schedule, and forget.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;7. Promoting Content&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Finally, it&#39;s time to promote the content you&#39;ve created. You can do this through various mediums including social media, email marketing, and even pay-per-click advertising.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To promote your content, think about what channels your audience is on. Are they on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube? Wherever it might be, it&#39;s important to meet them where they&#39;re at and promote your content on that medium.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Additionally, collaborating with influencers or other brands will help you promote your content and reach more people.&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;Analyzing Your Content&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The final, and arguably most important step in content creation is analyzing your content. Without data, you can&#39;t know what&#39;s working or how to improve it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are several data points you could track when analyzing your content, so use your goals as a guide to set some parameters. Whatever you want to accomplish with your content will help you choose your metrics. (Remember that initial goal we talked about?)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What you analyze is completely up to you, but here are some ideas for metrics to track:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Page Views&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The number of users that visit your content. For blog posts this page views, but for any type of content, there is usually a &quot;views&quot; metric that will let you know how many times your content has been viewed and by how many unique users.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Organic Traffic&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The amount of traffic that comes from search engines. This is unpaid traffic that you get from ranking high on Google or other search engines.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Bounce Rate&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The percentage of visitors who leave your site after visiting only one page. This is an important metric to track because it can let you know that people are interested in clicking your posts, but then the content is immediately unsatisfying.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Conversion Rates&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The percent of visitors that engage with a CTA — whether it&#39;s a content offer, or filling out a form.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Engagement Rates&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The number of people that interact with your content through likes, shares, comments, or in other ways.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Audience Growth&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The new subscribers or leads that are generated from a piece of content.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Time On Page&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The amount of time a user is on your page, whether it&#39;s a blog post, or a video (for video content this might be average watch time). It&#39;s important to keep track of where users drop off. Do they stay on the page long enough to read the post or consume the content?&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Paid Campaigns&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The amount of traffic that comes in from paid campaigns. If you sponsor posts on social media or pay for search engine ads, it&#39;s important to track how much traffic comes from those campaigns.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you need more tips on analyzing your content, check out this free &lt;a href=&quot;https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/measuring-and-analyzing-your-content&quot;>;HubSpot Academy course&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;Content Creation Tools&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;While a CMS will help you manage your content, it won&#39;t help you create it. That&#39;s where content creation tools come in handy. These are especially useful if you&#39;re artistically impaired, like me, or if you don&#39;t have the capacity to hire help. From GIFs to infographics, these content creation tools will help you look like a professional, regardless of what kind of content you&#39;re making.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona&quot;>;Make My Persona&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;MakeMyPersona is HubSpot&#39;s own nifty tool that will walk you through the process of creating your buyer persona.

Giphy allows you to search millions of pre-created GIFs in their database or even create your own.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vidyard.com/&quot;>;Vidyard&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Vidyard is a video hosting platform that was made for marketers.

If you want to see what a website looked like at any period since its launch, enter its domain name into the&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.org/web/&quot;>; &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.org/web/&quot;>;Wayback Machine&lt;/a>; and choose a date. In this post, let&#39;s take a look at how web design has evolved, from text-only interfaces up through the sleek, modern designs we see today.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a class=&quot;cta_button&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=c791aced-6180-48a5-916d-b2d76cec1836&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid=&amp;amp;hseid=&amp;amp;hsic=&quot;>;&lt;img class=&quot;hs-cta-img &quot; style=&quot;height: auto !important; width: auto !important; max-width: 100% !important;border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px&quot; alt=&quot;Free Download: 77 Examples of Brilliant Web Design&amp;nbsp;&quot; height=&quot;60&quot; width=&quot;477&quot; src=&quot;https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/c791aced-6180-48a5-916d-b2d76cec1836.png&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Early 1990s: Antiquity&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The early 90s marks the start of our website &lt;a href=&quot;https://venngage.com/blog/timeline-template/&quot;>;design timeline&lt;/a>;. At this point, there was no such thing as a high-speed internet connection. It was dial-up modems, or it was nothing. Therefore, websites needed to be built for less-than-stellar connection speeds. They mostly looked like walls of text — what we now take for granted as &quot;design layout&quot; did not exist.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;history of web design: an examle of an early html website&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/history%20of%20web%20design%20(update)-1.jpeg?width=650&amp;amp;name=history%20of%20web%20design%20(update)-1.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While later versions of HTML allowed for more complex designs, they were still very basic compared to today, consisting mainly of tags for headers, paragraphs, and links. Visual elements and styling like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/website/website-typography&quot;>;typography&lt;/a>;, imagery, and navigation were things of the not-too distant future.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Takeaways for Today&#39;s Websites:&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;While the function of these early sites was purely informational, we can see some design elements that apply today. These old web pages were very lightweight and optimized for a slow internet connection we all still experience from time to time. These design considerations took the user experience into account, something today&#39;s websites don&#39;t always do, even with faster speeds.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yes, today&#39;s internet can handle media-rich websites ... but it still has some limits. Large media files, heavy graphic design, and excessive animations can all contribute to higher bounce rates when load speeds aren&#39;t as fast as we want. Keep your user in mind when considering complicated design, and remember to KISS (Keep It Simple, Superhero).&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Mid-1990s: The Middle Ages&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The middle ages of web design were plagued by on-site page builders and spacer GIFs. (Better than an actual plague though, right?) By the mid-90s, web design had evolved both in terms of structure and appearance. Designers began using table-based layouts to organize content, allowing for greater flexibility and creativity. Sites were still quite text heavy, but text could now be divided into columns, rows, and other navigational elements for better readability.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Graphical design elements also quickly grew in popularity. Page hit counters, animated text, and dancing GIFs are just a few of the graphical elements that mark this period in web design.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;history of web design: the early version of apple&#39;s website&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/history%20of%20web%20design%20(update)-Mar-23-2022-09-25-43-49-PM.jpeg?width=650&amp;amp;name=history%20of%20web%20design%20(update)-Mar-23-2022-09-25-43-49-PM.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Takeaways for Today&#39;s Websites:&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Today, there are plenty of reasons why table-based design is not the best choice for your website — the extensive markup, slow load times, and visual inconsistency are just a few of the pitfalls.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regardless, this development was key in the evolution of web design: It was the first move toward non-linear page structure. Different elements could now be positioned in different sections of a web page, and designers had to consider the best way to present information to the user.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Page structure remains critical when thinking about navigation and content. It largely determines how the user experiences and interacts with your site. While these considerations might not have been at the forefront during the middle ages of web design, they are certainly at the forefront today.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Late 1990s: The Renaissance&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Renaissance.重生。 Web design has had its fair share of reimaginings, but one of the first occurred with the introduction of Flash. Introduced in 1996, Flash opened up a world of design possibilities that weren&#39;t possible with basic HTML. It was the marriage of virtual graphics and interaction.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While many of the same design elements from previous periods were still present, they were enhanced with animations, tiled background images, neon colors, 3D buttons, splash pages, and other multimedia.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Flash marked the beginning of visitor-focused design — structure and navigation became important considerations and designers began to hone in on appearance and usability over pure content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;history of web design: a website with flash elements&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/history%20of%20web%20design%20(update)-3.jpeg?width=650&amp;amp;name=history%20of%20web%20design%20(update)-3.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Takeaways for Today&#39;s Websites:&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Flash was a game-changer, but it wouldn&#39;t stick around forever. Flash is hardly ever used today and is deemed one of the biggest SEO sins of all time. Today, it&#39;s the norm to opt for alternative methods such as CSS and JavaScript animations to get similar effects, or to embed videos from video hosting sites.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Early 2000s: The Enlightenment&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The early 2000s were a period when usability and flexibility really came to the forefront of web design.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leading the charge was &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-tutorial&quot;>;CSS&lt;/a>;, a coding language that allowed developers to store visual rules in files separate from HTML, effectively separating content and style. This gave greater creative freedom to both web designers and content developers — content could now be developed exclusively from design, and vice versa. CSS made websites easier to maintain (less code and complexity), more flexible (div tags are independent of one another), and quicker to load (smaller files).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Better understanding of color psychology also led to increased use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/whitespace-web-design&quot;>;whitespace&lt;/a>; and the decrease of garish colors, like neons. Links started being added to icons rather than just text, resolution and pixelation became more important concerns, and strategic placement of content also gained traction.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;history of web design: an early website for the company polaroid&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/history%20of%20web%20design%20(update).jpeg?width=650&amp;amp;name=history%20of%20web%20design%20(update).jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Takeaways for Today&#39;s Websites:&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;People typically scan websites looking for the information they need, so any site that makes this job easier gets a giant check-mark. Savvy web designers know that most users don&#39;t read everything on a website, and understand how readers take in information.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, intuitively placed information, visually accentuated links, and straightforward &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/website/main-website-navigation-ht&quot;>;navigation&lt;/a>; are just a few best practices today&#39;s websites should adhere to. Always design with usability in mind!&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Mid- to Late-2000s: The Industrial Revolution&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The Industrial Revolution of web design begins with the birth of Web 2.0. It&#39;s at this time that things really began to move toward the modern web. The growth of multimedia applications, the rise of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/website/interactive-websites&quot;>;interactive content&lt;/a>;, and the advent of social media are a few definitive features of this period.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, these changes largely dictated the way web design was ... well, &lt;em>;done&lt;/em>;. Aesthetic changes included better color distribution, increased use of icons, and greater attention to typography.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most importantly, however, design became about content, and content became about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/designing-for-humans-and-bots-too&quot;>;search engine optimization&lt;/a>;. With the user now firmly at the center of design, selling products (at least explicitly) became the secondary function of websites — now it was all about getting found.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;history of web design: a mid-2000s website for the company lulu lemon&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/history%20of%20web%20design%20(update)-4.jpeg?width=650&amp;amp;name=history%20of%20web%20design%20(update)-4.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; width: 650px; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Takeaways for Today&#39;s Websites:&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As mentioned, the evolution of Web 2.0 saw the growth of SEO as a consideration. While these techniques have been adapted over the years, thinking about your website in terms of SEO is still a top priority for most thriving business websites.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;SEO demands content, and content largely became the focus of web design during this era. Keyword optimization, inbound and outbound linking, authoring, tagging, and syndication technology such as RSS became natural design elements. While link spamming and keyword jamming soon exploited these techniques, these methods are no longer effective and (I hope) have largely fizzled out.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;2010 to Now: The Modern Era&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Today, over two decades after the publication of the first website, web design has firmly established itself as an irreplaceable component of every good marketing strategy. Recent research found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/web-design-stats-for-2020&quot;>;50% of today&#39;s consumers think website design is crucial to a business&#39;s brand&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/elements-of-modern-web-design-list&quot;>;modern aesthetics&lt;/a>;, we have seen the proliferation of minimalism: sparse content, flat graphics (so long, 3D buttons!), simpler color palettes, and big and bold visuals. In addition, UX has taken center stage, giving way to such design features as &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/infinite-scrolling&quot;>;infinite scrolling&lt;/a>; and single-page design.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You may have noticed that our website has embraced all these features with its latest design:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;history of web design: a modern website for the company hubspot&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/history%20of%20web%20design%20(update)-2.jpeg?width=650&amp;amp;name=history%20of%20web%20design%20(update)-2.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One more key step in the evolution of web design is the mobile web. Since the launch of the iPhone in 2007, there has been a re-evaluation of the way websites are structured to accommodate for the growing number of mobile web users. This includes several mobile frameworks that take a “mobile-first” approach, and an even greater focus on mobile speed optimization, since phones usually lack the processing speed or connection strength of your typical desktop.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This digital revolution has also given rise to responsive design, in which page elements automatically adjust to the width of the browsing window, allowing websites to look good on any device or screen. Today, responsive design is necessary to ensure a pleasing mobile user experience, given &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/&quot;>;over half of global website traffic comes from mobile devices&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;AI and the Future of Website Design&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If there&#39;s one factor that has informed every single one of these developments, it&#39;s content. Every design element here has been adapted in such a way to bring the most relevant content to the user efficiently and effectively.

Using this guide will help you create realistic goals for your team.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;3. Build your email list.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;You need people to email, right? An email list (we&#39;ll cover how to build your email list in the next section) is a group of users who have permitted you to send them relevant content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To build that list, you need several ways for prospects to opt-in to receive your emails which we&#39;ll cover in another section in just a moment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Don&#39;t be discouraged if you only have a few people on your list. It can take some time to build. In the meantime, treat every subscriber and lead like gold, and you&#39;ll start seeing your email list grow organically.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;4. Choose an email campaign type.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Email campaigns vary, and trying to decide between them can be overwhelming. Do you send a weekly newsletter? Should you send out new product announcements? Which blog posts are worth sharing?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The answer is subjective.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can start by learning about the types of email campaigns, then decide which is best for your audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You should also set up different lists for different types of emails, so customers and prospects can sign up for only the emails that are relevant to them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;5. Make a schedule.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Decide how often you plan to contact your list and inform your audience upfront.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This way, they&#39;ll know exactly what to expect ahead of time. Forgetting this can lead to high unsubscribe lists and even get you in their spam.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, once you set a schedule, be consistent. It will build trust &lt;em>;and&lt;/em>; ensure you stay top of mind for your audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;6. Measure your results.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This should come as no surprise. As marketers, we measure everything. Being meticulous about every key metric will help you make small changes to your emails, yielding large results.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We&#39;re going to touch on the exact KPIs to monitor in a bit (or you can jump ahead).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that you understand the steps to creating an email marketing strategy, we&#39;ll look at what&#39;s involved in building your email list.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;2. Choose an email marketing platform.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;An email marketing provider (ESP) is an excellent resource if you&#39;re looking any support while fine-tuning your email marketing efforts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email&quot;>; HubSpot&#39;s Email Marketing tool&lt;/a>; allows you to efficiently create, personalize, and optimize marketing emails that feel and look professional without designers or IT.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are a variety of features to help you create the best email marketing campaigns and support all of your email marketing goals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Additionally, you can analyze the success of your email marketing so you can share the data that matters most to your business with your team.最好的部分？ You can use HubSpot&#39;s Email Marketing service for&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email&quot;>; free&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-examples-list&quot;>;examples&lt;/a>; of features services like HubSpot offer to consider when&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.logaster.com/blog/email-marketing-services/&quot;>; choosing an email service provider&lt;/a>;:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;CRM platform with segmentation capabilities&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Good standing with Internet Service Providers&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;A positive reputation as an email service provider (ESP)&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Easy-to-build forms, landing pages, and CTAs&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Automation&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Simple ways to comply with email regulations&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Ability to split test your emails&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Built-in analytics&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Downloadable reports&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;3.

Use lead magnets.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Your lead magnet is exactly as it sounds: It attracts prospects to your email list, usually as a free offer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The offer can take many formats, should be valuable to your prospects, and is given away for free in exchange for an email address.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s just one problem: People have become hyper-protective of their personal information. You can&#39;t expect to receive an email address without exchanging it for something valuable.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think about a lead magnet that is relevant, useful, and makes your prospects&#39; lives easier.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are a few &lt;strong>;types of lead magnets&lt;/strong>; you could create:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Ebooks.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Whitepapers.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Infographics.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Reports or studies.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Checklists.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Templates.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Webinars or courses.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Tools.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re short on resources, you can even&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/creating-lead-generation-offers-from-blogs&quot;>; repurpour existing content to create lead magnets&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;4. Create an enticing opt-in form.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Your opt-in form is how you get a prospect&#39;s information to add them to your list. It&#39;s the gate between your future leads and the incredible asset you created with them in mind.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are some tips for creating an enticing opt-in form:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Create an attractive design and attention-grabbing header.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Your form should be branded, stand out from the page, and entice people to sign up.

Any information on your form should be a truthful representation of the offer.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Keep the form simple.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This could be one of your first interactions with your prospect.

Double-check that the form works as intended, the thank you page is live, and your offer is delivered as promised.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is one of your first impressions of your new lead — make it a professional and positive one.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Next, let&#39;s take a moment to cover some universally-accepted email marketing best practices regarding how to send marketing emails.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;List snippet&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If all goes well, you&#39;ll have built a robust list of subscribers and leads waiting to hear from you. But you can&#39;t start emailing just yet unless you want to end up in a spam folder, or worse, a blocked list.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are a few important things to remember before you start emailing your list.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;1. Implement email segmentation.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Once you&#39;ve added people to your list, you must break them down into different segments.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That way, instead of having a monolithic email list of everybody, you&#39;ll have easier-to-manage subcategories that pertain to your subscribers&#39; unique characteristics, interests, and preferences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our subscribers are humans, after all, and we should do our best to treat them as such. That means not sending generic email blasts.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why should you segment your email list?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Each person who signs up to receive your emails is at a different level of readiness to convert into a customer (which is the ultimate goal of all this).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you send a discount coupon for your product to subscribers that don&#39;t even know how to diagnose their problem, you&#39;ll probably lose them. That&#39;s because you&#39;re skipping the part where you build trust and develop the relationship.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every email you send should treat your subscribers like humans you want to connect with, as opposed to a herd of leads you&#39;re trying to corral into a one-size-fits-all box.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more you segment your list, the more trust you build with your leads, and the easier it&#39;ll be to convert them later.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How to Segment Email Lists&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The first step in segmentation is creating separate lead magnets and opt-in forms for each part of the buyer&#39;s journey. That way, your contacts are automatically divided into separate lists.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beyond that, email marketing platforms allow you to&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-list-segmentation&quot;>; segment your email list&lt;/a>; by contact data and behavior to help you send the right emails to the right people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are some ways you could break up your list:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Geographical location.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Lifecycle stage.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Awareness, consideration, and decision stage.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Industry.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Previous engagement with your brand.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Language.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Job Title.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;In reality, you can segment your list any way that you want. Just make sure to be as exclusive as possible when sending emails to each subgroup.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;2. A/B test your marketing emails.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Not all email lists are created equal. Some audiences prefer personalization, and others will think it&#39;s spammy. Some audiences will like bright, eye-catching CTA buttons. Others will prefer a more subtle call-to-action.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You&#39;ll never know what type of people make up your email list until you test the variables. That&#39;s where A/B testing comes in handy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“If you&#39;re considering making any structural or content alterations to your email marketing, A/B testing is an excellent way to determine if the changes will be successful or worthwhile before they&#39;re implemented on a larger scale,” says Madison Zoey Vettorino, marketing manager and SEO content writer for HubSpot&#39;s Website Blog.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Surprisingly, not many brands leverage it. A&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.litmus.com/resources/state-of-email/&quot;>; 2021 Litmus study&lt;/a>; found that 44% of marketers rarely A/B or multivariate test their emails. Only 19% do it often or always.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Copy%20of%20Linkedin%20-%201104x736%20-%20Quote%20+%20Headshot%20-%20Dark%20(2).jpg?width=1104&amp;amp;height=736&amp;amp;name=Copy%20of%20Linkedin%20-%201104x736%20-%20Quote%20+%20Headshot%20-%20Dark%20(2).jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Copy of Linkedin - 1104x736 - Quote + Headshot - Dark (2)&quot; width=&quot;1104&quot; height=&quot;736&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 1104px;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A/B testing, or split testing, is a way to see what type of email performs best with your audience by analyzing the results of email A against email B. This can be especially helpful when working with templates.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Since emails often have the same template, A/B testing is smart because you can usually control variables outside of the test and get a solid signal on what performs better,” HubSpot&#39;s Litterst says.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s the step-by-step process for A/B testing your emails:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Select &lt;em>;one&lt;/em>; variable to test at a time, eg, subject line, CTA, images.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Create two versions of the email: one with and one without the variable.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Allow your emails to be sent out simultaneously for a period of time.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Analyze your results and keep only the version that performed better.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Test a new variable and repeat the process.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Most email service providers will have A/B testing built into their software, which will make it easy for you to compare email results without much manual work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When conducting an A/B test, consider these tips:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Test one element at a time.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“For example, try the same email with a different subject line. Or the same email and same subject line with a different CTA,” says Curtis del Principe, a user acquisition program lead and content strategist at HubSpot.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It might be tempting to make several changes at once, but that makes it harder to pinpoint the true cause of your wins or losses,” he says.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Don&#39;t try to &quot;eyeball&quot; an A/B test.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A/B test should be run with intention. Making quick changes and approaching results unscientifically can lead to incorrect conclusions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“You might be tempted to run an informal A/B test by making a change and then casually paying attention to the responses that you get. This unscientific method can easily be skewed by factors outside your control (like seasonality or deliverability),” says del Principe. “It also leaves out a ton of valuable data, like open rate, click-through rate, unsubscribe rate, or sharing/forwarding rate.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instead, use an email marketing tool, like Marketing Hub or BuzzStream, to help you get a broader and more accurate understanding of your email performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Featured Resource&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit?hubs_post-cta=inline-text&quot;>;The Complete Guide to A/B Testing&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;3. Analyze your email marketing performance.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Once you&#39;ve got your first few campaigns, it&#39;s time to see how they&#39;re performing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By diving into your email marketing analytics, you&#39;ll be able to make better decisions that will help your business&#39;s bottom line, resonate with your subscribers, readers, and customers, and justify your work to the rest of your company.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are the best ways to analyze the effectiveness of your email marketing campaigns.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;4. Set email marketing KPIs.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;There are four key metrics to pay attention to when evaluating the effectiveness of your email marketing campaign.&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Deliverability &lt;/strong>;measures the rate at which emails reach your intended subscribers&#39; inboxes.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Open rate &lt;/strong>;is the percentage of people that open your email once it reaches their inbox.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Clickthrough rate (CTR)&lt;/strong>; is the percentage of people that click on your CTAs.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Unsubscribes &lt;/strong>;measures the number of people who opt out of your email list once they receive your email.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;5. Adjust email components to improve results.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Many factors impact your KPIs, and it will take some experimentation and guesswork to figure out which tweaks to your emails will yield the biggest significance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you aren&#39;t getting the desired numbers, try playing with these variables to&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/make-emails-more-clickable-list&quot;>; improve your email results&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Deliverability&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Ensure that you&#39;re following best practices regarding spam filters.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Remove inactive people from your email list to keep only engaged subscribers.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Check which emails have bounced and remove those email addresses from your list.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Open Rate&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Play with the language in your subject line to entice people to click on your email.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Adjust the time and day that you send your email to see what works best.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Clickthrough Rate (CTR)&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Evaluate your offer to ensure that it provides value to your segmented list.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Rewrite your copy to make sure that it&#39;s clear what you want the reader to do.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Try different CTAs, eg, graphic versus Inline copy, bold versus subtle.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Unsubscribes&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;First, consider if this is a blessing in disguise, as uninterested parties are removing themselves from your list.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Regularly send an email to inactive subscribers on your list asking if they still want to be a part of it&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Evaluate whether the email you sent is aligned with your brand.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Ensure you haven&#39;t performed a bait-and-switch by promising one thing and delivering another.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Make sure your emails are providing value to your audience before trying to upsell.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;6. Use an email marketing report template.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Once you&#39;ve got some campaigns under your belt, it&#39;s time to look at how they performed. Your data does no good if you can&#39;t report it in an organized fashion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An email marketing report is a spreadsheet where you can record your results in one place to help you make inferences from your KPIs and take action to improve them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s how you should organize your report.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Metrics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Total number of emails sent&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Number of emails delivered&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Deliverability Rate&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Bounce Rate&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Open Rate&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Clickthrough Rate (CTR)&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Click-to-open Rate (CTOR)&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Unsubscribe Rate&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Data&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Subject line&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Length of the email body&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Offer&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;CTA (inline or graphic)&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;List segment(s)&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Questions To Ask:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Was your deliverability rate high in comparison to previous periods?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How did your CTR compare to your open rate?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Were your unsubscribe numbers consistent with other emails?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Did a certain subject line perform better than others?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Does the length of the email make a difference in CTR?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Could another style of CTA perform better?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Was the offer appropriate for the list segment?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Email Regulations You Should Know&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Email regulations are important to follow as they regulate and protect &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.janrain.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/online-consumers-fed-irrelevant-content-favorite-websites-according&quot;>;consumers&#39; desires to know how and why their information is being used&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If there&#39;s anything we care about, it&#39;s complying with what our customers—or potential customers—want.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are a few key ones that you should understand:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;1. CAN-SPAM Compliance&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Technically, CAN-SPAM is an acronym for Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing (because sometimes the two go together).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In practice, it&#39;s a way to protect your subscribers&#39; right to only receive emails that they&#39;ve requested.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The law was passed in 2003 and applies to any commercial emails used for business purposes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are the ways to ensure that your emails are CAN-SPAM compliant:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Include your company name and address in every email.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Place visible unsubscribe links within your emails.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Use real email addresses in the &quot;From&quot; and &quot;Reply to&quot; fields.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Write subject lines that indicate the contents of the email.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Please note: This is not to be confused with legal advice.

GDPR Compliance&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;While some may view these newly implemented email regulations as burdensome and unnecessary, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) moves us closer to building long-lasting, trusting customer relationships.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;GDPR is about giving your customers the right to choose. They choose your emails. They decide to hear from you. They choose your products. And that is exactly what inbound marketing is about.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is important to note that GDPR only applies to businesses operating in the European Union and businesses that market to EU citizens.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Noncompliance will result in significant fees that aren&#39;t worth the risk, so make sure to read the&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-the-gdpr&quot;>; GDPR guidelines&lt;/a>; entirely.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s an overview of how you can comply with GDPR laws:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Use precise language when requesting consent to store personal information.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Only collect contact data that is necessary for and relevant to your business.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Store contact data securely and only use it for the agreed-upon purpose.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Retain data for justifiable business purposes only.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Delete contact data on request.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Make it easy for contacts to unsubscribe from your list or update their preferences.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Comply promptly with a contact&#39;s request for access to their data.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Keep company records to prove GDPR compliance.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;These regulations will be taken seriously (as they should), so it&#39;s a good idea to create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/gdpr-everything-you-need-to-know&quot;>;GDPR strategy&lt;/a>; for your business before sending emails.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;3. Avoid Spam Filters&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;You spend time creating the perfect email and adhering to regulations, so the last thing you want is to end up in a spam folder.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You&#39;ll want to avoid the spam folder because:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;It hurts your deliverability rates across the board.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Your contacts will likely miss all of your emails.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;You won&#39;t be able to measure your email marketing effectiveness accurately.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Your analytics will be skewed.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;You can avoid being deduced to spam with the following.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Get whitelisted.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A whitelist is a list of approved senders that can reach the subscriber&#39;s inbox.
