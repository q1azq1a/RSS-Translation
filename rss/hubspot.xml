&lt;p>;根据我们的 &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/website/web-traffic -analytics-report&quot;>;网络流量和分析报告&lt;/a>;，75% 的网络分析师认为生成式 AI 集成搜索将对他们的博客产生积极影响，68% 的人预测他们的博客将获得比以前更多的流量。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是他们是正确的还是这只是一厢情愿？在这里，让我们深入了解 SGE 如何长期影响您网站的排名。&lt;/p>;

&lt;h2 >;人工智能集成到搜索引擎的优点&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;如上所述，大多数网络分析师预计人工智能集成会对 SERP 产生积极影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，SGE 将对用户体验产生积极影响。它将提供更准确、更相关的信息，让用户更快、更高效地找到他们想要的内容。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，人工智能集成的搜索引擎将根据用户偏好和过去的记录创建更加个性化的结果。行为。用户将享受根据其需求量身定制的内容的更加定制化的体验。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;得益于自动语言翻译功能，可访问性是人工智能集成搜索的另一个出色优势，可以促进不同语言之间的交流。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人工智能生成的翻译将打破语言障碍，让更广泛的受众能够获取信息（和内容）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，生成式人工智能可以帮助创建独特的内容，例如摘要、建议和建议激发用户兴趣并提供新鲜的想法。&lt;/p>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-wrapper&quot;

&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;h2>;搜索引擎中人工智能集成的挑战&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;当然，存在一些担忧和可能人工智能集成搜索的缺点。其中一个问题是非个性化的用户体验。我们的报告发现，与通用人工智能相比，许多用户更喜欢人类的响应。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;非个性化的用户体验也可能导致用户缺乏信任。&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;我们的报告显示，用户对人工智能生成的回复持怀疑态度，因为他们期望得到有偏见或不可信的信息。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，用户表示需要仔细检查人工智能生成的回复，因为程序员的偏见。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于 Google 的 &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-sge，营销人员也可能会遇到可见度和自然流量下降的情况。 -other-google-search-changes-could-impact-your-traffic-data-predictions#:~:text=How%20could%20SGE%20affect%20web,pushes%20them%20beneath%20the%20fold。&quot;>;AI 快照&lt;/a>; 功能，这会将某些内容推到用户视线之外。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;如何适应人工智能集成的 SERPS&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;有很多方法可以帮助您准备好您的内容。搜索引擎中人工智能集成的网站。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;培训、研究和学习&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;培训您的员工了解并使用人工智能工具和技术。考虑参加会议、研讨会或网络研讨会，以了解您行业中人工智能的最新进展，并在竞争中保持领先地位。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;您还应该研究使用人工智能的其他企业以及他们如何集成该技术。此外，采取措施了解算法、模型和功能。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;集成和实施&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;寻找将人工智能集成到网站和数字营销策略中的方法，例如下载和使用人工智能-驱动的软件和应用程序。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们的研究表明，&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/website/web-traffic-analytics-report&quot;>;50% 的博客作者在以下方面使用人工智能一些能力&lt;/a>;，无论是集思广益、大纲还是文案编辑。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;网站利用人工智能的网络分析师中，74% 的人表示这可以让他们的内容表现更好，65% 的人表示这有助于他们的页面排名搜索结果页面 (SERP) 更高。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首次将人工智能实施到您的数字营销策略中可能具有挑战性，因此您应该考虑聘请人工智能领域的专业人士并组织专门致力于该技术的团队。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些专业人员可以测试算法，进行程序测试。&lt;/p>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;overflow:hidden;width:100%;height:auto;padding:0px;max-宽度：560px；最小宽度：256px；显示：块；边距：自动;&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-content-wrapper&quot;>;

&lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;h3>;优化和改进&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;在策略中利用人工智能并不是万能药。超越人工智能，您还必须优化关键字使用、SEO 管理、关键字搜索和搜索结果，以跟上人工智能集成的 SERP。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com /marketing/seo-predictions&quot;>;SGE 将改变在 SERP 上表现最佳的内容类型&lt;/a>;。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，在后 SGE 世界中，HubSpot 的 SEO 全球增长总监 Aja Frost 认为，第一人称、专家、个性驱动的内容效果最佳。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正如&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-predictions&quot;>;她所说的那样&lt;/a>;，“由于人工智能的发展，人工智能编写的低价值内容的数量呈指数级增长。为此，谷歌正在优先考虑第一人称、可信的、个性化的内容——驱动内容。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，更新搜索定义和网站列表。您还必须利用 SERP 工具并改进网站查询和说明。&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;那么，SGE 会产生负面或正面影响吗？ &lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;您是否会从 SGE 的变革中受益将取决于您的组织在适应人工智能集成 SERP 方面的主动程度。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据我们的报告，57 % 的网络分析师已经采取措施，为生成式人工智能与搜索引擎集成做好准备。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些步骤包括上面提到的技巧，例如对团队人员进行人工智能使用培训并将其实施到他们的工作流程中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;没有办法解决这个问题 - SGE 会影响您的网络流量；其影响取决于您组织的准备情况。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a class=&quot;cta_button&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973- 772d11ef72d3&amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;amp;hsic=&quot;>;&lt;img class=&quot;hs-cta-img&quot;

&lt;p>;但是，如果人们不再通过您的品牌来寻找内容……他们转向人工智能，情况会怎样呢？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于人工智能，营销行业正在迅速发生变化，并且任何变化都会影响到营销行业。质疑现状是很正常的：传统的入站营销策略会在后人工智能世界中继续取得胜利吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;入站营销不会消失，但它正在发生变化，因为人工智能的结果。在这里，让我们深入探讨未来几年营销人员在入站营销和人工智能方面可能会看到的一些变化。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a class=&quot;cta_button&quot; href=&quot;https://www. hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b72f2b25-8cc9-4642-9a1b-1e675d3d273b&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=&quot;>;&lt;img class=&quot;hs-cta-img &quot;

&lt;p>;在短期内，HubSpot 创意总监 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewrwatkins/&quot;>;Matthew Watkins&lt;/a>; 相信人工智能将降低了我们在网络和社交渠道上看到的内容的质量。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正如他所说，“人工智能使创建绝对最糟糕类型的内容变得更容易。它并没有改变真正的创作方式重要并改善人们生活的优质内容。创作者可以使用人工智能工具更快地创作吗？当然，但真正有价值的内容仍然需要人类来提取洞察力。创作者仍然需要一个好主意来让人工智能为他们服务。”&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;沃特金斯补充道，“不幸的是，人工智能将用平淡、空洞的陈词滥调、图像和视频充斥互联网（比现在更多）。找到好东西在变得容易之前会变得更加困难。”&lt; /p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;当您考虑所有重大技术变革时，您会发现同样的模式正在发生。例如，在社交媒体的早期，人们主要在 Facebook 帐户上发布大量未经编辑的照片。如今，人们在创建高质量内容方面变得更加精明，因为这是在社交媒体上脱颖而出的唯一途径。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然我们绝对会看到内容价值在短期内下降，但它不可避免地会产生回旋镖从长远来看，回归到高质量的内容。随着在线内容数量的增加，如果您想在后人工智能世界中脱颖而出，质量将成为您的战略中越来越重要的一个方面。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，一个营销团队将更容易度过难关在人工智能的帮助下与主要企业团队竞争。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为首席编辑主管&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/harmanus/&quot;>;Ben Harmanus&lt; /a>; 指出，“人工智能工具使人们能够在短时间内‘体验’一个想法。这不一定是坏事。它有助于更​​快地迭代和再次测试，因为‘测试’并不那么昂贵就像以前一样。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/quote%20from%20Ben%20Harmanus%20on%20how%20AI%20will %20change%20inbound%20marketing.png?width=1104&amp;amp;height=736&amp;amp;name=quote%20from%20Ben%20Harmanus%20on%20how%20AI%20will%20change%20inbound%20marketing.png&quot; alt=&quot;引自 Ben Harmanus关于人工智能将如何改变入站营销&quot; width=&quot;1104&quot; height=&quot;736&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 1104px;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他继续说道，“现在一个人可以更轻松地超越公司营销部门，因为这个人可以立即将想法发布。它仍然需要一个能够输入智能提示的人，一个了解品牌一致性有多重要的人，一个能够区分好坏的人。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是我们将要进行的重大转变之一人工智能的结果是：营销将成为一个更加公平的竞争环境。您不需要企业级营销预算来竞争。人工智能将成为任何营销人员都可以用来创建更强大内容的工具。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Harmanus 认为，人工智能对内容创建的影响就像云 CRM 对电子表格联系人管理的影响一样 — 换句话说，它将改变几乎一切。&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;2. 人工智能将彻底改变用户对时事通讯的期望。&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;目前，电子邮件个性化很大程度上仅限于象征性个性化，就像我在电子邮件开头看到的“嘿，卡罗琳”。&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;但是人工智能的出现将彻底改变这种情况。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了了解人工智能将如何影响时事通讯的创作，我与 &lt;a href=&quot;https://rasa.io/&quot;>;rasa 进行了交谈.io&lt;/a>; 首席创新官，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/pchristmann/&quot;>;Paul Christmann&lt;/a>;。 rasa.io 是一种工具，使公司能够自动从网络上提取相关文章，并将其包含在他们的电子邮件通讯中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个过程只能在人工智能的帮助下进行。&lt;/p>; >; &lt;p>;正如 Christmann 告诉我的那样，“我们的人工智能试图找到可在网络上访问的其他内容，并且与发送者和接收者都相关。这就是人工智能真正的闪光点：当它可以创造根据我们对每个人的了解，为每个人量身定制时事通讯。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他补充道，“如果我们在网络上搜索，为收件人找到强有力的内容，我们如何梳理 500 堆新闻通讯？垃圾邮件找到真正值得花时间阅读的好内容？然后，在该内容池中，我们如何找到适合每个读者的选择？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;想象一个世界，其中每个时事通讯已根据您的兴趣、价值观和内容偏好进行策划。与随着时间的推移而变得更加智能的社交媒体算法类似，这些时事通讯将手动提供最能引起您共鸣的内容。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于您的时事通讯策略来说，这是进行重大调整的绝佳机会。未来，用户将期望这种个性化，因此电子邮件营销人员将希望通过测试人工智能现在如何帮助他们做好准备。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Christmann 指出，目前大规模个性化还面临着挑战：即，您无法在每封电子邮件发出之前对其进行编辑。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正如他所说，“如果我有十万人的受众，我就不会阅读其中的十万封电子邮件电子邮件正在校对中。所以它仍然让我陷入这种奇怪的爆炸方法中。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着时间的推移，Christmann 相信这一挑战将通过人工智能得到解决。他告诉我，“随着时间的推移，人工智能将帮助我定制这些消息，并确保它具有我的声音、我的语气等。人工智能将通过多种方式继续增强时事通讯的创作。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/quote%20from%20Paul%20Christmann%20on%20how%20AI%20will%20change%20inbound%20marketing.png?width=1200&amp;amp; height=628&amp;name=quote%20from%20Paul%20Christmann%20on%20how%20AI%20will%20change%20inbound%20marketing.png&quot;

&lt;p>;除了内容创建之外，人工智能还将彻底改变营销团队的数据分析。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in /cdevona/&quot;>;Chris Devona&lt;/a>;，HubSpot 的高级付费媒体经理，目前利用 ChatGPT 来格式化他的广告活动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他说，“我有一个工作原型，可以让我提交简短的内容我在 ChatGPT 的代码解释器中创建了该摘要。然后，ChatGPT 将摘要格式化为 CSV 文件，我可以下载该文件，然后将其上传到 Google Ads，以批量创建整个广告系列或轻松进行编辑。这样可以节省数小时的手动格式化时间。”&lt;/p>; &lt;想象一下作为一名营销人员，您全天要做的一些更多手动任务。哪些可以使用人工智能实现自动化？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正如 Devona 告诉我的那样，“我还在研究一个工作流程，允许人工智能‘分析’每周的数据并产生见解，以减少需要及时登录平台并自己形成它们。”&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;Devona 告诉我，“我认为，当人工智能最初被带入圈子时，第一个想法是创造，但将其用作助理可能会带来更大的价值。”&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;从长远来看，整个营销团队将采用人工智能驱动的数据分析策略，以绕过当前混乱且低效的数据收集和分析流程。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;人工智能将从根本上改变入站营销……但基础将保持不变&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;毫无疑问，人工智能将逐步彻底改变入站营销的运作方式。&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;在接下来的几年中，我们将看到人工智能改变营销人员创建内容、分析数据以及与受众建立联系的方式。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正如 Christmann 所说，“人工智能将从根本上改变营销人员创建内容、分析数据以及与受众建立联系的方式。”转变入站营销。它将改变我们所做的一切。它会让我们以不同的方式思考我们认为理所当然的问题。工作会有所不同，这会让很多人感到不舒服，但它最终会成为工作的推动者和创造者。但游戏仍然是一样的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人工智能不会改变的一件事是入站营销背后的目的。入站营销的核心是通过有价值的内容与潜在客户建立联系。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;内容创作的方式、内容和地点将因人工智能而发生巨大变化。但“原因”将保持不变。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a class=&quot;cta_button&quot; href=&quot;https ://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=8bc62f56-f557-4bf5-b1b3-0798c565a2e1&amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;amp;hsic=&quot;>;&lt;img class=&quot;hs-cta -img &quot;

BBC 新闻。你可以想象新词通过口碑传播比今天通过互联网传播需要多长时间。&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;俚语如何在互联网上传播&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;语言学和人类学家几十年来一直在研究俚语的传播方式，但只有在公共社交媒体网络出现后才能进行精确测量。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;平台可帮助语言学家准确、轻松地搜索和记录语言交流。例如，雅各布·艾森斯坦和他在佐治亚理工学院的同事 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21628916.300-twitter-shows-language-evolves-in-cities.html&quot;>;检查了来自美国的 3000 万条推文&lt;/a>;，以查明流行俚语的起源及其传播。下图是显示术语迁移方式及其影响方向的结果图。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;img class=&quot;alignCenter Shadow&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px; ” src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-1758454053-jpg/slang-migration-in-US.jpg?width=650&amp;amp;name=slang-migration-in-US .jpg&quot; alt=&quot;美国的互联网俚语迁移&quot; width=&quot;650&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;俚语现在可以在几周和几个月内移动，而不是几年，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube .com/watch&quot;>;&lt;/a>;《俚语的一生》一书的作者朱莉娅·科尔曼说道。 “不一定是语言变化得更快，而是技术已经发展，它们使得俚语可以更快地从一个群体传播到另一个群体。”&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;互联网世界各地的俚语&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;互联网影响着世界各地语言的发展。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在乌克兰，Svitlana Pyrkalo &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/ news/technology-10971949&quot;>;说&lt;/a>;按 control+alt+delete 的强制退出过程称为 Дуля (dulya)。 dulya 是一种乌克兰手势，使用两个手指和一个拇指，与我们发出“手指”的情况相同。 “你需要三个手指来按下按钮，”皮尔卡洛说。 “所以这就像告诉某人（在本例中是一台计算机）迷路。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其他国家/地区也有自己版本的“LOL”。在法国，“mdr”代表“mort de rire”，意思是笑死。瑞典人将“asg”写为Asgarv的缩写，意思是强烈的笑声。数字 5 在泰国代表字母“h”，因此 555 是“哈哈哈”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得注意的是，许多流行的网络俚语都来自非裔美国人白话英语 (AAVE)，这是一种形式美国黑人所说的英语。通常，黑人在网上进行对话，其他人使用这些词，他们成为日常互联网谈话的一部分。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;考虑到所有这些，让我们回顾一下一些最流行的互联网俚语，其中许多其中包括缩写词和其他完整单词和短语。&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;互联网俚语&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;一般互联网俚语&lt;/h3>; &lt;h4>;1.

LMK&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;LMK 代表让我知道。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;22。 LOL&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;LOL 代表大声笑。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;23。低调&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;低调有多种含义。&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;当某人受到某事轻微或中等程度的困扰，但不是什么大问题时：&lt;/strong>;“我很低调，很难过我错过了演出，但总有下次。”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;当某些事情应该保密、谨慎，并且不要在对话之外分享时：&lt;/strong>;“低调, I might quit.”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;To describe a mellow or low-stakes situation:&lt;/strong>; “It was a lowkey party with my closest friends.”&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h4>;24.

Fiona McPherson, Senior Editor, Oxford English Dictionary, says five years is a good length to become eligible for a spot in the big book.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dictionary editors also look to &lt;em>;us &lt;/em>;when voting on whether a word should have a place in their dictionary. “Dictionaries are fantastic resources, but they are human and they are not timeless,” Language Historian Anne Curzan &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/talks/anne_curzan_what_makes_a_word_real?language=en#t-971512&quot;>;reminds us&lt;/a>;. “If you ask dictionary editors, what they&#39;ll tell you is they&#39;re just trying to keep up with us as we change the language. They&#39;re watching what we say and what we write and trying to figure out what&#39;s going to stick and what&#39;s not going to stick.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, no matter whether you think internet slang vitalizes or destroys language, there&#39;s no denying how revealing it is of the culture that invents and uses it -- and the ease with which we adapt our language to new technologies and concepts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a class=&quot;cta_button&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=648420ad-1760-40e2-994f-7833315a7b7d&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid=&amp;amp;hseid=&amp;amp;hsic=&quot;>;&lt;img class=&quot;hs-cta-img &quot; style=&quot;height: auto !important; width: auto !important; max-width: 100% !important;border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; &quot; alt=&quot; &quot; height=&quot;226&quot; width=&quot;646&quot; src=&quot;https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/648420ad-1760-40e2-994f-7833315a7b7d.png&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;amp;k=14&amp;amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-internet-changes-language&amp;amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;amp;bvt=rss&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; &quot;>;</content:encoded><category> Psychology</category><pubDate> Mon, 28 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><author> fneedle@hubspot.com (Flori Needle)</author><guid> https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-internet-changes-language</guid><dc:date> 2023-08-28T11:00:00Z</dc:date></item><item><title> The 23 Best Graphic Design Portfolios We&#39;ve Ever Seen, &amp; How to Start Your Own</title><link/> https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/graphic-design-portfolio<description> &lt;div class=&quot;hs-featured-image-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/graphic-design-portfolio&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;hs-featured-image-link&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/24_The%2014%20Best%20Graphic%20Design%20Portfolios%20Weve%20Ever%20Seen%2c%20%26%20How%20to%20Start%20Your%20Own.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;graphic design portfolio&quot; class=&quot;hs-featured-image&quot; style=&quot;width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;&quot;>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;A great graphic design portfolio can&#39;t move mountains, but it can change your life with a new job or opportunity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/10/26/will-the-demand-for-graphic-designers-diminish-in-the-near-future/&quot;>;AI&lt;/a>; and other factors are impacting graphic design hiring, making your portfolio more important than ever before.&lt;/p>;</description><content:encoded> &lt;p>;A great graphic design portfolio can&#39;t move mountains, but it can change your life with a new job or opportunity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/10/26/will-the-demand-for-graphic-designers-diminish-in-the-near-future/&quot;>;AI&lt;/a>; and other factors are impacting graphic design hiring, making your portfolio more important than ever before.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a class=&quot;cta_button&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5478fa12-4cc3-4140-ba96-bc103eeb873e&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid=&amp;amp;hseid=&amp;amp;hsic=&quot;>;&lt;img class=&quot;hs-cta-img &quot; style=&quot;height: auto !important; width: auto !important; max-width: 100% !important;border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px&quot; alt=&quot;Download Now: 150+ Content Creation Templates [Free Kit]&quot; height=&quot;81&quot; width=&quot;441&quot; src=&quot;https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5478fa12-4cc3-4140-ba96-bc103eeb873e.png&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While some designers still carry a physical book of printed design examples, most portfolios are graphic designer websites.

They also help graphic designers build communities and share their work with potential fans around the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what does a graphic design portfolio website need to include to stand out? Your portfolio is much more than proving you know how to use Photoshop. Many graphic designers will include logos, typography, print design, or web design in their portfolios.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And, some of the best graphic design portfolios today may also include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/visual-effects-vfx-vs-motion-graphics&quot;>;Motion graphics&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-marketing&quot;>;Video&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Original illustrations&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Animation&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/product-pages-love-list&quot;>;Product design&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/website/become-a-ux-designer&quot;>;UX design&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/advertising&quot;>;Ad campaigns&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Storyboards&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/develop-brand-identity&quot;>;Brand identity&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;p>;As you&#39;ll see below, the most powerful graphic designer portfolios balance personal vision with standout client samples.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s look at some graphic design portfolio website examples to inspire and motivate your portfolio development. You could be a traditional graphic designer or experimenting with new media. There&#39;s something here for everyone.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.behance.net/jessicawalsh&quot;>;Jessica Walsh&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/jessica-walsh-graphic-design-portfolio.webp?width=650&amp;amp;height=342&amp;amp;name=jessica-walsh-graphic-design-portfolio.webp&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;342&quot; alt=&quot;Graphic designer portfolio, Jessica Walsh&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The design industry is competitive. It takes eye-catching imagery and typographic finesse to create a portfolio that draws top clients like Apple, Benefit, and Levis.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This portfolio comes from a designer who&#39;s been named one of Ad Age&#39;s &quot;Top 10 Visual Creatives,&quot; among many other accolades. Currently a design professor, creative director, and head of creative agency &lt;a href=&quot;https://andwalsh.com/&quot;>;&amp;amp;Walsh&lt;/a>;, this designer&#39;s portfolio on Behance makes great design the focus.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Why we love this graphic designer&#39;s website&lt;/strong>;: Walsh&#39;s approach to type is bright, graphic, and complex. Her style also favors lush colorful photography and illustrations. This could get overwhelming, but this graphic designer is an expert with negative space, using careful visual composition to draw the eye and make a statement.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.moragmyerscough.com/&quot;>;Morag Myerscough&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/graphic-design-portfolio-myerscough.jpg?width=650&amp;amp;name=graphic-design-portfolio-myerscough.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Graphic design portfolio example: Morag Myerscough&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bright graphics, animations, and clean design make this an exceptional graphic design portfolio. This approach is great for designers who lean into the art of design. It also works for designers who take on more experimental or site-specific projects.&lt;/p>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 650px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-content-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.5%; margin: 0px;&quot;>; &lt;iframe width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;113&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lY4JTWTYLtQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Why we chose this graphic design portfolio: &lt;/strong>;Myerscough&#39;s aesthetic is unique and this image-focused site quickly communicates her style.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Short sections of copy connect her visual brand to her background, professional experience, and personal philosophy. The combination makes the site feel like it shows the whole designer, not just a visualization of the work she does for clients.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3.&lt;a href=&quot;http://heathershaw.com/&quot;>; Heather Shaw&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/graphicdesign_4.webp?width=650&amp;amp;height=348&amp;amp;name=graphicdesign_4.webp&quot; alt=&quot;graphicdesign_4&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;This graphic design portfolio website includes samples of book and website designs, branding, and more. It&#39;s good for designers who work in many different media but want to present a cohesive portfolio.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Why we chose this graphic design portfolio:&lt;/strong>; Heather Shaw&#39;s portfolio is super clear and easy to navigate. It shows a wide range of skills and approaches to solving client problems, but it&#39;s also visually consistent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The designer also uses text effectively to explain each project and to encourage further engagement with the work.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mikemillsmikemills.com/&quot;>;Mike Mills&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mike-mills-graphic-designer-portfolio.webp?width=650&amp;amp;height=377&amp;amp;name=mike-mills-graphic-designer-portfolio.webp&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;377&quot; alt=&quot;Graphic designer portfolio, Mike Mills&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mike Mills is a talented designer, artist, and filmmaker, known for his punk aesthetic and original style. His portfolio is a reflection of his diverse interests and skills. The website offers a quick lesson in clean design, with easy-to-understand headers, professional photography, and crisp layout.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Why this is a great example of a graphic design portfolio website&lt;/strong>;: When you&#39;re a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design-tips-beginners&quot;>;design beginner&lt;/a>;, creating your first graphic design portfolio, you quickly learn the importance of editing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, a logo for your first-year graphic design class might have been your best work then. It shows that you know how to use Illustrator or &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/adobe-free-alternatives&quot;>;other design software alternatives&lt;/a>;. But five years later, you have to ask — does that logo belong in a professional portfolio?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As your body of graphic design work grows, you&#39;ll find yourself making tough decisions about what to include, and just as important, what to leave out of your portfolio.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This portfolio example stands out because Mills has found a way to include samples of design that span from the 90s to today. This could easily feel disjointed or overwhelming. Instead, it&#39;s a beautiful and cohesive portfolio with exceptional attention to detail.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.behance.net/Amado&quot;>;Mohamed Samir&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/graphic-design-portfolio-samir.jpg?width=650&amp;amp;name=graphic-design-portfolio-samir.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Graphic design portfolio example: Mohamed Samir&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Samir&#39;s work includes branding, typography, posters, and print design. So, this graphic design portfolio zeros in on a tight collection of award-winning designs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This graphic design portfolio is on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.behance.net/&quot;>;Behance&lt;/a>;. This makes it a good fit for graphic designers who want an online presence without designing their own website.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Why we love this graphic designer&#39;s website:&lt;/strong>; Besides the high quality of the design work, this portfolio shows a diverse range of approaches to typography and style. At the same time, it shows a consistent vision and passion for visual communication.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The printed design work is also well-photographed. While the designer could have added a digital file instead, the photographs give you a better sense of the final polished design.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;6. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gailycurl.com/&quot;>;Gail Anderson&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/gail-anderson-graphic-design-portfolio.webp?width=650&amp;amp;height=398&amp;amp;name=gail-anderson-graphic-design-portfolio.webp&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;398&quot; alt=&quot;Graphic designer portfolio, Gail Anderson&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Image quality matters. And if your portfolio pieces include a lot of detail, you may get stumped with your online portfolio design. This graphic design portfolio website has a simple left-hand navigation. So, with each click, you have a chance to see detailed posters, book covers, and more at a scale that shows how they look for print while also being easy to scroll on a mobile phone.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Why we chose this graphic design portfolio&lt;/strong>;: Anderson&#39;s work is smart and timeless. Each piece shows her dedication to the depth and value of design thinking, technical skill, and passion for design.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;7. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/glebich&quot;>;Gleb Kuznetsov&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/The%2012%20Best%20Graphic%20Design%20Portfolios%20Weve%20Ever%20Seen,%20%26%20How%20to%20Start%20Your%20Own-7.png?width=650&amp;amp;height=288&amp;amp;name=The%2012%20Best%20Graphic%20Design%20Portfolios%20Weve%20Ever%20Seen,%20%26%20How%20to%20Start%20Your%20Own-7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graphic design portfolio example: Gleb Kuznetsov&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;288&quot;>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Kuznetsov&#39;s portfolio combines product design, user experience, and graphic design to create something entirely new. This Dribble-hosted portfolio has over 50 images, which could be overwhelming. But they&#39;re split into seven easy-to-understand projects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This makes it a great graphic design portfolio example for designers who want to show long-term or complex projects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Why this is a great example of a graphic design portfolio website:&lt;/strong>; From the images to his brief &quot;About&quot; statement, this designer makes his unique vision and personality part of the work and its presentation.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;8. &lt;a href=&quot;https://sagmeister.com/&quot;>;Stefan Sagmeister&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;h3>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sagmeister-graphic-designer-portfolio.webp?width=650&amp;amp;height=386&amp;amp;name=sagmeister-graphic-designer-portfolio.webp&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;386&quot; alt=&quot;Graphic designer portfolio, Stefan Sagmeister&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Sagmeister is a legend in the design world, and his website reflects the curiosity and power of the designer. The home page features a grid of images with text that appears as you scroll over each image. With a click, you&#39;re presented with images and/or videos that show the details of each project.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The site is a mix of collaborations, art projects, and more traditional design, like the corporate identity for the Jewish museum.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Why this is one of the best graphic design portfolio websites we&#39;ve ever seen&lt;/strong>;: This portfolio site doesn&#39;t just show the quality and technical ability of the designer. It also gives any client working with Sagmeister a sense of what the design process might be like.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Quick note&lt;/strong>;: The &quot;answers&quot; section of the site is full of useful advice no matter where you are in your designer journey.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;9.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.christammar.com/&quot;>; &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lottanieminen.com/&quot;>;Lotte Niemenen&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/lotte-niemenen-graphic-designer-portfolio.webp?width=650&amp;amp;height=391&amp;amp;name=lotte-niemenen-graphic-designer-portfolio.webp&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;391&quot; alt=&quot;Graphic designer portfolio, Lotte Niemenen&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Great designers often let the work do the talking. That&#39;s certainly true here, with a streamlined graphic design portfolio that calls attention to client deliverables. When text is present, it adds to the value of the work, like sharing what parts of the design process their team completed. This is a great portfolio format for designers doing graphic design work like:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Logo design&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Branding&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Packaging&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Product design&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Why we chose this graphic design portfolio:&lt;/strong>; This group of work is simple and to the point. It also shows off a wide range of skills and tactics with a consistent vision. Be sure to take a closer look at the website navigation — it&#39;s clean and exciting while adding to the functionality of the site.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;10. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.velvetspectrum.com/&quot;>;Luke Choice (Velvet Spectrum)&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/velvet-spectrum-graphic-designer-portfolio.webp?width=650&amp;amp;height=398&amp;amp;name=velvet-spectrum-graphic-designer-portfolio.webp&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;398&quot; alt=&quot;Graphic designer portfolio, Luke Choice (Velvet Spectrum)&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;3D animation is an exciting design form that&#39;s growing in popularity. But if you&#39;re a client who&#39;s not in the market for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/billboard-advertising&quot;>;animated billboard&lt;/a>;, it may be difficult to figure out how you might use this creative form for your business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This site is a great example of a portfolio that educates with simple text, graphics, and video. It gives both a quick look and a deep dive into how this designer approaches his art form.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Why we chose this graphic design portfolio&lt;/strong>;: If you&#39;re doing something interesting and new, it may be a selling point. But truly new ideas can also challenge or frustrate people who don&#39;t feel &quot;in the know.&quot; This means that your portfolio can&#39;t just sell your designs. It also needs to teach viewers about the new format you&#39;re using and why you think it&#39;s important.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;11. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yeshidesigns.com/work&quot;>;Sophia Yeshi&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/graphic-design-portfolio-yeshi.jpg?width=650&amp;amp;name=graphic-design-portfolio-yeshi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Graphic design portfolio example: Sophia Yeshi&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A clear header and tile design emphasize work samples from this powerful graphic designer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While the tiles emphasize the designer&#39;s unique style, you can click on each tile to get the full details about each project. This is a great approach for designers who want to share the deeper story behind each project while still making the site easy to navigate.&lt;/p>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 650px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-content-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.5%; margin: 0px;&quot;>; &lt;iframe width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;113&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/drDKDWeT_2s&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Why we love this graphic designer&#39;s website:&lt;/strong>; A distinct style is important in graphic design. That said, it can be tough to show how many ways you can apply that distinct style in a business context. Major brands, including Google, Nike, and Comcast, use Yeshi&#39;s unique illustrative voice to speak for their brands.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This website portfolio makes that point clear, while still making graphic design the focus.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;12. &lt;a href=&quot;https://undersight.co/&quot;>;Eduardo Nunes&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/eduardo-nunes-graphic-design-portfolio.webp?width=650&amp;amp;height=364&amp;amp;name=eduardo-nunes-graphic-design-portfolio.webp&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;364&quot; alt=&quot;Graphic designer portfolio, Eduardo Nunes&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Designers often have a muse — someone or something that inspires and motivates them when the designing gets tough. Sometimes that inspiration can serve as a starting point for your portfolio design, as it did for this design portfolio example.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The landing page starts with a quote from Ansel Adams, &quot;There is nothing worse than a sharp image of a fuzzy concept.&quot; Then, using clean motion graphics and fresh design, Nunes points to a central theme, a philosophy that guides his design approach. This leads every site visitor on a journey through his portfolio.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Why we chose this graphic design portfolio&lt;/strong>;: This portfolio shows intense work, focus, practice, and care. It&#39;s an excellent model for anyone who wants to show the world what they&#39;re creating and why.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;13. &lt;a href=&quot;http://stefaniebrueckler.com/#projects&quot;>;Stefanie Brüeckler&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/stefanie-bruckler.webp?width=650&amp;amp;height=353&amp;amp;name=stefanie-bruckler.webp&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;353&quot; alt=&quot;Graphic design portfolio, Stefanie Bruckler&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;This portfolio includes packaging design, illustration, and web design as well as graphic design and branding work. It&#39;s one of our favorite graphic designer websites because it&#39;s clean and easy to navigate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It also shows a lot of different examples of work at a glance. This makes it a great example for designers who aren&#39;t sure how to organize all the work they want to include in their portfolio.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Why we love this graphic designer website example:&lt;/strong>; Brückler&#39;s graphic design portfolio focuses on the tiniest of details to create an excellent user experience. From the simple page-loading animation to the thoughtful use of motion graphics, this designer hones in on the stunning details.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;14. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chipkidd.com/home/portfolio/&quot;>;Chip Kidd&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/The%2012%20Best%20Graphic%20Design%20Portfolios%20Weve%20Ever%20Seen,%20%26%20How%20to%20Start%20Your%20Own-6.png?width=650&amp;amp;height=305&amp;amp;name=The%2012%20Best%20Graphic%20Design%20Portfolios%20Weve%20Ever%20Seen,%20%26%20How%20to%20Start%20Your%20Own-6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graphic design portfolio example: Chip Kidd&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;305&quot;>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Book cover designer Chip Kidd&#39;s graphic design portfolio website uses lightbox-style pop-ups. Popups make it easier to focus on each book cover. This is a smart way to narrow in on the visuals with a graphic design site while still making it easy to see all the work in one place.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kidd uses a range of different styles for book covers, and it&#39;s edited in a way that makes this range look natural and exciting instead of chaotic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Why this is a great example of a graphic design portfolio website:&lt;/strong>; The dark background makes this graphic designer&#39;s style pop. And the simple side navigation gives users a quick path to learn more about the designer and his work.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;15. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pavlovvisuals.com/&quot;>;Ryan Dean Sprague (Pavlov)&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pavlov-graphic-designer-portfolio.webp?width=650&amp;amp;height=322&amp;amp;name=pavlov-graphic-designer-portfolio.webp&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;322&quot; alt=&quot;Graphic designer portfolio, Ryan Dean Sprague (Pavlov)&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This Texas designer&#39;s style is heavily influenced by music.

Curate your best work, and show a wide breadth of skill.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsay-burke-287b1445&quot;>;Lindsay Burke&lt;/a>;, a HubSpot Product Designer, emphasizes the importance of quality over quantity when it comes to curating a graphic design portfolio. She says, &quot;I recommend selecting your strongest projects and making these the primary focus of your portfolio website.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ideally, your portfolio will feature your sharpest, most impressive 10-20 designs — undoubtedly, someone pursuing your portfolio won&#39;t have the time to look at more, and if your first couple projects are impressive enough, they shouldn&#39;t need to.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it&#39;s equally critical you show potential clients your versatility. If you&#39;ve dabbled in logo design as well as video animation, it&#39;s good to include both kinds of projects in your portfolio.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Choose the right platform to showcase your work.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Investing in a quality website with a custom domain URL will pay off in the long run by demonstrating your professionalism to potential clients.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having your own website helps you organize your portfolio to suit all your business needs — for instance, perhaps you&#39;ll include &#39;Projects&#39;, &#39;About Me&#39;, and &#39;Contact Me&#39; sections, so visitors can peruse your content and then contact you without ever leaving the site.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take a look at this list of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-website-builders&quot;>;best website builders&lt;/a>; if you need help choosing a platform for your portfolio.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Include a professional case study or client recommendations.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Lindsay Burke told me it&#39;s incredibly valuable to write out a case study to complement any website visuals — &quot;Through a written case study, your site visitors can get a sense of your project&#39;s background, the problem you were aiming to solve through design, and the process you took to arrive at a final deliverable. A lot of time, effort, and iteration goes into design solutions, and a written case study will help communicate your unique process.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To cultivate a strong case study, consider including the background of the project, the problem, the process, your deliverable, and any next steps.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the process section of your case study, Burke suggests including research, experience mapping, persona development, wire-framing, sketching, usability testing, and iteration.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plus it will impress future clients if you can include recommendations from prior employers, which allows you to display a level of professionalism.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Integrate your personality.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As you can see in the examples above, each portfolio is drastically different depending on the artist&#39;s unique style. Someone checking out Tobias van Schneider&#39;s portfolio will expect something vastly different from someone looking at Ling K&#39;s site. Make sure your portfolio — including layout, background, and website title — reflects who &lt;em>;you &lt;/em>;are as a designer.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Describe the creative process.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Each designer has a unique process when working with clients — and the sooner a potential client can learn about your process, the better. It&#39;s important you include context, so visitors can get a sense of how you handle challenges, and how your designs solve real-world problems.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plus, including a description of your creative process can help a potential client figure out whether you&#39;re capable of handling the scope of their project.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, they might be unsure of your ability to handle graphic designs for mobile until they read how you single-handedly brainstormed and created the designs for another client&#39;s mobile site. In this case, context is critical.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;6. Show non-client work, or side projects.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/achong1&quot;>;Amanda Chong&lt;/a>;, a former HubSpot Designer, says, &quot;Side projects are a great way to demonstrate your will to take initiative and your ability to balance multiple things at once. They&#39;re also a great way to show some of the more experimental, creative ideas that you might not be able to show through your day-to-day work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re just starting out, it&#39;s acceptable to include side projects or non-client work so potential customers can get a sense of your ability and style.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider incorporating school work, a logo you designed for your aunt&#39;s company, or an internal design you created for your current company — ideally, your designs will negate any concerns potential clients have over your lack of career experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Help a local business or start-up with its design and brand.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;One of the easiest ways to begin building your client base is by contacting nonprofits or local businesses in your area. Think about creating mock-ups or sketches in advance, These can help you give businesses a sense of your skill and vision.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps you think a local restaurant needs a new menu logo, or want to help a gift shop with their online marketing materials.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Projects like these will help you better understand &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/local-marketing&quot;>;local marketing&lt;/a>; challenges, and give you time to develop your skills in those areas. You never know what a pro-bono project could lead to next.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Create content for your own personal brand.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As you build personal brand content, take the time to make sure your marketing materials are cohesive and sleek.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Design a unique logo for your brand. Next, start building your website, and add that same design across various materials, including your business card and resume. This is also a great time to start a branded social media account, and to create posts that show off your design skills and interests.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Clients are more likely to work with you if they can see the type of high-quality work you&#39;re able to create for yourself.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Redesign an existing website.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Don&#39;t wait for your dream client to give you a call. Instead, create a complete website redesign for a well-known brand to prove your skills to future clients.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a well-known strategy already used by plenty of designers — just take a look at some of the impressive Behance mock-ups for brands like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.behance.net/gallery/174770851/Ryanair-App-Redesign-Concept&quot;>;RyanAir&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Additionally, Amanda Chong told me, &quot;If you&#39;re creating mockups for established brands to use as part of your portfolio, it&#39;s important to pair this with a case study or description of the process that helped you arrive at your proposed design. Talk about what you think wasn&#39;t working with the existing design, some of the constraints that you think the designers were working with, and why you made the decisions that you did.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chong added, &quot;Mockups are great at showing your visual design skills, but don&#39;t necessarily demonstrate your ability to work in a real-world context, so you&#39;ll want to take the time to explain how you would have approached it in a true business setting.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Create graphic design materials for a made-up company.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If your designs are impressive enough, potential clients won&#39;t care that you created them for a fictitious company. In fact, you could impress them with your innovation and creativity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider showing your skills by putting together a creative brief for a fake company, complete with wireframes and sketches. &lt;a href=&quot;https://sharpen.design/&quot;>;Other projects&lt;/a>; you can create for imaginary companies include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Branding&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Style guides&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Posters&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Billboards&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Social media ads&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Apparel graphics&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Wrapping paper&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Brochures and email newsletters&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Simple GIFs&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Animated infographics&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Trade show booths&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Branded wall art&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Pitch decks&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Book covers&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Packaging&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;In due time, real companies will take notice.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Design a logo for a brand you love.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Stick to the type of content you enjoy designing. If you&#39;re particularly adept at making logos, and are often inspired by the logos used by real brands, consider designing an alternative logo for a brand you like.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then take a look at these inspiring &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/stories/2020/01/31/nfl-team-logos-reimagined&quot;>;reimagined NFL logos&lt;/a>;. While these NFL teams probably won&#39;t make a shift, they&#39;re great examples of the designers&#39; skills and creativity.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;6. Create a stock theme for WordPress.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;WordPress, a popular content management system, allows users to develop stock themes for WP. Best of all, if your theme is approved, you can sell it as a premium theme for extra cash.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Begin by studying WordPress&#39;s most popular themes, and considering how you can create an impressive alternative. Take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/&quot;>;WordPress&#39;s Theme Review Requirements&lt;/a>; and this overview of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/website/wordpress-create-child-theme&quot;>;how to create a child theme&lt;/a>; to learn more.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;7. Take part in a design challenge.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;To get inspired, practice your skills, or interact with other designers in a community and build your portfolio at the same time, think about participating in a design challenge.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Design challenges can also help you uncover skills you didn&#39;t know you had by forcing you to step outside your design comfort zone.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are various daily, weekly, or monthly challenges that will send you prompts on things to design — for instance, try checking out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyui.co/&quot;>;Daily UI Design Challenge&lt;/a>; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailylogochallenge.com/&quot;>;The Daily Logo Challenge&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You&#39;ve done the work, and now you&#39;re pulling together your graphic design portfolio. Try these tips to make your graphic design portfolio stand out.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Show your versatility.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A portfolio should show a range of different works, so you want to highlight what you can do. Some clients prefer a more streamlined look, while others are looking for more experimentation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you have clients from different industries, include some work from each industry. Then, edit your portfolio based on the kind of client you&#39;re showing your portfolio to.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, if you&#39;re meeting with a client in real estate, show work samples from similar industries.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You&#39;ll also want to show anyone who sees your portfolio what you can do. So, if you create design logos, books, and motion graphics, include a little bit of everything in your portfolio.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Display your best work.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;That said, try to limit your portfolio to your best work. Don&#39;t include a piece in your portfolio just to show that you can do it. The way that you edit your portfolio shows that you understand your strengths and know how to play them up. So, edit your portfolio to include only your best work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re great with one skill set but not as good with another, edit your portfolio to spotlight that skill. If possible, create portfolio pieces that show many skill sets at the same time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, if you love hand lettering, a poster could emphasize your graphic design skills alongside this unique ability.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Include case studies.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Every client is unique, and each will teach you something new. As you continue to work with different clients, build up a collection of these stories.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Try not to throw anything away without documenting it. That page of thumbnails might not be much to look at on its own, but this kind of work in progress is a great way to show prospective clients how you solve problems.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you present case studies in your portfolio, start with the initial problem your client approached you with. Next, show what the conversation and ideation process looked like over time. As you pull your case study together, don&#39;t forget to include the final solution you delivered.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Make it clean and easy to navigate.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Design is about more than visual skills, it&#39;s about communicating. So the format of your portfolio, whether it&#39;s printed or online, should be clear and simple to scan.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This point is especially important for graphic designer websites. It can be tempting to build a website that shows off the latest trends or to add Easter eggs that people need to hunt for. There&#39;s a fine line between art and design, and those approaches can be super inspiring.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But building a complex site can also mean that clients in a hurry could miss some of your best work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, a graphic designer once sent his portfolio to a creative director friend of mine. They liked the designer&#39;s drawing but didn&#39;t see much of the graphic design or web work that he talked about in his resume. With a little digging, they found a URL in one of the sketchbook drawings, and that URL led to his website.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This hide-and-seek process was cool, but it wasn&#39;t clear or easy to navigate. This scenario could have been a missed opportunity for that designer.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5.

From there, you can decide if that population size is worth the cost of manufacturing, production, distribution, and more for your product.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Market sizing helps you estimate profit and potential for growth.&lt;/strong>; If you know how many people your business has the potential to reach, you can estimate how much revenue you can generate. This is valuable for both business owners as well as investors.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Market size defines who you&#39;re marketing to and what their needs are.&lt;/strong>; No business can succeed without marketing. Knowing your market size is the first step in understanding your target market and their needs.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Market sizing helps your business make better decisions.&lt;/strong>; Understanding your market landscape, gaps, and opportunities will inform your decision-making. It can also help you set more realistic goals, assign resources, and refine your strategies.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Market sizing helps your business minimize risk.&lt;/strong>; Starting or expanding a business is inherently risky. Understanding your market can help you anticipate and prepare for challenges.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;Market Size vs. Market Value&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Market size is the total potential demand for a product or service. This number usually calculates the number of potential customers, units sold, or revenue generated. So, market size is an estimate of the overall market reach.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Market value refers to the financial worth or estimated market capitalization of a company or industry. It&#39;s a measure of perceived value. It can give you an idea of how much a company could sell for in a given market.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In summary, market size focuses on the potential market opportunity, while market value is the financial value of an individual company or an entire market.&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;Market Sizing Terms to Know&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Before diving into how to figure out your market size, there are a few helpful terms you should get to know.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;TAM&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;TAM stands for Total Addressable Market. This number is the maximum potential revenue or customer base that a company could achieve if it were to capture 100% of market share.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;SAM&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;SAM stands for Serviceable Addressable Market. SAM is a part of the TAM that aligns with the company&#39;s resources, capabilities, and target customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;SOM&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;SOM stands for Serviceable Obtainable Market. SOM is the part of the SAM that a company can get at its current scale. This figure may consider marketing and sales strategies, competitive positioning, and product demand.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/market-sizing-terms-tam-sam-som.webp?width=650&amp;amp;height=365&amp;amp;name=market-sizing-terms-tam-sam-som.webp&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;365&quot; alt=&quot;Market sizing terms, TAM, SAM, SOM&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Check out this post to learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tam-sam-som&quot;>;TAM, SAM, and SOM&lt;/a>; and how to calculate them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Target Market&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/target-market&quot;>;target market&lt;/a>; is a specific group of customers, industries, or segments that a company focuses on. It&#39;s the customer segment that&#39;s most likely to show interest, purchase, and appreciate a company&#39;s products or services.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Penetration Rate&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Penetration rate refers to the percentage of a target market that a company has successfully captured. It shows the level of market share reached by a company in a specific market segment or overall market.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-penetration&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/market-sizing-definitions-marketing-penetration.webp?width=650&amp;amp;height=61&amp;amp;name=market-sizing-definitions-marketing-penetration.webp&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;61&quot; alt=&quot;Market sizing terms, Penetration rate&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re a new business, you can calculate penetration rate by dividing your total customers by the number of potential customers in the target market.

Usually, the people in these segments have common characteristics, needs, or behaviors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Segmenting the market can help you better understand your target customers. It can also help you tailor business strategies, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/segmentation-targeting-positioning&quot;>;marketing&lt;/a>;, to meet specific segment needs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Value Proposition&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A value proposition is the unique benefits that a company offers to its target customers. It differentiates a company&#39;s product or service from competitors and creates value for customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Understanding the value proposition is crucial in market sizing.

Start with your total addressable market.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;You can calculate your TAM by multiplying the total customers in a market by the annual value per customer. But before calculating, make sure you take a look at the tips below:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Define your product or service.&lt;/strong>; While developing a product can be quick, growing a business around a product is more complex. It&#39;s important to clearly understand your product or service and how it solves a problem or meets a need in the market.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Find your market category.&lt;/strong>; Some products fall within more than one industry or market category. This is the first step that will narrow your TAM. So, think carefully about what you expect customers to compare your offer to.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Conduct market research.&lt;/strong>; Gather relevant data and information about your potential users. If you&#39;re new to market research, check out this free &lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/market-research-kit&quot;>;market research kit&lt;/a>;, with research and planning templates.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Analyze the competition.&lt;/strong>; Conduct &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitive-analysis-kit&quot;>;competitive analysis&lt;/a>; to figure out the market share and unique value of your top competitors.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Define your total addressable market.&lt;/strong>; With the research and analysis you&#39;ve pulled together, create a realistic TAM estimate.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;2. Find a group of customers to focus on within that target market.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Dig into the tips below to quantify the top customers in your market:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Create your ideal buyer persona.&lt;/strong>; Use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona&quot;>;Make My Persona tool&lt;/a>; to outline the characteristics, demographics, and behaviors of your ideal customers.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Segment your target market.&lt;/strong>; Start dividing your target market into distinct segments. You might base segments on factors like age, location, interests, or buying behavior.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Continue market research.&lt;/strong>; Continue collecting data and insights about each segment. This will help you understand how big each segment is, as well as their needs, preferences, pain points, and purchasing habits. Your &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-buyers-journey-guide&quot;>;ongoing market research&lt;/a>; might include surveys, interviews, focus groups, or analyzing existing market research.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Set pricing for your product or service.&lt;/strong>; For some products, pricing is a deciding purchase factor. So, if you haven&#39;t already, set pricing or a price range for your products.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Assess segments of your market and prioritize&lt;/strong>;. Think about each segment&#39;s size, growth potential, and competition. It&#39;s also a good idea to think about how each segment aligns with your company&#39;s capabilities and resources. In short, don&#39;t just focus on segments that offer the most attractive opportunities. Make sure they align with your strengths and needs.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Refine your buyer personas.&lt;/strong>; With your prioritized segments, take another look at your ideal customer profile. This will give you a more useful buyer persona for your marketing and sales strategies.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Confirm your SAM with market testing.&lt;/strong>; Test your target segments with a product or service pilot group, measuring their responses and feedback.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;3. Figure out how many of those customers are likely to buy your product.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;This step will narrow your scope more intensely on the customers who need exactly what you have to offer. These are the people who are looking for you or a clear alternative to your competitors. To quantify this group:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Create a customer journey map.&lt;/strong>; From awareness to purchase, this process can help you map out the ideal customer path. From how you expect customers to discover your products to the blockers that might keep them from clicking buy, this step is useful for market sizing and beyond. Use these &lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/customer-journey-map-template&quot;>;customer journey templates&lt;/a>; if you&#39;re new to this process.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Estimate conversion rates.&lt;/strong>; Use historical data, industry benchmarks, or industry research to estimate conversion rates. This can help you quantify expected numbers of leads, prospects, and customers in each segment.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Figure out buyer intent.&lt;/strong>; Create a ranking or score for each segment to measure their likelihood of purchasing your product. This can help you prioritize segments with the highest conversion potential.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Create a SOM estimate with your data.&lt;/strong>; The research above will add credibility to your market size estimate. It can also help guide your growth strategies.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;4. Multiply that customer number by estimated penetration rate.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;To calculate penetration rate, divide the SOM you calculated above by your TAM, then multiply by 100.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once you have a calculation for your market size, you&#39;ll want to make sure you can trust that number. Keep your market sizing current with these tips:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Confirm your data is accurate and reliable.&lt;/strong>; As you complete your research, use reliable sources such as industry reports, market studies, or government databases. Also, check to ensure the data you&#39;re referencing is up to date.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Keep up with market growth, seasonality, industry trends, tech advancements, regulatory changes, and economic conditions.&lt;/strong>; These factors can affect both market size and customer demand.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Review and update your market size estimates regularly.&lt;/strong>; Market conditions change over time. Plan regular reviews of your market size, then update your calculations with new or relevant data.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;Market Sizing Methods&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;There are two simple methods for market sizing your business. These straightforward processes can help you use data to gauge market size.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Top Down Approach&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The first is a top-down approach, in which you start by looking at the market as a whole, then refine it to get an accurate market size. That would look like starting from your total addressable market and filtering from there.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;how to calculate market size using a top down approach&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Simple%20%26%20Straightforward%20Methods%20for%20Market%20Sizing%20Your%20Business.png?width=650&amp;amp;height=433&amp;amp;name=The%20Simple%20%26%20Straightforward%20Methods%20for%20Market%20Sizing%20Your%20Business.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;433&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Market Sizing Example&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s say you want to launch a wine company. First, you&#39;d want to figure out how many liquor stores are in the United States — this helps you figure out the total market to which you &lt;em>;could &lt;/em>;theoretically sell your product.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After your research, you discover there are 50,000 liquor stores in the United States. Of that total list, you only want to sell to the New England area — including Massachusetts, Maine, and Rhode Island.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You decide your target market includes the 1,000 liquor stores in the New England area. From here, you conduct research and speak with alcohol distributors to find there&#39;s a roughly 40% success rate for wine distribution.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using this as an example, we&#39;d calculate the market size using the following formula:&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;1,000 liquor stores x 40% = 400 liquor stores&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, if you assume each liquor store will result in $20,000, you can figure out potential revenue using the following formula:&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;400 liquor stores x $20,000 = $8,000,000&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means you stand to make $8 million if you penetrate 40% of the total market in the New England area.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Bottom-Up Approach&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A bottom-up approach is the exact opposite – starting small and working your way outward.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This looks like first identifying the number of units you can expect to sell then considering how many sales you anticipate from each buyer and finally the average price per unit.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Market Sizing Example&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Using the same wine example – Say you found recent data showing that the average cost of a wine bottle in New England is $10. A survey shows that the average consumer buys one bottle of wine a week, or 48 bottles a year. This means that the average consumer spends $480 per year on wine.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Next, you discover that the number of consumers (or households) you can expect to reach in the New England area is 16,000.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, your market size is&lt;strong>; 480 x 16,000 = $8,000,000.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s important to note that both methods ignore the existence of competitors, customer churn rate, and other factors that impact sales. With this in mind, you&#39;ll want to stay conservative when estimating how much of the market size you&#39;ll win and use this as a starting point.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;How to Leverage Your Market Size&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;You&#39;ve your estimated market size — now what?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Market size helps your business answer the following questions:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;How much potential revenue can we earn from this particular market? In other words, is it even worth our time and energy?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Is the market big enough to interest us?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Is the market growing? Will there &lt;em>;still&lt;/em>; be opportunities to earn revenue from this market in 3, 5, 10 years?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Market size is a critical number to know when you&#39;re looking for funding. Investors are going to need to know how much money they have the potential to make from a given market. Additionally, it&#39;s vital to recognize whether the potential revenue you can make outweighs your business&#39; costs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once you have market size, you&#39;ll also want to consider how saturated the market already is with your competitors&#39; products.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ultimately, you can&#39;t capture the total addressable market (TAM) — some of those people will choose competitors&#39; products over yours.

At the time, however, it wasn&#39;t considered a blog … just a personal homepage.&lt;/p>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-content-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IIpZUfM6gwI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;In 1997, Jorn Barger, blogger for Robot Wisdom, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorn_Barger&quot;>;coined the term “weblog”&lt;/a>;, which was meant to describe his process for “logging the web” as he surfed the internet. The term “weblog” was shortened to “blog” in 1999, by programmer Peter Merholz.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early stages, a blog was a personal web log or journal in which someone could share information or their opinion on a variety of topics. The information was posted reverse chronologically, so the most recent post would appear first.&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, a blog is a regularly updated website or web page, and can either be used for personal use or to fulfill a business need.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;For instance, HubSpot blogs about various topics concerning marketing, sales, and service because HubSpot &lt;em>;sells&lt;/em>; products related to those three subjects — so, more than likely, the type of readers HubSpot&#39;s blog attracts are going to be similar to HubSpot&#39;s core &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research&quot;>;buyer persona&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alternatively, a woman named Kiki started a personal travel blog, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://theblondeabroad.com/&quot;>;The Blonde Abroad&lt;/a>;, to document her travel experiences and provide readers with helpful tips and travel recommendations. Her blog doesn&#39;t serve a larger company, but it does help her create a personal brand.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If a personal blog is successful enough, the writer can also make money off of it via sponsorships or advertisements. Take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-monetize-a-blog&quot;>;5 Strategies to Monetize a Blog&lt;/a>; to learn more.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;What is a blog post?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A blog post is an individual web page on your website that dives into a particular sub-topic of your blog.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, let&#39;s say you start a fashion blog on your retail website. One blog post might be titled, “The Best Fall Shoes for 2023”. The post ties back to your overall &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/blog-topic-generator&quot;>;blog topic&lt;/a>; as a whole (fashion), but it also addresses a very particular sub-topic (fall shoes).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Blog posts allow you to rank on search engines for a variety of keywords. In the above example, your blog post could enable your business to rank on Google for “fall shoes”. When someone searches for fall shoes and comes across your blog post, they have access to the rest of your company&#39;s website. They might click “Products” after they read your post, and take a look at the clothing items your company sells.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A blog post links back to your overall blog site. For instance, right now, you&#39;re on blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-a-blog. The “what-is-a-blog” section of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/parts-url#:~:text=A%20URL%20consists%20of%20ten,at%20least%20three%20of%20them.&quot;>;the URL&lt;/a>; is tied back to /marketing/, which is the blog as a whole.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Blog vs. Website&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A blog is typically a section of your business&#39;s website — but, unlike the rest of your website, you need to update the blog section frequently by adding new posts. Additionally, your blog is a tool that allows you to engage more with an audience, either by analyzing how many readers share your blog posts on social, or by allowing readers to comment on your individual posts. In this way, a blog is more like a two-way conversation than the rest of your website. However, a blog can also be an entire website, and often is, if the blog is for personal use alone — for instance, a travel blog.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are plenty of benefits to blogging — it helps drive traffic to your website, it enables you to better convert that traffic into leads, it allows your business to establish authority in an industry, and it continues to help your business grow and attract new customers months and even years after publication.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To learn more about the benefits of blogging, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/the-benefits-of-business-blogging-ht&quot;>;Why Blog? The Benefits of Blogging for Business and Marketing&lt;/a>;.

On the other hand, there is typically only one person, or a team of people, with admin permissions to edit, share, or publish to a blog. Website visitors who come across the blog can potentially leave comments at the bottom of the blog post, but they cannot publish to the site or edit the posted material.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. To help your company rank on search engines.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Typically, a business will use a blog to help the business&#39;s website rank on search engines. You can absolutely employ SEO tactics, or use paid ads, to help your company homepage rank on page one of Google — but a more effective, long-term solution is blogging.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To consider how your company can rank on search engines via a blog, we&#39;ll start with an example — let&#39;s say you work for a web design start-up with very little online presence.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You decide to spend the first year writing and posting regular blog content that strongly relates to web design. Over time, your traffic increases and other companies link to your site for information regarding web design. When this happens, Google recognizes your company as a &lt;em>;legitimate&lt;/em>; source for web design information. Eventually (with a lot of trial and error), your blog posts begin ranking on page one of Google for terms like “web design”, “website builder”, and “e-commerce website”.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, one day, you search “web design companies in X city” and find your company is now on page one. This is likely due, in large part, to your consistent blogging efforts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogging-rank-number-1-google&quot;>;How HubSpot Uses Blogging to Rank #1 on Google&lt;/a>; to learn more about specific strategies you can implement to rank on search engines.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. To share information about a given topic and become an expert in an industry.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In 2006, Boston-native Matt Kepnes quit his job and began traveling the world. He documented his travels in his now infamous blog, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nomadicmatt.com/&quot;>;NomadicMatt.com&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After about a year, thanks to tireless blogging efforts and SEO strategies that enabled him to rank on Google, he began &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/07/how-nomadic-matt-quit-his-job-to-travel-the-world.html&quot;>;pulling in $60,000&lt;/a>;. Matt also created e-books, and used sponsorships and affiliate marketing to make money. Additionally, he wrote a New York Times best-seller, “How to Travel the World on $50 a Day.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, Matt&#39;s blog attracts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/07/how-nomadic-matt-quit-his-job-to-travel-the-world.html&quot;>;1.5 million visitors a month and grosses about $750,000 a year&lt;/a>; — and he&#39;s become a well-known expert in the travel space.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you want to become known as an expert in a topic that interests you, from fashion to blogging to fitness, you can — and, oftentimes, it starts with a blog.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. To attract visitors to your site, and turn those visitors into leads.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s only so much traffic you can get from the homepage or About Us page of your company&#39;s website. Of course, those pages are critical for leads who are already interested in your products — but they often won&#39;t attract traffic from top-of-the-funnel. That&#39;s where your blog comes into play.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your blog can be a general resource to help your website visitors even before those visitors are ready to purchase from you. For instance, let&#39;s say you sell products for e-commerce stores. You might attract some e-commerce owners who are already searching online for your products, but in most cases, the e-commerce owner isn&#39;t going to be ready to buy right out of the gate.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alternatively, if you begin blogging about tips to help the retail owner who is just starting out — like “How to start a retail website”, or “Benefits of e-commerce vs. physical store” — you&#39;ll slowly attract an audience who enjoys your content and finds it useful. Then, when those site visitors&#39; e-commerce stores begin growing (thanks, in part, to your blog), they&#39;ll already know about your brand and already trust it as a helpful source. &lt;em>;That&#39;s &lt;/em>;when they&#39;ll check out your product pages.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. To cultivate an online community and engage with an audience.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;At the very least, you might create a blog to engage with an online community of readers with similar interests. Maybe you start a food blog and ask readers to share their own recipes with you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alternatively, perhaps you start a blog that focuses on DIY projects. You post the fun, DIY projects you&#39;ve completed in your own home, and you ask your readers to share their own DIY tips in exchange.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Why You Need a Blog&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;For businesses, a blog is a valuable tool to have in your marketing strategy. It&#39;s a great way to get the word out about your brand and build rapport with your audience and potential customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Use it to provide your audience with useful industry-related information, share company news, and product updates. Blog content is also easy to repurpose for email marketing needs and across social channels. Without one, you&#39;re missing out on opportunities to promote your brand.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Creating engaging blog content may seem like a heavy lift at first. Luckily there are free tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms/ai-content-writer&quot;>;HubSpot&#39;s AI Content Writer&lt;/a>; to help you write better content faster.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Choose your target audience.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When you&#39;re &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog&quot;>;starting your own blog&lt;/a>;, it&#39;s important to think of your target audience. Who are you creating the blog for? And who do you want reading your blog posts? Before you can get started, you have to consider the niche you&#39;re writing about and what topics you&#39;ll cover and why.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Brainstorming your target audience is similar to creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research&quot;>;buyer persona&lt;/a>; for your company. Plus, this will give you an idea on what kind of content you want to produce.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Brainstorm content ideas frequently based on your market segment.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Once you&#39;ve started a blog, you&#39;ll want to churn out &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/benefits-high-quality-content-consistency-brand&quot;>;high-quality, consistent content&lt;/a>; on a regular basis. This isn&#39;t always easy. Creating content is a time-consuming task. You want to ensure your content is something your readers would be interested in and hopefully can help with your SEO — more on that in a minute.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To begin brainstorming content, consider what your competitors are doing. Look for gaps in their content that you can fulfill. Additionally, you should also do SEO research to verify that users are searching for and interested in the topic you want to write about. Tools like &lt;a href=&quot;http://semrush.com&quot;>;SEMrush&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/&quot;>;Google Keyword Planner&lt;/a>;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://answerthepublic.com/&quot;>;Answer The Public &lt;/a>;can help.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You&#39;ll want to brainstorm content frequently so you always have ideas that you can execute.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Research and review a content management system (CMS).&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In order to create your blog, you&#39;ll most likely use a CMS. A CMS is a tool you can use to design, manage, and publish on your website. You&#39;ve probably heard of examples like WordPress or Wix.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you don&#39;t have a website yet, you&#39;ll want to choose a CMS that has the ability to host a blog. If you already have a site, check if it has blogging options built in. If not, you may need to find a CMS that integrates with your site or choose an entirely new CMS altogether.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are tons of options in the CMS world, including HubSpot. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-a-blog&amp;amp;amp;hubs_post-cta=You%20can%20try%20out%20our%20CMS%20here&quot;>;You can try out our CMS here.&lt;/a>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;HubSpot&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms/free-blog-maker&quot;>;free blog maker&lt;/a>; provides everything you need, including free hosting and security tools. It&#39;s easy to get started, with hundreds of free themes to choose from, and a simple visual editor.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Create a blog strategy and editorial calendar.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Just like creating a business, you can&#39;t create a blog without a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-strategy-guide&quot;>;strategy&lt;/a>; in mind. Your strategy should answer questions like:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Who are you targeting?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What type of content will you produce?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;When will you post?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Where will you promote your content?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Overall, you should have a mission, vision, and goals for your blog.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, create an &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/business-blog-editorial-calendar-templates&quot;>;editorial calendar&lt;/a>; to keep you organized and on track. A calendar will help you track what posts are coming up, ensure writers are meeting deadlines, and assure you have enough content ideas for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Pay attention to article structure.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When you&#39;re &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog&quot;>;writing your blog posts&lt;/a>;, it&#39;s important to consider the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/anatomy-perfect-blog-post&quot;>;article structure&lt;/a>;. For instance, are you using subheads to break up the post so it&#39;s easy to digest? Are you using bullet points and images that make the post easy to scan? These are important factors that will help keep your reader on the page.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Additionally, you&#39;ll want to make sure that you&#39;re using &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-examples&quot;>;calls-to-action (CTAs)&lt;/a>;, that will guide the reader on what you want them to do next. This is how you can start making money and generating leads from your blog.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;6. Become an expert in marketing and promoting your blog.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Another element of blogging is marketing and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-promotion-tactics&quot;>;promoting your blog posts&lt;/a>;. It&#39;s like the age-old adage — &lt;em>;“When a tree falls in the woods and there is no one there to hear it, does it make a sound?”&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consequently, if you write a blog post but nobody reads it, will it have a positive impact on your company or brand? Probably not. That&#39;s why you&#39;ll have to market your posts. You can use social media, SEO, your website, or your email newsletter to reach current and potential customers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;7. Learn about SEO.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Like I mentioned above, you want people to read your blog posts. One way to do that is to get organic traffic through &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo&quot;>;SEO&lt;/a>;. If you want your blog to be successful, learn how to research keywords, how to rank in search engines, and how to build an SEO strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;8. Use a variety of blog post styles.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Your blog posts should be interesting to everyone who reads them, and especially for customers who read every single post. For those that are active followers and ambassadors of your blog, you should use a variety of blog post styles so your blog doesn&#39;t get stale. Consider using how-to posts, list-based posts, or thought leadership.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;9. Repurpose old content.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Producing blog content consistently can be hard. But you don&#39;t have to reinvent the wheel every time you write a blog post. You can update old blog posts to keep them accurate and comprehensive. Additionally, you can use other content of yours, perhaps a YouTube video or a podcast, and repurpose the content into a blog post.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;10. Perform a competitive analysis.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;To understand your audience, run a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitive-analysis-kit&quot;>;competitive analysis&lt;/a>; on your top blog competitors. This will help you identify trends, uncover gaps in the content in your industry, and give you ideas on topics and ways to promote your blog.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Running a competitive analysis will help you build and iterate on your own blog strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;How to Promote Your Blog&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As mentioned earlier, a blog is an excellent channel to build awareness and promote your brand.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s how to do it:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Link from Your Website&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;This may seem obvious, but you should make your blog easy to find on your website. Consider using an attention-grabbing CTA or making it easily accessible from a dedicated spot on your homepage.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Repurpose Blog Content&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As previously mentioned, repurposing content will save you loads of time when creating content, but it also allows you to promote your brand across multiple channels whether through video, podcasts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/make-emails-more-clickable-list&quot;>;email&lt;/a>;, or social.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Utilize Interlinking&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Once you&#39;ve started generating a significant amount of posts on your blog, it can be helpful to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/internal-linking-tools&quot;>;link to other posts&lt;/a>; or related topic pages within your blog. This is good for SEO, but it will also help your readers find pertinent information on a topic they are interested in.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Promote on Social Media&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;With the help of eye catching video or images, you can also leverage your &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-blog-social-media-marketing-report&quot;>;social media&lt;/a>; channels to drive traffic to your blog. Additionally, consider placing a link to your blog on all of your social accounts. *Stat about social media users*&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Consider Guest Blogging&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/guest-blogging&quot;>;Guest posting&lt;/a>; on another industry-related blog gives your brand the opportunity to introduce itself to new customers who may not have heard of you. It&#39;s also a great opportunity to network with other industry professionals and provide cross-promotion opportunities.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;6. Leverage Influencers&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Influencer marketing is a powerful tool you can use to give your brand some &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/service/psychology-social-proof&quot;>;social proof&lt;/a>; credibility. Similar to guest blogging, you&#39;ll be able to tap into that person&#39;s audience and introduce your brand to a new audience.

Limited navigation keeps visitors engaged and focused on the goal, avoiding distractions from multiple links.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To further prove that you should add more to your website, we surveyed 101 marketing and advertising professionals to learn which landing page elements and strategies were most effective.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;how many landing pages do you have on your websites?&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Why%20You%20Need%20to%20Create%20More%20Landing%20Pages%20%5BData%20+%20Tips%5D.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;91% of our surveyed marketing and advertising professionals feel positive about conversion shifts after adding their landing page(s). And the top three reasons why they believe those conversions happened were because of their team:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Marketing (17%)&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;People (11%)&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Landing Page (9%)&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Getting conversions means your marketing team is combining these three parts of their strategy to get results. And while there&#39;s no exact figure we can tell you to make, there is enough evidence to back up why you should have more landing pages.&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it&#39;s no exact science how many landing pages your business has, that is often reliant on the scale, product, or service of a business to determine. But after assessing survey and Marketing report data, we can conclude that multiple landing pages can be a net benefit for your business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And don&#39;t think that there&#39;s a ceiling to the number of landing pages you can include, in fact, those with &lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/marketing-benchmarks-from-7000-businesses&quot;>;more than 40 landing pages&lt;/a>; increase conversions by over 500%.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;impact of number of landing pages on lead generation&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Why%20You%20Need%20to%20Create%20More%20Landing%20Pages%20%5BData%20+%20Tips%5D-Jul-31-2023-05-45-38-9682-PM.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While most companies don&#39;t see an&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/free-ebook-an-introduction-to-lead-generation/&quot;>; &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/free-ebook-an-introduction-to-lead-generation/&quot;>;increase in leads&lt;/a>; when increasing their total number of landing pages from 1-5 to 6-10, companies do see a 55% increase in leads when increasing their number of landing pages from 10 to 15. And look how that leads index number spikes even more when a company has 40 or more landing pages on their website. And here&#39;s how it breaks down for B2B and B2C businesses:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;number of landing pages on lead generation for b2b and b2c companies&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Why%20You%20Need%20to%20Create%20More%20Landing%20Pages%20%5BData%20+%20Tips%5D-1.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While both B2B and B2C companies seem to benefit from having more landing pages, it seems to be even more advantageous for B2Bs to hit that 40 landing page threshold.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As you can see, it&#39;s hard to deny there&#39;s a pretty strong correlation between the number of landing pages you have on your website and lead generation. But why is this so? Here are four good explanations why the more landing pages, the better the number of your leads.&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;Why More Landing Pages Get More Leads&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;1. More landing pages mean more conversion opportunities.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Quite simply, the more landing pages you have on your website, the more opportunities you have to convert site visitors into leads. There&#39;s also a huge&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/seo-guide&quot;>; &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/seo-guide&quot;>;SEO benefit&lt;/a>; to having more landing pages, which can have an impact even before visitors land on your website.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think about it: The more landing pages you have, the more landing pages will be indexed in search. And if a searcher stumbles upon a search result that directs them straight to one of your landing pages, you&#39;ll have essentially cut out the extra step of a visitor perusing your site and needing to click on a call-to-action to get to that same landing page.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, the pathway from discovery to conversion has much less friction. And do you know&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29396/Master-Online-Lead-Generation-by-Reducing-Friction.aspx&quot;>; &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29396/Master-Online-Lead-Generation-by-Reducing-Friction.aspx&quot;>;what happens when there&#39;s less friction&lt;/a>;? You generate &lt;em>;more leads.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. More landing pages mean more variety.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;You&#39;ve all heard that saying, “variety is the spice of life,” right? Yep — it applies to marketing, too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider it from your visitors&#39; perspective. Say you&#39;re visiting a business&#39; website, and you surf on over to its &quot;Resources&quot; section (you know, where a business might organize all its offers and their respective landing pages). Now let&#39;s also say that “Resources” page only features 5 — or even 10, according to the research cited above — offers because, well, those are the only offers this particular business has available. And maybe none of those offers really appeal to you, because well ... there&#39;s just not enough variety. So you go on your web browsing way, abandoning the site without converting on anything.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same thing will happen if that business only has CTAs for a few offers placed throughout your website or promoted via their other marketing channels. If none of them tickle your fancy as a visitor, you&#39;re probably not going to convert.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a nutshell, don&#39;t let this happen to you. Creating more landing pages means you&#39;ll have a wider variety of offers for your visitors to convert on and for you to promote.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. More landing pages means more marketing collateral.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The more landing pages you have, the more offers you&#39;ll have to fuel the rest of your inbound marketing efforts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remember, content is the heart and soul of any successful inbound marketing strategy. Without it, you&#39;d have nothing to email your contacts, nothing to share with your social media fans and followers, nothing to promote through your website&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/how-to-create-effective-calls-to-action/&quot;>; &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/how-to-create-effective-calls-to-action/&quot;>;calls-to-action&lt;/a>;, nothing by which to get found and rank for your keywords in search.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more offers — and landing pages to house those offers — you have, the more inbound marketing you can do.

More landing pages means more targeting opportunities.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/segmentation-targeting-positioning&quot;>;Segmentation matters&lt;/a>; — and not just when it comes to email marketing. When you&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/free-template-creating-buyer-personas/&quot;>; &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/free-template-creating-buyer-personas/&quot;>;identify various different buyer personas&lt;/a>; and segments within your audience, you have the opportunity to better appeal to those different audiences&#39; interests and needs with more targeted and relevant offers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And to leverage this savvy thinking, face it: You need more landing pages. So what naturally ends up happening for marketers who build up a big arsenal of 40+ landing pages, is they start to create more segment&lt;strong>;-&lt;/strong>;specific content that, because it&#39;s highly relevant to different parts of their audience, is much better able to convert visitors into leads.&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;&lt;strong>;How to Add More Landing Pages&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;“I get it, I get it: More landing pages is better. But how can I go about cranking out more of those bad boys?” So glad you asked!&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Invest in a landing page creation tool.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A big reason why businesses don&#39;t use landing pages is because their marketing department doesn&#39;t know how to set them up, or they are too overloaded. And if you agree, you need to invest in a tool that enables you to quickly and easily create optimized landing pages.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This involves taking control of your website. Inbound marketing requires agility, and any &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/agile-marketing&quot;>;agile marketer&lt;/a>; would take this first step to innovate and improve. Plus, I hear HubSpot has a pretty sweet and easy-to-use&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/products/landing-pages/&quot;>; &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/products/landing-pages/&quot;>;Landing Page tool&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/products/landing-pages/&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;How to Add More Landing Pages: use hubspot landing page tool&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Why%20You%20Need%20to%20Create%20More%20Landing%20Pages%20%5BData%20+%20Tips%5D-4.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;h3>;2. Create more offers.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;You can&#39;t just go around slapping together a ton of new landing pages, no matter how motivated you are to reap those &quot;more is better&quot; results. You&#39;re going to need offers (and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-ebook/free-ebook-killer-marketing-content/&quot;>; &lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-ebook/free-ebook-killer-marketing-content/&quot;>;good ones&lt;/a>;, at that) to go along with them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Keep in mind that landing pages are simply the gateways for your marketing offers, so in order to increase your site&#39;s number of landing pages, you need to increase offer creation, too.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before you start creating new offers, take a look at the offers you already have, and identify where you might have some holes. Ask yourself these questions:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;Do you have offers to suit prospects at &lt;/em>;&lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/7-effective-lead-nurturing-tactics&quot;>;each different stage&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>;&lt;em>; in your marketing and sales funnel?&lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;Do you have offers in a variety of different formats (eg webinars vs. ebooks vs. templates vs. videos, etc.)?&lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;em>;Do they cover various different topics your target audience cares about? &lt;/em>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Once you&#39;ve identified what your holes are, then you can start filling in the gaps.

Tweak the offers you already have to cater to individual personas.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Okay — so you&#39;re going to have to create a bunch more offers to leverage the lead-gen power of an increase in landing pages. But here&#39;s a little saving grace: not all of these offers need to be created from scratch.

Reaching and engaging with everyone in your target audience can be tough since they are dispersed across so many different channels. Plus, the vast volume of competing ads can make it hard to stand out and make an impact on your audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the nature of advertising evolves, it&#39;s important that you do too. People can advertise anywhere, and today&#39;s best type of ad might not be the best type tomorrow.&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;Types of Advertisements&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As you can imagine, there are many &lt;a href=&quot;https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/digital-advertising?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=digital-advertising-certification&quot;>;types of advertisements &lt;/a>;— all of which run in different mediums, on different channels, and have different goals in mind for their business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are eight examples of advertising from the past few centuries.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Print Advertising&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The first print ad ran in England in 1472, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2011/12/26/history-advertising/#GgxZnvJW75ql&quot;>;Infolinks&lt;/a>;. Since then, this type of advertising has become available in newspapers, magazines, brochures, billboards, flyers, and similarly portable methods of carrying a brand&#39;s message to its ideal end user. In this ad method, the advertiser pays the publisher to place their ad in the publication.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Direct Mail Advertising&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Direct mail involves creating and distributing printed materials to a targeted mailing list. These materials can include post cards, catalogs, brochures, letters, and promotional offers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This method &lt;a href=&quot;https://postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibition/america%E2%80%99s-mailing-industry-industry-segments/direct-marketing-advertising-agencies-and&quot;>;first came about&lt;/a>; in 1835 when the American Anti-Slavery Society (AAS) mailed print materials to southern religious and civic leaders. Soon after, direct mail became a common advertising method used by businesses to raise awareness for their brand.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although it&#39;s easy to write off &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/direct-mail&quot;>;direct mail&lt;/a>; as just “junk mail,” it&#39;s actually quite effective, even in the digital age. Not only do consumers enjoy receiving physical mail, but there&#39;s also much less competition compared to the tons of email marketing ads that people receive each day.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Radio Advertising&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;United States radio stations launched their first commercial broadcasts in 1920. And while we might all drive around with our iPhones plugged in for music these days, don&#39;t let that fool you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Radio is still a viable marketing and advertising platform today for expanding the reach of sponsored events and new products. In this ad method, the advertiser pays the radio station to play their ad during designated breaks between music or a radio show.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Television Advertising&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Television ads originated in the 1940s with the promotion of practical items and political campaigns. Advertisers can now use television to promote food, toys, stores, business services, and more—both to local TV channels and to national broadcast networks. In this ad method, the advertiser pays the TV network to show their ad during designated breaks in the network&#39;s regular programming.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Internet Advertising&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Internet advertising took root in the mid-1990s with the launch of “banner” advertisements for various telecommunications companies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Marketers place these ads in interstitial spots on a webpage. Basically, advertisers pay the website owner to place their ads in exposed spaces peripheral to the website&#39;s own content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg. Internet advertising has gone on to include video, &lt;a href=&quot;https://instapage.com/solutions/social-ads&quot;>;search engine marketing&lt;/a>;, and more.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;6. Social Media Advertising&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/basics-effective-social-media-advertising&quot;>;Social media advertising&lt;/a>; is a form of internet advertising that emerged with the introduction of social media in the 2000s. In this ad method, advertisers promote products, services, or content through paid ads on social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and TikTok.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also many different ad formats to choose from when advertising on social media, such as image ads, video ads, carousel ads, sponsored posts, and more.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;7. Mobile Advertising&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Since the early 2000s, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/28776/the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-for-mastering-mobile-marketing.aspx&quot;>;mobile advertising&lt;/a>; has been a popular method due to the widespread use of cell phones and the amount of time people spend on them. It involves delivering promotional messages or advertisements through text messages, mobile apps, mobile websites, and push notifications.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With this method, advertisers can leverage data and create highly personalized ads based on location, behavior, and user interests.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;8. Podcast Advertising&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Podcast advertising gained popularity in the mid 2000s with the introduction of MP3 players, such as iPods, which made it easier for users to download and listen to podcasts on the go.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to radio advertising, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/podcast-advertising-tips&quot;>;podcast advertising&lt;/a>; is where advertisers pay podcast owners to promote their product or service through sponsorship or ad spots in podcasts. These ads can be inserted before, during, or after a podcast episode.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In essence, the advertising types listed above have evolved dramatically since their inception. What were once quite one-dimensional messages now carry clever, funny, or profound undertones that make the ads memorable years after they first ran.&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;What makes a good advertisement?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;No matter which method of advertising you use, one thing remains true: the best advertisements capture the attention of consumers right from the start. Here are some key qualities of an effective and impactful ad.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;It has a clear message.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Clear messaging ensures that your audience understands what you&#39;re trying to communicate with them. Without clarity, consumers may misinterpret or fail to grasp the main point of your ad, leading to confusion and a loss of impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As consumers are constantly bombarded with advertisements, simple and straightforward messaging can also help your brand cut through the noise and grasp their attention.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;It tells a story.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Storytelling is essential in advertising because it allows you to connect with your audience on a deeper level. A well-told story has the potential to hold your audience&#39;s interest for longer, increasing the chances of delivering your message more effectively.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Telling a story can also help you differentiate your brand from competitors. By sharing unique stories that reflect your brand&#39;s values or mission, you can establish a distinct brand identity and develop a loyal customer base.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;It uses emotional appeals.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Emotions are a fundamental part of the human experience. When advertisements appeal to emotions, they tap into universal feelings, such as joy, sadness, or empathy. This creates a sense of relatability and empathy, allowing viewers to connect with the brand on a deeper level.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Keep in mind that it&#39;s important to strike the right balance in emotional appeals and ensure authenticity and relevance to the brand and its target audience. Emotions should be used ethically, responsibly, and in alignment with the brand&#39;s values and positioning.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;It&#39;s memorable.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Whether your ad has a catchy jingle or unique tagline, a uniquely creative approach has the power to stick with peoples&#39; minds and give you a competitive advantage in the crowded advertising landscape.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When an advertisement leaves a strong impression, it continues to influence consumers&#39; thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors even after the initial exposure. Memorable ads are also more likely to be shared and generate word-of-mouth, amplifying their reach and impact.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;It prompts action.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;A good ad creates a sense of urgency and prompts the audience to take action, whether it&#39;s to make a purchase, visit a website, sign up for a newsletter, or engage with the brand in a meaningful way. A clear call to action guides your audience on what steps they should take next.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ultimately, prompting action ensures that advertisements are not just passive messages but active drivers of business outcomes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So how do you create an advertising strategy that resonates? Well, this post should help with that as we explore how we can learn from ads and campaigns.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But, first, an important distinction:&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 class=&quot;p1&quot;>;Featured Resource: &lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/advertising-plan-kit?hubs_post-cta=header&quot;>;Advertising Campaign Planning Kit&lt;/a>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/advertising-plan-kit?hubs_post-cta=image&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/advertisement_1.webp?width=650&amp;amp;height=394&amp;amp;name=advertisement_1.webp&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;394&quot; alt=&quot;hubspot featured resource: advertising planning kit&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/advertising-plan-kit?hubs_post-cta=imagebottom&quot;>;Download for Free&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Use HubSpot&#39;s free Advertising Campaign Kit to plan out your advertising project and learn more about which advertising type is the best for your project.&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Without further ado, here they are in no particular order: 18 of the best advertisements of all time and the lessons we can learn from them.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Nike: Just Do It.&lt;/h3>; &lt;h4>;Ad Campaign: Print, Television, Internet&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;nike-just-do-it-1.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/DRAFT%20best%20ads-Aug-23-2023-06-34-21-4776-PM.jpeg?width=650&amp;amp;height=291&amp;amp;name=DRAFT%20best%20ads-Aug-23-2023-06-34-21-4776-PM.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;291&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brandchannel.com/2013/07/03/nike-celebrates-25-years-of-just-do-it/&quot;>;&lt;em>;Image Source&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Did you know that once upon a time, Nike&#39;s product catered almost exclusively to marathon runners? Then, a fitness craze emerged, and the folks in Nike&#39;s marketing department knew they needed to take advantage of it to surpass their main competitor, Reebok. (At the time, &lt;a href=&quot;http://americanapersona.wordpress.com/2008/05/27/the-quick-history-of-nike-nike-advertising-and-nike-brands/&quot;>;Reebok was selling more shoes than Nike&lt;/a>;). And so, in the late 1980s, Nike created the “Just Do It.” campaign.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was a hit.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1988, Nike sales were at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/11/business/nike-is-bounding-past-reebok.html&quot;>;$800 million&lt;/a>;; by 1998, sales &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/1000-02-20/can-nike-still-do-it&quot;>;exceeded $9.2 billion&lt;/a>;. “Just Do It” was short and sweet yet encapsulated everything people felt when exercising—and people still feel that feeling today. Don&#39;t want to run five miles? Just Do It. Don&#39;t want to walk up four flights of stairs? Just Do It. It&#39;s a slogan we can all relate to: the drive to push ourselves beyond our limits.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Lesson&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When you&#39;re trying to decide the best way to present your brand, ask yourself: what problem are you solving for your customers? What solution does your product or service provide? By hitting on that core issue in all of your messaging, you&#39;ll connect with consumers on an emotional level that is hard to ignore.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Coke: Share a Coke&lt;/h3>; &lt;h4>;Ad Campaign: Print&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;share a coke advertisement&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/DRAFT%20best%20ads-1.jpeg?width=650&amp;amp;height=363&amp;amp;name=DRAFT%20best%20ads-1.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;363&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Big brands are often hard-pressed to do something ground-breaking when they&#39;re already so big. So, what did Coca-Cola do to appeal to the masses? They appealed to individuals by putting their names on each bottle.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Share a Coke campaign &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/share-a-coke-how-the-groundbreaking-campaign-got-its-start-down-under&quot;>;began in Australia in 2011&lt;/a>; when Coca-Cola personalized each bottle with the 150 most popular names in the country. Since then, the US has followed suit, printing first names across the front of its bottles and cans in Coke&#39;s branded font. You can even &lt;a href=&quot;https://buy.shareacoke.com/personalized-bottle&quot;>;order custom bottles&lt;/a>; on Coke&#39;s website to request things like nicknames and college logos.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This was a breaking story across the marketing and advertising industry. It enchanted many consumers, but it confused others. Why make something temporary so personal?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Either way, Coke received immediate attention for this campaign. Pepsi even released some sassy counter-ads shortly after the campaign launched. Theirs focused on mocking the bottle names, questioning how people truly felt when they got the wrong name.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Lesson&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Coke fans are regular buyers, and the company fully leaned into that sense of individual ownership. Wondering what name you&#39;ll get out of the vending machine was a fun thrill in and of itself—even if it isn&#39;t yours, it encourages you to “share a Coke” with whoever&#39;s name is on the front.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Absolut Vodka: The Absolut Bottle&lt;/h3>; &lt;h4>;Ad Campaign: Print&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;best ads: absolute paris&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/DRAFT%20best%20ads-Aug-23-2023-06-34-21-6632-PM.jpeg?width=450&amp;amp;height=600&amp;amp;name=DRAFT%20best%20ads-Aug-23-2023-06-34-21-6632-PM.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;best ads: absolute new york&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/DRAFT%20best%20ads-Aug-23-2023-06-34-21-2367-PM.jpeg?width=450&amp;amp;height=600&amp;amp;name=DRAFT%20best%20ads-Aug-23-2023-06-34-21-2367-PM.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aburningthroughjourney.blogspot.com/2011/05/absolut-vodka-bottle-campaign.html&quot;>;&lt;em>;Image Source&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aburningthroughjourney.blogspot.com/2011/05/absolut-vodka-bottle-campaign.html&quot;>;&lt;/a>;Despite having an ambiguous shape, Absolut made its bottle the most recognizable bottle in the world. Its campaign, which featured print ads showing bottles “in the wild,” was so successful that it didn&#39;t stop running for 25 years. It&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnbc.com/id/43673665/Top_Ad_Campaigns_of_the_20th_Century?slide=7&quot;>;the longest uninterrupted ad campaign ever&lt;/a>; and comprises over 1,500 separate ads. So, as the saying goes, “If it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the campaign started, Absolut had a measly 2.5% of the vodka market. When it ended in the late 2000s, Absolut was importing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/the-21-best-absolut-ads-2013-12&quot;>;4.5 million cases&lt;/a>; per year or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ddrewdesign.com/blog/index.php?cmd=article&amp;amp;id=136&quot;>;half of all imported vodka&lt;/a>; in the US&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Lesson&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;No matter how boring your product looks, you can still &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-ebook/free-ebook-killer-marketing-content/?_ga=2.20812088.1436521391.1672345749-231191358.1672345749&amp;amp;hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-advertisements&amp;amp;hubs_post-cta=tell%20your%20story%20in%20an%20interesting%20way&quot;>;tell your story in an interesting way&lt;/a>;. Let me repeat: Absolut created 1500 ads for one bottle. So, don&#39;t feel afraid to be determined and differentiate your product in the same way.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Anheuser-Busch: Whassup (1999)&lt;/h3>; &lt;h4>;Ad Campaign: Television&lt;/h4>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 650px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-content-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;&quot;>; &lt;iframe style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikkg4NobV_w&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;When&#39;s the last time an advertisement literally changed the way we talk to one another? Allow me to answer that question with another question: “Whassup?!”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This series of commercials, which first appeared in late 1999, features a group of friends connecting on a group phone call (not very common anymore, huh?) while drinking beer and “watching the game” on TV.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It starts gently: “What are you doin&#39;?” Someone asks. “Watching the game, havin&#39; a Bud” (a Budweiser), someone replies. As more friends pick up the phone, hilarity ensues: “WHASSUP!?” is yelled back and forth, becoming a classic catchphrase and an icon of beer-drinking culture that constantly ran on sports networks over the next few years.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Lesson&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The ad took pop culture by storm during the Super Bowl in 2000, and you can still hear its echoes today.为什么？ Anheuser-Busch showed us just how silly and informal an ad can be without ruffling feathers or going off-brand. Dare to celebrate your audience&#39;s absurdities. The more genuine your ad is, the more valuable your product is.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Miller Lite: Great Taste, Less Filling (1974)&lt;/h3>; &lt;h4>;Ad Campaign: Print, Television&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;best ads: miller lite&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/DRAFT%20best%20ads-3.jpeg?width=450&amp;amp;height=601&amp;amp;name=DRAFT%20best%20ads-3.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;601&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://buildingpharmabrands.com/2013/04/26/great-taste-less-filling/&quot;>;&lt;em>;Image Source&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think it&#39;s easy to create a whole new market for your product? The Miller Brewing Company (now MillerCoors) did just that with the light beer market—and dominated it. The goal of the “Great Taste, Less Filling” campaign was getting “real men” to drink light beer, but they were battling the common misconception that light beer can never actually taste good.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking the debate head-on, Miller featured masculine models drinking their light beer and declaring it great tasting.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Lesson&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For decades after this campaign aired, Miller Lite dominated the light beer market it had essentially created. What&#39;s the lesson marketers can learn? Strive to be different. If people tell you there isn&#39;t room for a product, create your own category so you can quickly become the leader.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;6. Always: #LikeaGirl (2015)&lt;/h3>; &lt;h4>;Ad Campaign: Television, Internet&lt;/h4>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 650px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-content-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;&quot;>; &lt;iframe style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dxrPeFKtUwQ?si=AuKPlfEWa-uImMSo&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Always, the feminine product brand, hit a home run with this advertisement, not because it went viral after the commercial ran in the 2015 Super Bowl, but because it was a groundbreaking message that hundreds of millions of people repeated long after the campaign was over.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The campaign began as a commercial explaining the stigma behind playing sports “like a girl”—implying that the boy&#39;s way is better or correct. By the end of the ad, the message is both clear and inspiring: girls are just as fit and capable as boys are, particularly during puberty—a stage of life that&#39;s extremely important to Always and its women&#39;s products.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The message is now a holistic initiative by Always and a hashtag that&#39;s still used on social media today.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Lesson&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Acknowledge not just your audience but the challenges they face—especially the ones that reflect your time or culture. Not every societal issue is off-limits to marketers and advertisers. Take a stand on the ones you know your audience supports, and you&#39;ll access a customer base that identifies with your passion.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;7. Volkswagen: Think Small (1960)&lt;/h3>; &lt;h4>;Standalone Ad: Print&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;best ad example: volkswagen think small&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/DRAFT%20best%20ads-4.jpeg?width=650&amp;amp;height=428&amp;amp;name=DRAFT%20best%20ads-4.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;428&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://designshack.net/articles/graphics/the-greatest-print-campaigns-of-all-time-volkswagen-think-small/&quot;>;&lt;em>;Image Source&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many marketing and advertising professionals like to call Volkswagen&#39;s &quot;Think Small&quot; campaign the gold standard. Created in 1960 by a legendary advertising group at Doyle Dane &amp;amp; Bernbach (DDB), the campaign set out to answer one question: how do you change people&#39;s perceptions not only about a product but also about an entire group of people?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;See, Americans always had the propensity to buy big American cars—and even 15 years after WWII ended, most Americans were still not buying small German cars. So what did this Volkswagen advertisement do? It played right into the audience&#39;s expectations. You think I&#39;m small? Yeah, I am. They never tried to be something they weren&#39;t.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Lesson&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s the most important takeaway from this campaign: don&#39;t sell your company, product, or service as something it&#39;s not. Consumers recognize and appreciate honesty.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;8. Google: Year in Search (2017)&lt;/h3>; &lt;h4>;Ad Campaign: Internet&lt;/h4>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 650px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-content-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;&quot;>; &lt;iframe style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vI4LHl4yFuo&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;This isn&#39;t the oldest or most well-known advertisement on our list, but it&#39;s become the most powerful over its nine-year (and still going) existence. So powerful and so true you forget it&#39;s an advertisement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2021/GLOBAL/?__hstc=20629287.531937af8872f71c6bf46b3a43b6caad.1691521659996.1691541119895.1691600256215.5&amp;amp;__hssc=20629287.1.1691600256215&amp;amp;__hsfp=311626848&quot;>;Year in Search&lt;/a>; began in 2009 as “Zeitgeist,” a written report of the public&#39;s most common Google searches over the previous 12 months. The following year, Google adapted it for a three-minute video. Since then, it&#39;s been a bold, yearly reminder of how much we depend on Google for information on the news and events that give the entire world pause. Check out the company&#39;s latest video from 2021 above.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Lesson&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Remind your customers how much you care that they care. These stories elicit a variety of emotions but ultimately unite everyone—no matter what Google products they might like—through an uplifting message of how our usage of the company reflects the best in all of us.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;9. Dos Equis: The Most Interesting Man in the World (2006)&lt;/h3>; &lt;h4>;Ad Campaign: Television, Pre-roll&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;dos equis the most interesting man in the world&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/DRAFT%20best%20ads-1.png?width=650&amp;amp;height=488&amp;amp;name=DRAFT%20best%20ads-1.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;488&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://intotheopenfield.com/2016/03/the-new-most-interesting-man-in-the-world/&quot;>;&lt;em>;Image Source&lt;/em>; &lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You know who he is. The man smokes Cuban cigars, surrounds himself with beautiful women, and drinks Dos Equis beer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cooling down indulgent vices, such as beer, desserts, or luxury items, is key to creating a successful campaign. And The Most Interesting Man in the World is one of the coolest commercial guys out there.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of every commercial, he says: “I don&#39;t always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis. Stay thirsty, my friends.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Lesson&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The hilarious hyperbole employed in this campaign makes it memorable the next time viewers head out to buy some beer. And even though Dos Equis &lt;a href=&quot;http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/dos-equis-swap-actor-plays-interesting-man/303026/&quot;>;recently replaced The Most Interesting Man&lt;/a>; with a new actor, the original actor&#39;s popularity in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.complex.com/style/2013/08/the-most-interesting-man-in-the-world-meme/&quot;>;meme culture&lt;/a>; will never decline because of his short, sweet, and memorable tagline—and the cool dude vibe it makes viewers harken back to.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;10. California Milk Processor Board: Got Milk? (1993)&lt;/h3>; &lt;h4>;Ad Campaign: Print&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;best ads: got milk wolverine&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/DRAFT%20best%20ads-Aug-23-2023-06-34-22-2864-PM.jpeg?width=450&amp;amp;height=582&amp;amp;name=DRAFT%20best%20ads-Aug-23-2023-06-34-22-2864-PM.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;582&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/restaurants/got-the-shakes-new-lame-milk-commercial-forgets-its-origins-6392885&quot;>;&lt;em>;Image Source&lt;/em>; &lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks to the California Milk Processor Board&#39;s “Got Milk?” campaign, milk sales in California &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketing-case-studies.blogspot.com/2008/04/got-milk-campaign.html&quot;>;rose 7% in just one year&lt;/a>;. But the impact ran across state borders, and to this day, you still can&#39;t escape the millions of “Got [Fill-in-the-Blank]?” parodies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Note, though, that the ad didn&#39;t target people who weren&#39;t drinking milk; it instead focused on the consumers who already were.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Lesson&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s not always about getting a brand-new audience to use your products or services. Sometimes, it&#39;s about getting your current audience to appreciate and use your product more often. Turn your audience into advocates, and use marketing and ad content to tell them why they should continue enjoying the product or service you&#39;re already providing.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;11. Metro Trains: Dumb Ways to Die (2012)&lt;/h3>; &lt;h4>;Ad Campaign: Internet, Radio&lt;/h4>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 650px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-content-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;&quot;>; &lt;iframe style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IJNR2EpS0jw&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Yes, you read that right: Dumb Ways to Die.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Melbourne, Australia, Metro Trains wanted to convey a simple message: no horsing near train tracks. Disorderly conduct could lead to injuries or even death. Still, instead of typical warning signs or announcements inside train stations, Metro Trains came up with Dumb Ways to Die, a song that has garnered 157 million YouTube views since it debuted in 2012.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The song is, unsurprisingly, about dumb ways to die. For example, poking a grizzly bear with a stick or taking your helmet off in outer space.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Frankly, it features a catchy little chorus you won&#39;t be able to stop humming to yourself (because singing it is a little morbid): “Dumb ways to die, so many dumb ways to die.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the video, after you&#39;ve watched adorable cartoon characters dying in the dumbest of ways, you get to the moral of the story: there are many dumb ways to die, but the dumbest possible way would be if you died while standing on the edge of a train platform, drove through a railroad sign, or tried to cross over a train track.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The video ad went viral on YouTube. The song was available on iTunes and even played over the radio with an accompanying ad.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Lesson&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This beloved, now-famous campaign communicates a simple idea in a creative and memorable way—and you don&#39;t feel you&#39;re being nagged the way some public service announcements do. Consider using creativity to convey your message if your subject matter is grim or boring.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;12. Apple: Get a Mac (2006)&lt;/h3>; &lt;h4>;Ad Campaign: Television&lt;/h4>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 650px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-content-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;&quot;>; &lt;iframe style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sdF5IsyOxU4&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;While there have been many great Apple campaigns, this one takes the cake. The video above is just one of a series of iterations of this campaign, and the Mac vs. PC debate ended up being one of the most successful campaigns ever for Apple. The company experienced &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.softpedia.com/news/Apple-s-Get-a-Mac-Awarded-Grand-Effie-56898.shtml&quot;>;42% market share growth&lt;/a>; in its first year with its help. These commercials tell Apple&#39;s audience everything they need to know about the product without being overt.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Lesson&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Just because your product does some pretty amazing things doesn&#39;t mean you need to hit your audience over the head with it. Instead, explain your product&#39;s benefits in a relatable way, so consumers can see themselves using it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;13. Clairol: Does She or Doesn&#39;t She? (1957)&lt;/h3>; &lt;h4>;Standalone Ad: Print&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;best ads: clairol does she or doesn&#39;t she&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/DRAFT%20best%20ads-3.png?width=450&amp;amp;height=581&amp;amp;name=DRAFT%20best%20ads-3.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;581&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTXjr49VipVh8Rrw6Poa91WpwRWMsoF2K8o_bQ5g-F_Ap1xIuy8lu1d8A&quot;>;&lt;em>;Image Source&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time Clairol asked this question in 1957, the answer was 1 to 15—as in, only 1 in 15 people were using artificial hair color. Just 11 years later, the answer was 1 of 2, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899732,00.html&quot;>;TIME Magazine&lt;/a>;. The ad was apparently so successful that some states stopped requiring women to denote hair color on their driver&#39;s license. You know you&#39;ve hit a nerve when your ad campaign changes things at the DMV.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Clairol did the opposite of what most marketers would do: they didn&#39;t want every woman on the street running around saying they were using their product. They wanted women to understand that their product was so good that people couldn&#39;t tell if they were using it or not.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Lesson&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sometimes, simply conveying how and why your product works is enough for consumers. Showing becomes more effective than telling.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;14. De Beers: A Diamond is Forever (1999)&lt;/h3>; &lt;h4>;Ad Campaign: Print, Television&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;best ads: de beers a diamond is forever&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/DRAFT%20best%20ads-Aug-23-2023-06-34-21-8450-PM.jpeg?width=450&amp;amp;height=602&amp;amp;name=DRAFT%20best%20ads-Aug-23-2023-06-34-21-8450-PM.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;602&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-27371208&quot;>;&lt;em>;Image Source&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1999, &lt;a href=&quot;http://adage.com/article/special-report-the-advertising-century/ad-age-advertising-century-top-10-slogans/140156/&quot;>;AdAge declared&lt;/a>; De Beers&#39; &quot;A Diamond is Forever&quot; the most memorable slogan of the twentieth century. But the campaign, which proposed (pun very much intended) the idea that no marriage would be complete without a diamond ring, wasn&#39;t just riding on the coattails of an existing industry. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/diamond-de-beers-marketing-campaign?_ga=2.42983077.1436521391.1672345749-231191358.1672345749&amp;amp;hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-advertisements&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=De%20Beers%20actually%20built%20the%20industry&quot;>;De Beers actually built the industry&lt;/a>;. It presented the idea that a diamond ring was a necessary luxury.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/fashion/weddings/how-americans-learned-to-love-diamonds.html?_r=1&amp;amp;&quot;>;New York Times&lt;/a>;, NW Ayer&#39;s game plan was to “create a situation where almost every person pledging marriage feels compelled to acquire a diamond engagement ring.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Lesson&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Advertising can make a relatively inexpensive product seem luxurious and essential.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;15. Old Spice: The Man Your Man Could Smell Like (2010)&lt;/h3>; &lt;h4>;Ad Campaign: Television, Internet&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;best ads: old spice&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/DRAFT%20best%20ads.jpeg?width=650&amp;amp;height=365&amp;amp;name=DRAFT%20best%20ads.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;365&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coloribus.com/adsarchive/tv-commercials/old-spice-the-man-your-man-could-smell-like-13578305/&quot;>;&lt;em>;Image Source&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The very first part of Old Spice&#39;s “The Man Your Man Could Smell Like” campaign, created by Wieden + Kennedy and launched in February 2010, was the following commercial. It became a viral success practically overnight:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That video has over 51 million views as of this writing. Several months later, in June 2010, Old Spice followed up with a second commercial featuring the same actor, Isaiah Mustafa. Mustafa quickly became “Old Spice Guy,” a nickname Wieden + Kennedy capitalized on with an interactive video campaign in which Mustafa responded to fans&#39; comments on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media websites with short, personalized videos.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In about two days, the company had churned out 186 personalized, scripted, and quite funny video responses featuring Mustafa responding to fans online.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/articles/201108/5-marketing-lessons-from-old-spice.html&quot;>; According to Inc&lt;/a>;, these videos saw almost 11 million views, and Old Spice gained about 29,000 Facebook fans and 58,000 new Twitter followers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We were creating and sending miniature TV commercials back to individual consumers that were personalized, and we were doing it on a rapid-fire basis,” Jason Bagley, former creative director at Wieden + Kennedy and a writer for the campaign, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/articles/201108/5-marketing-lessons-from-old-spice.html&quot;>;told Inc&lt;/a>;. “No one expects to ask a question and then be responded to. I think that&#39;s where we broke through.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Lesson&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If you find your campaign&#39;s gained momentum with your fans and followers, do everything you can to keep them engaged while keeping your messaging true to your brand&#39;s voice and image.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;16. Wendy&#39;s: Where&#39;s the Beef? (1984)&lt;/h3>; &lt;h4>;Ad Campaign: Print, Television&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;best ads: wendy&#39;s where&#39;s the beef&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/DRAFT%20best%20ads-Aug-23-2023-06-34-22-1115-PM.jpeg?width=450&amp;amp;height=423&amp;amp;name=DRAFT%20best%20ads-Aug-23-2023-06-34-22-1115-PM.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 450px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;423&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adsoftdirect.com/wheres-the-beef-anniversary-of-an-icon/&quot;>;&lt;em>;Image Source&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is it enough to say this campaign was successful because it featured a giant hamburger bun and a cute set of old ladies?不？ I didn&#39;t think so.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wendy&#39;s took a more daring approach in this advertising campaign: it targeted its competitors. The simple phrase &quot;Where&#39;s the beef?&quot; was used to point out the lack of beef in competitors&#39; burgers—and it quickly became a catchphrase that encapsulated all that was missing in their audience&#39;s lives.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While you can&#39;t predict when &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/slogan-makeover-before-and-after?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-advertisements&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=a%20catchphrase&quot;>;a catchphrase&lt;/a>; will catch on and when it won&#39;t, Wendy&#39;s (wisely) didn&#39;t over-promote their hit phrase. The campaign only ran for a year, allowing it to gently run its course.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Lesson&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Be careful with your campaign successes and failures. Just because you find something that works doesn&#39;t mean you should keep doing it repeatedly to the point it&#39;s played out. Allow your company to change and grow, and you may find that you can have even greater success in the future by trying something new.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;17. Procter &amp;amp; Gamble: Thank You, Mom (2012)&lt;/h3>; &lt;h4>;Ad Campaign: Television&lt;/h4>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 650px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-content-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;&quot;>; &lt;iframe style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BnBvlz8EaZ0&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Seriously, you wouldn&#39;t expect a household and cleaning products company commercial to pull at the heartstrings like that, would you? Lately, though, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble (P&amp;amp;G) has launched some of the best ads we&#39;ve ever seen from the consumer goods industry.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s because P&amp;amp;G identified the story behind the story of Olympic athletes—the stories of the supportive moms who pushed these world-class athletes throughout their entire lives leading up to that crowning moment. And yes, they probably had to do a lot of laundry and cleanup along the way (presumably using P&amp;amp;G products).&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Lesson&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Make your audience cry (just kidding). The season or time period of your ad is important. But even if you run an ad during the Olympic Games, like P&amp;amp;G did, make sure it has longevity and a message that can influence people no matter when or where they see it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emotional and nostalgia marketing are powerful tactics to get people to make buying choices, so if there&#39;s a bigger, more universal story behind your product or story, tap into it—and showcase it front and center.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;18. KFC: “FCK” (2018)&lt;/h3>; &lt;h4>;Standalone Ad: Print&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;best ads: kfc fck&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/DRAFT%20best%20ads-2.jpeg?width=650&amp;amp;height=325&amp;amp;name=DRAFT%20best%20ads-2.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;325&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ad above isn&#39;t just an empty bucket of KFC with the company&#39;s letters jumbled around. It&#39;s also not a normal, unprompted promotion of fried chicken.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This ad is an apology and perhaps the most creative one of all time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2018, KFC&#39;s business in the UK &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adweek.com/creativity/kfc-responds-to-uk-chicken-shortage-scandal-with-a-timely-fck-were-sorry/&quot;>;ran out of chicken&lt;/a>;. You read that right: a poultry company ran out of poultry. It&#39;s not every day that a business stumbles upon the most ironic PR crisis in company history, so when it happens, all eyes are on the business&#39;s response. Well, we&#39;re happy to report that KFC stuck the landing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the help of the creative agency Mother London, KFC took out a full-page ad in Metro, the UK&#39;s newspaper, rearranging its three famous initials to create a hilarious, albeit explicit, response to its product shortage. The ad depicts a KFC bucket that reads, “FCK”—as if to say, “FCK, this is embarrassing.” (You can fill in the missing letter...)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beneath this design, the company apologizes for what it realizes is an inexcusable, if not slightly funny, failure.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Lesson&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;No business is above a good old-fashioned sorry. And if you can laugh at yourself in the process, you&#39;ll only make it better.

Because the process of creating an HTML email from scratch can be quite involved, we recommend working with a developer or using a pre-made HTML email template instead.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Developing an HTML email specifically for HubSpot?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re developing an HTML email template specifically for use in HubSpot, you&#39;ll want to make sure you include the &lt;a href=&quot;https://designers.hubspot.com/docs/cos/email-template-markup&quot;>;required HubL tokens&lt;/a>; (these ensure your emails can be customized and are compliant with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-can-spam-ht&quot;>;CAN-SPAM&lt;/a>; laws).

Or alternatively, just use our simple what-you-see-is-what-you-get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/html-email&amp;amp;hubs_post-cta=email%20editor&quot;>;email editor&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that you understand the basics of what goes into developing an HTML email, let&#39;s go over a few important best practices you should keep in mind. No matter what method you plan to use to create HTML emails, these best practices will help improve the design, user experience, and deliverability of your emails.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Make sure your HTML email is responsive for different screen sizes and devices.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The way your email looks in a user&#39;s inbox depends on a wide variety of different factors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the biggest and most obvious factors is the screen size of the device it&#39;s being viewed on. An email that looks amazing and well-formatted on a desktop can easily devolve into a tangle of illegible, overlapping text and images when viewed on a smartphone screen.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To ensure your HTML emails look the way you intended across a wide spectrum of screen sizes, the best thing you can do is keep your layout simple and straightforward. When you start adding more complex elements like multiple columns and floated images, it becomes more difficult to translate the format of your email for different screen sizes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you do decide to develop a more complex layout, make sure you&#39;re actively solving for how the elements will be rearranged to suit different screen sizes. For example, if your email displays as multi-column on desktop, that same structure won&#39;t fly on mobile — you&#39;ll need to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/mastering-media-queries&quot;>;media queries&lt;/a>; to define how elements will be displayed on different screen sizes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remember, developing truly responsive HTML emails goes beyond the structure and format of your message. Think about how the overall user experience of your email will be perceived on different devices. Make sure your font choices are just as legible on mobile as they are on desktop, and use mobile-friendly buttons or CTAs in place of hyperlinked text (have you ever tried to tap a little line of hyperlinked text on mobile? It&#39;s not very easy).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can find our more in-depth &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-mobile-optimization-tips&quot;>;guide to mobile email best practices right here&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Make sure your styling works in different email clients.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Another big factor that heavily impacts the way your HTML emails appear in your subscribers&#39; inboxes is the email client they&#39;re using to open the message. Every email client loads emails slightly differently, so an email that looks a certain way in Gmail will likely look different in Outlook.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luckily, if you know how most popular email clients load particular HTML and CSS elements, you can create a pretty consistent experience across different users&#39; inboxes. It&#39;s all about knowing which unsupported tags to avoid and adapting accordingly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/&quot;>;This comprehensive guide&lt;/a>; explains how the most popular email clients (including Gmail and multiple versions of Outlook) support and render different styling elements.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can also check out an article we wrote on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/optimize-emails-different-email-clients&quot;>;optimizing emails for different email clients&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Be conscious of how long your HTML emails take to load.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;How long your email takes to load could very well be the difference between gaining a new customer and losing a frustrated subscriber. While it can be tempting to take advantage of all the different styling options and opportunities to incorporate visuals that HTML emails offer, none of that matters if your email takes too long to load.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As you design your HTML email, remain conscious of how long your email will take to load — especially if someone is, say, opening your message on their morning subway commute with a weak data connection. Here are a few little steps you can take that will go a long way towards improving load time.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Use images sparingly.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;That way, you&#39;ll bolster the message you want to get across to subscribers. Always use an image compressor (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://compressor.io/&quot;>;Compressor.io&lt;/a>;) to reduce the file size as much as possible. Most image compressors can significantly reduce the file size of an image without compromising on quality, so taking this extra step won&#39;t hurt the visual integrity of your email.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Use standard web fonts.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Custom fonts are great for spicing up a landing page, but they can add an extraneous layer of complexity when added to an email. As we talked about above, all email clients handle style elements differently, and this especially extends to fonts. To be safe, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/website/web-safe-html-css-fonts&quot;>;standard web fonts&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.chamaileon.io/best-fonts-for-email/&quot;>;check to make sure&lt;/a>; the email client most of your subscribers use supports a particular font.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Try an HTML minifier.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;An HTML minifier (like &lt;a href=&quot;http://minifycode.com/html-minifier/&quot;>;minifycode.com&lt;/a>; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://smallseotools.com/minify-html/&quot;>;smallseotools.com&lt;/a>;) automatically removes code that isn&#39;t needed in an HTML file. Repetitive, extra elements will be stripped out, but the actual rendering of your email should remain the same (always test it out!). Each line of code impacts how long an email takes to load, so taking the time to remove junk code can have a positive effect on load time.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Keep your message focused on a single objective.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The best way to reduce email load time is to reduce how much content you add to each of your email sends. It might seem obvious, but too many marketers try to stuff too much content into their emails. Not only does that lead to an off-putting user experience (nobody wants to read a novel in email form), but it can send your load time off the charts and cause users to abandon your email. Keep it simple, and your users will thank you.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Plan (as much as you can) for end-user inconsistencies.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The screen size and email client aren&#39;t the only factors that can alter the way your HTML email renders in your subscribers&#39; inboxes. Elements like the version of their email client, their operating system, their unique user settings, their security software, and whether or not they&#39;re automatically loading images can all impact how your email loads.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As you can probably guess by that hefty list of factors, trying to solve for all of them (every single time you send an email) would probably be enough to make you throw your computer across the room.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But you don&#39;t have to be completely helpless in the face of these variables — you just have to do a little pre-planning.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Consider creating a webpage version of your email.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This is kind of like giving your email a fail-safe button. If for some reason — due to one of the many factors discussed above — your lovingly designed email renders like an absolute mess when a subscriber opens it, they will at least have the option to click &quot;view as web page&quot; and see the email as you intended it to be.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since style elements render much more consistently across web browsers versus email clients, you&#39;ll be able to have way more control over the web page version of your message. In HubSpot, there&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/email/create-a-web-version-of-your-marketing-email?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/html-email&amp;amp;hubs_post-cta=an%20option&quot;>;an option&lt;/a>; you can turn on that will generate a web page version automatically.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Create a plain text version of your email.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A plain text version is exactly what it sounds like — an alternative version of your HTML email that renders in completely plain text. Adding a plain text version of your HTML email is important because some email clients and user settings can&#39;t (or choose not to) load HTML.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If this is the case, the client will look for a plain text alternative version of your HTML email to load for the user. If one doesn&#39;t exist, it could signal to the recipient&#39;s email server that your message is spam — or potentially dangerous.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most email tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/html-email&amp;amp;hubs_post-cta=HubSpot&quot;>;HubSpot&lt;/a>; will automatically provide a plain text version that displays if a recipient&#39;s email server requires it, but if you&#39;re coding an HTML email from scratch, you&#39;ll need to create something called &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/tylermakin/d820f65eb3c9dd98d58721c7fb1939a8&quot;>;a multipart MIME message&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A multipart MIME message is an email that contains both a plain text and HTML version of the same email. If a recipient&#39;s email client or security system doesn&#39;t allow HTML email, the plain text version will be displayed. This is a process that requires an advanced knowledge of coding, so we recommend working with a developer.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Make sure your email still makes sense if the images don&#39;t load.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Some users have automatic image-loading turned off, which means they&#39;ll see your email without images when they open it. For this reason, don&#39;t rely entirely on images to get the meaning of your message across, and always add &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/image-alt-text&quot;>;alt-text&lt;/a>; to the images you do include. Alt-text will load even when images don&#39;t, so your subscribers can get the general idea of what the visuals include.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Conduct thorough testing.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Finally, you&#39;ll need to test your HTML email at every stage of development to ensure it works across different email clients, operating systems, and device types. Don&#39;t wait until the very end of the process to test out your email — testing as you work is the best way to spot inconsistencies between different email clients and ensure you&#39;re creating the most consistent experience possible for your recipients.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some email tools (like HubSpot) offer in-app testing within their email builders to make the process easier. If you&#39;re working from scratch, you can use a tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.htmlemailcheck.com/&quot;>;HTML Email Check&lt;/a>; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://previewmyemail.com/&quot;>;PreviewMyEmail&lt;/a>; to get a better idea of how your email will look in different email clients and devices.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Simple and Free HTML Email Templates&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;There are an overwhelming amount of HTML email templates available on the web, and they vary in quality, responsiveness, and price.

It refers to an advanced technology that allows computer programs to understand, interpret, and respond to natural language inputs.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although AI chatbots are an application of conversational AI, not all chatbots are programmed with conversational AI. For instance, rule-based chatbots use simple rules and decision trees to understand and respond to user inputs. Unlike AI chatbots, rule-based chatbots are more limited in their capabilities because they rely on keywords and specific phrases to trigger canned responses.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Use Cases for AI Chatbots&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revechat.com/blog/what-is-a-chatbot/&quot;>;AI chatbots&lt;/a>; are used in a wide range of applications across many industries, helping businesses streamline operations and increase productivity, provide better user experiences, and improve customer service.

AI chatbots can handle multiple conversations simultaneously, reducing the need for manual intervention. This ensures faster response times and improves overall efficiency. Plus, they can handle a large volume of requests and scale effortlessly, accommodating your company&#39;s growth without compromising on customer support quality.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Data Gathering and Analysis&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;AI Chatbots can collect valuable customer data, such as preferences, pain points, and frequently asked questions. This data can be used to improve marketing strategies, enhance products or services, and make informed business decisions.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Lead Generation and Support&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;AI Chatbots can qualify leads, provide personalized experiences, and assist customers through every stage of their buyer journey.
