In spite of research warning customers of the dangers of cigarettes, Draper delivered the iconic slogan -- &quot;It&#39;s toasted&quot; -- to differentiate the brand from its competitors.&lt;/p>; &lt;iframe style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin: 0px auto;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/GALMX2BO5ps&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;p>;Now, we definitely aren&#39;t advocating for smoking cigarettes (or many of Draper&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thrillist.com/culture/how-long-would-don-draper-live-don-draper-mad-men-life-expectancy&quot;>;health choices&lt;/a>;). But fictional or not, you can&#39;t deny the memorability and catchiness of that tagline.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/blog-post-templates?hubs_post-cta=anchor&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/copywriting_2.webp?width=418&amp;amp;height=59&amp;amp;name=copywriting_2.webp&quot; alt=&quot;copywriting_2&quot; width=&quot;418&quot; height=&quot;59&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 418px;&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s easy to recognize good copywriting when you see it, but there are actually several characteristics that really separate outstanding writing from the rest of the pack. Want to know them? Read on below to find out.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;What is copywriting?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Copywriting is one of the most critical elements of any and all forms of marketing and advertising. Copywriting consists of the words, either written or spoken, marketers use to try to get people to take an action after reading or hearing them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Copywriting is like a call-to-action, but on a bigger scale: Copywriters are trying to get people to feel, think, or respond -- or, ideally, to Google the slogan or brand to learn more about the campaign. And where a blog post like this one has the luxury of hundreds of words with which to make a case, copywriters only have a few words to make their case.&lt;/p>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 560px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-content-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;&quot;>; &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p2HLmXvwpZ0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;But short and sweet isn&#39;t the only characteristic of good copywriting. Keep reading to learn more characteristics of truly memorable copy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;6 Traits of Good Copywriting&lt;/h2>; &lt;h3>;1) It tilts your perspective.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Sometimes, all a message needs to break through is a slight shift in angle. We&#39;ve grown so accustomed to blocking out marketing messages, we don&#39;t even see them anymore. One of the most powerful things a copywriter can do is break down a reader&#39;s guard with an unexpected approach. Every story has a myriad of angles -- your job as a copywriter is to find the one that resonates.&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/594ab5f61700002000102212.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=594ab5f61700002000102212.png&quot; alt=&quot;594ab5f61700002000102212.png&quot; title=&quot;594ab5f61700002000102212.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot;>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;>;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ppdsilencesucks.com/&quot;>;&lt;em>;Silence Sucks&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;This ad from Sage Therapeutics pressing the importance of talking about postpartum depression works because instead of asking readers to care about something they don&#39;t know, it puts them in the position of experiencing the struggle that mothers suffering do. Did they miss some readers who quickly passed by the ad thinking it was for adult pacifiers? Most definitely. But the ad resonated that much more thoroughly with those who read it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next time you sit down to write, try out this approach. Don&#39;t take the topic head on. Instead, ask yourself why it matters. Each time you write down an answer, challenge yourself to push it further. Find the larger story happening behind your message.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2) It finds connections.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In 1996, Steve Jobs let the cat out of the bag. He was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/wired/archive//4.02/jobs.html?person=steve_jobs&amp;amp;topic_set=wiredpeople&quot;>;speaking with a journalist from &lt;em>;Wired&lt;/em>; on the topic of creativity&lt;/a>; and explained:&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;>;&quot;Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something they feel a little guilty because they didn&#39;t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after awhile.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s say you have to write an ad for a new pair of sneakers. You could take the assignment head on. You could write about the elasticity of the shoe&#39;s sole or the lightweight design. Indeed, many have. Or you could put all of that aside and instead draw the connection between the product and the experience it evokes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img class=&quot;wt-blog__normal-image alignCenter shadow&quot; style=&quot;width: 503px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-398023691-png/Run_ad.png?width=503&amp;amp;name=Run_ad.png&quot; alt=&quot;Run_ad&quot; width=&quot;503&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;>;Source: &lt;em>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pinterest.com/pin/401242648028519555/&quot;>;Pinterest&lt;/a>;&lt;/em>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two things are happening in this ad. First, the copy recognizes that for many, running isn&#39;t about running at all -- it&#39;s about solitude, peace, and restoring sanity to an otherwise hectic life. Second, not only does Nike connect the ad to the experience of running, it actually connects to the sound that those shoes make as they hit the pavement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This ad is about the complexity of one&#39;s life fading away and being replaced by simplicity and clarity. As the copy progresses, the sentences simplify and the copy&#39;s complexity is slowly replaced by the simple and rhythmic pounding of words: run, run, run, run. The same rhythm one hears when all but their footsteps have faded away. &lt;em>;That&#39;s&lt;/em>;&amp;nbsp;connection.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3) It has a stunning lead.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The following are all headlines or leading sentences from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandaddy.com/home/bos&quot;>;Urban Daddy&lt;/a>;, an email-based magazine drawing attention to new products, experiences, and eateries.&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&quot;Six days. That&#39;s how long you have until 65% of your body is turkey.&quot;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&quot;There are 8,760 hours in a year. And just one hour in which a stand will be dispensing gratis latkes with homemade applesauce and sour cream in Harvard Square. Yeah, it&#39;s not fair. But 60 minutes is 60 minutes.&quot;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&quot;Ewoks. Talk about living.&quot;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;What&#39;s common among each of these leads? They make us want to read the next line. I mean, seriously, how much do you want to know &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandaddy.com/bos/leisure/13450/Tree_Spa_at_Hidden_Pond_Getting_Massaged_in_a_Maine_Treehouse_Boston_BOS_Service&quot;>;where that Ewok thing is headed&lt;/a>;?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s an adage in copywriting that&#39;s loosely credited to copywriter and business owner Joe Sugarman, which roughly states that the purpose of the headline is to get you to read the first line. The purpose of the first line is to get you to read the second line, and so on. In short, if your first line doesn&#39;t enthrall your readers, all is lost.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4) It is born out of listening.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Seeing its plans to launch yet another gym in the greater Boston region, an outsider might have called the Harrington family a wee bit crazy. The market was already flush with gyms, including a new breed of luxury ones that seemed to be in an arms war for the flashiest perks. Gyms across the region were offering massage services, smoothie bars, and fleets of personal trainers. And GymIt wouldn&#39;t have any of that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What did &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gymit.com/about/&quot;>;GymIt&lt;/a>; have? An understanding of its core audience. Before launching its new gym, the brand did a ton of listening to its primary market of gym-goers. For many in GymIt&#39;s target market, the added benefits associated with luxury gyms were nice to have, but came with a lot of baggage -- namely expensive rates and overly complex contracts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;GymIt decided to simplify the gym-going experience for people who predominately cared about getting in and working out. The copy in its launch campaign and across its marketing materials reflects that understanding.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img class=&quot;wt-blog__normal-image alignCenter shadow&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-397765571-png/GymIt__gyms_in_Boston_ma__health_clubs.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=GymIt__gyms_in_Boston_ma__health_clubs.png&quot; alt=&quot;GymIt__gyms_in_Boston_ma__health_clubs&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; title=&quot;GymIt__gyms_in_Boston_ma__health_clubs&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyblogger.com/listen-carefully/&quot;>;an older blog post&lt;/a>;, &lt;em>;Copyblogger&lt;/em>;&#39;s Robert Bruce put this nicely. &quot;Humble yourself and truly serve your audience, listen to their needs and desires, listen to the language they use,&quot; he said. &quot;If you listen carefully, your audience can eventually give you everything you need, including much of your copy.

Industry-wide best practices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Have I lost you yet?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When writers struggle to convey what is truly special about their company, product, or service, they sometimes fall back on jargon or hyperbole to underscore their point. The truth is, good copywriting doesn&#39;t need dressing up. Good copywriting should speak to the reader in human terms.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This isn&#39;t to say you should never celebrate awards or achievements. Just be direct in the way you &lt;em>;explain&lt;/em>; that achievement.

By knowing the audience, a copywriter can tailor their messaging, tone, and language to resonate with the intended readers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it&#39;s a sales copy or a blog post, addressing the audience&#39;s needs, pain points, and desires makes the copy more relevant, relatable, and engaging. It enables the writer to convey the value of a product or service in a way that truly speaks to the audience, fostering a connection and increasing the chances of achieving the desired outcome.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;7) It uses compelling headlines.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screenshot%202023-08-20%20at%2010.27.48%20PM.png?width=1400&amp;amp;height=460&amp;amp;name=Screenshot%202023-08-20%20at%2010.27.48%20PM.png&quot; width=&quot;1400&quot; height=&quot;460&quot; alt=&quot;NPR headline&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 1400px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2023/08/17/1193790447/new-podcasts&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;>;Source&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your content can be excellent, but if you don&#39;t get people to read it in the first place, it&#39;s a waste. Good copywriting incorporates attention-grabbing headlines because they serve as the first impression and the gateway to the rest of the content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A well-crafted headline like the one shown above from NPR grabs attention, sparks curiosity, and entices readers to continue reading. It sets the tone for the entire piece and plays a crucial role in capturing the audience&#39;s interest in a crowded online landscape. A compelling headline communicates the value and benefits of the content, making readers eager to dive deeper.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Without an attention-grabbing headline, even the best-written copy may go unnoticed. By crafting strong headlines, copywriters can increase click-through rates, engage readers, and maximize the impact of their content.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;8) It is well-researched.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screenshot%202023-08-20%20at%2010.45.30%20PM.png?width=1700&amp;amp;height=1210&amp;amp;name=Screenshot%202023-08-20%20at%2010.45.30%20PM.png&quot; width=&quot;1700&quot; height=&quot;1210&quot; alt=&quot;NYT&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 1700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/10/science/titan-submersible-map-titanic.html&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;>;A map from The New York Times shows how research can enhance writing.&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Good copywriting is well-researched because it is important to have accurate and up-to-date information in order to create compelling and persuasive content.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Research allows copywriters to understand their target audience, industry trends, and competitors. It helps to identify the pain points and needs of potential customers, enabling the writer to address them effectively. Thorough research also ensures that any claims made in the copy are backed by solid evidence, increasing credibility and building trust with the audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By investing time in research, copywriters can provide valuable insights, create content that resonates, and ultimately drive desired actions from their readers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;9) It uses formatting to its advantage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screenshot%202023-08-20%20at%2010.50.57%20PM.png?width=1490&amp;amp;height=580&amp;amp;name=Screenshot%202023-08-20%20at%2010.50.57%20PM.png&quot; width=&quot;1490&quot; height=&quot;580&quot; alt=&quot;HubSpot blog&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 1490px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/collaborate-across-departments&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;>;This HubSpot blog post uses a table of contents&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Formatted pieces are far easier to read than blocks of text. By incorporating elements such as a table of contents, subheadings, bullet points, bold or italicized text, block quotes, and whitespace, copywriters can break up the content into easily scannable and digestible chunks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Formatting helps readers navigate through the copy quickly, find key information or main points, and understand the structure of the content at a glance. It also draws attention to important details or calls-to-action, making them more noticeable and compelling. Well-formatted copy keeps readers engaged, reduces cognitive load, and ensures that the message is effectively communicated to the audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;10) It flows naturally.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When copywriting flows naturally, it feels effortless and easy to consume. The sentences and paragraphs flow smoothly from one to another, guiding the reader along a logical and coherent path.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This flow is achieved through the use of concise and clear language, proper sentence structure, and effective transitions. A natural flow eliminates any stumbling blocks that could distract or confuse the reader, allowing them to focus on the message being conveyed. It enhances comprehension, engagement, and ultimately, the effectiveness of the copy in achieving its intended purpose.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;11) It has a strong voice.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screenshot%202023-08-20%20at%2010.01.57%20PM.png?width=1420&amp;amp;height=240&amp;amp;name=Screenshot%202023-08-20%20at%2010.01.57%20PM.png&quot; width=&quot;1420&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2023-08-20 at 10.01.57 PM&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 1420px;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 12px; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/mobile-friendly-test&quot;>;An example from the HubSpot blog&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A strong voice reflects the brand&#39;s personality, values, and identity, allowing it to stand out in a crowded market.

They can suggest improvements, highlight potential errors, and offer alternative word choices to optimize the content. These tools can also recommend relevant keywords and help ensure that the copy aligns with SEO best practices, improving its visibility and search engine ranking.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;By leveraging AI tools, copywriters can save time, enhance their writing skills, and produce high-quality content that resonates with the audience and achieves the desired results.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;13) It is creative.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screenshot%202023-08-20%20at%2011.01.29%20PM.png?width=1080&amp;amp;height=520&amp;amp;name=Screenshot%202023-08-20%20at%2011.01.29%20PM.png&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;520&quot; alt=&quot;Omsom&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 1080px;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://omsom.com/pages/meet-us&quot;>;Source&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even the driest topics can be made interesting with creative copywriting. Interesting topics could also use more spice. Creativity allows copywriters to come up with unique and compelling angles, ideas, and storytelling techniques that make the copy stand out. Creative copywriting involves finding fresh and unexpected ways to communicate a message, evoke emotions, and inspire action. It involves using imaginative language, clever wordplay, and visually appealing imagery to captivate readers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ultimately, creative copywriting helps brands differentiate themselves, leave a lasting impression, and build a strong connection with their audience.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;14) It ends strong.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 12px; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screenshot%202023-08-20%20at%2010.54.38%20PM.png?width=1460&amp;amp;height=890&amp;amp;name=Screenshot%202023-08-20%20at%2010.54.38%20PM.png&quot; width=&quot;1460&quot; height=&quot;890&quot; alt=&quot;HubSpot blog&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 1460px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/list-building&quot;>;An example of a conclusion from a HubSpot blog&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Imagine watching You can have a superbly well written post but if it doesn&#39;t have a good ending, what&#39;s the point?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Good copywriting has strong endings because they leave a lasting impact on the reader and reinforce the key message or call-to-action. A strong ending summarizes the main points, highlights the benefits, and creates a sense of urgency or excitement to entice the reader to take action. It provides closure and a sense of satisfaction, leaving the reader feeling fulfilled and motivated. A strong ending can also include a compelling closing statement, a memorable tagline, or a thought-provoking question to spark further engagement or conversation.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;15) It cuts out excess.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Good writing gets to the point -- and that means cutting out excessive phrases, and rewording your sentences to be more direct.

It&#39;s half practice, half knowing where to cut. This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailywritingtips.com/10-techniques-for-more-precise-writing/&quot;>;article from &lt;em>;Daily Writing Tips&lt;/em>;&lt;/a>; is one of the most effective summaries I&#39;ve found on precise writing. Included in its tips:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Reduce verb phrases:&lt;/strong>; For instance, turn &quot;The results are suggestive of the fact that&quot; to &quot;The results suggest.&quot;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Reduce wordy phrases to single words:&lt;/strong>; You can change &quot;in order to&quot; into &quot;to.&quot; Another example: Turn &quot;Due to the fact that&quot; into &quot;because.&quot;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Avoid vague nouns:&lt;/strong>; Phrases formed around general nouns like &quot;in the area of&quot; or &quot;on the topic of&quot; clutter sentences.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailywritingtips.com/10-techniques-for-more-precise-writing/&quot;>;Read the full list of brevity tips here&lt;/a>;.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;In general, if you can afford to cut without losing the meaning of a sentence, do so. Push yourself to strip down your word count. Turn 50-word homepage copy into 25, then push yourself again to make that 25-word sentence into 15 words. It&#39;s not about brevity so much as it is about making sure every word counts in your writing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since my last point was about getting to the point, I&#39;ll keep this brief: &lt;em>;Words matter&lt;/em>;. Every time you sit down to write an ad, web page, video script, or other content for your company, you have the opportunity to break through to people. Find those opportunities in your marketing and make sure that you&#39;ve made the most of them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Editor&#39;s note: This post was originally published in November 2017 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/blog-post-templates?hubs_post-cta=bottom&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/copywriting_1.webp?width=646&amp;amp;height=226&amp;amp;name=copywriting_1.webp&quot; alt=&quot;copywriting_1&quot; width=&quot;646&quot; height=&quot;226&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 646px;&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;a class=&quot;close&quot; href=&quot;https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/53/544ec352-b131-458a-944d-20a70edea831&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/copywriting_0.webp?width=400&amp;amp;height=178&amp;amp;name=copywriting_0.webp&quot; alt=&quot;copywriting_0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;178&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 400px;&quot;>;&lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;amp;k=14&amp;amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fgood-copywriting-practices-list&amp;amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;amp;bvt=rss&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; &quot;>;</content:encoded><category> Copywriting</category><pubDate> Mon, 04 Sep 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><author> manderson@hubspot.com (Meghan Keaney Anderson)</author><guid> https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/good-copywriting-practices-list</guid><dc:date> 2023-09-04T11:00:00Z</dc:date></item><item><title> How to Write a Marketing Email: 10 Tips for Writing Compelling Email Copy</title><link/> https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32606/the-9-must-have-components-of-compelling-email-copy.aspx<description> &lt;div class=&quot;hs-featured-image-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32606/the-9-must-have-components-of-compelling-email-copy.aspx&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;hs-featured-image-link&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Untitled%20design%20%2840%29.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A blue email notification appears on a laptop screen; How to write a marketing email&quot; class=&quot;hs-featured-image&quot; style=&quot;width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;&quot;>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32606/the-9-must-have-components-of-compelling-email-copy.aspx&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=Email%20marketing&amp;amp;hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32606/the-9-must-have-components-of-compelling-email-copy.aspx&amp;amp;hubs_post-cta=Email%20marketing&amp;amp;_ga=2.4613749.738617674.1680521706-132984722.1680521706&amp;amp;_gl=1*u2l6eg*_ga*MTYzNDAyNDI5MS4xNjgwNTIxOTQx*_ga_LXTM6CQ0XK*MTY4MDUyMTk0MC4xLjAuMTY4MDUyMTk0MC4wLjAuMA..&quot;>;Email marketing&lt;/a>; has come a long way in the past few years.

Use actionable language.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;With email subject lines, using actionable language doesn&#39;t necessarily mean using verbs, although it certainly helps. OpenTable, for example, sent me an email that said “Take Mom to Brunch” in the subject line.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is one way to use actionable language effectively in email subject lines: by incorporating a verb (like “take,” “download,” “reserve,” “ask,” “buy,” etc.), the reader knows exactly what they can do in the email.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But there are ways to use actionable language without relying on verbs, which gives you more room to play around with wording.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It comes down to using language that makes it clear to the recipient what they can do with the information in the email, should they choose to open it. In other words, keep the value for the user top-of-mind.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, I once got an email from TicketMaster with the subject line “Don&#39;t Miss Taylor Swift&#39;s Eras Tour.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They didn&#39;t order me to purchase tickets by saying, “Purchase Tickets Tomorrow for Taylor Swift,” though such a subject line may have performed just as well.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original subject line worked well because it was clear what I could do with the information in that email — ensure I&#39;m prepared for the 10:00 am sale time so I could snag my tickets. (Which I tried to, thanks to the email!)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;2. Personalize when possible.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Highly segmented emails tend to have higher performance levels — such as open rate and clickthrough rate — than emails that aren&#39;t personalized.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://instapage.com/blog/personalization-statistics#:~:text=Segmented%20personalized%20automated%20email%20messages%20average%2046%25%20higher%20open%20rates%20than%20normal%20marketing%20messages.&quot;>;study&lt;/a>;, segmented personalized automated email messages average 46% higher open rates than standard marketing messages, and segmented, targeted, and personalized emails generate 58% of all revenue.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This isn&#39;t exactly surprising. After all, the more segmented your email list, the better you can personalize the subject line and provide relevant content to each email recipient.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So ask yourself: Can you make your email subject line more personal? And I&#39;m not talking about the dynamic field where you insert someone&#39;s [FIRSTNAME] — email recipients stopped being impressed by that fancy functionality some time ago.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consider this scenario instead: You&#39;re a realtor with a huge database of clients:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Some of them are looking to rent, while others prefer to buy.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Their ideal location ranges across several cities and zip codes.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;They all have different price points with which they&#39;re comfortable.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Some are looking for a studio, while others want a mansion.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;You even know that a group of them will only accept homes that have been renovated in the past five years.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;You wouldn&#39;t do a blanket email send across all of these different segments of your list, would you? And your email subject line wouldn&#39;t be the same, either.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You might have one subject line that says, “Renovated 1BR Apartment for Rent in Cambridge: Schedule a Viewing,” and another that says, “RSVP: Open House Sunday for Colonial House in Sudbury.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Each subject line speaks to the radically different needs of two different list segments and serves a different purpose.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re struggling with personalizing emails or looking to save time, HubSpot boasts a range of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email&quot;>;email marketing tools&lt;/a>; to help you create, personalize, and optimize your emails.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/campaign-assistant&quot;>;campaign assistant&lt;/a>; can generate marketing emails to quickly and effectively reach your consumers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;3. Prioritize clarity, and only then think about &quot;catchiness.”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Write a subject line that is clear first and catchy second. In marketing copy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/write-with-clarity-tips&quot;>;clarity should always, always, always be your first priority&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If, after you&#39;ve drafted a clear subject line, you can also make it catchy, funny, cute, whimsical, or whatever, then go for it. But never sacrifice clarity for entertainment value, especially when consumers can unsubscribe anytime.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandaddy.com/&quot;>;UrbanDaddy&lt;/a>; is an example of a company that excels at writing subject lines that are always clear — and sometimes also catchy, funny, or entertaining.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take a look at the subject lines of some of the emails I&#39;ve received from them:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;UD | A Hotel in the Middle of the Ocean&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;UD | Nunchucks. Made from Beer Cans. Finally.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;UD | Getting Everyone Together: Now Less Obnoxious&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;UD | A Grill the Size of a Foosball Table&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;UD | It&#39;s Ice Cream. It&#39;s Beer. It&#39;s Beer Ice Cream.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;UD | Here&#39;s a Private Bahamian Island. Do Your Thing.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Some of these subject lines either make the recipients chuckle or are bizarre enough to pique your interest. But it&#39;s always extremely clear what you will get when you open the email.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This brings us to our next point.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;4. Align your subject line copy and email copy.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;You might already know how crucial it is for your &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-examples&quot;>;call-to-action (CTA) copy&lt;/a>; and your landing page offer to align. Well, it&#39;s no different when crafting your email subject line and email message.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fimprove-your-email-subject-line&amp;amp;hubs_post-cta=47%25%20of%20marketers&amp;amp;_ga=2.56250029.722567966.1680526302-1130793573.1680526302&amp;amp;_gl=1*qlh12u*_ga*MTEzMDc5MzU3My4xNjgwNTI2MzAy*_ga_LXTM6CQ0XK*MTY4MDUyNjMwMS4xLjAuMTY4MDUyNjMwMS4wLjAuMA..&quot;>;47% of marketers&lt;/a>; say they test different email subject lines to optimize their emails&#39; performance. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important to craft subject lines that are compelling enough to get people to click through.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This also means that what your email subject line promises, the email message should deliver.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s not just because it&#39;s responsible — it&#39;s also because when readers don&#39;t get what they&#39;re actually promised in the subject line, click-through rates plummet.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(And, in the long term, so will your email open rates.) A high email open rate means nothing without any click-throughs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;How to Write an Email&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Now that you&#39;ve crafted a stellar email subject line, you have your audience&#39;s full attention on the body of your email message. So, how do you craft copy that will get them clicking? Here are the essential components you need to know!&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;5. Establish relevance.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Just like the email subject line should strive to establish relevance through personalization, so should the copy in the email&#39;s message.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Again, it takes more than just a dynamic name tag for your email copy to convince readers that what&#39;s inside is relevant to them. So use the very beginning of the email to explain how you know each other.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Below is an example of an email sent by 1-800-Contacts to a colleague of mine.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(By the way, the subject line was informative: “Get your contacts ordered before the weekend.”)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/68TS6XhQVuZecBViBBtxzGHZ3HFP4pIPSUKtmMsTZjY_oOGyKvCN8_8kIe7yxMwWsH4HuE4hKtcWGD_ANc5aMCMnNxsTmxPWfaJdGB_Y2xml7tNAmpE3OwBws7rXx-Gu9ZoViT4IOCX-eviJqlTYHsQ&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take a look at that first paragraph.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Right off the bat, the marketers at 1-800-Contacts tell the reader why they&#39;re being emailed (their contacts can come this weekend) and that this email is meant to help them order new contacts before probably a fun-filled weekend.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Imagine if this email didn&#39;t have that first paragraph and started instead with the line “See the weekend,” which is clever in context.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are you emailing me about the weekend? Why would I want your advice?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By reminding the recipient that they gave 1-800-Contacts their information in the past, there&#39;s a greater likelihood that that person will click through and redeem the offer in this email.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;6. Write in the second person.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Writing in the second person means using the pronouns “you,” “your,” and “yours.“ For example, ”Before you leave in the morning, remember to bring your jacket.&quot; It means you orient the copy towards the reader, not yourself.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take a look at the copy in this email from Zappos, for example: Now, count how many times this email says “You” instead of “we” or “I.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Okay, okay, we won&#39;t make you count: The words &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot; appear 12 times, while &quot;we,&quot; &quot;our,&quot; and &quot;we&#39;re&quot; appear only five times.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vf3g8dEr1hKEyeH5kMH6kvmeYUrlr-O-uiRDcU_sGnEQofXeIij6O75CXbohu3ZVbqVHxTBn6ctGNLRh3-G5y0gWeGgJTPNS-0k1A_Gsovty3dvrqmCL1abTUEjsHiWJg1X3g30unGorSpMF57fNDsg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;sa nice balance of second-person language that keeps the focus on the customer, not the brand. This subtle tactic helps you stay value-oriented, but this next step I&#39;m about to cover is crucial to hitting the point home.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;7. Talk about benefits, not features.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;You know the value of your email. But does your recipient? No, not yet. And it&#39;s your job to explain it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem is many emails only explain the feature they are offering, not the benefit. Look at the copy in two separate ecommerce emails I received.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Which one is touting the feature, and which is touting the benefit?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/CMUPOiuME3lmdf4ej6-TxCujZDM45xNjLRE-Z_m4EvxGu7yZBMx1suYVjsKio1DeJ94DShgIc44Yn1-2-WA0rRqoggs9N-vHpSqjZxCPWSl3rWEZLzf7nN7NYjtq0Sh2lrFNI0y1Js7_M1gBgoHj-qg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/koPrODlGCdVGSDgDAsFgml1gz_YEcLzV2-dUvjcrLyPDY-WiSAjaIIReTgtYYeMC9aQxE2T9-NtNQKyrfk5jJLgNEJUcYQcnCp2FBewD8_0PIimjor_isKpGgHAQbxW8M9M475Ocx44VDxNGRzeJmdk&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you guessed email B for benefit, you&#39;re right.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Email A throws a 30% off discount directly in your face but doesn&#39;t explain the value behind it. What does 30% off a GoDaddy product do for my goals?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Will it let me adjust a small business&#39; expenditures on infrastructure costs, freeing up money for a new hire? That benefit is far more tangible than 30% off an undisclosed cost.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compare that with Email B from Banana Republic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This email aims to sell shorts, but the copy isn&#39;t just shoving shorts down the recipient&#39;s throat. I mean, they&#39;re shorts — big deal, right? They&#39;ve identified what makes these shorts worthwhile: their versatility.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They allow a man to lounge around the house and then go out in the city while putting minimal effort into changing his outfit. How convenient! How easy! How versatile!&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The copy translates the benefit of buying those shorts, but the copy (or lack thereof) in GoDaddy&#39;s email doesn&#39;t explain the use of redeeming a generic 30% off offer.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;8. Be brief.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;One of the worst mistakes email copywriters make is trying to shove the entire story into the email message.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think about when you open a marketing email in your inbox. Do you read every single word in there? Probably not.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s more likely that you scan for important points to glean the overall message and decide whether you want to take any action.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think about why you open an email. You&#39;re not looking to read the next great American novel — you want to understand the point, the promo, and the CTA.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So if you&#39;re sending an email with hundreds of words of copy, you&#39;re making it more difficult for recipients to decide whether they want to click through — simply because they can&#39;t quickly sift through all of the information in your email.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instead, find a way to summarize what the reader will get compellingly, and let them click through to a page on your website for more information. Utilizing AI, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/ai-email-writer&quot;>;HubSpot&#39;s AI Email Writer&lt;/a>;, can assist in formatting concise yet engaging content that will keep your readers fully engaged.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take a look at how the folks over at Postmates drafted a brief email encouraging readers to click through for a limited-time offer:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NY9__Jzlgmp1QM9l2_zbgNor1YQ52le5ZoNTD6ooiKxO4vB4MyHnrTDKko69itMm8Ux0ekSxz7pFrRUfJiYebuoAe8PZuAx_ICvBRIeNVU9pWPySg7r55HKuawcDIehDYzssFE8sveMPUtImrIOPOqE&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Postmates doesn&#39;t wait to get to the point. After a brief, friendly hello, they get right down to the purpose of the email: telling customers about their new “free lattes on-demand” promotion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After introducing the concept, they offer some essential details, then get right to the CTA.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Keeping your message on point is the key to writing a brief email copy. What&#39;s the point you&#39;re trying to make with your email?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you know the action your email is supposed to drive — recipient orders free lattes on-demand, recipient remembers to buy their Taylor Swift tickets, the recipient gets motivated to work out — then you&#39;ll have a much easier time drafting succinct email copy that remains focused on that one end goal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If writing succinct email copy isn&#39;t enough of a motivator for you to narrow down your goals, remember that having just one primary CTA in your email marketing results in better click-through rates than emails with competing CTAs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;9. Be lovable.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Just because emails are meant to inform doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t also delight. In some cases, email can be a great avenue for letting your brand&#39;s personality shine, helping you build a meaningful relationship with the folks on your email lists.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After all, providing a lovable experience for people begins and ends with how you communicate with them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Check out the example below from the folks over at Death to Stock Photos.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The point of the email is to apologize for an email they&#39;d sent the previous day, which promoted a product that sold out way too quickly, didn&#39;t ship internationally, and generally gave many of their customers a poor experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NnyF9cHxfxLhskqJ2QQWpTk_C4eFo0fYveOCkiUDIQ-GUn2kbOijrdJPlcfj_vpCji7CLsvs9cnbPBaL2NY5VNIDT4PsJ4a3gpn3n4QnRWSAypzgLezoX2yz8JH8CC39Jt1_1lGtShRY3Z6ETEIfS9U&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/by2oCwiy5Pskews4BG7ptHCANl7w181HLYn7sF1tvbKbs2ow4mf0974JeLvbwzxR8g3JSxMjkGLfIoc-jN9KhiGCo7qtUubFqK5utLMv9emw-zZLq_NkDnNmphXEHzJ5WS9eWqrH78YjqPw84Djhp0g&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WOzoxs3V6fUTBAevCq59CRr5ovZux17Cuj29JM6qJpunh8To_MLhDeij6AvxAcShEObajPPPxtbUZ8vJ99IP7QP5LIow-KZ7IvhytQetDD5cx6c3zKj_yMxtufRXsaN-TFUbIjGh087Rome8-hw2h4c&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Notice the part of the email that&#39;s called out in red.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using concise, personable language, they explain what happened, apologize for the mistake, say what they learned from it and how they&#39;ll prevent it from happening in the future, and give the recipient several options for following up.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The format of this portion of the email is optimized for the large number of recipients who are likely skimming the email. The bold text and one-sentence paragraphs make it easy to follow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, they aren&#39;t afraid to add some personality using phrases like “Give us a wavvveeee” to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/humanizing-your-brand?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F32606%2Fthe-9-must-have-components-of-compelling-email-copy.aspx&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=humanize%20their%20brand&quot;>;humanize their brand&lt;/a>;.结果？ Recipients are probably much more open to forgiving them for the honest mistake.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;10. Use actionable language in your call-to-action.&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s right: Emails have calls-to-action, too. Well, the good ones do. First and foremost, your email CTA should be extremely easy to identify.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remember: People scan their emails. If there&#39;s one thing you want your recipient to pick up on, it&#39;s your CTA.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re sending an HTML email, you may decide to include a button, like this HeyDay email did below.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8Freh3x-HVkZze0I4aVti1iVVwhw27jxI49K_6cZLoC-dPW4VQHKG2Do-hkLmpf4RzoJfgjrLBMglbHQPOvNzxFrXhufjUhYzGTaavXgw8FziSBke71Nj0wDZFJKoQqcmMjA3Xin3URtJHgPQSIAxL4&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two qualities make this CTA button effective:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Great design:&lt;/strong>; First, notice how the large, dark gray button stands out from the beige design; that CTA certainly isn&#39;t hard to find.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Great copy: &lt;/strong>;The copy on the button is just as important. Your CTA button should include language that is succinct, clear, and action-oriented. This HeyDay button tells you in very few words what you can do using verbs — you can &lt;strong>;sign up&lt;/strong>; and &lt;strong>;save $20&lt;/strong>;.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;But it&#39;s also crucial to spend some time optimizing your plain-text emails for clear CTAs.

If you&#39;re struggling to merge cells, try these troubleshooting tips.&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;Ensure you&#39;re not actively editing a cell you want to merge. The &#39;Merge&#39; icon will be shaded out if you&#39;re in the middle of making changes. To fix this, simply hit &#39;Enter&#39; to stop editing or click onto another cell before clicking back to the cell you&#39;d like to merge.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;Check if one of the cells is part of an Excel table. Tables have a unique format that don&#39;t allow merging. You can tell you&#39;re on a Table if the &#39;Chart Design&#39; or &#39;Format&#39; tabs across the top of your workbook are highlighted in green and the &#39;Merge&#39; icon is shaded out.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;Look at the sharing permissions of the Excel workbook. If it&#39;s not shared with you or is protected, you won&#39;t be able to make any changes or merge cells.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;h2>;How to Unmerge Cells&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Maybe you got a little excited trying out your new skills and merged one cell too many. Don&#39;t panic. Simply unmerge your cells by following these steps.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unmerge%20cells.jpg?width=650&amp;amp;height=360&amp;amp;name=unmerge%20cells.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;unmerge cells&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/merge-and-unmerge-cells-5cbd15d5-9375-4540-907f-c673a93fcedf&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;>;Image Source&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;Highlight the cells you want to unmerge.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Under the &lt;strong>;Home&lt;/strong>; tab, click the &#39;Merge&#39; icon and choose &#39;Unmerge Cells.&#39;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Your cells will go back to the original formatting, but you will have lost the information from before the merge.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;If you need that information, click &#39;Command&#39; + Z (OS) or &#39;CTRL&#39; +Z (Windows) to undo your actions until you see the data pop up.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;h2>;Excel Shortcuts Make Life Easier&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;While using spreadsheets can feel intimidating at first, with the tips and shortcuts above, you&#39;ll have it down in no time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Editor&#39;s note: This article was originally published in May 2021 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a class=&quot;cta_button&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=7912de6f-792e-4100-8215-1f2bf712a3e5&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid=&amp;amp;hseid=&amp;amp;hsic=&quot;>;&lt;img class=&quot;hs-cta-img &quot; style=&quot;height: auto !important; width: auto !important; max-width: 100% !important;border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; &quot; alt=&quot;excel marketing templates&quot; height=&quot;226&quot; width=&quot;646&quot; src=&quot;https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/7912de6f-792e-4100-8215-1f2bf712a3e5.png&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;amp;k=14&amp;amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmerge-cells-excel&amp;amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;amp;bvt=rss&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; &quot;>;</content:encoded><category> Excel</category><pubDate> Fri, 01 Sep 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid> https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/merge-cells-excel</guid><dc:date> 2023-09-01T11:00:00Z</dc:date><dc:creator> Katrina Kirsch</dc:creator></item><item><title> What Is YouTube CPM?

As a creator, this means you have numerous opportunities to earn money. Understanding YouTube CPM is key to unlocking its potential.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;CPM, Cost per 1,000 Impressions, is a vital metric that determines how much advertisers pay to reach viewers through your videos.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s commonly used across various paid media platforms to describe the advertising expenditure per 1,000 individuals reached by the ad.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a class=&quot;cta_button&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b33cfd44-133a-49e3-a943-086c5679d485&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid=&amp;amp;hseid=&amp;amp;hsic=&quot;>;&lt;img class=&quot;hs-cta-img &quot; style=&quot;height: auto !important; width: auto !important; max-width: 100% !important;border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px&quot; alt=&quot;→ Free Templates: How to Use YouTube for Business [Download Now]&quot; height=&quot;59&quot; width=&quot;625&quot; src=&quot;https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b33cfd44-133a-49e3-a943-086c5679d485.png&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By maximizing your YouTube CPM, you increase your earnings and demonstrate the value of your content. In this article, we&#39;ll explore what CPM is, how it&#39;s calculated, what makes a “good CPM,” and more.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Table of Contents&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;#what-how&quot;>;What is CPM, and how is it calculated?&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;#why&quot;>;Why is CPM important?&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;#average&quot;>;The Average CPM on YouTube&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;#highest&quot;>;The Highest CPM on Youtube&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;What is CPM, and how is it calculated?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;CPM, or cost per 1,000 impressions, is the cost an advertiser needs to pay on YouTube for every 1,000 impressions their ads receive on your video.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;CPM varies depending on how much an advertiser pays to display the ad. Advertising costs on YouTube depend on a range of factors, including bidding price, ad type, and consistency.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To calculate CPM, divide the amount the advertiser paid for an ad by the number of views a video has. Then, multiply by 1,000.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/cpm-formula.webp&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, let&#39;s assume an advertiser is paying $9 for an ad seen 5,000 times on your video. To calculate CPM, you&#39;d divide nine by 5,000 = $0.0018, then multiply $0.0018 by 1,000.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This gives you a CPM of $1.80. YouTube takes 45% of your CPM, meaning you&#39;ll receive 55% of that $1.80. So, if you make $1.80 CPM off an ad, you&#39;ll only keep $0.99.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Additionally, there&#39;s another type of CPM: playback-based CPM.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rather than calculating the cost the advertiser pays for 1,000 impressions, playback-based CPM calculates the cost an advertiser pays for 1,000 video playbacks where an ad is displayed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are free calculators available online if you don&#39;t want to calculate your CPM manually.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And while individual videos&#39; CPMs might seem small (like the $0.99 made above), it can add up to a hefty monthly earning if plenty of businesses see your videos as consistently worthwhile platforms for their promotions.&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;Why is CPM important?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As a YouTube creator, CPM is an important metric for analyzing which of your videos are most valuable to advertisers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since advertising is the primary method for monetization on YouTube, it&#39;s essential to understand how CPM works to ensure you&#39;re maximizing revenue.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To make a full-time career out of YouTube, it&#39;s critical to know which videos can be monetized so you can create a more efficient, long-term strategy to target those types of topics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, perhaps you create YouTube videos for beauty, health, and wellness. But you find “Drugstore Makeup Tutorials” receive the highest CPMs. This suggests you should make more content that aligns with that topic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the best ways to increase your CPM is to make your channel an ideal space for advertisers to place their ads.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/data-and-measurement/video-advertising-roi-on-youtube/&quot;>;YouTube research&lt;/a>; has found that ad exposure (ensuring their ads reach people multiple times per week) significantly improves advertising ROI.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Advertisers consistently placing ads on your videos benefits them, earning you higher CPM and increased revenue.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Additionally, if you find one business in particular consistently advertises on your videos.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the brand aligns with your values, you might reach out directly to discuss other YouTube monetization opportunities, like affiliate marketing or brand partnerships.&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;The Average CPM on YouTube&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;CPM varies &lt;em>;greatly&lt;/em>; depending on how much an advertiser pays to distribute an ad on your video.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let&#39;s say an advertiser pays $10 for an ad that plays on your video with 1,000 views. If that&#39;s the case, you&#39;d make $10 CPM (10/1,000 x 1,000). Of course, you&#39;ll need to take 45% off that total — making your earnings around $5.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in most cases, the videos on which businesses choose to advertise will have more than 1,000 views, making your earnings closer to $7-$10.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jillian Hope, HubSpot&#39;s Senior Manager of Brand Advertising, agrees, telling me her team typically sees an average of $7 to $10 from past campaigns.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s important to note that CPM is just one metric that you can use to analyze and improve your YouTube performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, YouTube analytics provide metrics like &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9314357?hl=en&quot;>;revenue per mille (RPM)&lt;/a>;, which shows how much you&#39;re earning per 1,000 video views across multiple revenue sources.&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;The Highest CPM on YouTube&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The highest CPM varies by country, but here&#39;s a list of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecocnn.com/highest-youtube-cpm-country/&quot;>;five highest YouTube CPM rates by country from 2022-2023&lt;/a>;:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Norway:&lt;/strong>; $43.15&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Germany:&lt;/strong>; $38.85&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Moldova:&lt;/strong>; $29.50&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;Algeria:&lt;/strong>; $24.50&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;South Korea: &lt;/strong>;$17.00&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Higher CPM rates also relate to the content of your videos. Some categories earn higher CPMs than others. Some popular content niches on YouTube that earn high CPMs include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Makeup&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Retail&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Health&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Finance&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Technology&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;But video topics aren&#39;t the only factor that can make your CPM fluctuate. Many creators report peaks and troughs in their CPM throughout the year.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, seasonal shopping around the holidays throughout November and December can temporarily drive up YouTube earnings in certain niches.&lt;/p>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;&quot;>; &lt;iframe class=&quot;hs-responsive-embed-iframe&quot; style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_3KTntZBcf4?si=zsnY02J-E6Ot297U&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;h2>;Getting Started&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As a creator, you should use CPM as a metric to help you identify which topics seem most valuable to advertisers, as those topics likely provide the most opportunity for monetization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rather than looking for “quick tricks” to increase your CPM, however, you&#39;ll want to play the long game by creating a comprehensive YouTube strategy that helps you increase sales, reach new audiences, and grow brand awareness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a class=&quot;cta_button&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=7e8681b3-9162-45a4-b6a1-f33ff244a78a&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid=&amp;amp;hseid=&amp;amp;hsic=&quot;>;&lt;img class=&quot;hs-cta-img &quot; style=&quot;height: auto !important; width: auto !important; max-width: 100% !important;border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px&quot; alt=&quot;Featured Resource, YouTube for Business Kit: 18 Free YouTube Templates, 18 design, planning, and video description templates for YouTube.

As soon as you&#39;ve uploaded a video, it&#39;s automatically transcribed and ready to be distributed anywhere you want your video to be seen.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wistia&#39;s recommended upload settings for video are:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;MP4 file&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;H.264 codec&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;5,000–8,000 kbps target bitrate&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Want to make the process even easier? You can seamlessly import videos straight from Descript, Zoom, and YouTube. These are just a few &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/integrations&quot;>;Wistia integrations&lt;/a>; that can help make your video workflow a breeze.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Create Videos in Wistia&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Don&#39;t have any videos to upload? No problem! You can create videos right in Wistia. Here are some of the things you can do:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Create short tutorials, video voicemails, or other talking head videos using Wistia&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/soapbox&quot;>;screen and webcam recording feature&lt;/a>;.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Make simple edits to your videos with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/product/video-trimmer&quot;>;Wistia&#39;s video editor&lt;/a>;: Trim out unnecessary parts, create shareable clips, add music, and more.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Host a webinar with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/product/live-video&quot;>;Wistia Live&lt;/a>;, and then redistribute your recording.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 560px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-content-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;&quot;>; &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/18SMzKX2G04?si=YXjW79TIeUgcuCp2&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Step 2: Customize your videos.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Wistia offers a variety of ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/product/customize&quot;>;customize your videos&lt;/a>; to not only deliver a great viewing experience, but also to help you reach your business goals.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can customize your player color to match your branding, create a custom thumbnail to entice your audience to press the play button, add chapters to make it easy for your viewers to find the information they&#39;re looking for, insert &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/support/customizing/call-to-action&quot;>;a Call to Action (CTA)&lt;/a>; to direct your viewers to an action you&#39;d like them to take, and more.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can make changes anytime, and your video will be updated wherever it&#39;s embedded.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We also recommend making sure your videos are accessible to everyone. By enabling features like captions and audio descriptions, you can open the doors to a broader audience, allowing more people to enjoy your videos. With Wistia&#39;s in-app accessibility checklist, it&#39;s easier than ever to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/product/accessibility&quot;>;video accessibility&lt;/a>; a seamless part of your workflow.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Step 3: Integrate HubSpot with Wistia.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Did you know that you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/integrations/marketing-automation/hubspot&quot;>;combine the powers of HubSpot and Wistia&lt;/a>; to seamlessly capture, track, and manage leads? You can also use this integration to embed your Wistia-hosted video into your emails and website.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you have a HubSpot account and an Advanced or Premium &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/pricing&quot;>;Wistia software subscription plan&lt;/a>;, follow these steps to integrate both accounts:&lt;/p>; &lt;ol>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/support/integrations/hubspot#connect-the-hubspot-integration-in-wistia&quot;>;Connect the HubSpot integration in your Wistia account&lt;/a>;. This allows Wistia to request your lists and forms and send leads and engagement data into HubSpot.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;If you&#39;re tracking a video, set up a Wistia email capture form (called &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/support/integrations/hubspot#add-a-turnstile-to-your-video&quot;>;Turnstile&lt;/a>;) or add a HubSpot &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/support/integrations/hubspot#add-a-hubspot-form-to-your-video&quot;>;form&lt;/a>; directly to the video. Turnstiles and HubSpot forms are how Wistia identifies users for proper tracking.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Embed your video on a page with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/support/integrations/hubspot#embedding-with-a-hubspot-tracking-script&quot;>;HubSpot tracking script&lt;/a>;. The Wistia player and HubSpot script work together to identify users and track their activity for display on HubSpot contact records.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ol>; &lt;p>;The first step is usually a one-time thing, and thereafter you&#39;ll only need to repeat the second and third steps for each video you want to track.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Step 4: Share your videos.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Whether you want to embed your videos somewhere, publish them on social, or send them to folks privately, Wistia makes it super simple to share your videos.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;How to Display Your Wistia Videos&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/support/embed-and-share&quot;>;Embedding a Wistia-hosted video&lt;/a>; onto your website is a piece of cake.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All you need to do is open the Embed &amp;amp; Share window from your Media Page, choose your embed code type, fine-tune it, and then paste it onto your website.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are two main types of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/support/embed-and-share/media-on-your-website&quot;>;Wistia embeds&lt;/a>;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/support/embed-and-share/sharing-videos#embedding&quot;>;inline embeds and popover embeds&lt;/a>;. Inline embeds will place the player directly on the page, in line with the rest of your content. Popover embeds display your video&#39;s thumbnail in line, but play the video in a popover window when selected. The best part is that there&#39;s no coding required.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Wistia Channels&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/product/channels&quot;>;Wistia Channels&lt;/a>; enables you to turn a collection of videos into a video gallery without a developer&#39;s help. With just a simple embed code, you can take your recent webinars, a library of product videos, or a branded series (like a podcast) and display them as a beautiful, binge-able collection.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/support/embed-and-share/channel-embeds&quot;>;Embedding a Channel&lt;/a>; on your website is as simple as embedding a single video. Use an inline code when you want your Channel to show within the flow of your website, or use a popover code when you want to give your viewer a more immersive, full-window viewing experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;More Ways to Share Your Videos&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;With Wistia&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/support/embed-and-share/sharing-videos#sharing-in-email&quot;>;Email Campaign Link&lt;/a>; feature, you can include your videos in your marketing emails and even track their success. Just grab the email merge tag Wistia generated specifically for your favorite email marketing provider and then paste it into the body of your email.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Wistia + HubSpot integration makes embedding videos into your emails even easier. When you connect both accounts, you can access your Wistia video library in HubSpot using Media Bridge, select a Wistia video, and then embed it in a HubSpot email or web page.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Want to share your videos on social media? Use Wistia&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/support/embed-and-share/publish-to-social&quot;>;Publish to Social&lt;/a>; feature to connect Wistia to your Facebook, YouTube, and LinkedIn accounts and then directly upload your video content to these social networks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wistia&#39;s integration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.hootsuite.com/apps/wistia-for-hootsuite?utm_source=noticeable&amp;amp;utm_campaign=wyo8czgpadfwdrryjcby.our-hootsuite-integration-is-officially-live-on-the-app-marketplace-1&amp;amp;utm_content=publication+cta&amp;amp;utm_id=WYO8CZGPadfWDRRYjcbY.YTpQPYoTPiDII3gSqhSn.NNZt3BjrpSYJvrYTMoZW&amp;amp;utm_medium=newspage&quot;>;Hootsuite&lt;/a>; also lets you access your Wistia library from within the Hootsuite platform. It&#39;s easy for you to find, schedule, and publish your Wistia-hosted video content to any social media channel via Hootsuite.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you just want to share a video without making it available to everyone on the internet, no problem — simply grab a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/support/embed-and-share/sharing-videos#sharing-a-direct-link&quot;>;direct link&lt;/a>; to the video. The link will take folks to a media page you can customize to provide a branded viewing experience.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter how you share your Wistia videos, it&#39;s easy to keep your content secure with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/learn/marketing/video-privacy-and-security&quot;>;privacy and security options&lt;/a>;. You can control access to your videos by password-protecting your video, sharing a private video link, or adding an email gate to your video or Channel.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Step 5: Generate leads.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Videos are a great way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/product/lead-generation&quot;>;generate leads&lt;/a>; for your business, and Wistia makes it easy to do so. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/product/turnstile&quot;>;Turnstile&lt;/a>;, you can capture email addresses at any point in your video&#39;s timeline.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/integrations/marketing-automation/hubspot&quot;>;integrated HubSpot with Wistia&lt;/a>;, you can access your existing HubSpot forms in Wistia and add them to your videos. You can capture leads with your videos and pass detailed viewing data into your HubSpot customer relationship management system (CRM). Then score, segment, and assign leads in a flash based on video triggers.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Generating Leads with Wistia&#39;s Live Event Registration&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If you set up a webinar or a live-streamed event with Wistia, it&#39;s easy to see who registered, who attended, and who was the most engaged.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/support/live/getting-started#registration&quot;>;enable registration&lt;/a>;, Wistia automatically creates a landing page for your event so you can collect sign-up information like names and email addresses. If you&#39;ve integrated HubSpot with Wistia, those contacts get passed right from your registration page to HubSpot. Now, you can also use HubSpot forms right on your registration page.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as your webinar or live stream is over, your audience can watch it on demand. Whether you include a link to your webinar recording in an email blast or create a landing page to host your on-demand webinars, the leads can keep flowing in.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Step 6: Track your videos&#39; performance.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Lastly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/product/analytics&quot;>;Wistia&#39;s detailed analytics&lt;/a>; can help you strengthen your video marketing strategy over time. You&#39;ll get insights into who&#39;s watching your videos, how much they&#39;re watching, and which ones provide the most value for your business.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Engagement Graphs&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wistia&#39;s engagement graphs show how your audience consumes your content. You can see which sections of your media your audience replayed multiple times and where they stopped playing, with drop-offs indicating when attention waned and big spikes revealing sections that people found compelling enough to replay.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Analytics by Embed Location&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;To understand how your video is performing based on where it lives on your site, you can view media analytics by embed location.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All you need to do is head to the Media Analytics Overview page and scroll down. From there, you&#39;ll see metrics like plays, play rate, time played, engagement, unique visitors, and conversion rate for each embed location during the date range you&#39;ve selected at the top of the page.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Heatmaps&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/product/analytics&quot;>;Wistia heatmaps&lt;/a>; show precisely which parts of your video each individual viewer has watched, skipped, and rewatched.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the Wistia + HubSpot integration, Wistia heatmaps will appear in your contact timeline. You can also see how many videos a HubSpot contact has watched. Once a contact has filled out a HubSpot form anywhere on your website, all their viewing data for any video on your site is added to their contact card in HubSpot.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With these insights, you can build email workflows that automatically contact your most engaged viewers. What&#39;s more, your sales team will get a complete view of their leads&#39; interactions and the integration will proactively alert them when their leads are watching key videos so they can reach out at optimal times.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Make Your Videos Work Harder for You&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;ve made it to the end of this article, congrats! You&#39;ve just upped your video marketing game. We hope you&#39;re inspired to start doing more with video for your business.

For instance, if you&#39;re applying to be a project manager, you don&#39;t want to admit that you&#39;re &quot;not very good with time management.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, there are ways to answer this question that will help you demonstrate your value as a candidate. Here, we&#39;ve cultivated some incredible answers to the mainstay, &quot;What is your greatest weakness&quot; question — and don&#39;t worry, these answers aren&#39;t &quot;perfectionism.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can also listen here.&lt;/p>; &lt;iframe style=&quot;margin: 0px auto; display: block;&quot; src=&quot;https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=HS3397179603&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;h2>;Best Answer for What is your weakness?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Interviewers who ask &quot;What is your greatest weakness?&quot; want to know how honest and self-aware you are.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They are also looking for evidence that you have a drive to improve upon your weaknesses. As you think about the most common weaknesses, ask yourself:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;What are your weaknesses?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How did you notice this weakness in yourself?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;How did you react to that realization?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What steps are you taking to notice that habit in the moment?&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;What are you doing to change this behavior?&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;The best answers to this question sincerely explain a weakness and provide an example of how you are actively working on being better.

Instead, think about the job requirements and the types of answers that make hiring managers want to work with you. Then, choose the most honest answer to the question that won&#39;t make the hiring manager question your fit for the role.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are some of the best examples of how you might answer &quot;What is your greatest weakness?&quot; and why they work.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Lack of Patience&lt;/h3>; &lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #f6f9fc; padding: 20px;&quot;>; &lt;h4>;Sample Answer:&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&quot;I don&#39;t have much patience when working with a team — I am incredibly self-sufficient, so it&#39;s difficult when I need to rely on others to complete my work. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve pursued roles that require someone to work independently. However, I&#39;ve also worked to improve this weakness by enrolling in team-building workshops. While I typically work independently, it&#39;s important I learn how to trust my coworkers and ask for outside help when necessary.&quot;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;This answer works because the weakness — the inability to be patient when working with a team — doesn&#39;t hinder your ability to perform well in the role, since it&#39;s a job that doesn&#39;t rely on teamwork to succeed. Additionally, you display an eagerness to develop strategies to combat your weakness, which is a critical skill in the workplace.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Related Resources:&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/the-hustle/how-long-does-it-take-to-form-a-habit&quot;>;Change Your Ways — Tips on Habit Forming&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/habits-of-highly-effective-people-summary&quot;>;7 Habits of Highly Effective People [Summary &amp;amp; Takeaways]&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/what-is-your-greatest-weakness_0.webp?width=500&amp;amp;height=634&amp;amp;name=what-is-your-greatest-weakness_0.webp&quot; alt=&quot;best weaknesses to share with an interviewer&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;634&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;h3>;2. Lack of Organization&lt;/h3>; &lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #f6f9fc; padding: 20px;&quot;>; &lt;h4>;Sample Answer:&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&quot;I struggle with organization. While it hasn&#39;t ever impacted my performance, I&#39;ve noticed my messy desk and cluttered inbox nonetheless interfere with my efficiency. Over time, I&#39;ve learned to set aside time to organize my physical and digital space, and I&#39;ve seen it improve my efficiency levels throughout the week.&quot;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Plenty of people have messy desks. This answer works because it&#39;s a relatable and fixable weakness. You note that disorganization doesn&#39;t interfere with your ability to do your job, which is critical, but you also acknowledge it might make you less efficient. To ensure you&#39;re performing at 100%, you mention personal steps you&#39;ve taken to improve your organization skills for the sake of self-improvement alone, which suggests a level of maturity and self-awareness.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Related Resources:&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/organizational-skills&quot;>;Organizational Skills Every Leader Needs &lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vdZCXb5P1E&quot;>;Time-saving AI Tools Video&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;3. Trouble with Delegation&lt;/h3>; &lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #f6f9fc; padding: 20px;&quot;>; &lt;h4>;Sample Answer:&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&quot;I sometimes find it difficult to delegate responsibility when I feel I can finish the task well myself. However, when I became manager in my last role, it became critical I learn to delegate tasks. To maintain a sense of control when delegating tasks, I implemented a project management system to oversee the progress of a project. This system enabled me to improve my ability to delegate efficiently.&quot;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;This answer allows you to demonstrate an ability to pursue a new skill when a role calls for it and suggests you&#39;re capable of flexibility, which is critical for long-term growth. Additionally, you are able to showcase a level of initiative and leadership when you mention the successful implementation of a new process that enabled you to succeed in your past role, despite your weakness.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Related Resources:&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/the-hustle/how-to-delegate&quot;>;How to Delegate as a Leader&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://listen.hubspot.com/public/83/Marketing-Against-The-Grain-fc89af93/64017ad0&quot;>;How to Delegate Your Work to ChatGPT Podcast &lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;4. Timidity&lt;/h3>; &lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #f6f9fc; padding: 20px;&quot;>; &lt;h4>;Sample Answer:&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&quot;Oftentimes, I can be timid when providing constructive feedback to coworkers or managers, out of fear of hurting someone&#39;s feelings. However, in my last role, my coworker asked me to edit some of his pieces and provide feedback for areas of improvement. Through my experience with him, I realized feedback can be both helpful and kind when delivered the right way. Since then, I&#39;ve become better at offering feedback, and I&#39;ve realized that I can use empathy to provide thoughtful, productive feedback.&quot;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;This answer works because you&#39;ve explained how you were able to turn a weakness into a strength through real-world experience. Typically, timidity can be seen as a flaw in the workplace, particularly if a role requires someone to give feedback to others. In this case, you&#39;re able to show how timidity can be used as a strength, through thoughtful reflection and practice.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Related Resources:&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/W6gZHPvtOcU&quot;>;Why Introverts Make Great Leaders Video&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/peer-feedback-tips&quot;>;Tips for Giving Feedback&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/giving-negative-feedback-tips&quot;>;How to Give Negative Feedback&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;5. Lack of Tactfulness&lt;/h3>; &lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #f6f9fc; padding: 20px;&quot;>; &lt;h4>;Sample Answer:&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&quot;My blunt, straightforward nature has allowed me to succeed over the years as a team manager, because I&#39;m able to get things done efficiently, and people often appreciate my honesty. However, I&#39;ve recognized my bluntness doesn&#39;t always serve my employees well when I&#39;m delivering feedback. To combat this, I&#39;ve worked to develop empathy and deeper relationships with those I manage. Additionally, I took an online leadership management course, and worked with the professor to develop my ability to deliver feedback.&quot;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Oftentimes, facets of our personalities can help us in certain areas of our work, while hindering us in others. That&#39;s natural. However, you must demonstrate an ability to recognize when your personality interferes with the functions of your role, and how you can solve for that.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this example, you first explain how your blunt nature allows you to be successful in certain situations. Then, you mention that you understand your bluntness can be seen as a lack of empathy and provide examples of how you&#39;ve attempted to solve this issue. Ultimately, your awareness of how you might be perceived by others shows a level of emotional intelligence, which is a critical asset for a team leader.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Related Resources:&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/personality-tests&quot;>;Free Personality Tests&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://product.hubspot.com/blog/how-to-communicate-like-a-leader&quot;>;How to Communicate Like a Leader&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;6. Fear of Public Speaking&lt;/h3>; &lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #f6f9fc; padding: 20px;&quot;>; &lt;h4>;Sample Answer:&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&quot;Public speaking makes me nervous. While I don&#39;t need to do much public speaking in my role as a web designer, I still feel that it&#39;s an important skill — especially when I want to offer my opinion during a meeting. To combat this, I spoke with my manager and she recommended I speak at each team meeting for a few minutes about our project timeline, deadlines, and goals when developing a website for a client. This practice has enabled me to relax and see public speaking as an opportunity to help my team members do their jobs effectively.&quot;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;In this example, you mention qualities that aren&#39;t applicable to the role, but which you nonetheless have been working to improve. This shows your desire to meet more business needs than necessary in your current role, which is admirable. Additionally, it&#39;s impressive if you can show you&#39;re willing to contact your manager with areas you want to improve, instead of waiting for your manager to suggest those areas of improvement to you. It shows a level of ambition and professional maturity.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Related Resources:&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34274/7-lessons-from-the-world-s-most-captivating-presenters-slideshare.aspx&quot;>;Public Speaking Tips From Speakers &amp;amp; Communication Experts&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/science-public-speaking-tips&quot;>;Tips for Mastering Public Speaking&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;7. Weak Data Analysis Skills&lt;/h3>; &lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #f6f9fc; padding: 20px;&quot;>; &lt;h4>;Sample Answer:&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&quot;I&#39;m not great at analyzing data or numbers. However, I recognize this flaw can prevent me from understanding how my content is performing online. In my last role, I set up monthly meetings with the SEO manager to discuss analytics and how our posts were performing. Additionally, I received my Google Analytics certificate, and I make it a point to analyze data related to our blog regularly. I&#39;ve become much more comfortable analyzing data through these efforts.&quot;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;In this example, you&#39;re able to show your desire to go above and beyond a job description and actively seek out skills that could be helpful to the success of your company as a whole. This type of company-first mentality shows the interviewer you&#39;re dedicated to making yourself a valuable asset, and trying your best to understand the needs of the whole department, rather than just your role.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Related Resources:&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/excel-data-analysis&quot;>;Excel Data Analysis Lesson&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/resources/analytics&quot;>;Free Analytics Resources&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;8. Indecisiveness&lt;/h3>; &lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #f6f9fc; padding: 20px;&quot;>; &lt;h4>;Sample Answer:&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&quot;Sometimes I struggle with ambiguity and making decisions when directions aren&#39;t clear. I come from a work environment that always gave clear and direct instructions. I had such a strong team and leadership that I haven&#39;t had much practice making decisions in the heat of the moment. I&#39;m working on this by leaning more into my experience and practicing listening to my gut.&quot;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;This job interview answer works because you&#39;re demonstrating that you can both follow a leader and sharpen your leadership skills. It&#39;s alright to not know what to do in the moment. Admitting that you relied on strong leadership shows that you can be a follower when needed, but knowing when to step up is important, too. With this answer, you&#39;re showing that you&#39;ll step up if a situation calls for decisiveness.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Related Resources:&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/strategic_decision_making&quot;>;Strategic Decision Making Lesson&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/decision-tree&quot;>;Decision Trees&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/the-hustle/decision-making-management&quot;>;Decision Making in Management&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;9. Harsh Self-Criticism&lt;/h3>; &lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #f6f9fc; padding: 20px;&quot;>; &lt;h4>;Sample Answer:&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&quot;My inner critic can be debilitating at times. I take pride in producing good work, but I feel like I struggle feeling satisfied with it, which has led to burnout in the past. However, I&#39;ve started to push back against this inner voice by taking care of myself before and after work. I&#39;m also learning to recognize when my inner critic is right and when I need to dismiss it.&quot;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;This answer works because your interviewer may relate; we all have harsh inner critics. It&#39;s also effective because 1) It shows that you&#39;re willing to work on your weaknesses outside of work, not just during business hours, and 2) It demonstrates your inner critic may have valid points. Discerning when to dismiss it is key to prevent burnout and increase productivity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Realizing how the inner critic may inhibit good work ethic shows your willingness to grow and be an effective worker.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Related Resources:&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/critical_thinking_foundations&quot;>;Critical Thinking Foundations Lesson&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://listen.hubspot.com/public/83/Being-Boss%3A-Mindset%2C-Habits%2C-Tactics%2C-and-Lifestyle-for-Creative-Entrepreneurs-70eed633/404c62ea&quot;>;Your Inner Critic Is a Big Jerk Podcast&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;10. Micromanaging&lt;/h3>; &lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #f6f9fc; padding: 20px;&quot;>; &lt;h4>;Sample Answer:&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&quot;I used to work in industries where I had to cultivate a solid work ethic in my employees. This style of training has been so ingrained in me that I&#39;ve forgotten to discern who may need that coaching and who does not. I&#39;ve been reading books on effective delegation and team building to work on this shortcoming. One technique that works for me is assuring myself that if I establish clear expectations, then my team will follow. I&#39;ve also learned to trust my team members.&quot;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;This answer works best if you&#39;ve been in a leadership position before and are applying to a managerial role. However, you can still apply it to past experiences where you did have to show leadership. This answer shows that while you may be used to running your crew or team a specific way, you&#39;re willing to admit when your method isn&#39;t the most effective. Showing your flexibility demonstrates your ability to grow.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Related Resources:&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/management-styles&quot;>;Management Styles to Strive for and Avoid&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/management-by-objectives&quot;>;Management by Objectives&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;11. Talkative&lt;/h3>; &lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #f6f9fc; padding: 20px;&quot;>; &lt;h4>;Sample Answer:&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&quot;I enjoy developing a relationship with my coworkers by engaging in conversation, and that&#39;s a great team-building skill. However, I have a habit of carrying on a conversation to a point where it may distract other coworkers. I have learned since then that there are other ways to connect with my coworkers, and that if I&#39;m asking about their day, I need to keep it brief and redirect myself back to my work.&quot;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;This answer works because it shows you&#39;re aware of how your talkative tendencies may be distracting in the workplace. It takes a lot of courage to admit that. It also shows you are willing to develop a relationship with coworkers but not at the cost of productivity.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Related Resources:&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/how-to-build-business-relationships&quot;>; How to Build Business Relationships &lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/UxApOpBQBno&quot;>;Hubspot &amp;amp; Zapier CMOs Share Their Career Advice Video&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h3>;12. Trouble Maintaining a Work-Life Balance&lt;/h3>; &lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #f6f9fc; padding: 20px;&quot;>; &lt;h4>;Sample Answer:&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&quot;I&#39;ve struggled with work-life balance, especially after I started working remotely during the pandemic. This increased my stress levels to the point where my productivity was at an all-time low and I didn&#39;t bring my best self to work. Because I want to continue working remotely, I&#39;ve started adding more structure to my day and instituted a sharp start and end time. I&#39;ve already seen improvements in my levels of focus during work hours.&quot;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;At first, this might seem like a &quot;strength&quot; weakness — pouring yourself into work is great, right? That means you love your job. But if it impacts your productivity and your relationships with coworkers, that is not so great. This answer works because it doesn&#39;t just say, &quot;I work a lot, so my home life suffers.&quot; It says, &quot;I work a lot to the point of burnout, and I&#39;ve realized that I need to structure my day.&quot; If you&#39;ve struggled with work-life balance issues in the past, it&#39;s important to state how you&#39;re restoring that balance and how it has impacted your work.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Related Resources:&lt;/h4>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/work-life-balance-tips&quot;>;Secrets to Work-Life Balance&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/the-hustle/the-best-work-life-balance-hacks&quot;>;Work-Life Balance Hacks&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/the-hustle/work-life-integration&quot;>;Work-Life Integration&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;h2>;How to Identify Your Greatest Weakness&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As we already mentioned, your answer must be honest while also not jeopardizing your chance at getting a job offer. So, how exactly do you figure out which weakness to talk about? Here are some tips:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Rule out any skills that are listed in the job description.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Scan through every detail of the job listing and make sure weakness isn&#39;t included in the required skills and responsibilities.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, say you&#39;re applying to be a senior product marketing manager. The job description says that the company is looking for someone who is a skilled storyteller, can interpret data and market research, and is self-driven and adaptable to change.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/what-is-your-greatest-weakness_1.webp?width=650&amp;amp;height=234&amp;amp;name=what-is-your-greatest-weakness_1.webp&quot; alt=&quot;how to answer &amp;quot;what is your greatest weakness&amp;quot; example: job description&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;234&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because these are essential skills for the role, you wouldn&#39;t want to mention them as your weakness. Doing so would make you seem less competent and risk your chances of getting the job.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Consider weaknesses that you have overcome.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;While preparing your answer, reflect on what you&#39;ve learned and improved while working in your current role.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Talk about your early struggles in learning or improving upon a skill and explain to the interviewer what you did to overcome it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, early on in my career, I struggled with analyzing and interpreting marketing data. In order to improve these skills, my manager mentored me and gave me weekly assignments that allowed me to practice data interpretation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within a few months, I went from being a content marketer who was averse to data to one who embraced it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Find inspiration by looking through old performance reviews.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re having trouble thinking of a specific weakness example, read through old self-assessments and performance reviews. These documents offer examples of your accomplishments as well as the areas you can improve upon, making them a great source of inspiration.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Depending on how long you have worked at your current company, you may be reminded of old weaknesses that you now consider strengths. This can help you craft an answer that shows your willingness to work on yourself.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Choose a weakness that will not prevent you from succeeding in the role.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When an interviewer asks, &quot;What is your greatest weakness?&quot; they want to find out:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Whether you have a healthy level of self-awareness&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Whether you can be open and honest, particularly about shortcomings&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Whether you pursue self-improvement and growth opportunities to combat these issues, as opposed to letting these weaknesses hold you back&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Ultimately, you&#39;ll want to use this question to demonstrate how you&#39;ve used a weakness as motivation to learn a new skill or grow professionally. Everyone has weaknesses — your interviewer doesn&#39;t expect you to be perfect.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re applying for a copywriting position with little necessity for math skills, you might admit, &quot;I struggle with numbers, and don&#39;t have much experience with data analytics. While math is not directly tied to my role as a writer, I believe it&#39;s important to have a rudimentary understanding of Google Analytics to ensure my work is performing well. To tackle this weakness, I&#39;ve been taking online courses in data analytics.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An answer like this shows the hiring manager that you recognize your areas for growth and are able to act on them without being told to do so. This kind of self-starter attitude is a plus for virtually any team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/what-is-your-greatest-weakness_2.webp?width=650&amp;amp;height=365&amp;amp;name=what-is-your-greatest-weakness_2.webp&quot; alt=&quot;how to answer what is your weakness&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;365&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Be honest and choose a real weakness.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The answer &quot;perfectionism&quot; won&#39;t cut it when talking about your biggest weakness because it&#39;s not a real weakness. Perfectionism can never be attained — it&#39;s a fear-based pattern that leads to short-term rewards like getting the job done early and exceeding expectations. However, in the long-term, trying to attain perfectionism leads to burnout, low-quality work, and missed deadlines. Burnout is one of the biggest contributors to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.business.com/articles/why-you-need-to-worry-about-burnout/&quot;>;decreased productivity&lt;/a>;, turnover, and low employee engagement — all of which cost a company money, time, and talent.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instead, choose a real weakness. Underneath the desire to do perfect work may lie a weakness of trust. Perhaps you don&#39;t trust that you&#39;ll be able to make mistakes on the team, so you strive to do everything perfectly. That&#39;s a real weakness that you can definitely overcome.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Provide an example of how you&#39;ve worked to improve upon your weakness or learn a new skill to combat the issue.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Hiring managers don&#39;t expect you to overcome your weaknesses completely overnight. Everyone has areas they must constantly work on to keep them sharp. Think of it this way — if you&#39;ve dedicated six months to working out, you won&#39;t be able to stop one day and maintain your progress. It&#39;s an ongoing process that you have to work at.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Think about weaknesses in your own personal life.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If you humanize yourself in the interview, it&#39;ll allow your interviewer to connect and visualize working with you in the future. It&#39;s not just about weaknesses that pertain to the job. For example, if you are an introvert and you notice your preference for quiet time stops you from taking risks, this is a relatable weakness. When you demonstrate your self-awareness this way, it shows you understand that self-improvement correlates to work performance.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Think of where you&#39;d like to be and what support you need to get there.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Overall, growth is a part of life. Think about people you look up to that may be related to the field that you&#39;re in. Ask yourself what character traits those people have and what work you might need to do in order to get there. By providing an example of how you&#39;re working to improve your area of weakness, you&#39;ll give the interviewer a glimpse into a few positive attributes about your awareness, including that:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;You know how to identify and mitigate issues that come up.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;You&#39;ve found a helpful solution to a problem that you and perhaps others on the team face, which means you can be an immediate resource to the team.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;You demonstrate self-awareness and an ability to take feedback from others.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;More often than not, you&#39;re going to need to look outside of yourself to overcome a weakness. Whether you look to your supervisor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/&quot;>;the HubSpot Blog&lt;/a>;, or a mentor for help, the simple act of seeking help demonstrates self-awareness and resourcefulness — two skills that are hard to teach, but valuable to learn. Tapping into your resources shows the interviewers that you can solve problems when the answer is not yet clear. That&#39;s a character trait that has a place on any team.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Briefly share an example of a time when you asked someone for help in an area that you&#39;ve identified as a weakness. This gives the hiring team a clear picture of how you&#39;ll work with the team to balance out that weakness.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;6. Don&#39;t be arrogant and don&#39;t underestimate yourself.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The most important thing you can do when responding to the question &quot;What is your greatest weakness?&quot; is exhibit confidence in your answer. (If lack of confidence is your weakness, keep reading.) Even if you&#39;re not the most confident person, I&#39;m going to assume you&#39;re at least honest with yourself. If you&#39;ve identified an area of weakness and you&#39;re sure about it, let that assurance shine through in your answer. There&#39;s no need to feel embarrassed about something you&#39;re genuinely not good at as long as you&#39;re working to get better.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before you start expressing a genuine weakness to your interviewer, get comfortable with the types of answers that make hiring managers want to work with you. Take a look at the following examples and find a few that fit your personality and work style. Then, practice reciting them aloud so they come naturally to you.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Tips for Talking About Weaknesses in Job Interviews&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Now that you know the most effective answers and best practices for choosing a weakness, it&#39;s time for the hard part: Actually delivering the answer to the interviewer. Let&#39;s go over some tips for answering &quot;What is your greatest weakness?&quot; live.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/what-is-your-greatest-weakness_4.webp?width=650&amp;amp;height=339&amp;amp;name=what-is-your-greatest-weakness_4.webp&quot; alt=&quot;tips for answering what is your weakness in a live interview&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;339&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Practice your answer beforehand.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Practice does not make perfect, but it certainly makes better. While it&#39;s not guaranteed that an interviewer will ask you about weaknesses, there&#39;s a high possibility that they will. You want to be prepared for that moment by practicing the tone and delivery of your answer with a friend or in the mirror.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There&#39;s nothing worse than stumbling over an interview answer, especially for this question about weaknesses. It&#39;s totally okay to stutter a bit — we all get nervous — but you want your answer to be as coherent and brief as possible. If you ramble, stumble too much, or go back on your words, you&#39;ll seem unprepared or, worse, like you&#39;re lying.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once you&#39;ve written up your answer, be sure to read it out loud to yourself several times, then retrieve it from memory. Change your wording here and there, and know that it&#39;s okay to improvise so long as the bones of your answer remain the same.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Look the interviewer in the eye and project confidence.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Since you&#39;ve hopefully practiced several times, this should come naturally, but we can&#39;t overemphasize it: When answering &quot;What is your weakness?,&quot; try to maintain eye contact with your interviewer during most of the answer, and project confidence while you speak.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Project confidence while talking about my weakness?&quot; you may ask.是的！ You want to own up to your most urgent opportunities for growth — not seem like you&#39;re cowed or intimidated by your own shortcomings, or like your self-esteem has suffered dramatically. (Hint: It totally may have, and that&#39;s okay, but your interviewer shouldn&#39;t know that tidbit). You can take solace in that you&#39;re not alone. All of us have weaknesses to work on.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can increase your level of confidence during your answer by explaining how you&#39;ve been working on this weakness. In fact, by focusing the core of your answer on how you&#39;ve already improved in this area, you&#39;ll seem more self-assured and actualized by default.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Be brief and to the point.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;We don&#39;t want to linger too much on weaknesses; try to keep your answer short, between the length of thirty seconds and one minute. Even still, only the first statement should directly state your weakness, and the rest of the answer should be dedicated to the tools and strategies you&#39;re using to overcome it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alternatively, you may give a brief anecdote on what you learned from dealing with that weakness in your personal life or at work.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Don&#39;t think you have to over-elaborate, either. State, in as simple terms as possible, the steps you&#39;ve taken to improve. Your interviewer likely has much more pressing job interview questions to ask about your direct experience, and the answer to this question isn&#39;t as critical in the overall process as we all may think.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Understand the interviewer&#39;s goal.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Your interviewer&#39;s goal is not to intimidate you, scare you, or create a &quot;gotcha!&quot;片刻。 They&#39;re also not looking to disqualify you based on your answer. The &quot;What is your greatest weakness?&quot; question is one of the most popular behavioral interview questions. It&#39;s simply another way for interviewers to get to know your soft personal and professional attributes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They&#39;re not looking to find out that you &quot;totally suck&quot; at the job you applied for — if you applied, you likely meet the qualifications. They&#39;re also not looking to find out about your hard professional skills and attributes; other interview questions and answers are better suited for that. Rather, they want to know if you have enough self-awareness to identify your opportunities for growth. Do you have poise when speaking about your weakness? Do you gracefully accept feedback?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Including anecdotes about previous feedback you&#39;ve received, projecting confidence, and making it clear that you&#39;re taking steps to improve will be enough to fly with high marks during this question.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Don&#39;t stress too much over your answer.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Good news: Hiring decisions don&#39;t come down to your answer to &quot;What is your weakness?&quot; Shocking, I know! Sometimes it seems like it, because it can feel like such a loaded question.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not to worry: You can rest easy. As long as you&#39;re honest and state how you&#39;re trying to improve, this question will likely be low in your interviewer&#39;s notes, unless you lie about your weakness, use a &quot;fake&quot; weakness such as &quot;I&#39;m too organized,&quot; or simply evade the question entirely.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if you stutter a little bit, you&#39;ll be okay. So, relax, be certain in your answer, stay self-aware, and simply take it as part of the conversation between you and the interviewer. The other questions about your skills and how you can help their company are much, much more critical to their hiring decision.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;6. Showcase your personality while keeping it professional.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Is humor your style? How about dry wit? You can introduce some of that during this question, but only lightly, and only after you&#39;ve gauged the company&#39;s culture and examined the interviewer&#39;s personality. If you&#39;re interviewing for a highly corporate job, we recommend keeping humor to a minimum. But no matter what, you can always show your personality in your inflection, tone, and delivery.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take, for instance:&lt;/p>; &lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #f6f9fc; padding: 20px;&quot;>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&quot;You know, I&#39;ve had &lt;/em>;such&lt;em>; a hard time with [X] in the past, but I&#39;m grateful to my previous managers, who gave me useful feedback when I began my career. Now, I&#39;m &#39;thriving.&#39; Every single day, I do [Y] to improve upon that skill. It was such a pain point for me, but I&#39;ve improved tremendously and have been lucky enough to have a strong support system every step of the way.&quot; &lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Compare that with:&lt;/p>; &lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #f6f9fc; padding: 20px;&quot;>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&quot;I won&#39;t lie. I struggle with [X] sometimes. Fortunately, I&#39;ve picked up [Y] to work on it, and like any new learning experience, it&#39;s been eye-opening and humbling. I&#39;ve improved in [Z] areas — not so much that it would be &lt;/em>;first&lt;em>; on my list of skills, but maybe second or third. Either way, I&#39;m happy to report I&#39;m getting there and look forward to improving even more in the future.&quot; &lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Neither of these is better than the other, but they both show different personality types, and you can do the same.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;There&#39;s Strength In Every Weakness&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Regardless of whether you&#39;re bad with numbers or you tend not to speak up in group settings, there&#39;s a strength behind every weakness. The strength is in how you work to overcome it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leaning on your teammates who excel in those areas is a great way to show that you&#39;ll work well on the team and that you know how to use your resources to solve problems. Taking professional development courses shows that you&#39;re willing to work toward improvement.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter which of these answers you share with the hiring team, they&#39;ll be more than happy to help you grow and exceed the expectations of the role.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Editor&#39;s note: This post was originally published in December 2018 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a class=&quot;cta_button&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=2b65e012-a761-4ddf-ac81-b4396105d109&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid=&amp;amp;hseid=&amp;amp;hsic=&quot;>;&lt;img class=&quot;hs-cta-img &quot; style=&quot;height: auto !important; width: auto !important; max-width: 100% !important;border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; &quot; alt=&quot;New call-to-action&quot; height=&quot;613&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; src=&quot;https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/2b65e012-a761-4ddf-ac81-b4396105d109.png&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;amp;k=14&amp;amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwhat-is-your-greatest-weakness&amp;amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;amp;bvt=rss&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; &quot;>;</content:encoded><category> Job Search</category><pubDate> Thu, 31 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid> https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-your-greatest-weakness</guid><dc:date> 2023-08-31T11:00:00Z</dc:date><dc:creator> Caroline Forsey</dc:creator></item><item><title> How to Write a Powerful Executive Summary [+4 Top Examples]</title><link/> https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/executive-summary-examples<description> &lt;div class=&quot;hs-featured-image-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/executive-summary-examples&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;hs-featured-image-link&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/executive-summary-example_5.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Executive summary with examples&quot; class=&quot;hs-featured-image&quot; style=&quot;width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;&quot;>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Whether you&#39;re an entrepreneur looking for investors for your small business or the CEO of a large corporation, an executive summary can help you succeed and is a critical component for long-term growth.&lt;/p>;</description><content:encoded> &lt;p>;Whether you&#39;re an entrepreneur looking for investors for your small business or the CEO of a large corporation, an executive summary can help you succeed and is a critical component for long-term growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a class=&quot;cta_button&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=8fa1ffc1-8a1d-4d74-9620-3a2e029b12b9&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid=&amp;amp;hseid=&amp;amp;hsic=&quot;>;&lt;img class=&quot;hs-cta-img &quot; style=&quot;height: auto !important; width: auto !important; max-width: 100% !important;border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px&quot; alt=&quot;Download Now: Free Executive Summary Template&quot; height=&quot;59&quot; width=&quot;454&quot; src=&quot;https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/8fa1ffc1-8a1d-4d74-9620-3a2e029b12b9.png&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A short, attention-grabbing executive summary is an essential part of your &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-business-plan?_ga=2.220247512.1177812336.1659119874-827399145.1659119874&amp;amp;hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/executive-summary-examples&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=business%20plan&quot;>;business plan&lt;/a>;. Done correctly, it will ensure your company becomes or remains a key player in your industry. In this post, you&#39;ll learn what an executive summary is and how to write one that engages investors, customers, and general audiences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some documents that may have an executive summary include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Business plans&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Research documents&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Project proposals&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Annual reports&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Ultimately, the executive summary is meant to inform readers of the most important information in the document, so they don&#39;t have to read it all and can get caught up quickly.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Executive Summary vs. Business Plan&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;All business plans have an executive summary, but not all executive summaries belong to business plans.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A business plan includes a company overview, your company&#39;s short-term and long-term goals, information on your product or service, sales targets, expense budgets, your marketing plan, and a list including each member of your management team. In this case, the executive summary is the first section of the business plan that convinces readers that it&#39;s worth their time to read the whole thing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Business plans are very detailed and comprehensive, and can be as short as a dozen pages or as long as 100 pages. However, a CEO or investor might not have the interest or time to read your full business plan without first getting the general gist of your company or goals through an executive summary.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Executive Summary vs. Mission Statement&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Mission statements and executive summaries are typically both found in business plans, but they serve different purposes.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/inspiring-company-mission-statements&quot;>;mission statement&lt;/a>; defines your organization&#39;s purpose, values, and vision. It&#39;s your company&#39;s north star and communicates your core identity and reason for existence. On the other hand, an executive summary provides a high-level overview of the document.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ultimately, your mission statement provides direction for developing your business plan, while your executive summary describes your business plan to executives and shareholders.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Executive Summary vs. Company Description&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Like mission statements and executive summaries, company descriptions can also be found in business plans as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/company-profile&quot;>;“About us” page of your website&lt;/a>;. It provides an overview of your business, including essential details like company history, what your company does, unique selling points, goals, management team, and overall value proposition.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Executive Summary vs. Objective&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;An objective is a specific goal or target that your company takes aims to achieve its overall goal. It is a concrete, measurable outcome that guides your business&#39;s actions and decisions. Objectives are usually set at the strategic level and are typically aligned with the company&#39;s mission, vision, and overall strategic plan.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Company objectives are often included in executive summaries, but are not the sole focus of them.&lt;/p>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 650px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-content-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;&quot;>; &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LErpvV9EluQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;&quot;>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;h2>;What is the purpose of an executive summary?&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Writing an executive summary may not seem that necessary. After all, you can find the same information just by reading the rest of the document.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the executive summary serves many purposes for your document and those who read it. Here are some of the benefits of having one:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;It saves your readers time.&lt;/strong>; CEOs and investors often have limited time to review lengthy documents. An executive summary allows them to quickly grasp the main points, key findings, and recommendations without needing to read the entire document.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;It provides clarity and conciseness.&lt;/strong>; By providing a condensed overview, executive summaries help to distill complex information and present it in a manner that&#39;s easy to understand.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;strong>;It helps with document navigation.&lt;/strong>; For longer documents or reports, an executive summary provides a roadmap for readers. It helps them navigate through the document by signaling the main sections or topics covered, improving overall document usability and accessibility.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;To write an impressive executive summary that effectively embodies all the important elements of your business plan, we&#39;ve cultivated a list of necessary components for an executive summary, as well as an example to get you started.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/business-templates/executive-summary?hubs_post-cta=body&quot;>;Follow Along With HubSpot&#39;s Executive Summary Template&lt;/a>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/business-templates/executive-summary?hubs_post-cta=image&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/executive-summary.webp?width=310&amp;amp;height=413&amp;amp;name=executive-summary.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Executive summary template from HubSpot&quot; width=&quot;310&quot; height=&quot;413&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 310px;&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;h6 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/business-templates/executive-summary?hubs_post-cta=imagebottom&quot;>;Click to Download&lt;/a>;&lt;/h6>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Tell your story.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;When investors or CEO&#39;s read your executive summary, they should understand what your business is about. This is one of the first elements of your business plan, so it should set the tone.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In your executive summary, be sure to tell your story and include an overview about what your company does and why you do what you do. You can also briefly highlight important details about your company&#39;s management.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, you could talk about your founder or CEO&#39;s qualifications and motivations. You can also provide a high-level summary of your company&#39;s business operations and any management methods or best practices that you abide by.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You&#39;ll also want to explain the problem or opportunity that is being addressed, and how it is valuable to investors and customers. Think of this like an &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/elevator-pitch-examples?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/executive-summary-examples&amp;amp;hubs_content-cta=elevator%20pitch&quot;>;elevator pitch&lt;/a>;. If someone stopped reading and you only had the executive summary to explain your company, what information would you include?&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Highlight important data.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;An executive summary, while short, should include plenty of research.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Highlight the most important findings and insights from the document, including any critical data or statistics discovered in your &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitive-analysis-kit?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/executive-summary-examples&quot;>;competitor analysis&lt;/a>;. While your business plan will flesh out the details, it&#39;s important to include your key findings in your executive summary.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You should also provide a basic rundown of your target market, how you plan on addressing their needs and pain points, and how you will reach them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Additionally, you should include key financial information. The main points you should cover are the overall budget, the price per product/service, and your financial projections.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Pay attention to your tone.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Although the tone of your executive summary should be professional and concise, it should also be true to your company and target audience. Aim to convey a sense of authority and credibility while remaining accessible and engaging.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here are some tips to keep in mind:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Focus on presenting information objectively with facts and evidence.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Don&#39;t voice your personal opinions or use subjective statements.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Strive for clarity and simplicity in your language and ensure that your message is easily understood.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Avoid unnecessarily complexity or convolution.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Don&#39;t use hyperbole or excessive claims.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Use strong verbs, active voice, and concise language to make your points effectively.&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Aim to resonate with the reader&#39;s interests and concerns.&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;By striking the right balance between professionalism, clarity, and engagement, you can effectively deliver your message and compel the reader to take action or make informed decisions based on the summary.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Avoid cliché language.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;With any style of writing, it&#39;s best to avoid clichés. Clichés can convey the wrong message or be misunderstood, which is something you want to avoid when someone reads your executive summary.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Additionally, clichés tend to overpromise and under-deliver. For example, including something like “The Best Restaurant in Town” isn&#39;t true because you&#39;re untested as a business. Your executive summary should reflect the truth and who you are as a company.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To avoid clichés while writing, it&#39;s essential to be aware of their presence. Familiarize yourself with common clichés and be mindful of them as you write. Some examples include:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;“Thinking outside the box”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;“Innovative solutions”&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;“Cutting-edge technology”&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Instead of relying on these overused phrases, be descriptive and embrace the uniqueness of your brand when writing your executive summary. For instance, there&#39;s no need to vaguely refer to your product as a “game-changer,” when you could explain how it benefits your target audience instead. Show, don&#39;t tell.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By staying true to your voice and delivering an honest message, you can keep your writing fresh and your audience engaged.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Write it after completing your business plan.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;An executive summary is a summary of your business plan. However, it&#39;s hard to write a summary when you haven&#39;t written your business plan yet. That&#39;s why your executive summary should be the final thing you write.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By saving this step for last, you&#39;re able to gain a thorough understanding of the entire plan, including your business&#39;s goals, strategies, market analysis, and financial projections. This enables you to accurately depict the most important aspects in your summary.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you write you executive summary first, you&#39;re more likely to miscommunicate the essence of your business plan to executives and shareholders. Sure, you may have an outline prepare, but not having all the information can lead to inconsistencies or inaccuracies in your summary. You also risk including irrelevant details or omitting important details that come up during the planning process.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ultimately, writing your executive summary last ensures that precisely represents the content and findings your plan.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you don&#39;t have a business plan yet, don&#39;t worry; we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/business-plan-template?hubs_signup-url=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/executive-summary-examples&amp;amp;hubs_signup-cta=a%20comprehensive%20business%20plan%20template&amp;amp;hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/executive-summary-examples&amp;amp;hubs_post-cta=a%20comprehensive%20business%20plan%20template&quot;>;a comprehensive business plan template&lt;/a>; to help you create one quickly and effectively.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;Featured Resource: &lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/business-plan-template&quot;>;Business Plan Template&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/business-plan-template&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/image-png-Jun-12-2023-04-33-09-5504-PM.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot; alt=&quot;how to write executive summary: use business plan template from hubspot&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/business-plan-template&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;>;Download Your Free Template Here&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that you know how to write an executive summary, let&#39;s dive into the details of what to include.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;What to Include in Your Executive Summary&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Your business plan should convey your company&#39;s mission, your product, a plan for how you&#39;ll stand out from competitors, your financial projections, your company&#39;s short and long-term goals, your buyer persona, and your market fit.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ultimately, an executive summary should provide a preview for investors or CEO&#39;s, so they know what to expect from the rest of your report.

Even if you don&#39;t read the rest of the summary, you&#39;ll understand what Connected does from the heading alone. The company then goes into its history, mission, and values at length.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Try It Yourself&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Use the heading of your page to immediately describe what you do, as opposed to using “About Us” or “Executive Summary” as the title. Give readers the opportunity to get what they need above the fold and the option to read more. Note that this would not apply in an executive summary in a business plan.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventscouncil.org/About-Us/Our-Mission&quot;>;Events Industry Council&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;h3>;&lt;img alt=&quot;executive summary example: events industry council&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/DRAFT%20executive%20summary%20examples-1.jpeg?width=650&amp;amp;height=357&amp;amp;name=DRAFT%20executive%20summary%20examples-1.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;357&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot;>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Events Industry Council&#39;s executive summary is short and sweet, yet provides plenty of information for readers to understand what the organization does and which products it offers. Note the brevity in the mission, vision, and values sections — that demonstrates that there&#39;s no need to go on at length if it doesn&#39;t suit you. The “Who we are” section has the most emphasis here, which is a powerful technique to draw readers&#39; attention.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Try It Yourself&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Spend more time in the section that you feel your audience will care most about. If you&#39;re pitching to investors, you might spend more time on the Market Analysis and Financials sections. If you&#39;re writing for a general audience, you might focus on your company background.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.companyshopgroup.co.uk/about-us&quot;>;Company Shop Group&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;h3>;&lt;img alt=&quot;executive summary example: company shop group&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/DRAFT%20executive%20summary%20examples-2.jpeg?width=650&amp;amp;height=347&amp;amp;name=DRAFT%20executive%20summary%20examples-2.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;347&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot;>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;One of the first things you see when visiting Company Shop Group&#39;s About Us page is its subheading: “Company Shop Group is the UK&#39;s leading redistributor of surplus food and household products.” Like Connected, Company Shop Group includes what it does above the fold, so that readers have the option to either keep reading or walk away knowing what the company is about. The organization also includes multimedia to engage visitors and explain its business model in a more digestible format.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Try It Yourself&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Include what you do above the fold and add multimedia elements to provide an alternative way for readers to learn more about you. Videos, images, and headings can make it much easier to scan your executive summary, but be careful to only use this method for the right audience and through the right medium. (You might not include images inside a formal business plan, for instance.)&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.firstenergycorp.com/about.html&quot;>;FirstEnergy&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;h3>;&lt;img alt=&quot;executive summary example: first energy&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/DRAFT%20executive%20summary%20examples.jpeg?width=650&amp;amp;height=582&amp;amp;name=DRAFT%20executive%20summary%20examples.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;582&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot;>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;FirstEnergy&#39;s executive summary is great inspiration if you&#39;re a more corporate, formal brand. The company&#39;s executive summary covers its mission, subsidiaries, operations, products and services, corporate responsibility values, and strategic plan goals. This is useful information for potential investors, as the company is publicly traded.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While it&#39;s comprehensive, the executive summary remains short, using bullet points and images to break up the information and giving readers the opportunity to explore more with a sidebar menu.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Try It Yourself&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Be conscious of the status of your company when writing your executive summary. If it&#39;s publicly traded, you&#39;ll want to include more information, such as your strategic plan and expansion opportunities. If you&#39;re publishing your executive summary on your website, use a sidebar to allow readers to jump from page to page without leaving their place.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Start Your Executive Summary&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;An executive summary should be short and concise, but it should still convey who you are as a company. If you&#39;re starting a company, remember to tell your story, while also including important background and financial information. A strong executive summary will pave the way for more investors to invest in your business and more customers to trust in your brand.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;Editor&#39;s note: This post was originally published in December 2018 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;This article was written by a human, but our team uses AI in our editorial process.

That&#39;s 300 opportunities to market yourself and your business in those individual emails you send. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A lot of people treat their email signatures like an afterthought, which is a big missed opportunity. Those signatures are a chance for you to make it clear who you are, make it easy for people to reach you, and give people a place to go to find out more — either about you, about your business, or about something you&#39;re working on.&lt;/p>; &lt;a class=&quot;cta_button&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=3a319a89-ebd2-48ad-94d8-a7b3cc5aa634&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid=&amp;amp;hseid=&amp;amp;hsic=&quot;>;&lt;img class=&quot;hs-cta-img &quot; style=&quot;height: auto !important; width: auto !important; max-width: 100% !important;border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px&quot; alt=&quot;Create a new, on-brand email signature in just a few clicks.

So what exactly should go in your signature?&lt;/p>; &lt;br>; &lt;h3>;1. First and Last Name&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Just like with snail mail correspondence, your name should always be included so that the recipient of your message knows who it was from. This manifests in the email signature, often as the first line of text.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Affiliation Info (Such as Job Title and Department)&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Closely following your name should be your affiliation information. Your affiliations could include your job title, your company or organization, and/or even your department. Your name should eventually be its own draw, of course, as you build a relationship with the recipient, but providing this information provides more context about the conversation and your role in it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, affiliating yourself with a larger organization lends you more credibility, especially if it&#39;s a recognizable organization. This helps you get the attention of your readers so they take your message seriously.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Secondary Contact Information&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Secondary contact information is important, too, so that the recipient knows how else to contact you. Secondary information might include phone, fax, or any other method of communication you want to emphasize. In situations where you don&#39;t want to cough up your direct line, you could take this opportunity to promote your personal website — a passive way to open the lines of communication without flooding yourself with outreach if you don&#39;t want it.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Social Profile Icons&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Your social media presence is a major part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/the-ultimate-guide-to-personal-branding?__hstc=45788219.7a8e373dcdf4afab74c1ec6781de1784.1650465797294.1650465797294.1650465797294.1&amp;amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1650465797296&amp;amp;__hsfp=4140801928&amp;amp;_ga=2.172349350.481601421.1650465796-20625558.1650465796&quot;>;your personal brand&lt;/a>; because it helps you gain a following in your space and shows people what you care about. You can tell a lot about a person by what they post and how they portray themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s why it&#39;s a great idea to include links to your social media pages in your email signature. It not only reinforces your personal brand, but it also helps people find new ways to contact and follow you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even better? It can help drive traffic to your online content if you&#39;re posting links to that content on social media. So if you do include social icons in your signature, make sure you&#39;re keeping your social profiles up-to-date and chock full of interesting, relevant content. (In other words, if you haven&#39;t tweeted in six months, you may want to leave Twitter out.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why use social media icons instead of simply text links? Because icons are more easily recognizable for folks skimming your signature — and they&#39;ll stand out from the rest of the text in there. According to research from &lt;a href=&quot;https://neomam.com/interactive/13reasons/&quot;>;NeoMam Studios&lt;/a>;, visuals shown in color increase a person&#39;s willingness to read the rest of the content by 80%. That&#39;s a huge advantage. Plus, icons are big space-savers in a place where you might be packing a lot of information.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if you have a presence on a lot of social media sites, though, try to cap the number of icons to five or six. Focus on the accounts that matter most to growing your business or building your personal brand.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you do include a lot of social media icons, at least try to cut back on the other content if possible so your design isn&#39;t too busy. Check out the example below, made using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/email-signature-generator?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/professional-email-signatures&amp;amp;hubs_post-cta=HubSpot%27s%20Email%20Signature%20Generator&amp;amp;__hstc=45788219.7a8e373dcdf4afab74c1ec6781de1784.1650465797294.1650465797294.1650465797294.1&amp;amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1650465797296&amp;amp;__hsfp=4140801928&amp;amp;_ga=2.172349350.481601421.1650465796-20625558.1650465796&quot;>;HubSpot&#39;s Email Signature Generator&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/professional-email-signatures_0.webp?width=400&amp;amp;height=276&amp;amp;name=professional-email-signatures_0.webp&quot; alt=&quot;What to include in an email signature: social profile icons&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;276&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 400px;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Call to Action&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;One of the smartest things you can do in your email signature is include a call-to-action. The best email signature CTAs are simple, up-to-date, non-pushy, and in line with your email style, making them appear more like post-script, and less like a sales pitch.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Choose a CTA that aligns with one of your current business goals, and update it when those goals change. Here&#39;s an example of a HubSpotter&#39;s email signature that includes a CTA for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/podcastnetwork&quot;>;HubSpot Podcast Network&lt;/a>;:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/podcastnetwork&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/professional-email-signatures_3.webp?width=400&amp;amp;height=248&amp;amp;name=professional-email-signatures_3.webp&quot; alt=&quot;HubSpot Podcast Network CTA in a Professional Email Signature&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;248&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 400px;&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;6. Booking Links&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If you find yourself emailing back and forth with colleagues and clients who want to book meetings with you, make it easy for them by including a link to book your calendar right in your email signature. Here&#39;s an example from our own &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanlowry1/&quot;>;Bryan Lowry&lt;/a>;, below.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many tools out there that&#39;ll help people book appointments. If you&#39;re a HubSpot Sales customer, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/products/sales/schedule-meeting?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/professional-email-signatures&amp;amp;hubs_post-cta=share%20your%20personalized%20meeting%20link&amp;amp;__hstc=45788219.7a8e373dcdf4afab74c1ec6781de1784.1650465797294.1650465797294.1650465797294.1&amp;amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1650465797296&amp;amp;__hsfp=4140801928&amp;amp;_ga=2.172349350.481601421.1650465796-20625558.1650465796&quot;>;share your personalized meeting link&lt;/a>; with anyone who you want to book a meeting with and let them choose from your available times. If you want, you can make it so the HubSpot CRM automatically creates a new contact record for anyone who books a meeting if one doesn&#39;t already exist.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/email-signature-generator&quot;>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/professional-email-signature-example-vertical-hubspot.png?width=500&amp;amp;height=529&amp;amp;name=professional-email-signature-example-vertical-hubspot.png&quot; alt=&quot;professional email signature example: vertical layout by hubspot&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;529&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 500px;&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you aren&#39;t a HubSpot customer, one great meeting tool is &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/&quot;>;Calendly&lt;/a>;, which is free for Basic and lets you integrate your Google or Office 365 calendar. If you&#39;re looking for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.growthmarketingpro.com/the-5-best-calendly-alternatives-for-productivity-in-2020/&quot;>;Calendly alternative&lt;/a>;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youcanbook.me/pricing/&quot;>;YouCanBook.me&lt;/a>; is another booking tool that goes for $7 per calendar per month.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;7. Industry Disclaimer or Legal Requirements&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Some industries such as legal, financial, and insurance have specific guidelines on email usage and etiquette to protect private information from being transmitted. For this reason, you may want to look into what regulations your industry has in place and include a disclaimer in your signature about email transmissions. Mail-Signatures offers a number of email disclaimer examples, including this one:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;em>;&quot;The content of this email is confidential and intended for the recipient specified in the message only. It is strictly forbidden to share any part of this message with any third party, without a written consent of the sender. If you received this message by mistake, please reply to this message and follow with its deletion, so that we can ensure such a mistake does not occur in the future.&quot;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;8. Photo or Logo&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;An image is a great choice to spice up your email signature. If you want a personal touch so that recipients you&#39;ve never met can associate your name with your face, consider using a professional photo in your signature. Alternatively, you can use the company&#39;s logo to add more brand awareness to the email.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;9. Pronouns&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;While not as common in email signatures and certainly not required, adding your preferred pronouns to your signature is helpful, especially when emailing individuals you&#39;ve never met. It also takes ambiguity away if you have a name perceived as gender-neutral.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that you know the elements you should include, what does a great email signature look like? Here are some tips for creating signatures that are helpful and professional, including a few great examples.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Emphasize your name, affiliation, and secondary contact information.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;As you might guess, your name comes first. Closely following your name, however, should be your affiliation and where else people can reach you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Your affiliation could mean your job title, your company, your school, or a similar organization that you deem important to your recipients. Your name should eventually be its own draw, of course, but using a more popular brand name — and even its logo — ensures you get the attention of your readers and they take your message seriously.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondary contact information is important, too. You might not want to endorse your personal phone number, but you could take this opportunity to promote your personal website — a passive way to open the lines of communication without flooding yourself with outreach you don&#39;t want.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://newoldstamp.com/email-signature-examples/&quot;>;sample email signature&lt;/a>; that hits on all three things described above nicely.

Keep the colors simple and consistent.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Branding is most effective when it&#39;s consistent — and that includes your email signature. Adding color to your email signature is a nice touch that&#39;ll help it stand out from the rest of your email. But if you do choose to use color, be sure to stick to one or two in addition to dark text.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Use subtle highlights to match your logo or branding, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/brittanyhodak&quot;>;Brittany Hodak&lt;/a>; does in her email signature, below. Notice how her social media icons are the same blue hue as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://zinepak.com/&quot;>;ZinePak&lt;/a>; logo.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/professional-email-signatures_6.webp?width=313&amp;amp;height=234&amp;amp;name=professional-email-signatures_6.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Professional email signature example by Brittany Hodak with multiple colors&quot; width=&quot;313&quot; height=&quot;234&quot; style=&quot;width: 313px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Use design hierarchy.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Good design is all about presenting your information in an easily digestible manner. Because your email signature is likely more a list of information than it is a compelling story, you&#39;ll want to use hierarchy to direct readers&#39; eyes to what they should be reading first.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scale your name up to a larger font so that it attracts the most attention, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/resume-format-tips?__hstc=45788219.7a8e373dcdf4afab74c1ec6781de1784.1650465797294.1650465797294.1650465797294.1&amp;amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1650465797296&amp;amp;__hsfp=4140801928&amp;amp;_ga=2.162337721.481601421.1650465796-20625558.1650465796&quot;>;like you would on a resume&lt;/a>;. Then, pick and choose information to bold and color based on importance so you can help guide people&#39;s eyes logically through the design.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Make links trackable.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;So you put a few links in your email signature, including your CTA and your social media icons. But is anyone actually clicking on them?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To figure out whether the links in your signature are actually attracting clicks and making an impact, you&#39;ll want to make those links trackable — just like you would any other link in your emails.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht?__hstc=45788219.7a8e373dcdf4afab74c1ec6781de1784.1650465797294.1650465797294.1650465797294.1&amp;amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1650465797296&amp;amp;__hsfp=4140801928&amp;amp;_ga=2.200154923.481601421.1650465796-20625558.1650465796&quot;>;Follow these instructions&lt;/a>; to easily make a tracking link that helps you attribute traffic to your website to your email signature. From time to time, you might switch up the format of your signature or the wording inside your signature to see what drives the most clicks.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Use space dividers.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Although you never want to jam-pack your email signature for too much information, there are ways to fit a lot of text into a compact area like this one without compromising design.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is helpful for breaking up different types of information, like your name and contact information, your logo, any calls-to-action you have, or even a disclaimer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using space dividers within your design, as in the example below, is one great way to do this. You can also use glyph dividers, which is the vertical bar symbol (ie, |.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/professional-email-signatures_4.webp?width=500&amp;amp;height=150&amp;amp;name=professional-email-signatures_4.webp&quot; alt=&quot;email signature for Evelyn Castiger with a space divider between photo on the left and text on the right&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 500px;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://venngage.com/blog/email-newsletter-templates/&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;>;Image Source&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;6. Include an international prefix in your contact number.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If you work with people around the world, don&#39;t forget the prefix for your country&#39;s code when you list your contact phone number. Many people overlook this if they aren&#39;t used to dialing international prefixes themselves, but it&#39;s really helpful for your international colleagues and clients to have it right there. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/international-calling-codes.htm&quot;>;Here&#39;s a list of country codes&lt;/a>; if you don&#39;t know yours.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here&#39;s an example from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/kit-smith-38b14282&quot;>;Kit Smith&lt;/a>;, formerly of Brandwatch, a company that has offices in both the United States and Europe and works with international clients. Including the US country code makes it easier for folks in other countries to reach him by phone.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/professional-email-signatures_8.webp?width=468&amp;amp;height=215&amp;amp;name=professional-email-signatures_8.webp&quot; alt=&quot;email signature for kit smith with international country code&quot; width=&quot;468&quot; height=&quot;215&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 468px;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;7. Make your design mobile-friendly.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;According to Truelist,&lt;a href=&quot;https://truelist.co/blog/mobile-email-statistics&quot;>; over a third of professionals&lt;/a>; open emails on their phone making it a prime method of communication for business and professional matters.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more people who read email on mobile devices, the more you&#39;ll want to keep mobile users top-of-mind when you&#39;re writing emails — including your email signature.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One major way to make your email signature mobile-friendly is to make your signature&#39;s design easy to read and clickable for mobile users. This is where scale becomes really important. Make sure your text is large enough to read on small mobile screens, and that your links and buttons are large enough — and spaced out enough — for folks to tap on with their fingers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Check out the example below, and note how much space there is between different clickable elements like the social media icons. These are great for tapping with your finger on a mobile screen so that users don&#39;t accidentally tap on the Facebook icon when they meant to go to Twitter.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/professional-email-signatures_2.webp?width=400&amp;amp;height=271&amp;amp;name=professional-email-signatures_2.webp&quot; alt=&quot;email signature for tyler adams with padded space between social icons&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;271&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 400px;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://designschool.canva.com/blog/best-email-signature-design/&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;>;Image Source&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;8. Use an email signature generator.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;ve tried all of these steps and you&#39;re still not happy with how your email signature turned out, don&#39;t fret. These digital sign-offs can be tricky to get perfect. Try a free email signature generator to do the heavy lifting for you instead.&lt;/p>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto; max-width: 650px;&quot;>; &lt;div class=&quot;hs-embed-content-wrapper&quot;>; &lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.5%; margin: 0px;&quot;>; &lt;iframe style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qWt3AH22Mh8?feature=oembed&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;113&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen>;&lt;/iframe>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Rather than choosing the colors, fonts, and layout yourself, this generator gives you several combinations to choose from. Simply add your information, photos, and links. Then choose your colors. Once you&#39;re satisfied with your email signature, you can add it to your email account right away.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;9. Check your new email signature for quality.&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Finally, as with any part of an email, make sure your signature looks as good as you think it does by testing it with various email clients. Microsoft Outlook doesn&#39;t recognize background images, for example, so avoid using those. Other email clients don&#39;t load images by default at all.&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;Professional Email Signature Examples&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Now that you know how to create an email signature, it&#39;s time to get some inspiration. Here are some of our favorite examples.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. Vertical Email Signature Example&lt;/h3>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/email-signature-generator&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/professional-email-signature-example-vertical-hubspot.png?width=500&amp;amp;height=529&amp;amp;name=professional-email-signature-example-vertical-hubspot.png&quot; alt=&quot;professional email signature example: vertical layout by hubspot&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;529&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 500px;&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/email-signature-generator&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;>;Create an email signature just like this one with HubSpot&#39;s free signature generator! &lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;d like your email signature to be low-effort and high impact while drawing attention to a call-to-action, look no further than this email signature example. Set in a vertical layout, it not only includes social links for the owner, but it uses space effectively to pull the viewer&#39;s eye to the CTA button at the bottom.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of its narrow width, this email signature is ideal if many of your recipients will be opening their email on a mobile device (which is more than guaranteed, since most of us check our email on our phones). The best part? You can create your own signature using this exact same layout using our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/email-signature-generator&quot;>;free email signature generator&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. Beige Professional Email Signature Example&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/professional-email-signature-example-beige-image.png?width=500&amp;amp;height=246&amp;amp;name=professional-email-signature-example-beige-image.png&quot; alt=&quot;professional email signature example: beige image&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;246&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canva.com/p/templates/EAFYqjnZ7-4-white-beige-modern-elegant-aesthetic-photo-email-signature/&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;>;Image Source&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This beautiful email signature example is image-based, and while we don&#39;t recommend using image files for your signature, it still deserves a spot on this list. Available as an image template on Canva, this example drew our eye due to its lovely layout, fonts, and colors.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The primary benefit of using an image as an email signature is that the fonts don&#39;t change, allowing you to create a stronger branding story. Remember: The font is determined by the recipient&#39;s email client, not by you. If you&#39;re at all worried about that, consider using an image like this one. At the bottom, or in the alt text, you might include your contact information in plain text.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. Shorthand Email Signature Example&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/professional-email-signature-example-shorthand.png?width=500&amp;amp;height=256&amp;amp;name=professional-email-signature-example-shorthand.png&quot; alt=&quot;professional email signatures: shorthand casual example&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;256&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mysignature.io/editor&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;>;Image Source&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This simple email signature example, created by the team over at mysignature.io, uses shorthand to identify each piece of the sender&#39;s contact information. The owner&#39;s email and mobile phone are designated with the letters e and m, respectively.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This trendy move can differentiate your email signature from the rest; we recommend it if you&#39;re specifically in a more informal or casual industry. The only thing we might advise against is using such a light font and icon color, which might be more difficult for colorblind viewers to read.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;4. Professor Email Signature Example&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/professional-email-signature-example-professor.png?width=500&amp;amp;height=246&amp;amp;name=professional-email-signature-example-professor.png&quot; alt=&quot;professional email signature example: professor signature&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;246&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mysignature.io/editor&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;>;Image Source&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We love this modern, eye-catching email signature example for a professor, which features a CTA, a line of social media buttons, and a paragraph of boilerplate GDPR language — which is critical in industries where you may require recipients&#39; private data.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In doing research for this post, we found countless email signature examples for professors and workers in academia. This one, by far, wins the prize in terms of design, professionality, and utility.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. Instagram Influencer Email Signature Example&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/professional-email-signature-example-influencer.png?width=500&amp;amp;height=401&amp;amp;name=professional-email-signature-example-influencer.png&quot; alt=&quot;professional email signature example for influencer&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;401&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mysignature.io/editor&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;>;Image Source&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether you&#39;re an influencer on Instagram, YouTube, or TikTok, it&#39;s essential to still have a professional email signature — especially if you often seek corporate partnerships and deals. This email signature example provides the person&#39;s name, title, and contact information, as well as a clever prompt for the recipient to download her media kit.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even more importantly, it includes a button at the bottom to “Like her on Instagram” — which is essential for professionals whose main &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/choosing-kpis&quot;>;key performance indicators&lt;/a>; are engagement metrics.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;6. Simple Email Signature Example&lt;/h3>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/email-signature-generator&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/professional-email-signature-example-simple-hubspot.png?width=500&amp;amp;height=359&amp;amp;name=professional-email-signature-example-simple-hubspot.png&quot; alt=&quot;professional email signature example: simple layout by hubspot&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;359&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;Create an email signature just like this one with HubSpot&#39;s free signature generator! &lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When in doubt, keep it simple. This email signature sample, available as a template in our free signature generator, includes all essential pieces of information with plenty of space in between. Your signature doesn&#39;t have to be crowded and packed into just a few lines. It&#39;s the last opportunity you have to make an impact, so it stands to reason that you can take your time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the bottom, the signature includes your social links for those who&#39;d like to learn more about you or your company. And if you edit it using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/email-signature-generator&quot;>;HubSpot&#39;s free email signature generator&lt;/a>;, you&#39;ll find that you can add a photo of yourself, a CTA button, and more.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;7. Formal Academia Email Signature Example&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/professional-email-signature-example-university.png?width=500&amp;amp;height=227&amp;amp;name=professional-email-signature-example-university.png&quot; alt=&quot;professional email signature example: university and academia&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;227&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://webtools.illinois.edu/webservices/public/ds/signaturedocs/customization_guide.pdf&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;>;Image Source&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If ever in need of a formal email signature, look to this example for inspiration. Created by the University of Illinois as guidance to its employees, this email signature example is effective, simple, and frills-free.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a more “fun” academic email signature, look to the other example from a professor in this list. But if you work in a traditional industry, this is a great example to follow. We like that it includes a privacy disclosure at the bottom, which is especially important to include if you ever plan to share your emails with anyone.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;8. Real Estate Email Signature Example&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/professional-email-signature-example-real-estate.png?width=500&amp;amp;height=316&amp;amp;name=professional-email-signature-example-real-estate.png&quot; alt=&quot;professional email signatures: real estate agent&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;316&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mysignature.io/editor&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;>;Image Source&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This real estate email signature example made us wish we worked in real estate. But you can always adjust it to your needs using mysignature.io&#39;s tool. The profile photo includes a cool modern shading effect, and the social buttons at the bottom are more prominent, making this a fantastic fit if you&#39;d like to draw more attention to your social accounts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The one piece we&#39;d reconsider with this example, if you&#39;re going to use it as inspiration, is that the CTA is too close to the other two social buttons. If you&#39;d like your call-to-action to have the entirety of your recipient&#39;s attention, consider using small social buttons instead.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;9. School Teacher Professional Email Signature Example&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/professional-email-signature-example-teacher.png?width=500&amp;amp;height=322&amp;amp;name=professional-email-signature-example-teacher.png&quot; alt=&quot;professional email signature example: teacher&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;322&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 12px;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mysignature.io/editor&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;>;Image Source&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With or without the image, this email signature example is a winner. It uses both bold and regular text to create a sense of structure, and includes boilerplate language about the confidentiality of the email. We like that the language at the bottom is in a lighter font, keeping the attention off of it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This example is great to follow if you don&#39;t need to have a CTA in your email signature. Most professionals who aren&#39;t in sales don&#39;t need one — though it&#39;s always good to leave your recipient with an action they need to take.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;10. Horizontal Email Signature Example&lt;/h3>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/email-signature-generator&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/professional-email-signature-example-horizontal-hubspot.png?width=500&amp;amp;height=258&amp;amp;name=professional-email-signature-example-horizontal-hubspot.png&quot; alt=&quot;professional email signature example: horizontal layout by hubspot&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;258&quot; style=&quot;height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 500px;&quot;>;Create an email signature just like this one with HubSpot&#39;s free signature generator! &lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take this spacious email signature example as inspiration if you&#39;d like to include plenty of information — while also keeping the attention on your CTA all the way to the right. Available as a template on HubSpot&#39;s email signature generator, this example also has space at the left for you to include social links.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We like it for its simplicity and customizability.

Here, we&#39;re going to explore:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;#what-is-an-affiliate-program-1&quot;>;What is an Affiliate Program?&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;#how-do-affiliate-make-money-2&quot;>;How do affiliates make money?&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;#types-of-affiliate-programs-3&quot;>;Types of Affiliate Programs&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;#best-networks-for-beginners-4&quot;>;Best Affiliate Marketing Networks for Beginners&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;#best-affiliate-programs-5&quot;>;Best Affiliate Programs&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;&lt;a href=&quot;#resources-6&quot;>;Resources for Getting Started with an Affiliate Marketing Program&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To further understand affiliate programs, let&#39;s consider an example. &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewirecutter.com/about/&quot;>;Wirecutter.com&lt;/a>;, a New York Times company, is a website that lists product recommendations for shoppers. Wirecutter largely earns commission based on affiliate relationships with retailers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The publication&#39;s affiliate monetization model might make you doubt the legitimacy of its recommendations — but, in fact, it&#39;s quite the opposite.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wirecutter only makes commission when a reader purchases a product from an affiliate retailer and doesn&#39;t return the product. Wirecutter, then, has no incentive to promote inferior products. If they did, they&#39;d make less money and turn away readers.&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h3>;How do affiliates make money?&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;The affiliate gets a unique link (an &quot;affiliate link&quot;) from which clicks can be tracked — typically using cookies. The cookie then tracks the user to see if they make a purchase. If they do within an allotted amount of time, then the affiliate will earn commission.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Each cookie has a &quot;length&quot; or &quot;cookie life&quot;, which simply defines how long the cookie will be tracking the user&#39;s online activity.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, if a cookie has a 30-day life, your referral needs to make a purchase within 30-days of clicking your affiliate link in order for you to get paid — otherwise the lead will no longer be trackable.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re interested in starting an affiliate program, there are different types of affiliate programs, and you&#39;ll want to pick the one best-suited for your business. Let&#39;s dive into the types of affiliate programs, next.&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;h2>;Types of Affiliate Programs&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re looking to promote products or services, there are a few affiliate programs you can consider. When choosing an affiliate program, you&#39;ll want to keep in mind the avenues or platforms where your audience spends the majority of their time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, does your buyer persona typically read blog posts, scroll Facebook, or use search engines when researching new products?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alternatively, is your buyer persona someone who&#39;s always looking for a good deal, and would appreciate a link on a coupon site? Or are they more interested in doing tons of research before purchasing, making your promotion efforts more worthwhile on a review site?&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While those are questions you&#39;ll have to consider for yourself, let&#39;s take a look at some general types of affiliate programs so you can begin brainstorming potential avenues for your own marketing efforts:&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Search Affiliates&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;With this program, marketers pay their own money to promote affiliate offers on search results or other online advertising platforms like Facebook Advertising. This is a great option for marketers with an SEO background and want to A/B test to see which ads result in the most referrals — and ROI.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Influencer Programs&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;If you&#39;re a blogger or social media influencer who engages with a specific audience, consider partnering with a company whose products would appeal to them.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, if you are a food blogger or YouTube influencer who creates recipe content, consider partnering with a company that sells kitchen appliances by featuring their product in your content in exchange for commission for every product sold via your affiliate link.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ideally, this would result in additional revenue if your audience likes the products you&#39;re promoting.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Review Sites&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Blind buying products online can be daunting for consumers, which is why they often turn to review sites during the buyer&#39;s journey so they can conduct research before purchasing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Review sites partner with individual companies or &lt;a href=&quot;https://instapage.com/affiliate&quot;>;affiliate networks&lt;/a>; to review products and services in exchange for an affiliate link.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Coupon Sites&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Similar to review sites, coupon sites partner with companies to provide buyers with discounts on products and services in exchange for a kickback.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Email Marketing&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;This is best in small doses. You don&#39;t want to send out bulk emails to an audience who isn&#39;t interested in promoted products or services. However, with proper consideration for who&#39;s receiving the email, this could be an effective method.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For instance, if you work for a marketing agency, you could partner with a company that sells design tools and include an affiliate within emails you send to design clients. This could help your clients create higher-quality content while providing an added source of revenue.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Affiliate Networks&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Instead of offering products from only one company, affiliate networks act as a marketplace and provide a larger pool of brands and offers to choose from.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This option may appeal to beginner affiliate marketers because you don&#39;t have to manage as many partnerships at once. Plus, there&#39;s no limit on how many affiliate networks you can join, so the possibilities are endless.&lt;/p>; &lt;a>;&lt;/a>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Getting started with affiliate marketing as a beginner can be overwhelming. There&#39;s just so many options to choose from! Below, we&#39;ll explore the top affiliate programs that you can join as a beginner.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/&quot;>;Amazon Associates&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bBOLdXQx8oNX6JX9fBjZm7tLRdYm9lsNYbFG-2rmRfQhcL47rhoPxx9Qrwrd8XlwWPD-UYzfqy56pFaPlcw_-WLcg7g00BJuFYrify9_t1B7rz08v5KSsKjmMVpH5Y6ROZiJNe_mxNvWb7eaOkD1HSo&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; alt=&quot;best affiliate programs: amazon associates&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Commission:&lt;/span>; 1-10% (depending on the product category)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Cookie life:&lt;/span>; 24 hours&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amazon is one of the most popular online shopping platforms, so if you&#39;re looking to buy something, chances are you&#39;ll find it on Amazon.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amazon Associates get commissions between 1% and 10%, depending on the category the product purchased falls under. The most valuable items to promote are clothes and luxury beauty products, both of which &lt;a href=&quot;https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/node/topic/GRXPHT8U84RAYDXZ&quot;>;can earn you a 10% cut on the price&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the main advantages of doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/amazon-affiliate&quot;>;affiliate marketing with Amazon&lt;/a>; is that people already know the company and love to shop there, so it&#39;s not a hard sell. The company has very high conversion rates, especially around the holidays. And because the product selection is so vast, it fits most kinds of businesses.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you write about animals, for instance, you can promote cat treats or dog toys. If your audience is interested in cars, you can recommend jumper cables — you get the idea.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Additionally, if someone ends up on Amazon through your link and buys something other than what your content links to, you still get commission on the user&#39;s entire cart. The only downside is some categories have particularly low commissions, such as video games and electronics.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For businesses with large audiences, Amazon recently launched its new &lt;a href=&quot;https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/influencers&quot;>;Amazon Influencer Program&lt;/a>; as an extension to the Associates program for social media influencers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jf5qOiC4I0Lj02VLmYUxcj7h4wz7tlT7ptyAetzvko08eZesay0E5ZPzZgM1Qaq-SQ8ET2wdprG1NqQHK5IjjGBFX6NVMaBCrIIuc-RvdBPYITkHL41c-VxRJk_4_JLJOPgkCZXt2Et_v0YIYe9jaOk&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; alt=&quot;amazon influencers program&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You get similar benefits to the online Associates program, as well as your own page on Amazon with a unique URL to showcase the products you recommend to your followers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, you must have a YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook account to qualify. Amazon looks at the number of followers and other engagement metrics of your social media accounts to determine whether you&#39;re eligible for the program.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://partnernetwork.ebay.com/&quot;>;eBay Partner Network&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6T-tGgV4pm-WIqV0xsOUR61Cid_hj3hqw6nKiKpL5uqg4F7JReufoWpiR8K6eRZgEUeOU7e3bPy1-D1nVK2P_0SXkbb_DHvxxQE0L0501dD5tnc_PaxX_BWd9WVCFpOIcEGuDbIeMVQ7oKfGwptF9Ho&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; alt=&quot;best affiliate networks: ebay partner network&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Commission:&lt;/span>; 1-4%, depending on the category&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Cookie life:&lt;/span>; 24 hours&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With over one billion listings from a wide range of product categories, eBay&#39;s affiliate program shares a lot of the same advantages as Amazon&#39;s — well-known brand, high conversion rates, and a diverse selection of products.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The eBay Partner Network pays a commission of 1% to 4%. You earn a percentage of the revenue eBay earns from that purchase, based on the product category.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;High-ticket items you can promote fall under Parts &amp;amp; Accessories, or Fashion. You can have a look at the complete rate card here. The one downside of this program is that it offers a cap for each category — with most falling well under $1,000. Your earning potential is thus limited.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://rakutenadvertising.com/&quot;>;Rakuten Advertising&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/74n2uT0vSOI-U3iufZv-9br5u-Yh5UiCHZRycX1jCSlyham0r39yyRvVofbSGofnZF102H0k9K-Wo9FjOlFOmjX8OjDGGWX6TJoJ6keKVvxJzqh9bvfognDIdsbcOWaOMhYw3Vq96E0XYc1IK2aQslM&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;327&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; alt=&quot;best affiliate networks: rakuten advertising&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Commission:&lt;/span>; Depends on the merchant&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Cookie life:&lt;/span>; Depends on the merchant&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Formerly known as Linkshare, Rakuten is one of the oldest affiliate networks in the game.

Think recurring revenue of 20-100% of a sale for the lifetime of the customer you helped create.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through the in-app dashboard, you&#39;ll be able to easily monitor your performance across all of the programs that you are currently part of. Built-in partner engagement features like challenges, in-app messaging, learning materials, etc… allow for more connectivity and engagement with the partner program managers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like with other affiliate networks, you will need to apply to each individual partner program separately, but you&#39;ll be paid out altogether once a month via Paypal or Stripe once you hit the network&#39;s $5 payout threshold.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you are looking to work with top-tier B2B companies that provide higher commission and conversion rates, the PartnerStack Network should be the first place you start your search for affiliate marketing programs.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;5. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cj.com/&quot;>;CJ Affiliate&lt;/a>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/x2U_9zJebIjggap8A-JtbexF4RvLG0WJUSVXAEEIvnUMvYh2PUxShJCC3A6bxmUJCF-ISc5ADcdDEKnShLZy3zUjRDplHsAhPnVERHYGqiw3fuCCEazyVJzfzU9SInpzkZBhVhG_Wkll3uE9KE-8fNo&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;332&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;&quot; alt=&quot;best affiliate networks: cj affiliate&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Commission:&lt;/span>; Depends on the merchant&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Cookie life:&lt;/span>; Depends on the merchant&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;CJ Affiliate (formerly known as Commission Junction) is one of the most popular affiliate networks out there, holding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/affiliate-networks--69&quot;>;7.69% of the market share&lt;/a>;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the benefits of using CJ Affiliates is its selection of brand partnerships which cover many verticals including retail, travel, finance, and network &amp;amp; home services.

Content that drew predominantly female audiences has ruled the box office and live events space:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;Greta Gerwig&#39;s &lt;em>;Barbie&lt;/em>; has earned over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a44611602/barbie-oppenheimer-box-office-how-much/&quot;>;$1.28B&lt;/a>; at the box office since its release in July&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Beyoncé&#39;s &lt;em>;Renaissance &lt;/em>;tour impacted inflation rates in the UK and Sweden and is expected to bring in over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/beyonce-net-worth-7644298&quot;>;$2B&lt;/a>;, the highest generated by a female act&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Taylor Swift&#39;s &lt;em>;Eras&lt;/em>; tour has already earned $1B and is expected to help circulate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/barbie-beyonce-and-taylor-swift-and-the-rising-power-of-the-female-dollar-9acba515&quot;>;$5B&lt;/a>; across the global economy&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;Major publications have attributed this renaissance (pun intended) of female consumer spending influenced to shifting post-pandemic habits but in reality, it&#39;s been in the works for more than a decade.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;From an economic standpoint…&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Women have held a lot of economic power for years, they were just spending money differently. It&#39;s been widely reported that for women with children, roughly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/the-ghost-statistic-that-haunts-womens-empowerment&quot;>;90%&lt;/a>; of their income goes back to their families. A staggering statistic compared to their male counterparts, who typically contribute 30-40% of their income back to their families.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Per the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/economy/consumers/the-summer-women-flexed-their-spending-power-dc2ce92c&quot;>;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a>;, major demographic shifts are impacting how women now spend money including:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;More women opting to have children later in life, if at all&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Higher workforce participation and wage increases compared to the prior decade&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;Evolving gender roles in the household&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;In other words, women have more money and more agency over how they spend it than ever before, and female audiences are spending on goods and experiences that align with their personal interests.&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Women-centered Marketing&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s no wonder Barbie, Beyoncé, and Taylor Swift have seen so much success — all three have effectively used women-centered marketing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even before audiences knew that the &lt;em>;Barbie&lt;/em>; movie&#39;s plot was about examining the patriarchy, the marketing was clearly geared towards a female audience. Viewers were drawn in by the numerous &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/barbie-oppenheimer-movie-marketing&quot;>;cross-collaborations&lt;/a>; with their favorite brands, a catchy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.billboard.com/pro/nicki-minaj-ice-spice-barbie-world-number-1-rhythmic-airplay-chart/&quot;>;theme song&lt;/a>; that was trending on TikTok for most of the summer, and sheer nostalgia over their own childhoods.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, arguably two of the most popular musicians on the planet with extensive music catalogs focused on women&#39;s empowerment, used social media to rally their predominantly female audiences around their subsequent tours.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only have they had some of the highest-grossing tours in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2023/08/11/1193283472/barbie-taylor-swift-beyonce&quot;>;history&lt;/a>;, but their audiences have also pumped &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/11/business/beyonce-taylor-swift-tour-spending.html&quot;>;millions of dollars&lt;/a>; into local economies at every stop. After all, fans aren&#39;t just shelling out money for tickets. They&#39;re also paying for travel accommodations, (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackenterprise.com/beyonce-increases-small-business-sales-after-silver-outfit-request/&quot;>;often sparkly&lt;/a>;) clothing, and other goods and services to enhance their concert-going experience. The economic domino effect across industries is hard to ignore.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s not just entertainment, women&#39;s sports have also had a record-breaking year:&lt;/p>; &lt;ul>; &lt;li>;The first half of this year&#39;s WNBA season has drawn &lt;a href=&quot;https://frontofficesports.com/wnba-journey-at-midseason-reveals-unprecedented-success-and-unfinished-business/&quot;>;record&lt;/a>; viewers and sponsorships&lt;/li>; &lt;li>;The women&#39;s FIFA World Cup also brought in record viewership from across the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/29/08/2023/bein-sports-reveals-record-breaking-viewership-for-fifa-womens-world-cup&quot;>;globe&lt;/a>;&lt;/li>; &lt;/ul>; &lt;p>;The key takeaway for marketers isn&#39;t to go all-in on content related to toys or to push pink, sequined merch. It&#39;s that when customer groups feel seen, heard, and understood, they show up in a big way. Barbie, Beyoncé, and Taylor showed us that it&#39;s always a win when you can make that happen.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a class=&quot;cta_button&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=21ecd91a-e772-4550-ac36-8617d800295f&amp;amp;pid=53&amp;amp;ecid=&amp;amp;hseid=&amp;amp;hsic=&quot;>;&lt;img class=&quot;hs-cta-img &quot; style=&quot;height: auto !important; width: auto !important; max-width: 100% !important;border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; &quot; alt=&quot;New call-to-action&quot; height=&quot;613&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; src=&quot;https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/21ecd91a-e772-4550-ac36-8617d800295f.png&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;amp;k=14&amp;amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwomen-consumer-spending&amp;amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;amp;bvt=rss&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; &quot;>;</content:encoded><category> Marketing News</category><pubDate> Wed, 30 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><author> lalfred@hubspot.com (Lestraundra Alfred)</author><guid> https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/women-consumer-spending</guid><dc:date> 2023-08-30T11:00:00Z</dc:date></item></channel></rss>
