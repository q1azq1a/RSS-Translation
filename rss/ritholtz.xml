500 指数的表现时犯了一个新手错误：<em>他遗漏了股息，从而忽略了大部分回报</em>。</p><p>我回复了这条推文<sup>1</sup> ，礼貌地指出我的同事本<a href="https://twitter.com/awealthofcs">·卡尔森 (Ben Carlson)</a>此前曾解释过，“自 1928 年以来，包括股息在内的股市回报率比单纯的股价回报<a href="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2023/01/how-dividends-juice-your-returns-in-the-stock-market/">率高出 70%</a> 。”</p><p>事实上，股息是您长期持有股票的一个主要原因。 “总回报比单独的价格回报高出约 35 倍。” <sup>2</sup></p><p>但这就是事情变得有趣的地方。庞普指出：</p><blockquote><p> “然而，我认为传统上引用的总回报率并不是人们因税收而在经纪账户中实际获得的回报率。另外，考虑到你必须在大多数经纪账户中打开 DRIP，我想知道还有多少百分比的投资者进行再投资（已经查看过，但似乎在任何地方都找不到这个数字）。”</p></blockquote><p>我之前曾讨论过税收阿尔法（<em>请参阅</em><a href="https://ritholtz.com/2022/04/tax-alpha/">此</a>和<a href="https://ritholtz.com/2021/04/accessing-losses-via-direct-indexing/">此</a>）；显然，包括加密货币在内的其他资产类别也存在同样的情况（或更糟）。</p><p>但 Pomp 间接提出了一个非常不同的问题：<em>为什么人们的资产表现不佳？</em>他本质上指的是行为金融学的整个领域。</p><p> <a href="https://ritholtz.com/category/behavioral-finance-psychology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BeFin</a>解释了为什么人们持有的股票表现不佳。</p><p> <a

最初是在正常价格时期买入的，例如，不追新热点，在历史高点附近买入； 3) 不得过早出售、交易或以其他方式干扰复利的力量。</p><p>它是“<em><a href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/01/simple-but-hard/">简单但困难</a></em><strong>”——</strong>抽象上很简单，但在现实世界中执行起来却很困难。我们大多数人缺乏有效地做到这一点的理解、纪律和技能。<a href="https://behaviorgap.com/">卡尔·理查兹</a>将其称为“<em>行为差距”</em> ，这个描述词完美地总结了这些挑战。</p><p>如果您更注重视觉，请考虑下面两张来自摩根大通<a href="https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/market-insights/guide-to-the-markets/">市场季度指南的</a>图表。它们显示了普通投资者缺乏纪律给他们带来的回报损失有多大。资产类别回报与投资者回报之间的表现不佳就是行为差距。</p><p>过去 10 年（2012 年至 2021 年），SPX 的年回报率为 16.6%，但普通投资者每年仅获得 8.7% 的回报。在此期间，典型投资者获得了市场收益的一半左右：</p><p> <a href="https://ritholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/10-Year-annnual-returns-.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img

RITHOLTZ：顺便说一句，对于一个没有太多经验的年轻作家来说，你的东西非常紧凑和有力。你的声音很好听。</p><p>米安：所以，在我推出《流浪反思》之前，你实际上发表了我的作品，而你发表的最后一篇文章是我的辞职信，这确实是一种鼓舞人心、热情洋溢、流畅的文字，讲述了我为什么要离开工作去展开我的个人传奇，因为我正在思考那段受《炼金术士》启发的时光。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么让我们来谈谈今天的杂散反射是什么以及您的客户是谁。告诉我们一些关于您的研究的信息。</p><p> MIAN：Stray Reflections 是一个宏观咨询和社区，与世界各地的投资组合经理、首席信息官合作。他们依靠我来挑战他们的信念，扩展他们的知识，帮助他们以不同的方式思考世界，而我通过不同的方式做到这一点。首先是我的研究、我的写作以及我被允许进行反思。我不会每天或每周发布。我不会对事件做出反应。我可以深刻反思正在发生的事情。</p><p>所以每隔两三次，我会写一些有趣的话题或主题。我们通过在线活动来做到这一点。因此，我将就特定主题采访社区中的某个人。我并不声称自己是所有领域的专家，但如果生物技术、中国、美联储政策或人工智能领域发生了一些有趣的事情，我们将举办一个沙龙，一个在线沙龙，我们可以在其中讨论想法。</p><p>我认为核心部分就是全年活动。每六周去一次纽约、伦敦、迈阿密、香港、新加坡、洛杉矶、旧金山、迪拜，我们会在某个地方吃晚餐或早餐，我们都会交换想法。一个核心原则是我们所有人都比任何人都聪明，我真的很倾向于这一点，所以我从社区中学到了很多东西。</p><p>第四个元素就像一个松弛小组，每个人都可以实时交换想法。</p><p>第五个也是最重要的元素就是一对一的对话。我坚信建立牢固的关系，这就是发展飞轮研究理念的原因。了解人们在想什么、关心什么。这激励我专注于我需要写的内容。</p><p>简而言之，这就是我们所做的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么，我们将详细讨论长期牛市和熊市。是什么导致了导致泡沫的时代精神。我们将讨论很多非常有趣的事情。市场价格反映了什么，没有反映什么？我们等待已久的令人讨厌的衰退到底在哪里？</p><p>但现在我想坚持这样一个事实：与传统的战略家或宏观经济学家不同，你为战略和分析的世界带来了非常具体的哲学倾向，这是我非常感兴趣的。是什么促使这种方法来撰写有关经济、美联储或人工智能等枯燥技术主题的文章？</p><p>米安：我的意思是，一些最伟大的作家，巴里，拥有与他们的经历非常奇怪的才能。如果你想想赫尔曼·梅尔维尔，他就无法忍受船上的生活。他写了《白鲸》。欧内斯特·海明威虽然远离战争，但他成为了有史以来最伟大的战时作家。杰克·凯鲁亚克以游牧闻名，他在母亲家里写下了《在路上》。简·奥斯汀仍然单身，但她成为了受人尊敬的求爱、爱情和婚姻的编年史。你知道，艾米莉·勃朗特喜欢独来独往，但当她写《呼啸山庄》时，人们认为这是一个男人写的，因为她描绘了一个如此恶毒残酷的世界。艾米莉·狄金森，你知道，她喜欢独处，在她的诗歌中，她揭示了宇宙的秘密。</p><p>所以当我问自己这个问题时，我有资格提供投资建议吗？我意识到，在所有这些情况下，他们与主题的距离并没有削弱他们的可信度。这只会让他们更加好奇，并以其他人可能不会的方式进行检查。所以在很长一段时间里，我实际上认为我的非传统背景，我不是常春藤盟校的学生，我没有在投资银行接受过培训，我没有为对冲基金工作，我的职业生涯是从银行出纳员开始的。在很长一段时间里，我都认为非传统的背景是一种缺点。但多年来，在社区的帮助和鼓励下，我意识到，这实际上是一种核心优势，因为你怎么能以不同于绝大多数西方出生和训练有素的分析师的方式看待世界呢？</p><p> RITHOLTZ：你说“以不同的方式看待世界”这句话很有趣。最近《华尔街日报》的一篇文章说，90%的投行经济学家都毕业于同一六所研究生院。这意味着，尽管我们愿意认为存在一些思想差异，但本质上是同一家工厂生产相同的小部件。他们或多或少都说了同样的话，我们对此并不感到惊讶。</p><p>我们将谈论永远即将到来但似乎永远不会到来的经济衰退。但这似乎与具有相同背景的同一群人将产生相同的投资结果密切相关。这或多或少公平吗？</p><p>面：我不能和别人说话。我知道-</p><p> RITHOLTZ：嗯，你真是太慷慨了。</p><p>米安：但可以肯定的是，当我创办这家公司时，我意识到我所做的事情并不独特，因为还有很多其他人在撰写有关市场的观点，但我是独一无二的。因此，我一直坚持从个人空间进行写作，真正培养写作技巧，真正客观地审视市场，在我的分析中变得非常不可知论，而不是意识形态和经验主义，而不是教条主义。</p><p>所以我不在乎是一致的还是逆向的，看涨还是看跌。我只想独立并了解真相。</p><p>里索兹：所以在你的很多著作中，你引用了老子、佛陀、孔子、塞内卡。这是各种各样的影响。是什么让您认识了这群思想家？这些伟大的哲学家如何影响您对市场问题的思考？</p><p>面：你看，我认为生活和市场是交织在一起的。市场中最大的风险是自我。我想说生命中最大的风险是自我。市场和生活中最大的美德就是谦虚。我常说，成功的投资只有在了解自己的情况下才有可能。所以我认为对我来说，当我开始写作时，这既是一个自我探究的过程，也是一个审视市场的过程。你会看到重叠和相似之处以及不断出现的偏见和常见错误。你只需要不断培养更好的自己并不断进步。</p><p>我觉得关于古代智慧有很多话可说。好像所有的事情都已经说过了，但是没有人听，所以又被报道了，又被说了一遍。</p><p>所以我从古代圣贤、诗人、哲学家的美德、智慧中受益匪浅。我认为它可以帮助我看清世界。你知道，我相信我们的内心越清晰，我们看待事物的能力就越清晰。所以你引用的所有这些人都在帮助我成为一个更好的人，意识到我的偏见，并且只是，是的，成为一个更清晰的思考者。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么让我们来谈谈自我和谦逊。所有最好的投资者都认识到自己的错误，没有人能击中一千个，我们都经常犯错误。 Ray Dalio 的《原理》一书本质上是一篇关于 Go 尝试某件事、犯一个错误、从错误中吸取教训并融入到你的过程中、再试一次的论文。</p><p>但即使大声说出来，听起来仍然相当激进。为什么我们不能接受这样一个事实：投资是一门令人谦卑的艺术，需要其从业者保持谦逊？</p><p>米安：巴里，我的想法是再次从精神角度出发，所有的先知都做了这个特殊的祈祷。 “哦上帝，请让我们看到事物本来的样子。”所以对我来说，目标是看到事物本来的样子，而不是我想要的样子。所以当我使用“应该”这样的词时，我什至会注意自己。市场应该这样运作。我认为这是虚伪的。市场不应该以这样或那样的方式表现。就是这样，对吧？所以我有一个特定的观点，你有你的观点，然后有一个神圣的观点，或者市场观点。那么如何才能接近这个事实呢？只有摆脱你自己，摆脱你的自我，坚持市场以特定的方式运行。我很好奇，你知道吗？这是一个很大的区别。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：我总是想到各种策略师、经济学家、交易员等等。我想说，这就像约翰·萨克斯关于六个盲人描述大象的诗。每个人都抓住了其中的一个小方面。哦，这个绳状的东西是尾巴，这是象牙。但很少有人能够凭借自己的优势看到整个市场。</p><p> MIAN：我认为这就是社区发挥作用的地方，对吧？因为我并不自称是大师或市场专家。我只是真的很好奇，我很高兴知道并承认我并不知道一切。坦率地说，这是我一生中最伟大的自由化之一，因为我不需要知道一切，我也不需要知道一切，我可以依赖和信任社区内的其他人。</p><p>所以我对某个特定主题没有特别强烈的看法。我会去看专家并与他或她交谈。这样我就可以依靠社区。再说一次，我们所有人都比任何人都聪明。我没有特定的自我需要以特定的方式呈现和表达。我很高兴地说，我不知道什么时候我真的不知道。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：嗯，真的很有趣。让我们来谈谈您去年八月发表的一些文章，当时正值股票和债券同年首次出现两位数低迷，在短短 40 年的时间里，您定义并讨论了长期牛市，这引起了我的强烈共鸣。在进一步讨论之前，我们先来定义一下，什么是长期牛市？</p><p>米安：所以，长期牛市将是一段时期，股票回报率高于平均水平，期间会出现回调，但回调的持续时间和幅度都比预期的要短，而且复苏很快，风险偏好上升，估值攀升或扩大，而长期熊市则反之亦然，对吗？事实上，风险偏好正在下降，下跌时间较长、深度较大，估值意味着回归。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：让我们举几个例子。</p><p>告诉我们二战后的长期牛市。您如何定义和描述那个时期？</p><p>米安：所以到了 1950 年，标准普尔 500 指数在 20 的水平上停留了大约 13、14 年。到了 20 世纪 50 年代，你终于爆发了。 1950 年至 1968 年，也就是第一个长期牛市期间，涨幅约为 450%。我们忘记了，20 世纪 50 年代是股市有史以来最好的十年。但尽管如此，整个时期实际上经历了三次衰退。有朝鲜战争，有古巴导弹危机，有种族骚乱，有3次超过20%的修正。它的债券收益率从 2.2% 升至近 6%，但股票却表现良好。那是1950年至1968年这段时期。</p><p>第二个事实，也是这一时期的有趣之处，是估值实际上在 1961 年达到顶峰。而市场却在 1968 年达到顶峰。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：换句话说，尽管市盈率下降，但价格仍在继续走高。</p><p>米安：是的，所以——</p><p>里索兹：有趣。</p><p> MIAN：估值有起有落。因此，估值的峰值是在1961年，当时市盈率是22倍，但到了1968年，即使指数停止了，市盈率也达到了18倍。这很重要，因为现在有很多关于估值的讨论。我觉得我们可能会在 2021 年看到这个周期的估值峰值，远期市盈率为 23 倍。但这并不一定意味着长期熊市已经结束。因此，我们今天所处的长期熊市始于 2013 年，当时我们最终突破了自 2000 年以来限制该指数的 1,500 点水平。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：是的，这是一个长达 13 年的长期熊市，经历了巨大的反弹和大规模的抛售，但从未突破过 2000 点的峰值。</p><p>棉：第二次牛市是从13点的4点开始的。我们上升到23点。去年10月我们在15点左右触底。而我们现在已经18岁了。再说一次，这是从 13 到 23，再到 15。我认为我们不会达到 23，但我们能达到 20、21 吗？当然，我想是的。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：所以你提到了朝鲜战争，你提到了经济衰退。写了肯尼迪遇刺事件、古巴导弹危机，发生了很多事情。我们如何将像大流行这样的无关事件置于背景中？它是否对我们说，“嘿，这个长期牛市已经结束”，或者它只是引起波动，让我们回到之前的趋势？</p><p>面：所以每次长期牛市通常都会有这样的周期中期崩盘。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：对，&#39;73，&#39;74。</p><p>面：实际上是熊市。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：当时正处于熊市之中。你是说牛市有一个长期市场。</p><p>棉：即使是长期牛市也有周期中期崩盘的权利，比如1950年到1968年的牛市，周期中期崩盘就是1961年的肯尼迪熊市，市场下跌了30%。在 1980 年至 2000 年的市场中，经历了周期中期崩盘和 1987 年崩盘。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：1987 年，1997 年，1998 年，有很多非常重要的事情。</p><p>棉：但是有没有一个事件确实让投资者感到震惊，就像1987年非常令人震惊，肯尼迪熊市的下跌非常令人震惊，发生得非常快。大流行就是这样的。从我的角度来看，这是一次周期中期的崩溃。因此，我认为更重要的是，除了我们围绕指数和突破进行的技术对话之外，从基本面的角度来看，这种流行病也产生了重大影响。因为显然长期牛市的根本性支撑，第一是家庭的财务状况比全球金融危机以来更好。</p><p>但第二点是从人口的角度来看。</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p>米安：千禧一代现在是美国人数最多的一代。如果你想想 1980 年的长期牛市，1981 年是婴儿潮一代开始年满 35 岁、进入收入高峰的时期。千禧一代从 2016 年开始这样做。这次疫情很重要，因为疫情过后，千禧一代的家庭财富增加了。</p><p>所以如果你用现在的美元来比较，那么当婴儿潮一代在 1981 年 35 岁时，他的净资产约为 136,000 美元。以今天的可比美元计算，千禧一代的收入为 128,000 美元。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：在通货膨胀调整后的基础上具有可比性。</p><p>米安：当然。更有趣的是，我认为，这种流行病造成了这种心理上的恐惧和焦虑，要求财务安全并确保你的财务未来。所以你会看到更多的购房兴趣和更多的股票参与，因为这场大流行就像这种发自内心的死亡经历。</p><p>里索兹：叫醒电话。</p><p>米安：敲响警钟，你就会想要——而金钱是安全的代表。所以你已经看到了千禧一代越来越多地参与金融市场和拥有住房的动态。就这样，在过去七年里，千禧一代的房屋拥有率从 38% 增加到了 46%。而且这一数字还将继续增加。因此，他们正在进入收入高峰期，我认为人口冲动仍然没有得到充分认识。</p><p>里索兹：有趣。咱们就来说说那80到2000年的牛市吧。有些人将其日期定为 1982 年。这取决于您查看的是道琼斯指数还是标准普尔指数。标准普尔在这 20 年期间表现如何？</p><p> MIAN：我认为在那段时间里，我们的股价可能上涨了 1700% 左右。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：1700%，因为我知道道指大约是 1000%。标准普尔的表现甚至更好。</p><p>米安：是的，我认为那段时期有趣的地方又是，87 年的崩盘，1990 年的储贷危机，海湾战争，拉美危机，亚洲危机，俄罗斯违约，94 年的大屠杀。所以你总是会遇到这些事件，并且仍然有 3 次超过 20% 的修正。因此，即使是当前的长期牛市，当你把它放在背景中时，背景之所以重要是因为我们一直处于长期牛市中，自 2013 年以来，股票上涨了 175%。</p><p>所以我们缺乏上涨空间，我们在价格方面还没有达到那种上涨空间，甚至在持续时间方面也没有达到这种上涨空间。所以之前的牛市长达18年。我们已经过去九年了。我可能会说，现在已经过去了三分之二。</p><p>有趣的是，尽管存在中美贸易战、疫情大流行、通胀高得令人无法接受、欧洲能源危机、银行再次倒闭，尽管如此，我们的股价还是上涨了 135%。我认为，由于经济的结构性变化，我们将继续向前推进，而我们并没有充分认识到这一点。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：那么人们对周期性牛市和长期牛市有何误解？当我们谈论这一点时，我不得不问，媒体似乎喜欢的20%的衡量标准对于牛市和熊市的开始和结束有何意义？</p><p>面：是的，这很有趣，对吧？所以我认为 20% 的衡量标准并没有什么重要意义，但我们可以围绕它进行一项有趣的研究。所以我们要考虑的是，让我们对 20% 的下降进行细分。长期牛市和长期熊市之间，有什么区别？你意识到的是，当你在长期牛市中跌幅超过20%时，平均跌幅为27%，恢复到高点需要九个月的时间。</p><p>在长期熊市中，平均跌幅为43%，恢复至高点需要48个月。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：深度和持续时间都有巨大差异。</p><p>米安：所以，当人们将当前的熊市周期与 2001 年和 2008 年进行比较时，我认为这是有缺陷的，因为那是在长期熊市中。</p><p> RITHOLTZ：19%，换句话说，您的意思是恢复到 2022 年之前的高点并不遥远。</p><p>面： 不是那么遥远。</p><p> RITHOLTZ： 嗯，这真的很有趣。缩小一点。是什么让长期牛市如此强劲、如此普遍、持久且富有弹性？</p><p>面：我想我提到了人口冲动。我认为这是非常重要的。我认为第二个是家庭财务状况，这也与为什么我们迄今为止以某种方式避开了经济衰退而消费者仍然存在——</p><p> RITHOLTZ：消费者支出处于历史最高水平。它真的很坚固。</p><p>面：你知道，我喜欢问的一个问题是，哪些事情发生了不应该发生的事情，或者哪些事情没有发生，而本该发生的事情，对吗？考虑到美联储的紧缩政策以及我们收到的所有信息，市场的坚挺令人惊讶。简单回答，二级市场。看到房地产市场反弹具有重要意义。简单的答案，人口统计。虽然我们没有陷入衰退，但简单的回答是，我想说美国经济的利率敏感性处于历史低位。我的意思是，在全球金融危机之后，我们实现了桥水基金所说的美妙的去杠杆化。</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p>米安：但是疫情过后，情况变得更好了，因为收入增加了。</p><p>里索兹：对。</p><p>面：利息成本进一步下降。</p><p>因此，如果你看看家庭偿债与可支配收入的比率——</p><p> RITHOLTZ：这和以前一样好。</p><p> MIAN：低于数据系列开始时 1980 年的水平。这非常重要。因此，你可以享受 5% 的联邦基金利率，而消费者却不会停止。 At the same time, if you look at corporates, they extended their maturities for their liabilities from five years to seven years. Their interest cost as a share of debt is 3.5%, the lowest since 1950.</p><p> And then you look at the mortgage market, that&#39;s another phenomenal backdrop. So the rate sensitivity to the US economy is historically low. So the household&#39;s in a much better position today than they ever were. The reason, despite global tightening, we haven&#39;t seen a slowdown in sort of, in a major slowdown in consumer spending is partly because of the fact that we had significant, you know, gains in savings, not just excess savings, but total savings because of hours worked.</p><p> So checking deposits today are $4 trillion higher than they were pre-pandemic. We&#39;re under appreciating the amount of money still in the system and what that means for demand.</p><p> The demand side of the economy, because of the pandemic, a massive upward shock that I still don&#39;t think that we&#39;re fully getting our heads around.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really quite intriguing. Let&#39;s talk a little bit about how markets fool people. What is it that makes investors so susceptible to being fooled and why do investors seem to love the bearish argument, why is that so compelling?</p><p> What makes Mr. Market so able to convince us of one thing and then he goes off and does something else?</p><p> MIAN: It&#39;s interesting. A question I&#39;ve been asking is what if the greatest trick the market ever pulled was convincing investors that we&#39;re still in a bear market?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, a variation of the old devil quote from, I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s New Testament, Old Testament. So lots of people are negative. Lots of people are bearish. It&#39;s not quite as bad as my recollection of 2010, &#39;11, &#39;12, but coming out of the financial crisis, people stayed bearish despite the 56% collapse in the S&amp;P.</p><p> You would think that should be enough to say, “Okay, we got our bearish reset. Last year was pretty modest, down 19%. Yeah, bonds were down 15% but everybody seems to think that&#39;s it, it&#39;s over.”</p><p> MIAN: It is a difficult business though, Barry, right? If you think about it, it seems so obvious now that we should be owning Microsoft and Apple and Amazon and Google and Facebook. So obvious, but I would argue 10 years ago it wasn&#39;t so obvious. 10 years ago you had the top economics, economists, investors in America writing a letter to the Fed in 2010 saying, “Hey, stop QE. “You&#39;re going to create hyperinflation and debase the dollar.”</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> MIAN: In 2011 you had the debt ceiling crisis, the credit rating got downgraded, the dollar was at a 50 year low. So you did not have policy or political leadership that was very inspiring. In 2012 Facebook went public, the IPO flopped.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s right.</p><p> MIAN: From $32 to like I think 16 or $18.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Yes.</p><p> MIAN: In 2015, Carl Icahn sold all his Netflix stake because it was too expensive. Netflix was the best performing stock last decade. He sold half his Apple stock in 2015. In 2015, Bill Gurley at Benchmark was saying Silicon Valley is in a bubble. So it&#39;s interesting to do this exercise, the fact that it seems so obvious today, but it wasn&#39;t obvious to hold on to these companies. It wasn&#39;t so obvious that America will be the investment destination that&#39;s going to matter. And so it&#39;s curious that I think we need to just remind ourselves of this the fact that it isn&#39;t always easy and what could we be missing you know right now in the present.</p><p> I always say my job is not to predict the future it&#39;s to see the present clearly.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Which is much harder than it sounds.</p><p> Let&#39;s talk a little bit about something that people seem to have a hard time recognizing and that&#39;s each decade a theme emerges and yet this tends to come with some problems.</p><p> MIAN: It&#39;s an opportunity if you think about it because in 1970 like every decade something happens. So in 1970 it was the in the 1970s it was the 1971 breakdown of Bretton Woods and that led to inflation and the gold bull market. But 1980 onwards you wanted to avoid gold. The zeitgeist of the 1980s was Japan&#39;s taking over the world. So you only be long Japanese equities and Japanese real estate. It was Japanese management techniques that were being passed around. Your children were learning Japanese, Japanese were the villains in American movies, Japanese were buying real estate in New York. But 1989 onwards, that was a disaster.</p><p> The zeitgeist of the 1990s was the internet. You want to be long NASDAQ. March 2000 onwards, stopped working. It&#39;s really interesting how they&#39;re literally a calendar decade, Barry.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> MIAN: The zeitgeist of the 2000s was China&#39;s entrance into the World Trade Organization in June 2001. So suddenly you can have the build out of the world&#39;s second largest economy, you&#39;ll be long in EM and commodities.</p><p> The zeitgeist of the 2010s was best articulated by Marc Andreessen in 2011 in a “Wall Street Journal” article, “Software is Eating the World.” So what you&#39;re seeing now is the unraveling of that zeitgeist. So 2021 was the peak of that zeitgeist. It was all about software and cloud. And the question is now, the software zeitgeist is over, what&#39;s the zeitgeist for this decade? And what we&#39;ve been writing about and discussing in the community is that we believe climate is a zeitgeist for this decade, not that climate change —</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Just starting now, not peaking now, starting in 2023.</p><p> MIAN: Starting now, so from the 2020 to 2030, just like software was from 2010 to 2020, from 2020 to 2030, the zeitgeist is climate.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Is that an investable thesis? Is that something people can put money into? Because when, sure, you can look at the low carbon funds and things, but are there a way to say, I want to participate in EMs and lithium and wind power and battery technology and all the things that are going to drive the next decade. How does an investor participate in that?</p><p> MIAN: So the interesting thing with climate is there are multi-faceted ways to play it. Different sectors, different opportunities from a bottoms up standpoint as well. And again, now that it&#39;s become a global economic and political priority, it&#39;s become a solution for spending as opposed to a risk.</p><p> You can see higher CapEx this decade, so that benefits certain sectors. I think the simplest expression would be the EV revolution in many ways. I think the China EV, I think BYD would be a key asset to own this decade. I think that could be the simplest expression of what goes on. I think, I don&#39;t believe we&#39;re in a commodity super cycle, but I do believe certain commodities will win. And the way to think about commodities is naturally as it relates to the energy transition, but more specifically, it&#39;s not related to China growth, it&#39;s related to China climate.</p><p> What I mean by that is that most likely no Western government will meet their climate targets. The Chinese will meet their climate targets because for them it&#39;s an existential issue. Air pollution is a crisis. What&#39;s the point of common prosperity if you&#39;re going to get sick?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> MIAN: And so China&#39;s old growth model was one in which they increased production capacity in a lot of base metals because they wanted to create employment. That no longer makes sense.</p><p> So for example, China became two thirds of the global aluminum market. They&#39;re going to start to reduce capacity within that to reduce emissions because they&#39;re importing raw materials to produce that. So they&#39;re probably emitting 16 to 17 ton per carbon per ton compared to what I&#39;d say someone like Alcoa is doing, you know, two or three. And so you&#39;re going to see China rationalize its industry, its capacity in certain key base metals, aluminum and steel are amongst them.</p><p> And I think you want to monitor what they&#39;re doing on the climate front to understand which commodities to be long, not across the board. And so certain commodities will do well as part of the energy transition. I think China EV story works. You know, a lot of it is just retrofitting and, you know, like buildings. and you know the role ACs play in emissions and retrofitting that and there&#39;s a lot of companies sitting in Japan and Korea and Taiwan that are mid-cap engineering names that sort of benefit from that.</p><p> You know higher CapEx like I mentioned, you know who benefits from that. And so what you&#39;d realize as you look at deeper and deeper into this, it&#39;s not so much a US centric story, it&#39;s a much more global story. So you could argue you can see non-US markets begin to outperform.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: And that&#39;s already happened the past 18 months. Developed x-US has done better than the US markets have done going back to let&#39;s call at the end of 2021. So that&#39;s following what a 10 or 14 year period of US outperformance. So not unexpected.</p><p> Let me throw a quote of yours at you and have you describe it. “It&#39;s more valuable to consider why we aren&#39;t in a US recession rather than nervously dreading one.” Explain.</p><p> MIAN: Again that&#39;s the point of you know staying in the present and I think the reason why we&#39;re not is the fact that I think rate sensitivity is historically low.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Rate sensitivity.</p><p> MIAN: Rate, interest rate sensitivity for the US economy is historically low so you can actually have 5% interest rates and the consumer doesn&#39;t stop because we are not fully adjusting for how strong the household finances are. But more important than that, based on I think more recent conversations, I would argue maybe you&#39;ve already had a recession.</p><p> And the only indicator that hasn&#39;t cracked yet is the labor market. And that&#39;s what everybody is sort of focused on now. And my view there is also sort of contentious because I don&#39;t expect the labor market to crack. I actually believe the labor market is in a secular tightness. Let me explain.</p><p> In the past, recessions have basically destroyed demand. You&#39;ve seen job losses in goods producing sectors, manufacturing, auto, construction. Job openings take years to recover. The pandemic was different because the disruption happened in labor supply. And on the demand side, we actually created a huge positive demand shock. So it&#39;s complete reverse of what we&#39;ve ever experienced.</p><p> So we&#39;ve seen a positive demand shock when labor supply got hit. And now you&#39;ve seen a situation where you still have high job openings and the service sector, which comes up with 80% of jobs, is still looking to hire.</p><p> So how are you going to see the unemployment rate go from 3.5% to 5% in that dynamic? Let me give you specific examples. Last year, bad year for single family housing. Overall, you know, conditions were pretty poor for housing. Construction employment last year was a record. There&#39;s still a shortage of construction workers. Job openings in the construction industry today are twice what they were during the mid-2000s boom.</p><p> If you think about construction specifically, since the construction activity peaked in mid-2006 it took 18 months for unemployment in the construction industry to go up. Today the order backlog is bigger, it&#39;s going to take more time, the labor shortage is worse because you&#39;ve got early retirements and lower immigration and so I would argue you can see the economy weaken even the housing market weaken without an increase in joblessness across the board.</p><p> The only sector of the economy that overhired was tech.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> MIAN: And that&#39;s where you&#39;re seeing layoffs. But if the construction of unemployment doesn&#39;t pick up for the reasons that I&#39;ve outlined, you&#39;ve got auto demand that remains robust. They&#39;re not letting go of people. Manufacturing seems to be bottoming with ISM where it is right now. So who&#39;s actually going to let go of workers here?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Nobody. So, let&#39;s talk about some of the factors that are driving that labor scarcity. You mentioned immigration. Legal immigration has been trending lower since the Gulf War in 2003. We changed the rules as to who could stay in the country following coming here for college. We basically eliminated a lot of the most capable, most qualified immigrants. That&#39;s 20 years in the making.</p><p> You mentioned COVID. A lot of people still suffering from long COVID. Disability has been on an upward trends for 20 years and on the male side of the labor force participation rate, that&#39;s been trending down for decades also. Why would anyone imagine we&#39;re going to have excess labor supply anytime soon in the United States?</p><p> MIAN: So I think you&#39;re seeing improving immigration trends not just in the US but globally and I think that&#39;s a structural theme that we should pay more attention to.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Improving immigration trends, does that mean we&#39;re going to see more legal immigrants in the United States by substantial numbers?</p><p> MIAN: I mean it&#39;s very difficult to quantify, but I think it&#39;s a trend, it&#39;s a structural trend globally, not just in the US. Like even countries that were not historically very friendly to immigration realize from a demographic standpoint, they need to open up.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> MIAN: And so we&#39;re going to see that. So again, for me it&#39;s like on the margin, what can happen in the future that&#39;ll positively surprise? I&#39;m negatively surprise, but I think in a world right now where everybody&#39;s asking, it&#39;s so easy to think about what&#39;s wrong with the world, Barry. It&#39;s more difficult to think about what&#39;s right with the world.</p><p> And usually when you ask that question, people shift in their seats because they&#39;re not used to thinking about what&#39;s right with the world. It&#39;s more difficult to point out oftentimes, but I think immigration is one of those trends that&#39;s what&#39;s right with the world. Because if you look at just working as population growth in the US can be 60 basis points this decade. But the real upsides are going to come from productivity.</p><p> And so I still think immigration is going to sort of do some improve from here I should say, going forward on the labor side. And then we still have record employment in the US, right? Like you know….</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> MIAN: We&#39;ve had the prime age participation rate recover. We&#39;re suddenly realizing that early retirements wasn&#39;t a thing and you know, people are coming back to the labor force. So it&#39;s very difficult given this, this is why I&#39;m saying that I think we can actually have a secular tightness in the labor market.</p><p> The concern amongst investors is that they fear stagflation. I don&#39;t see a future that&#39;s stagflationary.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> MIAN: A stagflationary future would destroy your fixed income and equity portfolios, right? The future that I&#39;m seeing is one of productivity-led growth. And this is a look-back period that&#39;s important. Because when you think about debt ceiling, you think about 2011. When you think about the regional banking crisis, you think about 2008. You think about inflation, think about &#39;70s. But we don&#39;t have memory of anything that remotely resembles a productivity led growth era. But that was the 1950s.</p><p> So you could have secular tightness in the labor market. The AI boom is coming at the right time where you could see wages, profits rising simultaneously where inflation is relatively contained. Because even if wages are growing at four, four and a half percent, if productivity grows at two percent, your overall inflation picture is not that bad. Labor costs aren&#39;t going to crush your margins. So I think the real possibility is one that the future is not stagflationary, but one of productivity-led growth, which is extremely bullish for nominal growth and equities.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really quite fascinating. So let&#39;s talk a little bit about some of the other ways you find interesting ideas and get a sense of what&#39;s going on in the here and now.</p><p> Tell us a little bit about the one-on-ones you have and the dinner salons you have and what comes from those.</p><p> MIAN: So we do about 10 dinners a year in different cities and I travel according to what&#39;s happening in the world. So that&#39;s more timely and interesting from a conversational standpoint and benefits the whole community. Tongue in cheek, I call these dinners the most interesting dinner in the world. So I really set expectations very high. I found the best gathering is about 10 people. Everybody&#39;s requested to bring a chart to discuss. It could be–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: A chart?</p><p> MIAN: A chart. It could be a stock, it could be–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I like that idea.</p><p> MIAN: Something that they are interested in and they would like to share with the group. It could be a picture of your dog. I really don&#39;t care, but you have to become prepared.</p><p> I feel like when people are thoughtful about what they want to come and share, it&#39;s more interesting than just rambling conversation. I make sure that we&#39;ve got certain rules, no egos, no business cards, no (EXPLETIVE DELETED).</p><p> RITHOLTZ: (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MIAN: Try to really set the tone.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Well that really limits who can participate. You&#39;ve cut it down radically.</p><p> MIAN: So really be very intimate. And it&#39;s not me pitching something. I&#39;m more curious and just facilitating conversation, learning from everybody. And the last rule is no one leaves without a hug.</p><p> So it&#39;s 10 people, usually CIOs, portfolio managers, from different sort of hedge funds, long only funds, family offices, pension CIOs, so it really varies. Again, based on what I think is topical and interesting. So we do those eight to 10 times a year, and then we&#39;ll do breakfasts, which are more easier to organize, and tongue in cheek, I call them the breakfast, the moderately interesting breakfast. Because again, it&#39;s early in the morning, you haven&#39;t had your coffee, lack sleep, so just moderately interesting ideas are enough to share with each other.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s interesting. I&#39;ll tell you the two — so we&#39;ve been hosting these dinner salons for I don&#39;t know the past going back to the financial crisis and the two interesting things I&#39;ve kind of learned. The first is it&#39;s a little bit like you&#39;re right about the size eight to ten is as big as you get as you want and even there you still end up with these side conversations and you want everybody talking about the same subject in the middle of the table not three groups of two, three, four.</p><p> MIAN: So I have a rule, no side conversation.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: No side. We have the same rule and then we did something, I don&#39;t remember when this was, it was a couple of years ago and I try and remember to do it every dinner but it&#39;s really fascinating. At the end of the dinner I want everybody to recommend the most interesting book they&#39;ve read over the past year and you get some fantastic eclectic, wildly unexpected book recommendations from people. Because I think that&#39;s all people want is give me a really interesting book to read and I&#39;m happy for 30-40 hours. You&#39;ve just made me happy with that.</p><p> So you hold these. You mentioned after the China first quarter you did something in Singapore. If there&#39;s a big Fed meeting coming up do you do that in DC? Do you do that in New York? Where would you hold something like that?</p><p> MIAN: I found New York is the best place for like Fed centric conversations.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Why is that?</p><p> MIAN: I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just part of the culture. You know, the macro guys are very obsessed with–</p><p> RITHOLTZ: They&#39;re all here.</p><p> MIAN: Yeah, the one they&#39;re all here, but also pay very close attention to what the Fed is saying, what the Fed is doing. You know, rates and effects matter, you know, it matters a lot.</p><p> And so every city actually has its own interesting, like Hong Kong dinners will be very China centric. Singapore is very pure macro because you&#39;ve got a good Asian pulse, but you also have some funds there that are really plugged into what&#39;s happening in the US and Europe.</p><p> The London dinners will be a mixture, still annoyed with Brexit and EU policy and other sort of interesting themes come up from there.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Well, unforced errors get everybody upset, right? It&#39;s just, why did you do that? That was silly.</p><p> Let me ask you about Singapore. On my list of places to go, never been, I have been told from a wide variety of people that it is absolutely the best food destination in Asia.</p><p> MIAN: I&#39;m not a foodie, so I can&#39;t say if it&#39;s the best food destination. It&#39;s certainly a city that I love.</p><p> It&#39;s such a, especially from a macro community standpoint, like you&#39;ve got everybody there, walking distance. It&#39;s just fun. And I think what I&#39;ve learned from my Singapore conversations again, because it&#39;s East and West, good mixture is probably some of the best conversations I&#39;ve had in, around the world.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: In Singapore.真的吗？ What, where else besides London do you, do you like to host these in Europe?</p><p> MIAN: Just London so far.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really?</p><p> MIAN: I mean, so it&#39;s London, New York, Miami, Hong Kong, Singapore.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: What do you think of Miami as a city? I&#39;m always, I&#39;m always, every time I go to Miami, I want to like it and Miami always manages to disappoint me somehow, including Michelin star rated restaurants that won&#39;t serve decaf after dinner.</p><p> MIAN: I&#39;m not that opinionated.你知道我的意思？ I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t, I mean, I don&#39;t have a strong judgment on cities and people. And so I go, and usually again, I&#39;ve got young children, so I&#39;m usually going for like a day, three days, two days, four days.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s a lot of travel for a day or two, right?</p><p> MIAN: So I&#39;m just going, meeting clients who are also friends and doing the dinner and coming back. So I&#39;m not usually spending a lot of time in Miami, checking out the city, the food scene. I love Wynwood Walls. One of my favorite people is in Miami, Peter Tunney, who I love to spend time with. So I feel like in every city I&#39;ve got someone deep that I connect with or something about that place. A city that I&#39;m dying to visit and host a dinner is actually Boston because of my love for Ralph Waldo Emerson. I haven&#39;t visited, I just want to go and pay a tribute to him and Khalid Gibran actually as well, who was living in Boston for a very long time.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I was going to recommend some restaurants in Boston, but you don&#39;t —</p><p> MIAN: They must have a round table. That&#39;s the other rule. I only do round tables in a private room.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Well, the private room, otherwise you can&#39;t hear, but there are a lot of places where you end up with a rectangle, but it&#39;s hard. It&#39;s hard, right? That lends itself to those side conversations.</p><p> MIAN: Exactly.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So, without revealing any confidences, and I&#39;m assuming everything is off the record, private, you&#39;re not repeating.</p><p> The last salon you held, tell us about some of the conversations that took place. Who said what, and I mean this economist, this PM, without naming names, what sort of topics came up?</p><p> MIAN: I&#39;ll tell you what surprised me, because the last dinner we did was in Singapore, and I was surprised at the amount of conversation, time spent discussing the US economy and the consensus about a recession.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Which has been going on for 18 months now.</p><p> MIAN: Not something that I would expect in Singapore.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Oh, really?</p><p> MIAN: So it almost felt as though news here was infecting there in terms of the fact that it&#39;s inevitable or it&#39;s ever present. It&#39;s almost like a foregone conclusion.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> MIAN: So that was something that was unexpected. But again, because those views are also coming from people that I love and respect. And so that makes me think twice about my view and makes me go back and do more work on what am I missing and what are they getting right?</p><p> And so that was my lesson. It forced me to think deeper. And I&#39;ve come back looking, so my focus on the labor market was partly as a function of me attending that dinner and hearing that from the community to make sure that what am I missing in the labor market? How can I get more robust in my analysis of the labor market? And I&#39;ve come away thinking that actually, yeah, I still stand by my view that the labor market will remain tight, secular fashion won&#39;t crack the way people expect. And now it&#39;s my job to share that with the community and get feedback. And so that&#39;s kind of how the process works, the research idea, discovery, flywheel works.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So you mentioned something earlier I want to circle back to talking about the expectation of recession and you said that there is a tendency for people to ignore good news and focus on bad news. Let me throw this out there. From an evolutionary perspective, isn&#39;t threats and security risks and bad news, an existential risk versus good news is just, Hey, we&#39;re all doing a little better.</p><p> MIAN: From a spiritual perspective.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right?</p><p> MIAN: I would say I&#39;m, I&#39;m born to be grateful.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Okay.</p><p> MIAN: And so I always see the bright side of things.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I&#39;m with you. I&#39;m, I&#39;m a glass half full guy. Also mathematically, half of zero is zero so there&#39;s no such thing as a half empty glass. But you know the Morgan Housel wrote this really interesting piece that said following the first flight of Kitty Hawk it took newspapers 20 years to start talking about flight but the first instant there&#39;s any sort of trouble, it&#39;s headline news. My curiosity is how Darwinian is this? How much of the — your spirituality is not the traditional state of human psyche. We are — seem like we were built to over anticipate threats.</p><p> MIAN: Perhaps. My philosophy on that is simply the more we look at others the more neglectful we become looking at ourselves.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So let&#39;s talk about that because some of some of your thoughts on knowing yourself how could you be a good investor if you don&#39;t understand yourself? Let&#39;s delve into that. How important is self-awareness and self-enlightenment in managing capital and risk?</p><p> MIAN: I don&#39;t know about enlightenment but self-awareness certainly is I think very important.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Is there that much of a distinction or am I using overly broad terms?</p><p> Like I think of self-enlightenment and self-awareness as part of the same spectrum.</p><p> MIAN: Right. I think awareness is important, right? What&#39;s the motivation? Why are you in this business? Like it&#39;s just asking a simple question like why do you care so much about investing?</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You want to ask me or just generally?</p><p> MIAN: Yeah, just diving deeper into a person, right? Why do you care so much about investing, what is it doing for you? You know, like for example, you, I think I read somewhere recently or heard that you don&#39;t know why you&#39;re drinking until you stop drinking.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Okay, that&#39;s fair.</p><p> MIAN: You don&#39;t know why you&#39;re trading until you stop trading. It&#39;s like what is our underlying motivators? You know, in the industry a lot of people struggle with ego and identity and you know, like so what are your underlying motivators? It&#39;s just getting to know who you are, why you&#39;re doing what you&#39;re doing. You know, how do you become more flexible in your thinking, adaptable? I often say the biggest risk you need to manage is yourself. It&#39;s not a position, it&#39;s not what the Fed is saying, it&#39;s not a political event, it&#39;s yourself because you&#39;re going to react to a particular news story or a particular event, right?</p><p> So the biggest risk you need to manage is yourself. So if you don&#39;t know yourself, it&#39;s pretty difficult.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: One of the comments you had written about was the obsession we have with things that we can&#39;t control. We can&#39;t control the economy, we can&#39;t control inflation, we can&#39;t control what the Fed does, We can&#39;t control what Congress does, but to your points, you can control yourself and your own reaction, given that, are we spending too much time focusing on news when we really should be focusing more on things that are within our penumbra of being able to manage, modify and control?</p><p> MIAN: Perhaps, but again, it depends on what you&#39;re doing, right? So I certainly do that. I can&#39;t speak to other people. But I have the luxury of doing that because that&#39;s partly why I get to do what I do is because I can zoom out, I can disconnect to come back with some reflective, deep, refreshing thoughts that will sort of help the community, the client base in a particular way.</p><p> But obviously if you&#39;re macro PM, you can&#39;t disconnect. You know, if you&#39;re a CIO of a pension fund, you&#39;re always thinking about your employees and your portfolio and the plan sponsors. So I have a luxury, I think, Barry, to design my lifestyle in a particular way that gives me an edge maybe, that I appreciate that not everybody does.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: All right, so let me throw you a curveball question. I got to ask, you write all the time. Why write a book? Tell us what motivated you to turn “Stray Reflections” into a bound printed book.</p><p> MIAN: So I didn&#39;t write the book. What actually happened was, like I mentioned earlier, I wrote from the very beginning from a very personal space. So at the end of every issue, there&#39;d be a personal reflection. It could be my daughter being born, my grandmother dying, meeting a friend, reading a book, some travel experience. So I&#39;d always made sure I ended on a personal note. I realized when I started writing, there was a lot of reservations. Will I have something meaningful to say on a regular basis?</p><p> And something Rumi said struck with me and he said, “Words are just a pretext. connects one person to another is that inner bond, not words. So I realized I want to write from a very personal space, I want to write from the heart. There&#39;s too much brain intelligence, you know, in our industry, like, let&#39;s connect at a personal level. So the book is simply a collection of all those personal reflections that I&#39;ve been writing since the beginning of the publication.</p><p> So I didn&#39;t write a book separately. It was, you know, I held this conference in 2018 in the desert and I was trying to think of a way to give a thoughtful gift and this idea came about. So we just assembled all the reflections into a book that you can just order on Amazon. But back then we just printed it and gifted it to all our clients. And there&#39;s a lot of people who would ask for it. And I&#39;m glad that it&#39;s just available for anybody to sort of pick it up or for me to keep gifting it. I&#39;d much rather meet a client and instead of giving them a presentation about housing or this or that, just leave a copy of my book on their desk.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Really interesting.</p><p> We only have you for a little while longer. Let me jump to my favorite questions that we ask all of our guests, starting with tell us what you&#39;re paying attention to these days in terms of entertainment. What are you listening to in terms of podcasts or are there any Netflix or Amazon shows that have caught your attention? What&#39;s entertaining the family?</p><p> MIAN: I actually don&#39;t get bored to feel the need to be entertained so I actually don&#39;t listen to music or watch movies. I&#39;ve got three young daughters and I love spending time with them.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Do they watch TV? Do they watch listen to music?</p><p> MIAN: They watch cartoons so we&#39;ll have a movie time every weekend with them so they&#39;ll watch some children&#39;s movie and I&#39;m just present with them.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: You&#39;re along for the ride? Okay, so Pixar, Disney, all the usual suspects.</p><p> MIAN: What I find myself doing, you know, one of my goals last year, for example, Barry, was I want to work fewer hours and get more done. So that&#39;s when I started cutting out distractions. Again, deep work is something that I really believe in. And so I would say if I have any downtime, I&#39;m actually listening to a book as opposed to watching a movie or listening to music. And I&#39;m a big “Audible” fan. Again, with young girls, it&#39;s more difficult to sit and pick up a book because they&#39;re jumping on you. So you&#39;re driving, when you&#39;re cleaning or just going for a walk, you can listen to a book. And something that I listened to recently was “Screwtape Letters” by CS Lewis, read by Jean Cleese, which is a masterpiece.</p><p> I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar with the book, but it&#39;s basically a senior devil writing a letter to a junior devil talking about how to corrupt the patient, which is humans, and keep him away from the enemy, which is God.</p><p> And even though people think that “The Fourth Turning” is the most important book of our time, I would say CS Lewis, “The Screwtape Letters” is the most important book of our time.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: “The Screwtape Letters.”</p><p> MIAN: It explains a lot with what&#39;s going on.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: If you like that, have you ever read Mark Twain&#39;s “Letters From Earth?”</p><p> MIAN: No.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s literally that the devil comes to earth and or, or a demon comes to earth and is writing letters back to a devil, explaining what&#39;s going on with the humans and why they&#39;re so hard to corrupt because they&#39;re already corrupted.</p><p> MIAN: (LAUGHTER)</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s really quite fascinating. I haven&#39;t read it in a long time, but you&#39;ve given me up. We&#39;re going to circle back to books in a bit. Let&#39;s talk about your mentors. Who helped shape your career and turn you into the person you are today?</p><p> MIAN: In the twenties I searched for a mentor and I couldn&#39;t find one. So I spent my 20s learning and dreaming. And the book that got me to dream was “The Alchemist,” which I know you don&#39;t like.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like it, it&#39;s that the books that are parables that sort of rely on magic to reach their conclusion, I find annoying.</p><p> MIAN: The concept that resonated with me in the book was this idea of the personal legend. So I&#39;ve spent my 20s dreaming that I&#39;m going to unfold my personal legend. So for me, the 20s were spent learning and dreaming. I would say when I launched “Stray Reflections” the first five years, I was very lucky to meet someone called Steve Drobny out of Santa Monica who runs Clocktower Group. Every time I was thought of quitting in the first few years because I couldn&#39;t figure out the business model, I wasn&#39;t making enough money. He was on the other side of the phone saying, just hang in there, a path will open up.</p><p> And I remember his words, he said, “Jawad, this will be your only job for the rest of your life, be patient.” And wise words. And I realized, you know what, actually surviving is succeeding.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right.</p><p> MIAN: And the universe opened its path. And so he was influential and remains a very close friend. And I would say in the last five years, the most impact that I&#39;ve had is from a coaching relationship. And I speak with my coach every week and she&#39;s indispensable to me.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: That&#39;s really, that&#39;s really interesting. The idea that you&#39;re not ready for this and the universe will open up to you when you are is frustrating prospectively but when you&#39;re looking backwards, it&#39;s like oh that turned out to be pretty uh you hate it in the advance but looking backwards it&#39;s like maybe it&#39;s a coincidence but that seemed to come along at the exact right time didn&#39;t it?</p><p> MIAN: Absolutely that&#39;s been my experience.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So we&#39;ve mentioned two books so far three books “Letters from Earth”, “The Alchemist” and the CS Lewis book. Tell us some other books you&#39;re reading. What are some of your all-time favorites?</p><p> MIAN: I love everything written by Ralph Waldo Emerson, CS Lewis, as well as Rumi, who I&#39;m a big fan of. What I&#39;m reading more recently is actually something John Arthur has recommended. I was having a conversation with him and I was asking for advice on writing and the craft and he suggested that the most influential person in his life was Professor Freedman from Columbia and he&#39;s written a bunch of books. So I went and looked through his books and the one that really appealed to me was “Letters To A Young Journalist” And I&#39;m reading that and I&#39;m fascinated.</p><p> Because again, I look at what I do as writing, and I want to really improve that craft to be a creative thinker and looking at the world and observing things differently.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: So Rumi, give me a book of Rumi that you think is–</p><p> MIAN: “The Masnavi.” “The Masnavi” is the big sort of collection of poems that he&#39;s written. Will be the one. – Reynold Nicholson has the best translation in my opinion.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Okay.</p><p> MIAN: So anything that Reynold Nicholson has translated of Rumi would be the best.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Right, and by the way, you know there&#39;s only two secrets to good writing, right? You&#39;re aware of this.</p><p> MIAN: No, reveal.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: I&#39;m not sharing anything that hasn&#39;t been revealed many times. First, read really good writing. You&#39;re already doing that. And second, write regularly and relentlessly. And the more you write, the better you get. It&#39;s just a muscle that has to be exercised. I hate that metaphor but it&#39;s true if you write regularly you&#39;ll find you just get especially if you have access to a decent editor also you&#39;ll just start to get better and better and better.</p><p> I&#39;ve watched this arc with people over and over again and every now and then someone will say oh I hate my early stuff but now I&#39;m pretty comfortable with it but that that&#39;s the path ,you have to that route.</p><p> MIAN: As someone who has struggled with the imposter syndrome, I think what really helped me alongside was reading the book “The War of Art” by Steven Pressfield. He talks about turning pro. An amateur waits for inspiration and then he goes to the room and starts writing. The pro takes his craft seriously and shows up.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Finds inspiration.</p><p> MIAN: Exactly. Just this concept of turning pro, professional, made a big difference mentally, psychologically that you know take it seriously. That made a huge difference.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: My buddy David Nadig and I have this ongoing debate about imposter syndrome which is a problem for him and I have just no understanding of it. My defense is that I&#39;m oblivious. He says I&#39;m a sociopath and therefore but I don&#39;t really feel like a sociopath.</p><p> Although sociopaths probably don&#39;t feel like sociopaths. But I think I have a pretty a pretty decent defense on that.</p><p> So our last two questions. A recent college grad came up to you and said I&#39;m thinking about a career in finance writing a newsletter or a macro advisory paper for investors. What sort of advice would you give them?</p><p> MIAN: Rumi jumps to mind and he says “Let the beauty of what you love be what you do, there are a thousand ways to kneel and kiss the ground.” That&#39;s the first thing. The other thing I&#39;d say also comes from Rumi which is “Be with those who help your being.” So surround yourself with good people.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: To say to say the very least.</p><p> And our final question what do you know about the world of macro analysis investing, economic data, et cetera. today that you wish you knew 20 years or so ago when you were first getting started?</p><p> MIAN: The world is not the way they tell you it is. That&#39;s a classic opening line from “The Money Game” and I wish I knew that. The world is not the way they tell you it is.</p><p> RITHOLTZ: Adam Smith, “The Money Game” another classic book that is absolutely worth reading.</p><p> Jawad, thank you so much for being so generous with your time. This was absolutely fascinating.</p><p> We have been speaking with Jawad Mian. He is the editor and publisher of Stray Reflections, a macro advisory research commentary.</p><p> I would be remiss if I did not thank the crack team that helps put these conversations together each week. Paris Wald is my producer. Sean Russo is my researcher. Rob Bragg is my audio engineer. Atika Valbrun is our project manager. I&#39;m Barry Ritholtz.

His clients include some of the world&#39;s largest hedge funds, family offices, and institutional investors. Mian studied finance and economics at the University of Western Ontario and is a CFA and CMT charter holder.</p><p> We discuss what makes a secular bull market so strong, pervasive, long-lasting, and resilient. Rather than focusing on future predictions, he focuses on trying to fully understand what is going on right now, a task that is much harder than it sounds.</p><p> Mian explains why, despite all the predictions to the contrary, we have not fallen into a recession. Rate sensitivity in the US economy is historically low. Post-GFC, the “beautiful de-leveraging” (as Ray Dalio of Bridgewater termed it) took time, but post-pandemic, the economic recovery was much faster and stronger. Fiscal stimulus boost to incomes and a further drop in costs led the Household debt service to disposable income ratio to its lowest point, below the 1980 levels, when the data series first began.</p><p> A list of his favorite books <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/07/mib-jawad-mian/#more-317016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is here</a> ; A transcript of our conversation is <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/07/transcript-jawad-mian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available here</a> Tuesday.</p><p> You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/masters-in-business/id730188152" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Podcasts</a> , <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3s05WHoHBr6OKXi1URzhxf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotify</a> , <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/show/masters-in-business/episode/jawad-s-mian-on-global-investment-research-305461246" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stitcher</a> , <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcGxheWxpc3QvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxLzRlNGNkOTEwLTQwYTEtNDYxOS1hNWYzLWFlMmIwMDEyZmZmZi81ODczYTNjYi0yOThmLTQwYmMtYjcxZi1hZTJiMDAxMzAwMGQvcG9kY2FzdC5yc3M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> , <a href="https://youtu.be/IEFPCCLHL_k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> , and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2023-07-21/jawad-s-mian-on-global-investment-research-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> .

Same with Sterling Shepard. Same with Leonard Williams. “Isn&#39;t that stuff for kids?” they wanted to know. Martinez knew it was coming.

If this were true, it would mean we have been measuring income inequality incorrectly (perhaps wealth inequality as well).</p><p> <em>It is untrue.</em></p><p> Since 2008, the Census Bureau has included government transfers in its <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/2021/demo/poverty_measure-how.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supplemental Poverty Measure</a> . It took 0.77 seconds to find 253,000,000 results on Google showing exactly how the government measures this.</p><p> Call it ” &#39; <em>America&#39;s Enormous Math Mistake&#39;s Mistake.</em> ”</p><p> Was this ignorance? Willfull misrepresentation? Sheer stupidity? Or is anything economic <a href="https://ritholtz.com/phil-gramm/">Phil Gramm</a> touches simply destined to be a dumpster fire of lies, foolishness, and incompetency?</p><p> You may remember Phil Gramm. He&#39;s the (thankfully) former US Senator who said Americans were a “nation of whiners” suffering from a “ <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2008/12/quote-of-the-day-phil-gramm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental recession</a> .”</p><p> <em>In 2008.</em></p><p> This was as the country was sinking into the worst recession since the Great Depression.</p><p> Gramm wrote a book that was published last year, “ <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1538167387/thebigpictu09-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Myth of American Inequality: How Government Biases Policy Debate</em></a> .” Phil and his co-authors perform sleight-of-hand tricks to convince you that, <em>hey, income and wealth inequality aren&#39;t nearly as bad as you might think</em> . Who ya gonna believe, me and my our jiggered stats, or your own lyin&#39; eyes?</p><p> Anyway, Gramm&#39;s book was apparently the basis – along with just a bit of perplexing illogic from <a href="https://www.ramseysolutions.com/retirement/the-national-study-of-millionaires-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dave Ramsey</a> and <a href="https://www.theboxisthereforareason.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cj-v35n3-1_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cato</a> – for the <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/07/gramm-strikes-again/#more-316810">video below</a> ; The essence of the video is this:</p><p> Poverty in the US is not as bad as Census would have you believe because Census focuses on money income and the poors get a lot of non-cash benefits, eg “ <em>many benefits aren&#39;t paid in cash</em> ,” and when you factor those non-cash benefits into the equation, the poors are no longer poor!瞧！</p><p> (Digression: I must mention it was Ritholtz who made me aware of the video, manipulative bastard that he is, knowing full well that it would trigger me, sending me down a rabbit hole. Owe you one, Barry. But I digress.)</p><p> Imagine that. The boneheaded, pencil-necked geeks at Census have been totes unaware of this glaring flaw in their work for all these years. Thank God Phil Gramm came along to set the record straight. Except for the fact that Census is, of course, aware of the exact limitation cited here, and long ago – prior to Gramm&#39;s book and the nonsensical video below – constructed its <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2022/comm/supplemental-poverty-measure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supplemental Poverty Measure</a> ( <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2022/comm/supplemental-poverty-measure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPM</a> ), which is neatly summarized in the graphic above. Would you look at that – all the items Gramm gripes about being excluded from the “official” measure are captured in the SPM. It&#39;s almost as if Gramm wasted his time writing a book and its readers wasted theirs reading it. For the record, Census published <a href="https://www2.census.gov/prod2/popscan/TP-50.pdf">its first study</a> on the valuation of so-called “in-kind transfer benefits” in 1982.</p><p> There&#39;s a good debunking of Gramm&#39;s book by Timothy Noah that can be found here: <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/167811/texas-senator-phil-gramm-inequality-myth">Phil Gramm Thinks Poor People Have It Too Easy</a> .</p><p> I was fully prepared to dig in and figure out exactly how Gramm was manipulating the data to make his point, but apparently he simply either wasn&#39;t aware or didn&#39;t care that Census had, long ago, addressed the deficiencies he cited. In a nutshell, the SPM renders Gramm&#39;s book more irrelevant than it otherwise would have been.</p><p> The focus on poverty exclusively is itself a bit of a straw man, as the larger issue is the unarguable hollowing out of our middle class, which goes entirely unaddressed.</p><p> Special thanks to Liana Fox at Census for sharing the 40-year history of government transfers as part of poverty measures.</p><p></p><p></p><p> <em>See also</em> :<br /> <a href="https://www2.census.gov/prod2/popscan/TP-50.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alternative Methods for Valuing Selected In-Kind Transfer Benefits and Measuring Their Effect on Poverty</a><br /> Timothy M, Smeeding<br /> ASA / Census Research Fellow and University of Utah<br /> US Department of Commerce / Bureau of the Census<br /> Technical Paper 50, March 1982</p><p> <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/167811/texas-senator-phil-gramm-inequality-myth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phil Gramm Thinks Poor People Have It Too Easy</a><br /> Timothy Noah<br /> TNR / September 21, 2022</p><p></p><p> <em>Previously</em> :<br /> <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2008/12/quote-of-the-day-phil-gramm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quote of the Day: “mental recession”</a> (December 10, 2008)</p><p> <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2008/11/gramm-deregulator-unswayed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phil Gramm: A Deregulator Unswayed</a> (November 17, 2008)</p><p> <a href="https://ritholtz.com/phil-gramm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phill Gramm</a></p><p></p><p></p><p> <em>More on the SPM from Census</em> :<br /> <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2021/demo/poverty_measure-how.html">Measuring America: How the US Census Bureau Measures Poverty</a></p><p> <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2022/comm/supplemental-poverty-measure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM)</a></p><p> <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/2021/demo/poverty_measure-how.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How the Census Bureau Measures Poverty</a></p><p> <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty/data/tables/cps.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPS Poverty Data Tables</a></p><p> <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2022/demo/p60-277.html">Poverty in the United States: 2021</a></p><p> <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2014/demo/poverty_measure-history.html">Poverty Measurement Timeline</a></p><p> <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2022/comm/well-being.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Measuring the Nation&#39;s Social and Economic Well-Being</a></p><p> <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/supplemental-poverty-measure/library/visualizations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supplemental Poverty Measure Visualizations</a></p><p></p><p></p><p><span id="more-316810"></span></p><p></p><p> <strong>The Dumbest Video on YouTube</strong> </p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube 视频播放器" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vfiv8uOBZRs" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p><p></p><p> The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ritholtz.com/2023/07/gramm-strikes-again/">America&#39;s Enormous Math Mistake&#39;s Mistake</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://ritholtz.com">The Big Picture</a> .</p> ]]>;</content:encoded></item><item><title> 10 Friday AM Reads</title><link/> https://ritholtz.com/2023/07/10-friday-am-reads-416/<dc:creator><![CDATA[Barry Ritholtz]]></dc:creator><pubDate> Fri, 21 Jul 2023 10:30:20 +0000</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Links]]></category><guid ispermalink="false"> https://ritholtz.com/?p=316757 </guid><description><![CDATA[<p> My end-of-week morning train WFH reads: • Inflation undershoot?

Narrative shifts again</strong> . But as impressive US disinflation sweeps through 2023, without a cratering of employment or the wider economy so far, the narrative is shifting again – and encouraging hopes that bruising central bank tightening may be short-lived too. With a &#39;soft landing&#39; now majority thinking again, phrases like &#39;immaculate disinflation&#39; abound and raise questions about whether underlying price dynamics have changed very much after all – even if geopolitical and supply chain maps are redrawn. ( <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/inflation-undershoot-narrative-shifts-again-2023-07-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a> )</p><p> • <strong>This Statistic Could Be Distorting How We Think About Inflation</strong> : The apparent causal link between unit labor costs and inflation is far weaker once you understand how the statistical sausage is made. It&#39;s honest but crude. One of the two inputs into the calculation is inflation itself. So if inflation rises and nothing else changes, the unit labor cost will go up. By definition ( <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/17/opinion/inflation-unit-labor-cost.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times</a> ) <em>see also</em> <strong>Unit Labor Costs are Literally Constructed Using Prices</strong> : Some big-name economists have also unfortunately similarly cited high unit labor costs as a contributor to inflation in the US, arguing that growth in hourly compensation is too high relative to the growth in labor productivity in order to see inflation return to low levels. However, when one takes a closer look at how this statistic is constructed, one finds that “unit labor costs” are simply the product of the labor share and a price index. The notion that this “explains” inflation is therefore a near-tautology; multiplying the CPI by a relatively stable measure—my average resting heart rate, for example—would perform similarly.

I am not a market prognosticator for a simple reason. I am just not good at it, and the first six months of 2023 illustrate why market timing is often the impossible dream, something that every investor aspires to be successful at, but very few succeed on a consistent basis. At the start of the year, the consensus of market experts was that this would be a difficult year for markets, given the macro worries about inflation and an impending recession, and adding in the fear of the Fed raising rates to this mix made bullishness a rare commodity on Wall Street. Markets, as is their wont, live to surprise, and the first six months of 2023 has wrong-footed the experts (again).
